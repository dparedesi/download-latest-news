All rights reserved Former New York Knicks John Starks, center, joined by other Knicks Alumni, gavels trading closed at the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, Jan. 16, 2026. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) BANGKOK – Stocks edged a bit lower on Wall Street Friday as the first week of corporate earnings season ended with markets trading near record levels. The wobbly day for stocks closed out a week of similar movements for major indexes amid profit reports from banks and updates on inflation. Recommended Videos The S&P 500 fell 4.46 points, or 0.1%, to 6,940.01. It is sitting just below its record, which was set on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 83.11 points, or 0.2%, to 49,359.33. The Nasdaq composite fell 14.63 points, or 0.1%, to 23,515.39. Each index notched weekly losses. Smaller company stocks fared better. The Russell 2000 eked out a 0.1%, while also notching a 2% gain for the week. Technology stocks were the strongest forces behind the market's moves throughout most of the day. Several big technology stocks made strong gains and helped offset losses elsewhere. Broadcom rose 2.5% and Micron Technology rose 7.8%. The semiconductor companies are among several Big Tech companies with outsized valuations that often push the market higher or lower. A handful of regional U.S. banks reported their earnings following mixed reports from their larger peers. Pittsburgh’s PNC jumped 3.8% after it beat Wall Street’s fourth-quarter targets, but Regions Financial fell 2.6% after reporting results that missed forecasts. Outside of the banking sector, transport company J.B. Hunt Transport Services fell 1% after reporting mixed quarterly financial results. The latest round of earnings updates from companies could help give Wall Street a better sense of how consumers are spending their money and how businesses are operating amid economic concerns brought on by inflation and tariffs. Results from the technology sector are being scrutinized by investors trying to figure out whether the high stock prices fueled by the craze around artificial intelligence are justified. “Despite the strong start to 2026, we would not be surprised if markets experience volatility in the coming weeks as fourth quarter earnings progress and the threat of escalating geopolitical tensions remains,” wrote Doug Beath, global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, in a note to investors. Wall Street will have a broader mix of earnings to review next week, coming from airlines, industrial companies, and technology companies. United Airlines, 3M, and Intel are all scheduled to release their quarterly earnings results next week. Crude oil prices rose after dropping sharply on Thursday. The price of U.S. crude oil rose 0.4% to $59.44 and the price of Brent crude, the international standard, rose 0.6% to $64.13. Oil prices have been volatile amid widespread protests in Iran against that country’s leadership and President Donald Trump's warnings that the U.S. “will come to their rescue.” Gold prices, which have also been volatile this week, fell. Prices for the precious metal, often viewed as a safe haven amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty, fell 0.6%, but are still up more than 5% so far in January. Treasury yields moved higher in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.23% from 4.17% late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do, rose to 3.60% from 3.57% late Thursday. The Fed's next policy meeting on interest rates is in two weeks, and Wall Street is betting that it will maintain its current benchmark interest rate. The central bank is trying to balance a slowing jobs market with stubbornly high inflation. Updates on inflation this week showed that prices remain above the Fed's 2% goal. The U.S. central bank will get one more update on inflation next week when the government releases the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE. It is the Fed's preferred measure for inflation. European markets fell, and markets in Asia were mixed. Taiwan's benchmark index rose 1.9% after its government signed a trade deal with the U.S. China, which claims the self-governed island as its own territory, protested the agreement. The deal with Taiwan comes amid an ongoing trade war between the U.S. and much of the world. Uncertainty over tariffs have raised concerns about inflation and economic damage because of higher costs for businesses and consumers. Canada is the latest to shift its partnerships because of the uncertainty. It has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products as part of a break with the U.S. Tesla fell 0.2% and Rivian fell 2.3%.

Title: State Street rolls out new crypto tokenization tools
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/state-street-rolls-out-tokenization-platform
Time Published: 2026-01-16T06:04:36Z

State Street said its new crypto platform would help clients build tokenized money market funds, exchange-traded funds, and products such as tokenized deposits and stablecoins. Cointelegraph in your social feed Multinational banking giant State Street has launched an institutional digital asset platform, aimed at helping businesses navigate the sector and launch a range of crypto products. State Street said on Thursday its platform aims to bridge traditional assets to crypto via tokenization and will support the creation of tokenized money market funds, exchange-traded funds, as well as products such as tokenized deposits and stablecoins. The platform will provide institutions with tokenization services, digital asset custody and access to a range of digital assets. “By pairing blockchain connectivity with robust controls and global servicing expertise, we’re enabling institutions to confidently embrace tokenization as part of their core strategy,” said Joerg Ambrosius, State Street’s president of investment services. Like other bank-led tokenization initiatives, the platform is initially targeted at institutional clients and remains subject to jurisdictional regulatory approvals Tokenization has become a key focus for traditional finance companies as they push to experiment with blockchain, which proponents say can improve liquidity. Related: BNY launches tokenized deposits amid TradFi rush into blockchain and crypto Crypto banking group Sygnum has tipped tokenization to hit the mainstream in 2026 on the back of clear regulations rolling out in the US. State Street has $5.4 trillion worth of assets under management. The firm has been dipping its toes into the digital asset space for the past couple of years, with momentum growing significantly in 2025. In December, the firm teamed up with Galaxy Asset Management and Ondo Finance for a tokenized fund on Solana. The aim of the fund is to push cash sweep balance on blockchains to enable a 24/7 source of liquidity. Other finance managers, such as Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and JPMorgan, have also launched tokenized money-market funds, with many more traditional firms, including BlackRock, having also launched crypto-tied ETFs.

Title: BlackRock strengthens Bitcoin position after scooping up 6.6K BTC – Details
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/blackrock-strengthens-bitcoin-position-after-scooping-up-6-6k-btc-details/
Time Published: 2026-01-16T06:00:01Z

BlackRock’s ETF activity suggests demand is building even when the market looks quiet. BlackRock has made a major move in crypto, but not the kind most headlines suggest. When BlackRock’s IBIT ETF records a large single-day Bitcoin [BTC] purchase, many frame it as a bold corporate bet. However, in reality, BlackRock isn’t speculating with its own balance sheet. Instead, it is acting as an intermediary, pulling Bitcoin off the open market on behalf of pension funds, asset managers, and long-term institutional investors. In mid-January 2026, investor demand surged sharply. To meet that demand, BlackRock purchased nearly 6647 Bitcoin in one session. This steady accumulation has pushed BlackRock’s total Bitcoin holdings to roughly 781,000 BTC – Close to 4% of all Bitcoin currently in circulation. At this scale, BlackRock now ranks among the largest long-term holders in the world. Thus, as custodians move more of this Bitcoin into secure, offline storage, those coins have effectively exited the liquid market. Hence, fewer coins now remain available for active trading. This move is not just with Bitcoin, but also with Ethereum though. BlackRock recently added tens of thousands of Ethereum [ETH], while other large investors locked up Ethereum through staking. Staked ETH cannot move easily, further reducing supply on exchanges. Together, ETF accumulation and staking continue to tighten available supply and dampen short-term selling pressure. Despite this aggressive absorption, however, prices have not exploded upwards. In fact, at the time of writing, the altcoin was valued at close to $3,335 pn the price charts. Still, these price levels are much better than ones below $90,000 – Levels seen by BTC back in Q4 2025. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT and ETHA recorded inflows worth $648.4 million and $81.6 million, respectively. The latest surge came on the heels of another major accumulation spree by BlackRock. Over a short window, the firm quietly pulled close to $1 billion worth of cryptos off the open market. It moved 9,619 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $878 million, along with 46,851 Ethereum worth about $149 million, directly into custodial storage. All these moves, together, show that the crypto markets no longer revolve around short-term hype. Therefore, as 2026 unfolds, the real question isn’t whether institutions are involved. It’s whether enough liquid Bitcoin and Ethereum will remain on exchanges to meet their growing demand.

Title: NZ sharemarket up 1.3% for the year - Market close

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Manufacturing activity in New Zealand is now the highest in four years, according to the BNZ-BusinessNZ Performance of Manufacturing Index. Photo / Dean Purcell Ebos Group and Fletcher Building both had strong bounces as the New Zealand sharemarket closed the week with a solid gain of nearly 0.5%. The S&P/NZX 50 Index climbed steadily all day and closed at 13,718.1, up 58.31 points or 0.43% – with a mid-afternoon intraday high of 13,749.47. The index has risen 1.3% year to date in 2026. There were 94 gainers and 40 decliners on the main board with 43.9 million shares worth $171.9 million changing hands. ‘Weakness and wariness’ Manufacturing activity in New Zealand is now the highest in four years, according to the BNZ-BusinessNZ Performance of Manufacturing Index (PMI). The index reached 56.1 in December, up from 51.4 in November – its best reading since December 2021 and well above the long-term survey of 52.5. Shane Solly, portfolio manager with Harbour Asset Management, said the better-than-expected PMI update is another sign the economy is recovering, though some are seeing weakness in the number of business closures. He said the increased activity is benefiting companies like Fletcher Building and Mainfreight. Fletcher was still cautious in its trading update, but there is a better tone towards economic activity. Fletcher rose 12c or 3.18% to $3.89, and Mainfreight was up 49c to $68.99. Ebos Group increased 28c to $26.46. Solly said, “We’ve seen very heavy selling in Ebos from offshore, but we might be getting through to the other side of it.” Infratil, which traded at $12.67 in early November, was up 7c to $11.26 on the back of a recovery in overseas tech stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, a major supplier to the industry, reported stronger quarterly profit than analysts expected and said it could boost its equipment investment to US$56 billion ($97.2b) to take advantage of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Nvidia was up 2.1% to US$186.99. Solly said the continued demand for chips is positive for datacentres, and this benefits Infratil. There had been quite a debate about the capital expenditure for AI. He said there was also a bounce-back in New Zealand tech stocks. “We’ve been seeing some weakness and wariness in that sector over the use of vibe coding, one of the AI tools, and replacing existing software applications.” Other stocks Vista Group increased 5c or 2.27% to $2.25; Gentrack was up 19c or 2.3% to $8.46; Blackpearl Group added 5c or 5.26% to $1; and Eroad gained 3c or 2.36% to $1.30. Fintech stock PaySauce, down 0.005c or 1.79% to 27.5c, earlier reported record annual recurring revenue of $9.4m for the December quarter, including an 11% increase in year-on-year processing fees to $1.8m. This offset a 25% reduction in interest revenue. The dual-listed banking groups had a good day, with Westpac rising $1.24, or 2.79%, to $45.73, and ANZ up 42c to $43.41. The financial institutions had a better day in the United States. BlackRock increased by 5.93% to US$1156.65, and Goldman Sachs rose 4.63% to US$975.86 after reporting improved quarterly profits. Back home, Santana Minerals increased 4c or 3.27% to $1.26, and 2 Cheap Cars was up 2c or 3.17% to 65c after its positive quarterly update. Heavily traded Ryman Healthcare was down 8c or 2.69% to $2.89, with 4.33 million shares worth $12.6m changing hands a day after reporting steady quarterly sales. Fellow retirement village stock Summerset, which provides an update next week, gained 22c or 1.81% to $12.40. There was heavy trading in energy stocks on the quarterly rebalancing of the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. Contact was up 10c to $9.36 on trade worth $27.11m; Meridian gained 7c to $5.59; and Mercury also added 3c to $6.48 on trade worth $11.7m. Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The S&P/NZX 50 Index closed at 13,659.79, down 97.92 points or 0.71%.

Friday, 16 Jan 2026 NEW YORK, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended higher on Thursday, snapping a two-day losing streak as a surge in semiconductor and financial shares bolstered investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 percent to 49,442.44. The S&P 500 added 0.26 percent to 6,944.47. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 0.25 percent to 23,530.02. Seven of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with utilities and industrials leading the gainers by going up 1.04 percent and 0.93 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, energy and health led the laggards by losing 0.91 percent and 0.58 percent, respectively. The rally was primarily spearheaded by the technology sector following a record-breaking quarterly report from TSMC, which announced plans to increase its 2026 capital expenditure to between 52 billion and 56 billion U.S. dollars, a move seen as a strong vote of confidence in the sustained global demand for AI infrastructure. TSMC shares climbed 4.44 percent. The optimism spread across the semiconductor industry with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF rising 2.08 percent, while industry leaders Nvidia and Micron Technology gained 2.13 percent and 0.98 percent, respectively. The financial sector also provided significant upward momentum as investors processed the latest wave of fourth-quarter earnings. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both reported surging profits, driven by a year-end resurgence in global dealmaking. Meanwhile, asset management giant BlackRock saw its shares jump 5.93 percent after ending 2025 with a record 14 trillion dollars in assets under management and exceeding quarterly earnings estimates. On the economic front, data from the U.S. Department of Labor indicated continued resilience in the U.S. job market. Initial requests for unemployment benefits for the week ending Jan. 10 fell to 198,000, significantly lower than the 215,000 claims projected by economists. Further supporting the market was a notable decline in energy costs. Global oil prices retreated, with both Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate futures sliding more than 4 percent during the session. Thank you for your report!

Title: Pundit Warns XRP Is On The Verge Of Being Sold Out, What’s Going On?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/pundit-warns-xrp-sold-out/
Time Published: 2026-01-15T22:00:31Z

Is XRP running out? A recent debate between market analyst Jake Claver and other industry commentators has thrust the digital asset back into the spotlight, predicting a looming supply crunch. As structural limits meet rising demand, experts warn of a “sell-out” scenario that could fundamentally redefine the token’s market dynamics. The core of the “sell-out” claim lies in the technical architecture of the XRP Ledger’s escrow system. In a post on January 14, 2026, Claver explained that Ripple’s monthly supply releases are hard-coded into the protocol, meaning the company is unable to inject extra tokens into the market during a liquidity crisis. While this mechanism was designed to provide predictability and limit manipulation, it creates a double-edged outcome. In a high-demand environment, supply becomes effectively inelastic. This structure is more relevant when viewed against current supply figures. XRP has a hard maximum of 100 billion tokens. About 60.7 billion XRP are already in circulation, leaving roughly 39.3 billion outside active market supply. At a price near $2.10, circulating supply translate to a market capitalization above $127 billion, while the fully diluted valuation sits close to $210 billion. These figures show that nearly 40% of XRP’s total supply is effectively off the table and cannot be accessed to meet sudden demand. If a large institution attempted to buy $10 billion worth of XRP, Ripple could not unlock escrow early to provide liquidity because the ledger prohibits releases beyond the 1-billion-token monthly cap. Any abrupt surge in buying pressure therefore, cannot be met with new supply. This rigidity materially increases the risk of a severe supply shock, with price acting as the sole pressure valve under this structural bottleneck. The conversation escalated when a user known as RemiRelief responded to Claver, sounding an alarm that XRP is “on the verge of being sold out completely.” RemiRelief argued that there is very little liquid supply left on exchanges and predicted a “mind-boggling” scenario if investors began moving their holdings into private storage. The post specifically pointed to the potential entry of BlackRock as a catalyst that would drain the remaining “low-hanging fruit” from the market. The current performance of XRP ETFs supports this “constant buying” narrative. Since early 2026, XRP ETFs have seen massive, consistent net inflows—reaching over $1.37 billion in a single week. Every dollar flowing into an ETF represents XRP being sucked out of the public market and locked into institutional vaults. RemiRelief’s claim stems from this collision: institutional giants are buying up tokens at a record pace, while the “escrow trap” Claver described prevents any new supply from entering the market to balance it out. Beyond signalling a looming sellout, this debate emphasizes that the window for acquiring XRP at “low” prices is closing fast. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Why Wall Street refuses to sell Bitcoin – and actually bought way more – even while losing 25% of its value

Wall Street's increased Bitcoin ETF shares in Q4 2025 highlight strategic buying during price slides, hinting at a more complex market play. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Institutional investment managers increased their allocations to US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during the fourth quarter of 2025, despite the asset suffering a sharp price correction that shaved nearly a quarter off its market value. The divergence between rising share counts and falling asset values presents a complex picture of institutional behavior during a period of extreme volatility. According to CryptoSlate's data, Bitcoin's price began the last three months of last year on a strong footing, reaching a new all-time high of more than $126,000 in October. However, that rally proved unsustainable and gave way to a tumultuous period sparked by a massive $20 billion deleveraging event. By the time the year concluded, Bitcoin was trading under $90,000. Massive sell-off causes over $7 billion in liquidations, exposing crypto's structural weaknesses during volatile trading. Despite this turbulent backdrop, early regulatory filings suggest that professional money managers viewed the pullback as a buying opportunity rather than a reason to exit the market. As of press time, BTC has since returned to an upward momentum this year and is eyeing a break above $100,000. An early analysis of 13F filings compiled by Bitcoin analyst Sani revealed that 121 institutions reported a net increase of 892,610 shares across various US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2025. Paradoxically, while the physical number of shares held by these firms increased, the aggregate dollar value of those holdings fell by approximately $19.2 million. To understand this dynamic, one must look at the raw totals reported by these firms. In the third quarter of 2025, the tracked institutions held a collective 5,252,364 shares valued at roughly $317.8 million. By the end of the fourth quarter, their holdings had swelled to 6,144,974 shares, yet the market value of that larger pile had shrunk to $298.6 million. This math reveals the extent of the drawdown. Based on these filings, the implied average value per ETF share held by these institutions dropped from approximately $60.50 in Q3 to roughly $48.60 in Q4. That marks a decline of roughly 19.7%. Despite this repricing, the total share count held by these managers rose by about 17%. The drop to $88,500 isn't random noise; historical data confirms that this specific year-end deviation exposes exactly how institutional risk budgets are tightening for 2025. The narrative emerging from the data is clear. These investors continued to buy units even as the mark-to-market value of their holdings evaporated, adding exposure directly into the teeth of a drawdown. For context, Dartmouth College’s $9 billion endowment fund revealed it had acquired around $15 million in shares of BlackRock's IBIT and Grayscale's Ethereum fund, despite the broader market situation. Notably, these positions are new and show how the crypto ETFs continue to attract institutional interest regardless of their performance. Nowhere is this disconnect between capital flows and asset performance more visible than in the books of the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Last year, the fund achieved something incredibly rare in the asset management business as it attracted billions of dollars in fresh inflows while losing money for its clients. IBIT ended 2025 as the sixth-most popular ETF in the United States by net inflows, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. It raised $25.4 billion in fresh cash, beating established giants like the Invesco QQQ Trust and the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). This influx occurred despite IBIT posting a 10% loss. By contrast, gold rallied nearly 65% in 2025, buoyed by central bank purchases and geopolitical anxiety. Industry stakeholders noted that the fund's performance demonstrated the asset managers' conviction in Bitcoin. IBIT now generates more revenue for BlackRock than funds that have been operating for decades. Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, pointed out that 99% of advisors who owned crypto in 2025 plan to increase or maintain their exposure this year. People have wondered what advisors would do if crypto hit a patch of volatility. We have our answer: They're planning to buy more. However, there is an interesting caveat to the “institutional adoption” narrative. Spot Bitcoin ETFs exist at the crossroads of long-term investment and short-term arbitrage. A rising share count in a 13F filing looks like bullish conviction, but it can often mask a market-neutral hedge. On the surface, the adoption story holds water. State Street research from December estimates the US Bitcoin ETF market at $103 billion, with institutions owning nearly a quarter of that float. Their data suggests that 60% of institutional investors prefer the regulatory safety of an ETF wrapper over holding physical coins. However, the “long ETF” positions reported in 13F filings do not tell the whole story. These forms require managers to disclose long positions in US equities but do not require disclosure of short positions. Notably, this effectively hides the other side of the trade. As the CME has noted, hedge funds frequently use spot ETFs to execute basis trades. They buy the ETF (which shows up in the filing) and simultaneously short Bitcoin futures (which does not). This allows them to capture the spread between the spot and futures price without taking any directional risk on Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin's tumultuous year saw regulatory embrace, miner crises, and Wall Street's long-awaited entry into the crypto realm. This distinction is critical for forecasting the market's next move. If the fourth quarter’s accumulation was driven by genuine allocators building “portfolio sleeves,” that capital is likely sticky. However, if it was driven by hedge fund capitalizing on spreads, that capital is mercenary. It could reverse quickly if volatility spikes or if the basis trade becomes less profitable. Regardless of the motive, the result is the same. In a quarter where Bitcoin lost nearly a quarter of its value, Wall Street ended up owning more of it. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Δ The investment management firm and the tech giant joined forces in 2024 to fund data centers behind the AI boom and are now closer to their $30 billion goal, the report said. The partnership also includes Nvidia, xAi and United Arab Emirates-affiliated MGX investment group. The effort “continues to attract significant capital,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told analysts during the call, per the report. The partnership is aiming to pull in $30 billion of private equity capital and then mobilize up to $100 billion in investment potential, including debt financing for infrastructure projects, PYMNTS reported in September 2024. “We are committed to ensuring AI helps advance innovation and drives growth across every sector of the economy,” Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said at the time. “The Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership will help us deliver on this vision, as we bring together financial and industry leaders to build the infrastructure of the future and power it in a sustainable way.” The group made a $40 billion deal in October to acquire Aligned Data Centers from Macquarie Asset Management, which called it the largest data center acquisition in history.

A study from Switzerland-based tech university EPFL found that while frontier model training is still computationally intensive, many operational AI systems can be deployed without requiring centralized hyperscale facilities. Instead, these systems can distribute workloads across existing machines, regional servers or edge environments, cutting back on the reliance on large, centralized clusters. “The research highlights a growing mismatch between AI infrastructure and real-world enterprise use cases,” PYMNTS reported Friday (Jan. 9). “These systems often rely on smaller models, repeated inference and localized data rather than continuous access to massive, centralized models.” Nvidia found that small language models could carry out 70% to 80% of enterprise tasks, leaving the most complex reasoning to large-scale systems, a structure that is becoming the most cost-effective way to operationalize AI.

Title: Bitcoin: Big money buys the uncertainty as BTC defends $96K

Time Published: 2026-01-15T20:00:11Z

Bitcoin’s breakout reflects structural strength as disbelief continues to fuel upside momentum. Bitcoin rebounds near $96k as BlackRock-linked buying tops $646.6M, while Santiment flags a ten-day peak in retail FUD globally. Institutional activity continues to diverge sharply from retail sentiment, creating a constructive backdrop. Whale Insider data confirmed that BlackRock clients accumulated $646.62 million in BTC, signaling conviction from long-term capital. Meanwhile, Santiment’s social metrics showed bearish commentary reaching a ten-day high, despite Bitcoin holding the $96,000–$97,000 zone. This contrast matters because institutions rarely chase momentum. Instead, they accumulate during uncertainty. As retail traders hesitate and question the rebound, large buyers absorb available supply. Pessimism reflects disbelief rather than distribution. Such belief gaps often appear during continuation phases, not market tops, reinforcing the underlying structure. Bitcoin [BTC] has broken out of the highlighted accumulation zone, confirming a transition from the prior mark-down phase into early mark-up. After the sharp selloff that defined the markdown, the price stabilized and consolidated between roughly $85,000 and $95,600, forming a clear accumulation base. Bitcoin has now pushed above the range high and established acceptance above $95,637, which previously acted as resistance and now functions as key support. Pullbacks toward this level continue to attract demand, reinforcing the role flip. Above support, price faces resistance near $105,000, followed by $116,147, both highlighted supply zones. However, the formation of higher lows beneath these levels suggests controlled expansion rather than exhaustion. Momentum confirms the shift, with RSI climbing into the upper 60s, reflecting strengthening upside participation without reaching overheated conditions, a typical trait of early mark-up phases. Source: TradingView Spot Taker CVD over the 90-day window has turned decisively positive, confirming aggressive buyers dominate execution. Rather than waiting passively, participants lift offers, signaling conviction behind the rebound. This shift matters because spot-led moves tend to hold better than leverage-driven spikes. Sustained positive CVD during consolidation reflects accumulation instead of emotional chasing. Additionally, buy-side dominance persists despite rising pessimism, reinforcing intent. Buyers commit capital while sentiment remains negative. Therefore, downside pressure weakens as genuine demand absorbs sell orders. This alignment supports structural continuation, tying price recovery to real flow rather than short-term speculative positioning. Source: CryptoQuant Liquidation data highlighted a leverage reset that favored stability. During the latest pullback, long liquidations reached roughly $17.99 million, while shorts accounted for only $1.47 million. This imbalance showed that long positions absorbed most forced closures. Importantly, Bitcoin held near $96,000 despite this flush, indicating strong spot demand underneath. When longs unwind without cascading selloffs, markets often stabilize rather than collapse. Moreover, leverage resets reduce fragility by clearing crowded positioning. Consequently, downside risk decreases instead of rising. This pattern supports continuation, as fewer overextended longs remain vulnerable to liquidation-driven declines. Source: CoinGlass The Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap showed that the downside liquidity below $95,000 gradually clearing, while heavier clusters remained above the current price. Currently, as Bitcoin consolidates near $96,000, lower liquidation bands lose density, reducing downside pull. This shift matters because price often gravitates toward concentrated liquidity zones. With downside levels increasingly consumed, selling pressure weakens. Meanwhile, untested liquidity above the range continues to build, acting as a potential magnet if momentum strengthens. Therefore, the evolving heatmap structure favors upside exploration rather than renewed breakdowns. Source: CoinGlass To sum up, Bitcoin’s rebound reflects structural strength rather than speculative excess. Institutional accumulation, positive spot CVD, leverage resets, and thinning downside liquidity align with continuation. As long as buyers defend the $95,600 support zone, the broader setup favors expansion over failure, with disbelief-driven momentum still intact.

Title: Mamdani housing official decries 'white middle-class homeowners' for stalling 'renter justice' in resurfaced video

Mamdani has been buried by controversial statements from his housing czar. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani's administration got hit with another blow in the form of a resurfaced video of more extremist comments from its top housing official. Cea Weaver has been previously criticized for her socialist schemes on housing, but the newest video shows her taking aim at "white, middle-class homeowners." 'Unless we can undermine the institution of homeownership ... it's a really difficult organizing situation we find ourselves in.' "I think that United States public policy has done a really, really, really good job of pitting cash-poor homeowners and working-class homeowners and middle-class homeowners against renters, and we need to figure out how to navigate that as organizers," said Weaver in a video shared by the Free Beacon. She went on to say that the real threat to "renter justice" was not institutional investors, but rather smaller-scale investors who own numerous housing units. "It's just this challenging dynamic," she continued in the 2021 interview with Briahna Joy Gray. "White, middle-class homeowners are a huge problem for a renter justice movement. She added, "Unless we can undermine the institution of homeownership and seek to provide stability in other ways, I don't know — it's a really difficult organizing situation we find ourselves in." Mamdani tapped the socialist housing activist to lead his Office to Protect Tenants, leading many to unearth her previous statements espousing statist schemes to erase private ownership of housing. "I think the reality is, is that for centuries we've really treated property as an individualized good and not a collective good," Weaver said in one video interview. "And transitioning to treating it as a collective good and towards a model of shared equity will require that we think about it differently. And it will mean that families, especially white families but some [people of color] families who are homeowners as well, are going to have a different relationship to property than the one that we currently have." In the latest resurfaced video, Weaver went on to say that massive taxation would be necessary to fund expanded social service programs. "We need a national movement to pass universal rent control to limit landlords' ability to endlessly profit on our homes, to give tenants the right to form a tenants' union where they live, and to really block evictions," she added. "But rent control is not enough. People need money. We need to tax billionaires and transform that into cash assistance for renters. And we need to chip away at home ownership, and that means — that means Medicare for All, that means, like, a deep investment in real social service programs." RELATED: 'You have to be completely out of your f***ing mind': Eric Adams rips into Mamdani aide Even some on the left have recoiled at the extremism from Mamdani's administration and the comments from Weaver associating homeownership with white supremacy. "Homeownership is how immigrants, Black, Brown, and working-class New Yorkers built stability and generational wealth despite every obstacle," said former NYC Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, on social media. "You have to be completely out of your f***ing mind to call that 'white supremacy,'" he continued. "That level of thinking only comes from extreme privilege and total detachment from reality."

Title: BlackRock bails on $2b NZ climate fund
URL: http://newsroom.co.nz/2026/01/16/blackrock-bails-on-2b-nz-climate-fund/
Time Published: 2026-01-15T18:32:13Z

Business news in association with The world’s largest asset management firm has quietly abandoned plans for a multibillion-dollar climate fund to help New Zealand reach 100 percent renewable energy, just years after saying the initiative could serve as a global model. However, American multinational BlackRock insists it remains committed to its operations in the country, given its “appeal as a global investment destination”. In August 2023, the then-Labour government trumpeted BlackRock’s involvement in a “first of its kind” climate infrastructure fund, with the company attracting an initial $2 billion of investment for renewable energy projects like battery storage, wind and solar generation, and electric vehicle charging. “This is a game changer for the clean tech sector and another example of the pragmatic and practical steps the Government is taking to accelerate climate action while growing our economy,” then-Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said at the time, highlighting his government’s target of reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. When the plans were first announced, BlackRock co-founder and chief executive Larry Fink (whose company has almost $22 trillion in assets under management worldwide) said the initiative would be the company’s “largest single-country low-carbon transition investment” to date. “It will enable New Zealand companies to access greater pools of capital to build out climate infrastructure across the country’s energy system including in wind power, solar power, battery storage, electric vehicle charging, and natural capital projects.” Praising the then-government’s ambition to build a more resilient energy system and become a global leader in decarbonisation, Fink said the fund could act as a model for cooperation between the private and public sectors “to ensure an orderly, just, and fair energy transition”. But the National-led coalition government rolled back a number of Labour’s climate commitments after taking office at the 2023 election, with Prime Minister Christopher Luxon saying the renewables target had put the country’s energy security at risk and would increase electricity prices while reducing reliability. In May 2024, BusinessDesk reported that BlackRock was yet to make any investments via the fund, although the company said it “firmly believes in the significant potential for deploying climate infrastructure and related enabling technologies … irrespective of changing policy settings”. Start your day informed. Make room for newsroom's top stories. Direct to your inbox daily. But in November last year, the firm asked the Companies Office to deregister the limited partnership connected to the initiative (New Zealand Climate Infrastructure Fund LP) on the grounds it had “ceased to carry on business”. In a written statement sent to Newsroom, a BlackRock spokesperson confirmed the fund was being scrapped, saying: “Following our acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners and in response to client feedback, BlackRock will no longer proceed with a standalone New Zealand Climate Infrastructure Fund. “We continue to offer clients access to a suite of global infrastructure strategies that can invest into New Zealand, supported by our growing local presence.” The company remained committed to supporting New Zealand’s economic growth and infrastructure projects, having doubled its Auckland-based team to six people (including three infrastructure investors) in the last year. “BlackRock currently invests close to NZ$30 billion in New Zealand across public and private markets on behalf of clients, with approximately 75 percent sourced from offshore investors – underscoring the country’s appeal as a global investment destination.” What investments (if any) the firm made via the climate fund remains unclear, with Newsroom’s questions on the matter going unanswered. BlackRock has in recent years ramped up its presence in the New Zealand market, with mixed results. The company placed local solar installation firm SolarZero into liquidation in 2024, two years after acquiring the business, with 160 staff losing their jobs. The American firm copped criticism for its failure to pay out employees’ entitlements, with one former staffer telling Newsroom the case showed the dangers of foreign investment; the ex-staff did eventually receive outstanding pay as part of the liquidation process, although contractors were reportedly left out in the cold. At the time, BlackRock said it had explored several options to keep SolarZero operating but was unable to find a suitable solution, requesting the appointment of a liquidator “to ensure an orderly transition of the business in the interests of related stakeholders, including SolarZero’s customers, employees, creditors, and others”. Luxon’s Government has nonetheless continued to woo BlackRock, inviting the company to take part in last year’s high-profile Infrastructure Investment Summit to the consternation of former SolarZero staff. The Prime Minister had earlier met Fink during a 2024 trip to the United States, saying the pair had discussed “how New Zealand can attract more investment to strengthen our economy at home”. Climate Change and Energy Minister Simon Watts told Newsroom neither he nor officials had been contacted by BlackRock regarding its decision. Asked whether he had any concerns about what the move said about levels of appetite for foreign investment into climate infrastructure, Watts responded: “This is a commercial decision made by BlackRock. I expect no impact.” Newsroom exists because of readers like you. Help us deliver trusted, independent journalism that serves all New Zealanders. Support our work with a donation today.

More by Sam Sachdeva 8 Comments Shame, shame, shame on BlackRock . This tells us everything about their global investment strategies. This is also a clear signal for investment in biodiversity. Renewable energy infrastructure, climate adaptation, and biodiversity restoration all depend on long-term capital, credible frameworks, and policy settings that remain stable well beyond a single electoral cycle. When climate and energy targets are questioned or rolled back, it sends a broader message that natural capital, including biodiversity protection, restoration, and emerging biodiversity markets, is politically fragile. Investors do not separate climate from biodiversity. They assess whether a country is willing to maintain consistent rules, pricing signals, and institutional support over decades. When that confidence weakens, capital reallocates quietly, regardless of how strong the underlying environmental case may be. New Zealand’s ecological value and renewable resource base have not diminished. What has changed is the perceived durability of the policy environment needed to support long-horizon investment. If we want private capital to help deliver environmental outcomes, credibility and consistency matter more than ambition alone. After 12 months of the government gutting our climate and biodiversity goals, Blackrock clearly saw the writing on the wall. This government is not serious about protecting our natural environment and treasures. Heaven, or a progressive government, help us if we continue to let investment firms like this get their hands on core assets in this country. Check out These are the Plunderers – how Private Equity runs and wrecks America on Amazon Books. Or look at the story on You Tube about the fate of 37 Healthscope Hospitals in Australia under the management of Brookfield Asset Management. It’s happening here but barely rates a mention. An Australian accounting firm SBO Financial had this to say about the Healthscope debacle: Private equity walks into a business. Promises “synergies.” Murmurs “operational excellence.” Says they’re here to unlock value. What actually happens? • They lever it up 7x EBITDA. • Sell the real estate. • Attempt to trim costs by “streamlining operations” — a.k.a. cutting corners. Then they completely misread the market, margins tank, and the whole thing collapses under the weight of its own debt. Sound familiar? Of course it does. That’s the story of Healthscope. One of Australia’s largest private hospital networks — treating over 650,000 patients a year — is now in financial freefall. The company went from a $5bn pricetag to bankrupt in only 6 years. So how did Brookfield blow it? In 2019, the Canadian buyout giant dropped $5.7 billion to acquire Healthscope, slapped a debt bomb on it, sold off the hospitals, and cooked the operations. Fast-forward to now: • Revenue barely moved. • Costs soared. • Interest payments exploded. • Patient outcomes worsen • Declared bankruptcy, with sale process being run Or, as the ABC put it: “They’ve trashed the joint and now just dropped the keys and run away.” This government, in particular, sees foreign investment as the answer to our weak economy. Growth, growth, growth the Prime Minister repeats. The health sector is being run down, as is public housing investment. I fear this government is lining up our public services for foreign investors to takeover. It shows that we (NZ) are desperate for money to further our ‘climate support’ plans. This desperation for external financial help – in furthering our plans for clean energy, internal social support and manufacturing – is highlighting serious mis-management at the highest level of management – Government. The coalition has systematically dismantled almost all significant climate policies left to it by the previous Labour government. As Charmaine says above, “If we want private capital to help deliver environmental outcomes, credibility and consistency matter more than ambition alone.” Dealing with climate change requires concrete, long term actions and bipartisan agreement on the importance of adopting the relevant policies. Whether you are a dairy farmer or an IT worker, we are all affected eventually. No wonder Blackrock is pulling out, it’s just not financially worthwhile. Next, insurance companies will be increasing costs on policies covering flood etc to horrendously prohibitive levels or just plain refusing to insure. New Zealand will pay eventually, in some way or another. It staggers me how supposedly ‘conservative’ governments rip into energy-transition projects as ‘greenie rubbish’ when the transition from fossil fuels is currently the world’s most bankable global direction, strongly committed to by China and India and, until Trump, the US. The recent decision to let a dubious seabed mining venture drive out a massive wind farm was an act of serious economic harm by the coalition government, all to please a shrinking cohort of backwards-looking voters who feel it threatens their right to drive cheap, polluting cars on cheap, polluting fuel and farmers who just want to go on doing what they have always done.

Title: Why BlackRock isn't worried about rising defaults as it dives into private credit

The $14 trillion asset manager has become a major player in the private lending space after it acquired HPS at the end of 2024. The firm has been focused on fundraising for private markets, and CEO Larry Fink said Thursday during BlackRock's earnings call that the firm's distribution team was pitching HPS offerings to advisors for wealthy people at wirehouses like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. Private credit has seen explosive growth in recent years, as strategies brought in more than $220 billion in 2025, according to S&P. Still, several high-profile defaults, including auto parts supplier First Brands and auto lender Tricolor, have some wondering if there are more hidden risks in the credit market. "When you see one cockroach, there's probably more," JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon colorfully put it in October. BlackRock CFO Martin Small said the manager deployed $25 billion into private-market investments in 2025, including in private lending, and sees "generally stable credit conditions."

Defaults are rising, he said, but that is to be expected after a period of historically low defaults, thanks to low interest rates. "Returning to normal defaults is something we expect," he said, adding that "context is critical" when looking at headlines about bankruptcies. Fitch Ratings said that private credit default rates for the past 12 months were 5.7% at the end of November, up from 5.2% a month prior. In November, Fitch recorded 13 default events, more than double the monthly average of 5.5. "It's not that there's nothing to see here," he said, but this is an "expected catch-up." BlackRock's portfolios are further insulated, he said, because they focus on lending to companies with sufficient earnings to repay loans. In the firm's closed-end investment company, HLEND, for example, loans have been made to companies with average annual earnings of $250 million. Small companies bringing in less than $50 million in annual earnings that took out loans when they were at their peak valuation "are the credits we'd expect to struggle," Small said. BlackRock ended the year with more than $145 billion in private credit assets, and "we see the structural pipeline of private credit fundraising and deployment as intact," Small said. Jump to

Title: BlackRock Q4 Earnings Call Highlights

BlackRock NYSE: BLK executives used the firm’s fourth-quarter 2025 earnings call to highlight what Chief Financial Officer Martin Small described as “one of the strongest years in our history,” pointing to record net inflows, accelerating organic base fee growth, and continued expansion in technology services as the company enters 2026 with a fully integrated platform that now includes GIP, Preqin, and HPS. Get BlackRock alerts:Sign UpFinancial performance and capital return Small said clients awarded BlackRock nearly $700 billion in net new assets in 2025, alongside 9% organic base fee growth and 16% technology annual contract value (ACV) expansion. For the full year, BlackRock reported as-adjusted revenue of $24 billion, up 19% year over year, operating income of $9.6 billion, up 18%, and earnings per share of $48.09, up 10%. Why Bitcoin ETFs Like IBIT May Be Set to Surge in 2026In the fourth quarter, revenue was $7 billion, up 23% year over year, which Small attributed to the acquisitions of HPS and Preqin, organic base fee growth, and the impact of market moves on average assets under management (AUM). Fourth-quarter operating income was $2.8 billion, up 22%, while EPS rose 10% to $13.16. Small noted that quarterly EPS also reflected a lower tax rate, lower non-operating income, and a higher share count tied to the close of the HPS transaction on July 1. Non-operating results included $106 million of net investment losses, primarily from a non-cash mark-to-market loss related to BlackRock’s minority investment in Circle. Small said the company contributed a portion of its Circle stake to an existing donor-advised fund in mid-December, and that it still holds roughly 1.1 million shares of Circle common stock that will continue to be marked through investment income. The as-adjusted tax rate was about 20% in the quarter due to discrete items, and Small said the company currently estimates 25% as a “reasonable projected tax run rate” for 2026. Why Billions Are Flowing into IBIT, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETFBlackRock also emphasized shareholder returns. Small said the board approved a 10% increase to the first-quarter 2026 dividend per share and authorized repurchase of an additional 7 million shares. The company is targeting $1.8 billion of share repurchases during 2026, subject to market and other conditions. Base fees, technology growth, and margins Fourth-quarter base fees and securities lending revenue totaled $5.3 billion, up 19% year over year, driven by market beta on average AUM, organic base fee growth, and approximately $230 million in base fees from HPS. Performance fees were $754 million in the quarter, up from a year ago, and included $158 million from HPS. Technology services and subscription revenue grew 24% year over year in both the quarter and full year, reflecting client onboarding, expansions with existing clients, and the Preqin transaction. Small said Preqin added approximately $65 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and $213 million for the full year. ACV increased 31% year over year, including Preqin, and grew 16% organically. Expense growth was also discussed. Total expense rose 19% in 2025, driven primarily by higher compensation, sales and account expense, and G&A. Employee compensation and benefits increased 20% for the year, reflecting higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees and higher operating income, as well as the onboarding of employees from GIP, Preqin, and HPS. G&A increased 15% due largely to M&A transactions and higher technology investment spend. Fourth-quarter as-adjusted operating margin was 45%, down 50 basis points year over year, and the full-year margin was 44.1%, down 40 basis points. Small said both periods reflected the impact of performance fees and related compensation. Excluding performance fees and related compensation, he said the fourth-quarter adjusted margin would have been 45.5%, up 30 basis points year over year, and the full-year margin would have been 44.9%, up 60 basis points versus 2024. On the Q&A portion of the call, management reiterated its margin framework. Small said BlackRock continues to target a “45% or greater adjusted operating margin profile,” while describing upward momentum in margins on recurring fee-related earnings. He also said that after annualizing the impact of HPS and Preqin, management expects a mid-single-digit percentage increase in G&A and expects headcount to be “broadly flat” in 2026. Record flows led by iShares and diversified channels Small reported total net inflows of $698 billion in 2025, with iShares setting a record at $527 billion. He said iShares’ flows represented 12% organic asset growth and 13% organic base fee growth, with diversified demand across core equity and premium categories such as fixed income, active, and digital assets exchange-traded products (ETPs). Fourth-quarter iShares net inflows were $181 billion. Retail net inflows were $107 billion, which Small said was led by the onboarding of an $80 billion separately managed account (SMA) assignment from Citi Wealth in the fourth quarter. He also noted record inflows at Aperio, net inflows in active fixed income, and $12 billion of alternatives inflows during 2025. Institutional active net inflows totaled $54 billion in 2025, reflecting multiple outsourcing mandates, the above-target close of GIP V, and deployment in private credit. Institutional index saw net outflows of $119 billion, which Small attributed mainly to redemptions from low-fee index equity strategies. In private markets, Small said the platform delivered $40 billion of net inflows for the year, led by private credit and infrastructure. BlackRock also reiterated its fundraising ambition, targeting $400 billion in gross private markets fundraising through 2030. BlackRock Cash Management saw $74 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and $131 billion in 2025, driven by U.S. government, international prime, and Circle reserve funds. Strategic priorities: private markets, wealth, insurance, and retirement Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said BlackRock entered 2026 with “accelerating momentum” and highlighted the company’s record quarterly and annual net inflows, including $342 billion in the fourth quarter. He said the firm’s pipeline has broadened across public and private markets, technology and data, and client channels. Fink and Small repeatedly emphasized the “whole portfolio” approach and pointed to structural growth areas, including private markets to insurance, private markets to wealth, digital assets, and active ETFs. Small said BlackRock believes these initiatives can each be “$500 million revenue generators in the next five years.” In insurance, Small said BlackRock manages $700 billion in AUM as the largest general account manager for insurers, across more than 450 relationships. He added that HPS manages more than $60 billion of credit assets for more than 125 insurance companies. Management said it is engaged in roughly 20 late-stage conversations to help insurers build more diversified portfolios across public and private markets, and Small said the company hopes to see deployments “pull through the second half of 2026.” In retirement, Fink said the company expects to launch its first LifePath target-date fund with private markets “later this year,” and argued that plan sponsors will need standardized benchmarking and performance data—a role he said Preqin can support. Key Q&A themes: cash, Asia, Preqin, and private credit conditions Asked about the net flow pipeline and the outlook for money market funds in a Fed-cutting environment, Small said BlackRock expects money market yields to fall and sees opportunities for investors to “lock in bond yields” in intermediate-term bonds. Fink added that cash levels may remain elevated as global capital markets grow and suggested tokenization could contribute to continued cash usage, including through tokenized money market funds. On Asia, Fink highlighted faster capital markets growth in the region, cited changes in Japan driven by NISA accounts, and reiterated confidence in the Jio BlackRock partnership in India, which he said is positioned to benefit from what he characterized as the early stages of capital markets growth there. On Preqin, Small said integration has been “terrific” and laid out priorities that include expanding distribution of data, building models and benchmarking tools for private markets, scaling the “data factory,” and pursuing the longer-term opportunity to help build private market indexing. He said BlackRock is working on investable indices that it hopes to bring to market “in the next few years.” On private credit, Small said BlackRock saw $7 billion of private credit net inflows in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by deployment activity. He said the company generally sees stable credit conditions across the main HPS strategies and characterized some negative headlines as highlighting “isolated stress points.” Small added that default rates are rising but remain within historical ranges, and said HPS has focused on lending to larger companies, noting the weighted average EBITDA in the HLEND portfolio is about $250 million. He also cited $1.1 billion of gross subscriptions into HLEND in the fourth quarter and said redemptions were 4.1%, which he described as higher than recent quarters but in line with the broader industry. In closing remarks, Fink said the company’s 2025 results “validate the power” of BlackRock’s integrated platform and that the firm enters 2026 with “differentiated momentum” and opportunities to deliver for clients and shareholders.About BlackRock NYSE: BLKBlackRock, Inc is a global investment management firm that provides a broad range of products and services to institutional, intermediary and individual investors.

He also said that after annualizing the impact of HPS and Preqin, management expects a mid-single-digit percentage increase in G&A and expects headcount to be “broadly flat” in 2026. Record flows led by iShares and diversified channels Small reported total net inflows of $698 billion in 2025, with iShares setting a record at $527 billion. He said iShares’ flows represented 12% organic asset growth and 13% organic base fee growth, with diversified demand across core equity and premium categories such as fixed income, active, and digital assets exchange-traded products (ETPs). Fourth-quarter iShares net inflows were $181 billion. Retail net inflows were $107 billion, which Small said was led by the onboarding of an $80 billion separately managed account (SMA) assignment from Citi Wealth in the fourth quarter. He also noted record inflows at Aperio, net inflows in active fixed income, and $12 billion of alternatives inflows during 2025. Institutional active net inflows totaled $54 billion in 2025, reflecting multiple outsourcing mandates, the above-target close of GIP V, and deployment in private credit. Institutional index saw net outflows of $119 billion, which Small attributed mainly to redemptions from low-fee index equity strategies. In private markets, Small said the platform delivered $40 billion of net inflows for the year, led by private credit and infrastructure. BlackRock also reiterated its fundraising ambition, targeting $400 billion in gross private markets fundraising through 2030. BlackRock Cash Management saw $74 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and $131 billion in 2025, driven by U.S. government, international prime, and Circle reserve funds. Strategic priorities: private markets, wealth, insurance, and retirement Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said BlackRock entered 2026 with “accelerating momentum” and highlighted the company’s record quarterly and annual net inflows, including $342 billion in the fourth quarter. He said the firm’s pipeline has broadened across public and private markets, technology and data, and client channels. Fink and Small repeatedly emphasized the “whole portfolio” approach and pointed to structural growth areas, including private markets to insurance, private markets to wealth, digital assets, and active ETFs. Small said BlackRock believes these initiatives can each be “$500 million revenue generators in the next five years.” In insurance, Small said BlackRock manages $700 billion in AUM as the largest general account manager for insurers, across more than 450 relationships. He added that HPS manages more than $60 billion of credit assets for more than 125 insurance companies. Management said it is engaged in roughly 20 late-stage conversations to help insurers build more diversified portfolios across public and private markets, and Small said the company hopes to see deployments “pull through the second half of 2026.” In retirement, Fink said the company expects to launch its first LifePath target-date fund with private markets “later this year,” and argued that plan sponsors will need standardized benchmarking and performance data—a role he said Preqin can support. Key Q&A themes: cash, Asia, Preqin, and private credit conditions Asked about the net flow pipeline and the outlook for money market funds in a Fed-cutting environment, Small said BlackRock expects money market yields to fall and sees opportunities for investors to “lock in bond yields” in intermediate-term bonds. Fink added that cash levels may remain elevated as global capital markets grow and suggested tokenization could contribute to continued cash usage, including through tokenized money market funds. On Asia, Fink highlighted faster capital markets growth in the region, cited changes in Japan driven by NISA accounts, and reiterated confidence in the Jio BlackRock partnership in India, which he said is positioned to benefit from what he characterized as the early stages of capital markets growth there. On Preqin, Small said integration has been “terrific” and laid out priorities that include expanding distribution of data, building models and benchmarking tools for private markets, scaling the “data factory,” and pursuing the longer-term opportunity to help build private market indexing. He said BlackRock is working on investable indices that it hopes to bring to market “in the next few years.” On private credit, Small said BlackRock saw $7 billion of private credit net inflows in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by deployment activity. He said the company generally sees stable credit conditions across the main HPS strategies and characterized some negative headlines as highlighting “isolated stress points.” Small added that default rates are rising but remain within historical ranges, and said HPS has focused on lending to larger companies, noting the weighted average EBITDA in the HLEND portfolio is about $250 million. He also cited $1.1 billion of gross subscriptions into HLEND in the fourth quarter and said redemptions were 4.1%, which he described as higher than recent quarters but in line with the broader industry. In closing remarks, Fink said the company’s 2025 results “validate the power” of BlackRock’s integrated platform and that the firm enters 2026 with “differentiated momentum” and opportunities to deliver for clients and shareholders.About BlackRock NYSE: BLKBlackRock, Inc is a global investment management firm that provides a broad range of products and services to institutional, intermediary and individual investors.

Get This Free Report Fourth-quarter base fees and securities lending revenue totaled $5.3 billion, up 19% year over year, driven by market beta on average AUM, organic base fee growth, and approximately $230 million in base fees from HPS. Performance fees were $754 million in the quarter, up from a year ago, and included $158 million from HPS. Technology services and subscription revenue grew 24% year over year in both the quarter and full year, reflecting client onboarding, expansions with existing clients, and the Preqin transaction. Small said Preqin added approximately $65 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and $213 million for the full year. ACV increased 31% year over year, including Preqin, and grew 16% organically. Expense growth was also discussed. Total expense rose 19% in 2025, driven primarily by higher compensation, sales and account expense, and G&A. Employee compensation and benefits increased 20% for the year, reflecting higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees and higher operating income, as well as the onboarding of employees from GIP, Preqin, and HPS. G&A increased 15% due largely to M&A transactions and higher technology investment spend. Fourth-quarter as-adjusted operating margin was 45%, down 50 basis points year over year, and the full-year margin was 44.1%, down 40 basis points. Small said both periods reflected the impact of performance fees and related compensation. Excluding performance fees and related compensation, he said the fourth-quarter adjusted margin would have been 45.5%, up 30 basis points year over year, and the full-year margin would have been 44.9%, up 60 basis points versus 2024. On the Q&A portion of the call, management reiterated its margin framework.

He said the company generally sees stable credit conditions across the main HPS strategies and characterized some negative headlines as highlighting “isolated stress points.” Small added that default rates are rising but remain within historical ranges, and said HPS has focused on lending to larger companies, noting the weighted average EBITDA in the HLEND portfolio is about $250 million. He also cited $1.1 billion of gross subscriptions into HLEND in the fourth quarter and said redemptions were 4.1%, which he described as higher than recent quarters but in line with the broader industry. In closing remarks, Fink said the company’s 2025 results “validate the power” of BlackRock’s integrated platform and that the firm enters 2026 with “differentiated momentum” and opportunities to deliver for clients and shareholders.About BlackRock NYSE: BLKBlackRock, Inc is a global investment management firm that provides a broad range of products and services to institutional, intermediary and individual investors.

Title: Trump says he has no plans to fire Jerome Powell — after reported ‘joke’ offer of Fed chair job to Jamie Dimon
URL: https://nypost.com/2026/01/15/business/trump-says-he-has-no-plans-to-fire-powell-after-offering-job-to-jpmorgans-dimon-report/
Time Published: 2026-01-15T15:25:01Z
Full Content:
President Trump said Wednesday he has no plans to fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell despite a criminal investigation into the central banker — after reportedly offering the job to Jamie Dimon months earlier in what the Wall Street titan interpreted as a “joke.” “I don’t have any plan to do that,” Trump told Reuters in an interview Wednesday when asked if he would attempt to remove Powell from his job. Asked whether the DOJ probe gives him the power to fire Powell, Trump said: “Right now, we’re (in) a little bit of a holding pattern with him, and we’re going to determine what to do. But I can’t get into it. It’s too soon. Too early.” Months earlier, Trump had offered Dimon — the CEO of JPMorgan Chase who has supported many of Trump’s policies — the top job during a meeting in the White House, although Dimon ”took the offer as a joke,” according to the Wall Street Journal. “Until an announcement is made by President Trump, any reporting about the Federal Reserve chairman nominations process is pointless speculation,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told The Post. Powell — against whom Trump has long railed for not slashing interest rates fast enough — is currently facing a Justice Department probe over the Fed’s over-budget headquarters renovation. His term as chairman ends in May, though Powell could stay on as a member of the Fed’s board through 2028. He has so far declined to comment on whether he plans to remain on the board. Trump signaled he is looking at either former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh or National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett to replace Powell, adding that he has ruled out Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent “because he wants to stay where he is.” “The two Kevins are very good,” Trump told Reuters. “You have some other good people too, but I’ll be announcing something over the next couple of weeks.” BlackRock exec Rick Rieder and Fed Governor Christopher Waller have also been interviewed for the role. Powell — who has largely refrained from responding to Trump’s personal attacks in the past — spoke out against the federal investigation on Sunday, arguing it is motivated by politics. “No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure,” Powell said in a Sunday statement.

Never miss a story. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” he added. Foreign central bank leaders, former US government officials and current American lawmakers across the political spectrum have blasted the investigation and raised alarms about installing a Fed leader who could potentially threaten the bank’s independence. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a member of the Senate Banking Committee’s slight GOP majority, on Sunday threatened to block any of Trump’s candidates for the Federal Reserve after news of the investigation broke. Dimon also said that “anything that chips away” at the Fed’s independence “is probably not a good idea.” Trump responded on Tuesday that Dimon “probably wants higher rates, maybe he makes more money that way.” “I don’t care,” Trump told Reuters when asked to respond to criticism from lawmakers who will have to vote through his pick to lead the Fed. “They should be loyal. That’s what I say.” As for broader criticism from foreign investors and economists, Trump repeated, “I don’t care.” “A president should have something to say” about decisions out of the Federal Reserve, Trump told Reuters. “I made a lot of money with business, so I think I have a better understanding of it than Too Late Jerome Powell.” The president has ramped up pressure on the Fed to slash interest rates in an attempt to help Americans feel better about the economy — as voters rank affordability a top issue ahead of this year’s midterm elections. The central bank issued three quarter-point cuts last year, lowering the target range to 3.5% to 3.75%. Along with attacks on Powell, whom Trump has called “stupid” and “crooked,” the White House has pushed Fed Governor Lisa Cook to step down, accusing her of mortgage fraud. Cook called those allegations “baseless.” Meanwhile, Stephen Miran — Trump’s economic adviser who stepped into a seat vacated by Adriana Kugler — will see his term on the Fed board expire in January. There are also rumors about potential retirements from the board, such as Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. Federal prosecutors are investigating Powell over his testimony last summer about the central bank’s renovations. Last month, Trump threatened to sue Powell for “gross incompetence,” claiming the cost of the project had run up to $4 billion — roughly $1.5 billion over budget. On its website, the Fed attributed spending increases to unexpected costs of materials and labor, more asbestos than anticipated and toxic contamination in the soil. It added the project will “reduce costs over time by allowing the Board to consolidate most of its operations.” Advertisement

Title: Wall Street steadies as Big Tech bounces back and oil prices ease
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2026/01/15/stock-market-big-tech-bounce/
Time Published: 2026-01-15T15:15:04Z

NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street steadied on Thursday as stocks in the artificial-intelligence industry bounced back following an encouraging report from a Taiwanese chip giant and as oil prices eased sharply. The S&P 500 rose 0.3% and snapped the two-day losing streak it had been on since setting an all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 292 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.2%. Nvidia and other formerly high-flying AI stocks helped lift the market after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a major supplier to the industry, reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. TSMC also said it could boost its investment in equipment to $56 billion this year to take advantage of the AI boom. The frenzy around AI has already sent Nvidia and other superstar stocks to dizzying heights, but that stirred criticism that their prices had shot too high. Nvidia was one of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500 Wednesday after sinking 1.4%. But it rose 2.1% after TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said it’s seeing “continued strong demand” in an encouraging signal for the entire AI industry. TSMC is a crucial player as a major supplier for Nvidia and other giants and as a key customer for ASML and other providers. TSMC’s stock that trades in the United States rose 4.4%, while ASML’s U.S.-listed stock rallied 5.4%. Other chip-related companies helped lead the U.S. stock market, including gains of 7.7% for KLA Corp. and 5.7% for Applied Materials. Also helping to calm financial markets was a sharp easing in oil prices. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude sank 4.6% to $59.19, while Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 4.1% to settle at $63.76 per barrel. Analysts pointed to comments from President Donald Trump, who said Wednesday afternoon that he heard “on good authority” that plans for executions in Iran have stopped amid widespread protests against the country’s leadership. Financial markets took that as a signal that tensions flaring above some of the world’s largest oil deposits could ease, which in turn could lower the possibility of a disruption to the flow of oil. Gold’s price edged back 0.3% in another signal of potentially calming nerves across financial markets. Earnings reporting season for big U.S. companies continued to pick up pace, meanwhile, with several more big financial companies delivering their results for the last three months of 2025. BlackRock, the giant that’s now overseeing more than $14 trillion in investments, rose 5.9% after reporting stronger profit and revenue than analysts expected. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.8% after likewise delivering stronger profit and revenue than expected. Goldman Sachs rose 4.6% after the investment bank topped analysts’ forecasts for profit but fell short on revenue. Outside of earnings, Boston Scientific fell 4% after announcing it‘s buying Penumbra, whose products help remove blood clots, in a cash and stock deal valued at roughly $14.5 billion. Penumbra’s stock jumped 11.8%. In the bond market, Treasury yields rose following encouraging reports on the U.S. economy. One said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in an indication that the pace of layoffs may be slowing. Other reports, meanwhile, said manufacturing was significantly stronger in the mid-Atlantic region and in New York state than economists expected. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.17% from 4.12% just before the release of the reports. It was at 4.15% late Wednesday. The stronger-than-expected data on the U.S. economy helped stocks of smaller companies to lead the market. Their profits can be tied more closely to the strength of the U.S. economy than their bigger, multinational rivals, and the Russell 2000 index rose 0.9%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 17.87 points to 6,944.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 292.81 to 49,442.44, and the Nasdaq composite gained 58.27 to 23,530.02. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.6% for one of the world’s bigger moves. AP Business Writers Chan Ho-him and Matt Ott contributed.

Share this article In its fourth-quarter earnings release on Thursday, BlackRock announced that total assets under management surged to $14 trillion by the end of 2025, spurred by a record $698 billion in annual net inflows. BlackRock’s shares (BLK) rose 5% following the report, per Yahoo Finance. Digital assets AUM stood at around $78 billion at year-end, with $35 billion in full-year ETF inflows for the category, while private markets AUM climbed to $323 billion following the HPS acquisition. “BlackRock enters 2026 with accelerating momentum across our entire platform, coming off the strongest year and quarter of net inflows in our history,” CEO Larry Fink said in a statement. Fink said that the unified BlackRock platform is expanding client activity across public and private markets, technology, and data, with a broadening pipeline and strong fundraising positioning the firm to scale private market initiatives and emerging channels like digital assets and tokenization. “BlackRock is at the forefront of some of the largest new growth channels across the industry – from private markets to wealth and 401(k), to active ETFs, to private markets data, to digital assets and tokenization,” he noted. BlackRock also reported that organic base fees grew 12% annualized in Q4, reflecting strength across iShares ETFs, systematic active equities, private markets, outsourcing, and cash management. The firm posted a 19% increase in full-year revenue, driven by strong markets, 9% organic base fee growth, transaction-related fees, and higher technology services and subscription revenue.

Title: Watch this key level in the bond market for signs of an inflationary shock to stocks, BlackRock chief Larry Fink says

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Larry Fink is eyeing one number in the bond market: 5%. That's the key threshold for the 10-year US Treasury yield that could tell signal when a stock correction could be on the way, the BlackRock CEO said. Speaking to CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Fink said he saw a potential scenario where inflation fears cause the 10-year yield to enter the 5% to 5.5% range. If it surpasses that threshold, it could spark a repricing for stocks, he added. "I have scenarios where it could be pretty bad," Fink said of his outlook for markets. "There's a probability we could see the 10-year over 5%, maybe even 5.5%. That would shock the equity market. That would not be a good scenario," he added, though he said that the scenario wasn't his base-case. The threshold that Fink flags has been tested several times in recent years, usually with a negative reaction in stocks following close behind.

Yields in the US and globally have been volatile but have risen over the years thanks to issues like inflation, tariffs, and rising debt and deficits making investors nervous. The 10-year US Treasury yield hovered around 4.1% this week, up more than 300 basis points over the last five years, rising from record-low levels during the pandemic as the economy entered a new era of elevated inflation. Part of the latest uptick in yields has been a "sell America" sentiment that has settled over markets amid investor fears of waning Fed independence, which could potentially cause a spike in inflation down the road. That trend appears to have accelerated in recent days amid renewed geopolitical pressures and new initiatives from President Donald Trump to lower borrowing costs for Americans, which have only raised fears that inflation could rise down the line. Fink added he saw the Treasury yield curve steepening in virtually every scenario going forward. "There is a scenario where we're going to have much more elevated interest rates because of inflation. And that's going to have a very negative impact on the equity market, and it's going to change — it's going to force a revaluation," he added of stock prices. How bonds will move in the near future depends on the delicate balance between growth and inflation, Fink said. He pointed to the billions in private capital being poured into the AI trade, which could boost economic growth, but also rev up consumer prices. Jump to

What does the world's biggest asset manager that just raised the most capital in a single year in company history do as an encore? Raise more money, of course. BlackRock now runs $14 trillion, thanks to nearly $700 billion in net cash that flowed into its investment products last year, according to financial results released Thursday. The manager's iShares ETF franchise alone brought in $181 billion in net new money in the fourth quarter of 2025, a record for the division. "It's not the biggest are getting bigger — it's the best are getting bigger," boasted CFO Martin Small on the company's earnings call Thursday. To maintain the pace, CEO Larry Fink and his team outlined the firm's "ambitious 2026 fundraising plan," which will focus on a range of products, including private markets, target-date funds, active ETFs, and international retirement savers. Private investment vehicles have been a focus for Fink for years, and 2026 will be the first full year with private-credit player HPS, infrastructure investor GIP, and private-market-data provider Preqin all under the BlackRock umbrella after their acquisitions in recent years. The firm's goal for new private market assets is $400 billion by 2030, and one key client group for the firm is insurance companies, Fink said. The manager is currently in "late-stage conversations" with close to 20 insurers about a range of private market offerings. But the firm's private market strategy extends down to retail and retirement savers. The manager plans to launch the first target-date fund with private market exposure later this year, Fink said, and the industry is watching the Department of Labor to see if private assets will be allowed in 401(k) plans, as many asset managers have hoped for over the years. Fink said the firm's sales and distribution team, which he called the largest in the industry, is getting HPS products in front of financial advisors at wirehouses such as Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. "The opportunity ahead is inspiring," Small said. BlackRock also sees plenty of room to grow internationally. Fink and his executive team mentioned Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America as places that were once "exporters of capital" but are now building their own capital markets and investing. Fink highlighted the firm's direct-to-consumer retirement offering in India and pension funds and insurers in Japan as examples of international opportunities from individual savers to institutions for BlackRock to scoop up assets. "BlackRock is going to grow as long as the world's capital markets grow," Fink said. And while the firm has certainly moved beyond its roots as a fixed-income specialist, Fink highlighted the growth of BlackRock's bond investment products, including the active ETF managed by Rick Rieder, the firm's chief investment officer of global fixed income, which trades under the ticker BINC. For 2025, fixed-income ETFs attracted $159 billion in net new money, only $9 billion less than core equity offerings, despite stock funds managing significantly more capital. "We're positioned ahead for new, great opportunities," Fink said. Correction: January 15 — This article has been updated to correct the attribution to Martin Small in the second reference. Jump to

Title: How Do We Break through the Veil of Hatred? “The Vast Majority of People in the US Want Peace”
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/break-through-veil-hatred/5912367
Time Published: 2026-01-15T14:38:34Z
Full Content:
People in the USA are currently fascinated and enchanted by 19 Buddhist monks. On October 26 last year, the red-robed sandal wearers set off from Fort Worth, Texas, on a nearly 4,000-kilometer peace march through the American South. Their destination: the US capital, Washington, D.C. The brave monks do not want their marathon march to be seen as a political demonstration, but rather as a pious pilgrimage with the goal of enlightenment. Nevertheless, this march has a political dimension. On their way through the southern states, they are greeted by ever-growing crowds of people who welcome them joyfully[1]. The people on the side of the road are so happy to finally be able to be peaceful and nonviolent again in a completely brutalized world[2]. And when observing these scenes of peacefulness, most viewers cannot help but feel a certain emotion. Once again, it is clear that the vast majority of people in the US want peace. While the president deliberately escalates the spiral of violence, many ordinary Americans refuse to participate in this madness. The brave monks from the Huong Dao Vipassana Bhavana Center in Texas have proven to be extremely skilled at self-promotion. They are active on social media. Aloka, a former Indian street dog, serves as a visual representation of this peaceful pilgrimage, so to speak. Members of the order brought him to the US from a pilgrimage through India. Aloka bravely ran the routes at the beginning. Then the dog had a traffic accident and was treated by veterinarians. Aloka has his own Facebook page[3]. There, veterinarians reported on his operation, which was met with great sympathy from the American population. The recovering dog now runs a few kilometers every day. He travels the rest of the way by car. Perhaps he will be able to cover the entire route again by the time he reaches Washington. Two monks were also injured. A truck accidentally drove into the accompanying vehicle of the monks’ demonstration. One monk was so badly injured that his leg had to be amputated[4]. He is now continuing the long journey in a wheelchair. The pious order from Texas is a branch of Theravada Buddhism, which is predominant in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Vietnam. And so the Texan Theravada monks not only want to make a pilgrimage for peace, but also to raise money for a huge temple complex in Texas. Anyone who, like the author of these lines, has visited all these Theravada states knows that the poverty of the population corresponds to the gigantic Buddhist temples, which are covered with gold plates instead of shingles. The simple believer can improve his karma by buying the gold plates that adorn the roofs of the pagodas with his meager money. Compared to the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, Myanmar, St. Peter’s Basilica looks like a poorhouse[5]. Our devout brothers in Texas know how to combine peace with a passion for lavish architecture. Nevertheless, the devout pilgrimage is wonderful. And sometimes this pilgrimage does take on an explicitly political character. For example, when the monks reach the city of Selma in Alabama and cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge there. This is where the so-called Bloody Sunday took place in March 1965[6]. Civil rights demonstrators, black and white, crossed this very bridge. Some of them died as a result of brutal police violence. Even back then, people were marching. For the civil rights of Black people and Jews. The massacre in Selma, Alabama, caused great outrage in the US, fueled the civil rights movement, and mobilized white students and pupils for the protests of the late 1960s. The pilgrim monks and the citizens of Selma and Huntsville who marched with them paused to pay their respects to the civil rights activists[7]. The parallels to that time are evident everywhere. However, thanks to the Trump presidency, a much harsher wind is now blowing from Washington. The companions of the devout peace pilgrims are also aware of this. Perhaps such a supposedly apolitical meditation tour through the southern states is a kind of paradoxical intervention. After all, US citizens are being provoked to white heat by Trump’s terror troops, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE for short. This shock troop has been around since the days of George Bush the Dumb. Its job is to track down illegal immigrants and remove them from the country. Under Trump, the terror is increasingly directed against the normal population in the US. Like locusts, up to two thousand ICE thugs invade peaceful towns and commit all kinds of violent crimes without any legal authority. Just recently, a 37-year-old mother of three was shot at close range in her car by an ICE killer[8]. Citizens are also forming observation watches. The governors and mayors of the affected cities and states are announcing their vigorous resistance to the illegal attacks by ICE paramilitary gangs. It is no longer unreasonable for authorities and communities to distance themselves more than before from the US federal government. Part of the strategy, cynically calculated by shock strategist Trump, is to ensure that the people in the communities under attack are unable to find peace and remain under constant stress. These are, so to speak, regime change methods on the home front. In doing so, an oligarch like Trump, who has always been rich, seems to forget that it is ordinary people who create the wealth on which Trump and his neo-feudal parasite caste rest so comfortably. Are workers, employees, and farmers no longer needed? Is the plan to replace these people with robots and artificial intelligence? Trump visited a Ford car manufacturing plant. A worker called Trump a “pedophile.” Trump gave him the middle finger and shouted, “Fuck you!”[9] This is how direct contact between the rich and the people who create wealth looks today. It’s disgusting. There’s war everywhere. Not just on the Eastern Front. But also at home. A war that people out in the country don’t want. We all want to be left in peace by these disturbed violence fetishists. Maybe we should organize a peace pilgrimage march in Germany too? * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: “It is not IF, but When will Trump bomb Iran?” “Greenland Will Not be Free”. America is in Stage Five of Collapse
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/america-stage-five-collapse/5912350
Time Published: 2026-01-15T13:54:07Z

It is not IF, but when will Trump bomb Iran? Given he is scheduled to be at the World Economic Forum January 18th, the ego would be inclined to brag what a great warmonger he is before the biggest and baddest attendees present. With protests ongoing, it is difficult to see how he would escape murdering civilian Iranians while forcing the Ayatollah to flee. It also ventures into the cosmos – how much destruction and devastation will be forthcoming before an Israeli Prime Ruler is installed. So far, Americans are on the end feed of massive tariffs. We are going to shell out $100+ billion to rebuild the oil infrastructure in Venezuela. And we will be tabulating some $500 to $750 billion to rebuild Gaza and the West Bank. Meanwhile, Trump is thinking about making Rubio president of Cuba, and the Federal Reserve Chair a BlackRock appointee who will smile warmly while destroying the last vestige of what was America. And then there is the $500 billion increase for Pentagon funding. Greenland will not be free. There are only 93 miles of road in all of Greenland making infrastructure for mining rare earths and gold relatively impossible. New ports would need to be developed. Electricity generation is minimal with blackouts periodically occurring. All machinery and equipment would have to be imported. Labor would be imported. The list is nauseatingly long! Like Venezuela, it is likely Trump would have to print more deficit money to even begin any projects which could take years to a decade to become feasible. The full bankruptcy of America would seem to leer its monstrous head from the White House. Because everything Trump is proposing will never come to fruition in his lifetime. In addition, all his dreams of fairyland could be quashed with the Supreme Court decision which was scheduled for today – and has been pushed ‘again’ for a later date. Which leads me to believe we are missing something. A Pattern: In 1590, Spain was the richest empire on earth controlling over half the gold and silver and their military was a dominant force across Europe – within 80 years they were bankrupt and never recovered. In 1918, Britain ruled the largest empire in history, within 40 years their currency collapsed and they became a vassal of America. Empires exhaust themselves with debt and a collapse of their currency hegemony. Always following the same pattern of rise–war–ego–currency rupture and defeat. The stages of an Empire’s fall: Always collapsing from internal economic failure, always following the same script. “I will take down America without firing a shot.” It is questionable whether America’s gold reserves exist. Our manufacturing base has collapsed. Trade is becoming ever more sparse as Trump makes America noncompetitive and continues the spiral of trillion dollar deficits. While these failed empires collapsed after Stage 5, the US hasn’t. By sheer resilience! Call in the cleaners! Trump and Israel. To effectuate Stage 6 and 7 for a complete decay: Stage 6 is where we are today when other countries no longer rely on America’s fiat paper money. BRICS are moving back to gold and silver. The Middle East is recognizing alternate currencies. And with Israel at Trump’s helm, the war machine is now overextended and pushing toward a complete failed empire. Bombs in one year: Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, and Iran again. This is not coincidental. The takedown of America is the end game. And the lizards have no intention of rebuilding ‘robust economies.’ That would be the Illusion. There is no real money to prop us back up. Trump is now resorting to outright stealing to keep us running until the final decay which will be economic and agricultural collapse sending crime out of control. The same pattern over and over. As the economy collapses, citizens emigrate – those who stay fight for any remaining goods. When visiting the Detroit Auto factory yesterday, the manager informed Trump he had over 5,000 positions he couldn’t fill. Trump’s response, “Buy robots.” The number of farm bankruptcies in 2024 were 55% higher than 2023. The number in 2025 is higher than 2024. Agriculture has a low margin for survival. Trump’s response? Import beef from Argentina. Trump’s policies are NOT about making America Great. They are about feeding the 7 stages of collapse as led by bankers. Money-changers. Debt. Every single scenario throughout history providing the blueprint. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are pointing to a higher open Thursday amid a chip stock rally, while investors also digest a new slate of earnings from major banks; Oil futures are sliding as tensions around Iran's recent protests look to be easing; TSMC shares are surging after the chipmaking giant reported strong quarterly results; Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs results handily topped Wall Street expectations; and Nvidia is getting closer to selling H200 chips to China with White House approval. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are higher as chip stocks lead an early-morning rally following a strong earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 0.9% recently, while S&P 500 futures added 0.4% and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures hovered near unchanged. The major indexes finished lower for a second straight day on Wednesday as bank stocks retreated following earnings from several major financial institutions. Crude oil futures have dropped below $60 per barrel as tensions with Iran that boosted the commodity in recent days look to have eased. Gold futures were down 0.3% at $4,620 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Wednesday. Bitcoin, which hit its highest level in two months yesterday, was down slightly from those levels, trading at $96,800. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, ticked up to 4.15%. Crude oil futures are tumbling Thursday morning after President Trump said that Iranian officials have told him the killing of protestors has stopped. Recent protests against the government in Iran have resulted in an estimated 2,500 or more deaths, creating uncertainty around the country's stability and therefore the stability of its oil industry. Trump had said previously that the U.S. military could get involved if the protests continued to be met with a violent response from the Iranian government. Crude oil futures surged to a three-month high on Wednesday, but WTI futures, the U.S. benchmark, were down 4% at $59.55 per barrel this morning. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) are surging after the dominant chipmaker topped estimates in its latest quarterly report. For the fourth quarter, TSMC said it generated 1.05 trillion New Taiwan Dollars ($33.73 billion) in revenue, up 25% year-over-year, while profits surged 35% to $3.15 per American Depositary Receipt. Each metric came in higher than the analyst consensus, per estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. The contract manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, making advanced chips for many of the industry's heavyweights including Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). TSMC's U.S.-listed shares, which closed at a record high on Monday, were up 6% in recent premarket trading, while Nvidia and AMD added 1% and 2%, respectively. Shares of ASML (ASML), which makes equipment used by TSMC and other chipmakers to manufacture the semiconductors, were up more than 7% ahead of the opening bell. The heavy flow of earnings reports from major financial institutions continued this morning, with Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and asset management giant BlackRock (BLK) all releasing fourth-quarterly results. BlackRock reported first, with revenue, adjusted earnings per share, and total assets under management each coming in higher than analysts had forecast. Results from Goldman and Morgan Stanley also handily topped Wall Street expectations. Bank stocks have had a rough week. They sank Monday on a proposal from President Trump to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, and remained under pressure after a string of mixed reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). BlackRock shares were up about 2% in recent premarket trading, while Morgan Stanley fell slightly and Goldman dropped 2%. Nvidia moved a step closer to being able to sell its H200 chips to customers in China again this week, as the Department of Commerce updated its rules for semiconductor exports and Trump said his administration would support the sales. Last month, Trump said Nvidia would be allowed to sell the H200 chips, less advanced than Nvidia's Blackwell and new Vera Rubin chips, to China with the U.S. government receiving a 25% cut of the revenue. The Commerce Department said it would shift from rejecting exports of the chips to a case-by-case review. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that demand has been strong from Chinese customers, but the Chinese government has previously told companies in the country not to buy less advanced Nvidia chips over concerns of the U.S. government's involvement in the process. Nvidia shares were up about 1% recently.

Title: IPO boom times are back, with SpaceX and OpenAI on investors’ 2026 wish list. But be careful what you buy

In 1999, stock buyers had a cornucopia of new options as U.S. companies went public at a near-record clip. The crop included names like Nvidia and BlackRock that, for those who purchased them on the first day of trading, have delivered spectacular long-term returns. Now the IPO market is heating up again. While 2026 will almost certainly not match the banner year of 1999, which saw 476 companies go public, investors should have far more choices than they did four years ago, when just 38 firms held an IPO. Those likely to debut this year include the giants SpaceX and OpenAI. “We’re going to see some companies go public that are going to be defining the American technology and economic landscape for the next decade,” says Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital. All of this is enticing for investors hoping to get in early on the next Microsoft or Google. But, as history shows, there is plenty to give pause to those looking to pounce on first-day share offerings. Jay Ritter is a soft-spoken emeritus professor at the University of Florida who has acquired the nickname “Mr. IPO” for his exhaustive research on initial public offerings. His data shows that new offerings go on to beat the overall market in some years, but in other years the opposite is true—particularly in years that produce a bumper crop of IPOs. While shares in Nvidia proved a winner, that wasn’t the case with the overall class of 1999 IPOs. That year, in fact, saw newly public companies deliver three-year returns of -48%. The number is especially sobering given that Ritter’s metric measures from the first-day closing price (which is almost always higher than the official offer price), and excludes nonconventional IPOs like reverse mergers. For those tempted to dismiss this as ancient history—many members of the IPO class of 1999, after all, got clobbered by the dotcom crash—2021 provides another cautionary tale. That year saw a flood of 311 companies go public—the most in 20 years—but the three-year returns they collectively delivered came in at -49%. The reason for this is not particularly surprising. “When every IPO is popping, that’s when you see deals thrown together in a hurry,” says Kennedy, noting that smaller, unprofitable companies that would ordinarily not make the cut can pull off an IPO in such a climate. He adds that investors face a further challenge during IPO bull markets because even strong companies are prone to listing at hard-to-justify valuations, increasing the odds of a future slump. The upshot is that IPO boom times offer investors more opportunities, but also a lot more chances of a misstep. Meanwhile, companies that go public during lean years are more apt to be built to last. 19% $1.19 trillion Over the years, the path to going public has also shifted. According to Ritter, companies that debuted in the 1980s and 1990s were typically younger than today’s IPO entrants, but also more likely to be profitable. Surprisingly, though, Ritter says that profitability at the time of an IPO is not a big predictor of future success. He says that company sales are far better indicators, and firms that have $100 million or more in annual revenue are more likely to perform well over the long term than those that do not. Any investor who has sought to purchase a newly listed stock has likely encountered a familiar frustration: Even if they seek to buy right when the stock lists, the price they see from their brokerage is higher than the official listing price. This occurs because the banks that underwrite the stock offer the listing price to large clients, leaving retail investors to scramble for shares on the open market. Those who want a better price can do so by getting in even earlier—via a private sale or during a company’s pre-IPO “road show”—but that’s easier said than done. According to Glen Anderson of Rainmaker Securities, which brokers private-share transactions, it’s possible to get hold of shares of firms like SpaceX or OpenAI, but it typically requires an investment of $250,000 or more. But for the vast majority of investors who will acquire shares on the open market, timing can still play a role. There is no upside to seeking to purchase a stock right when it lists, says Kennedy of Renaissance, adding that it can even be a good idea to buy it at the end of the day or on the day after the IPO. To get a true sense of a stock’s value typically requires waiting considerably longer for the dust to settle. Ritter makes the case that a newly public company’s first earnings report is not particularly helpful, noting that analysts and corporate executives are heavily invested in delivering results in line with expectations—meaning a firm will take any steps necessary to do so. He says a company’s true investment potential will become clearer after six months, which is when insiders are allowed to sell their shares—after which the share price will reflect the company’s fundamentals more than IPO hype. All this said, the next Nvidia is likely out there among this year’s IPO crop, and for those who want to try to buy it on its debut day, the best approach is still old-fashioned research, says Anderson. “You can press the buy button right at the opening for every new stock,” he says. “Or you can do the homework and see what a stock is really worth relative to its comps and valuation, and wait for the price you want. Otherwise, you are just rolling the dice.” This article appears in the February/March 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline “IPO boom times are back—but be careful what you buy.”

How much fibre do you need? What are good sources of it? And should you purchase food with added protein? Lorraine Cooney, gut health and IBS dietitian at Blackrock Health and author, joins me on this week’s episode of the Real Health podcast. Fibre is a type of carbohydrate found in plant foods that the body cannot fully digest. Instead of being broken down for energy, fibre passes through the digestive system and helps keep it working properly. It adds bulk to stool, which supports regular bowel movements and helps prevent constipation. Fibre also feeds beneficial gut bacteria, supporting gut health and immunity. I asked the dietitian ‘do we get enough fibre in Ireland?’ She explained, “We are dramatically deficient in fibre in Ireland. We should aim for 30 grams a day, but I think that's maybe even a minimum. A lot of the studies would recommend 50 grams. Our ancestors would have consumed 100 grams. We're at around the 18 grams in Ireland.” You can listen to the full episode here or wherever you get your podcasts.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted over $1.7 billion in a three-day streak as BTC hit two-month highs and sentiment turned bullish. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen strong inflows for three consecutive days, reversing earlier January losses. Spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF inflows topped $843.6 million on Wednesday, marking the largest single-day inflows of 2026 so far, according to data from crypto research platform SoSoValue. During the three-day streak, spot Bitcoin ETFs have drawn more than $1.7 billion, offsetting earlier outflows of about $1.4 billion on Jan. 6–9. The fresh inflows came as Bitcoin revisited two-month highs above $97,000 on Wednesday, pushing investor sentiment higher as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index moved into “greed” territory for the first time since October. Investment giant BlackRock topped spot Bitcoin ETF inflows yesterday, with its iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) drawing more than $648 million. Other notable contributors included Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which added $125.4 million. ARK Invest’s ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) brought in almost $30 million, while Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) saw $10.6 million in inflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $1.5 billion in inflows over nine trading days in January, signaling a notable trend reversal. Tuesday’s $754 million inflows were the largest since Oct. 7, when spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $875.6 million of inflows, according to SoSoValue. The surge in Bitcoin funds came as BTC climbed past $97,000 for the first time since mid-November.

Title: We All Must Stand With NYC Nurses on Strike

Solidarity with the 15,000 New York City nurses at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, the Montefiore Medical Center, and the Mount Sinai Hospital, who have launched the city’s largest-ever nurses’ strike. The rank-and-file members of CWA District 1, NYSNA, and 1199SEIU are demanding safe nurse-to-patient staffing ratios, higher wages, full healthcare coverage and pensions, and increased security at hospitals to minimize violent episodes and shootings. Working people around the country need to fully support them in their courageous strike. We also need to demand that the Mount Sinai administration immediately reinstate the three labor and delivery nurses they unjustly fired on the eve of the strike’s first day. Labor unions should build national solidarity and financially support the nurses. My organization, Workers Strike Back, has donated $500 to the strike fund of the nurses’ unions. Pressure from mass anger at the cruel healthcare system in America coupled with broad and powerful working-class support for the nurses is forcing several New York Democratic Party politicians to publicly support the strike. The unions must organize to harness this mass support for the strike by mobilizing the wider working-class community to help force the hand of the hospital administrations. Democratic Party politicians, including NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani, have emphasized that the hospital administrators must “bargain in good faith,” clearly implying that the nurses could have their demands met if only that was done. This is a false idea. The bosses will not “bargain in good faith.” They will fight tooth and nail against even modest demands by workers. The only way for the workers to win is to build a powerful strike. Bosses only concede when they feel a credible threat to their profits and reputations. In order to strengthen the balance of power in favor of the striking nurses, we need citywide nurses’ unions, and unions across New York state, to carry out solidarity work stoppages. The leadership of the wider labor movement in NYC should call for mass protests and mobilize tens of thousands of workers and union members to the picket line. Socialist politicians have an obligation to use their offices to help in the combat against the hospital administrations, instead of sowing illusions in the idea that bosses and workers can have common ground. The fight to improve the wages and working conditions of healthcare workers will be greatly strengthened by tying it to a powerful nationwide fight for a system of universal healthcare.Workers Strike Back is fighting for free healthcare for all funded by taxing the rich, as a historic step towards establishing a nationwide system of socialized medicine and eliminating the for-profit insurance and pharmaceutical industries. Neither For-Profit Nor Nonprofit Bosses Care About Working People Even though the three hospitals involved in the strike are nonprofit in structure, their actual functioning is largely similar to for-profit corporations because they exist in the context of capitalism. The executives pay themselves stratospheric salaries, they prioritize their connections with the for-profit insurance and pharmaceutical corporations over the health of working-class and poor patients, and they cut staffing to the bone and pay their employees as little as possible. In 2024, NewYork-Presbyterian CEO Steve Corwin was paid $26.3 million. As the unions have pointed out in the picket line speeches, that’s over $2.1 million per month, and nearly $72,000 per day. In 2023, Montefiore’s CEO Philip Ozuah was paid $16.4 million in total compensation, making him the second highest-paid hospital executive in the New York area. Between 2020 and 2023, his pay more than doubled, increasing by 120 percent. In 2024, New York-Presbyterian, Montefiore, and Mount Sinai had net revenues of $1.4 billion, $314 million, and $127 million, respectively. Almost none of these surplus dollars have been used to improve staffing rates and workers’ wages and benefits. Mount Sinai has affiliated venture capital funds that run a private for-profit company. According to the unions, the administrators and executives at Mount Sinai have “invested untold millions in artificial intelligence, which aims to replace human care with machine care…. their largest investments in a single AI facility totaled over $100 million.” These hospitals are among the world’s largest and most leading medical centers that pride themselves on high-quality patient care. NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital was ranked the seventh-best hospital in the United States in 2022. Yet, the boards and administrations of every single one of the hospitals have engaged in systematic and ruthless cost-cutting that has had severely negative impacts on patients, nurses, and other employees. The high rankings of the hospitals are primarily thanks to the dedication and talent of the physicians, nurses, clinical researchers, and other hospital staff. But it’s those very workers who are badly exploited on an ongoing basis by the bosses. In a commonly used strike-breaking tactic, the boards at the hospitals have spent a whopping $100 million to hire temporary nurses. Mount Sinai hospital, for example, has already brought in 1,400 temporary nurses to undercut the nurses on strike. This eye-popping spending by the hospital bosses completely belies their false claims that they cannot afford to meet the nurses’ demands. It is also a grim reminder of how the capitalist class will be ruthless in their attempt to crush worker fightback. Most importantly, it points to why workers so desperately need regional, national, and international solidarity on a class basis. Efforts by the ruling class to divide and splinter the working class are endemic under capitalism in order to keep rebellion at bay. The only way for us to counter capitalism’s divide-and-conquer race to the bottom is to unrelentingly insist on working-class solidarity. Concretely, the current strike would be greatly strengthened if other nurses’ unions in NYC, and allied unions in New York state and New Jersey, carried out solidarity strikes, starting with a one-day coordinated work stoppage, except for emergency patient services. In addition to the enormous sums they are spending to hire scab workers, the hospital bosses have also spent undisclosed amounts of money to pay the exorbitant attorney fees to fight against the nurses in the courts. Why do bosses spend inordinate sums of money fighting against their employees instead of just paying to fulfill modest demands from the workers? For the bosses, even such big expenses to crush worker fightback are a small price compared to what it would cost them when workers win any significant victory. This is because victories among any section of workers raise the morale of the working class as a whole, and send the message that when we fight, we can win. That is a dangerous message as far as the billionaires and multimillionaires are concerned, so they are willing to go to great lengths to prevent working people from being emboldened to fight for their interests. America Has Scandalously Low Nurse-to-Patient Staffing Ratios In the world’s richest nation, minimum nurse-to-patient staffing ratios are legally mandated only in Oregon, California, New York, and Massachusetts. And even in these states, extremely poor enforcement is an endemic and pervasive problem. A 2021 study by the National Institute of Nursing Research unsurprisingly reveals a high nurse-to-patient ratio to be a key determinant of patient health and recovery rate. The study shows that each additional patient per nurse increased the likelihood of death, length of hospital stays, and chances of needing to be re-hospitalized within 30 days. It’s revealing of the nature of capitalism that despite all this devastating data, the bosses at the NYC hospitals have called the union’s reasonable demands “extreme” and “reckless.” Hospital administrators and corporate healthcare systems rely on nurses’ compassion and sense of obligation towards their patients to push them beyond safe limits. They know that nurses will stretch themselves, skip breaks, work understaffed shifts, and absorb emotional trauma rather than abandon those in need. Stretched thin by unsafe staffing levels, chronic stress, and deteriorating working conditions, it’s not surprising that fully 40 percent of nurses state that they plan to leave the profession within the next five years because their jobs have become unsustainable. Using the momentum for essential workers to take substantial steps forward in the wake of the Covid pandemic, nurses’ unions in New York state organized to win the Safe Staffing for Quality Care Act in 2021. The law mandates all hospital ICUs in New York to comply with a 1:2 nurse-to-patient ratio. The law also requires hospitals to provide on-call coverage for registered nurses, ensuring that staffing ratios can be maintained in the event the scheduled nurses cannot report to work. However, the lack of hospital compliance with these regulations is shocking, including in the high-profile hospitals. The nurses’ unions have provided some stark examples of how these hospitals routinely and blatantly flout the law: + Some of the nurses are forced to work with 1:3 nurse-to-patient ratios in the ICU departments, when the ratio required by the law and necessary for adequate care is 1:2 for critical and intensive care patients. + Entire patient care units are being left without any care attendants, leaving patients without being changed, cleaned, or provided their medication. + Management mandates staff to work beyond their scheduled hours on a regular basis. It’s Not About “Good Faith Bargaining” — It’s About Building Class Struggle It is crucial that the rank and file at the nurses’ strike, and at all strike actions, be geared towards building the strongest possible action to force the bosses to concede. Workers need to reject any suggestion that “fair agreements” can be reached on the basis of bosses acting “in good faith.” The Democratic Party’s New York State Senator Robert Jackson urged hospital administrators “to negotiate in good faith.” New York State AFL-CIO President Mario Cilento said that it is “unfathomable that these hospitals show such complete disregard for the pressure under which these nurses work and for all they do for their patients each day.” Cilento also said that the hospitals need to “negotiate in good faith.” and quickly to ensure nurses can get back to serving their communities by providing superior care to their patients. New York City Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO, President Brendan Griffith declared that nurses “have made every effort to reach fair agreements … in good faith.” Mamdani exhausted “all parties” to “return immediately to the negotiating table” and “bargain in good faith.” These statements represent a fundamental misunderstanding. Capitalism is a zero-sum game. Billionaires and multimillionaires only make profits by exploiting workers and using a strategy of dividing and disempowering us. Conversely, workers only win when we get organized to build our collective power in a class-based struggle to defeat the bosses and take away a portion of their profits. Any suggestion that workers win victories through “both sides” coming to the “bargaining table” and meeting in “good faith” instead of collectively fighting for our interests is utterly misleading and ahistorical. The only way workers have ever won substantial gains under capitalism is when we get organized and fight. Going on strike is the clearest and most crucial expression of such a fightback. Rather than expect that the hospital bosses are open to moral persuasion, the rank-and-file nurses should organize a militant strategy including publicly appealing to other unions in the city and state to join their struggle. This is why, as a socialist, I take issue with Mamdani’s “good faith bargaining” position on the strike. It is far too neutral for someone identifying as a socialist. A socialist representative in office must squarely and unambiguously stand with workers on strike, and help lead mass movements to decisively defeat the bosses through class struggle, as I did over my decade in office as an elected Marxist in Seattle. The Fight for Healthcare Workers Is Tied to the Fight for Free Healthcare for All As working people, we need to tie our individual struggles on specific demands to wider struggles for far-reaching change. The courageous strike action by nurses in NYC shows the urgency of a universal public healthcare system, which is also why Workers Strike Back is calling for free healthcare for all by taxing the rich. The U.S. for-profit healthcare system is driven not just by individual hospital institutions, but by the ruthless for-profit insurance industry, medical device corporations, and Big Pharma. In turn, the majority of the shares of these companies are held by investment corporations like BlackRock, which manages a monstrous $13 trillion in assets. In other words, the same billionaires and multimillionaires who own most of the nation’s overall wealth are also the ones profiting from a healthcare system that is roughly twice as expensive as the public healthcare in other industrialized countries and results in far worse outcomes for tens of millions of working people and their families. Trump’s attacks on Medicare and Medicaid, which the Democrats refused to fight, have only degraded the U.S. system further. The public healthcare systems in Canada and Western Europe were won as victories of past battles of working-class people and union members, under socialist leadership. They were hard fought and hard won. We need such mass movements today, to fight in the U.S. for free healthcare for all by taxing the rich. Healthcare workers have a real stake in building the fight for such a system, in which nurses, researchers, and staff will not only have well-paying unionized jobs, but also a real democratic say over practices and procedures such as staffing ratios, treatment options, and an orientation towards preventative healthcare. The experience in states like California and Vermont decisively shows that no universal healthcare system, let alone free healthcare, can be won by putting our faith in the Democratic Party. Democrats are just as heavily bankrolled by the wealthy, and have repeatedly stymied and crushed efforts by the labor movement, while performatively acting like they support it. The movement for free healthcare and for workplace rights will need the kind of independent working-class leadership provided by my socialist Seattle City Council office for a decade. By using my office to fight big business and the Democratic Party, I was able to help lead victories like the nation’s highest minimum wage, the Amazon Tax, and unprecedented renters’ rights. We won these through class struggle methods, not by trusting the billionaires and their Democratic Party spokespeople to act in “good faith.” We need to join each of our individual fights to the struggle for a socialist world in which healthcare is a basic right of all people. Kshama Sawant is a revolutionary socialist, a founding member of Workers Strike Back, and a former Seattle City Councilmember who led the movement to win the nation’s highest minimum wage and the Amazon Tax on wealthy corporations to fund affordable housing. Kshama is now running for the U.S. Congress as an independent antiwar socialist.
