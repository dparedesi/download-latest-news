Title: Wall Street futures slip as markets reprice rate path ahead of busy week

By Sinéad Carew and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) -Wall Street's three major indexes closed down around 1% on Monday while Treasury yields rose, as traders tamped down bets for Federal Reserve interest-rate easing and worried about the Middle East conflict's impact on oil prices. While waiting for quarterly earnings season and fresh economic data, investors also braced for another big hurricane, Milton, which is expected to hit the United States this week. Relief efforts are under way after Helene, a Category-4 hurricane, killed more than 200 people across six states. Further dampening sentiment on Monday was an order from a U.S. judge for market heavyweight Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google to overhaul its mobile-app business to give Android phone users more options. Analyst reports also spurred selling of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). After Friday's stronger-than-expected jobs report, traders pulled back from bets for a 50-basis-point rate cut in November. They were pricing in an 86% chance of a 25-basis-point cut and a roughly 14% chance the central bank would not cut rates at all, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. The change in rate-cut expectations caused U.S. Treasury yields to rally, with the yield on benchmark 10-year notes exceeding 4% for the first time in two months. Besides next month's Fed meeting, investors are waiting for the Consumer Price Index inflation reading for September and the kickoff of third-quarter earnings season with reports from banks, both due this week. "It's a combination of things over the last couple of days: the jobs report, the hurricane damage, the elevated energy prices and negative comments about some of the large-cap tech names," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. "All of that combined just makes for a nervous day, and the Google headlines tipped things over to more aggressive selling in the last hour." James pointed to the Middle East conflict as a concern for U.S. investors who are worried about the war's economic impact, including rising oil prices. Investors continue to fret about how Israel would respond to Iran's missile strikes. On Monday, Lebanon's armed group Hezbollah fired rockets at Israel's city of Haifa while Israeli forces looked poised to expand ground raids into south Lebanon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 398.51 points, or 0.94%, to 41,954.24, the S&P 500 lost 55.13 points, or 0.96%, to 5,695.94 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 213.94 points, or 1.18%, to 17,923.90. The CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge, closed up 3.4 points at 22.64, marking its biggest one-day points gain in more than a month and its highest closing level since Aug. 8. Among the S&P 500's 11 major industry indexes, only energy advanced, finishing up 0.4%. U.S. crude futures settled up 3.7% in their fifth-straight advance on concerns about Middle East supply disruptions. [O/R] The biggest industry laggard was utilities, down 2.3%, followed by communications services, which was under pressure from Alphabet's 2.5% drop. The benchmark S&P 500's biggest drag from a single stock was from Apple, after Jefferies assumed coverage with a "hold" rating, sending the stock down 2.3%. Amazon.com finished down 3% after a Wells Fargo downgrade. Among the benchmark's biggest gainers was Generac Holdings (NYSE:GNRC), which added 8.52% as investors bet on solid demand for backup power generators because of the pending hurricane. Shares of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) rose 2% after a report that activist investor Starboard Value has taken a roughly $1-billion stake in the drugmaker. Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) closed up 9.5% on a report that activist hedge fund Mantle Ridge has built a position in the company. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.73-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 222 new highs and 55 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 1,292 stocks rose and 2,988 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.31-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and two new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and 118 new lows. On U.S. exchanges, 11.39 billion shares changed hands compared with the 12.06-billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Title: US stock futures lower; CPI and earnings ahead this week - what's moving markets

Investing.com -- US stock futures edge lower following a Friday spike on Wall Street that was fueled by a strong jobs report. Markets are now gearing up for fresh inflation data which could provide more clarity on the path ahead for Federal Reserve interest rate policy in the coming months. Elsewhere, global miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) confirms a takeover bid for US-based Arcadium Lithium . 1. Futures lower US stock futures pointed lower on Monday following a rally in the prior session sparked by a bumper September employment report. By 03:28 ET (07:28 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 89 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures had fallen by 13 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had dipped by 46 points or 0.2%. On Friday, the main averages on Wall Street jumped after Labor Department figures showed that the US economy added far more jobs than anticipated last month. The numbers bolstered hopes that the the world's largest economy was on solid footing heading into the fourth quarter. Although the reading dented projections that the Federal Reserve would roll out another jumbo 50-basis point interest rate reduction at its final meetings this year, it served to boost the idea that the central bank was on course to achieve a so-called "soft landing" -- a scenario in which elevated inflation is successfully quelled without a igniting a wider downturn in the economy or jobs market. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a record closing high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 1.2% and the benchmark S&P 500 grew by 51 points or 0.9%. The increases also helped the major indices eke out a fourth consecutive positive week. 2. Data, earnings ahead this week Investors will have more economic data to pour over this week, as well as a raft of new quarterly corporate earnings. Thursday’s consumer price index (CPI) data for September is expected to show that price pressures continued to moderate at the end of the third quarter. The data, coming on the heels of Friday’s robust jobs report is likely to shape expectations around the size and pace of Fed rate cuts in the coming months. Producer price inflation data on Friday is also expected to point to tamer inflationary pressures. “CPI for September will be a key data release. If prices rise faster than expected on top of the stronger labor data, chances for the Fed to skip the November meeting will increase,” analysts at UBS said in a recent note. Meanwhile, US third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, in what will be a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at lofty valuations. Major financial firms -- including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) -- are all due to report on Friday. 3. Rio Tinto confirms approach to acquire Arcadium Lithium Mining giant Rio Tinto (LON:RIO) has made an approach to purchase lithium producer Arcadium Lithium (NYSE:ALTM), the companies announced in separate statements on Monday. Both groups said the approach was "non-binding," adding that they would divulge more about a potential deal when they had "news to share." Should it be completed, the agreement would make Rio Tinto one of the world's biggest producers of lithium, the ultralight metal essential in powering electric vehicle batteries and power storage. Prior to the announcement, media reports had speculated that Rio may pursue a bid following months of slumping lithium prices due in part to oversupply in China and weaker EV demand. No financial details were provided, but Arcadium Lithium has a market capitalization of around $3.3 billion. Shares in the Philadelphia-based firm surged by more than 24% in premarket trading. Reuters previously reported the discussions on Friday, saying that Arcadium could be valued at between $4 billion to $6 billion or higher. 4. Activist investor Starboard Value takes stake in Pfizer - WSJ Activist investor Starboard Value has taken a stake in Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) worth around $1 billion as part of a bid to overhaul the pharmaceutical company, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Starboard has approached two former Pfizer executives -- ex-CEO Ian Read and ex-CFO Frank D'Amelio -- to help in the process, the paper added, citing people familiar with the matter. The report comes as Pfizer's leadership team is facing growing calls to turn around its recently flagging performance. The drugmaker was a key COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer during the pandemic, but it has struggled to plug a subsequent sales gap as the health crisis has abated. In late-2023, Pfizer issued a revenue warning and a disappointing 2024 outlook, along with a $3.5 billion cost-cutting drive. Shares in Pfizer, which are now trading below pre-pandemic levels, were higher in premarket dealmaking following the report. 5. Oil jumps Oil prices jumped on Monday following hefty gains posted in the previous week, as traders eye ongoing tensions in the Middle East. By 03:28 ET, the Brent contract had risen by 0.5% to $78.47 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.8% higher at $74.94 a barrel. Oil prices last week recorded their biggest weekly gains in over a year on the mounting threat of a region-wide war in the Middle East. Israel has sworn to strike Iran for launching a barrage of missiles at the country in retaliation for the assassination of the leader of Tehran-backed Hezbollah.

Title: Japan’s Metaplanet expands Bitcoin portfolio with latest purchase

Metaplanet has made thirteen acquisitions since it began accumulating BTC on 23rd April. Bitcoin’s [BTC] recent price activity has drawn attention as it fluctuated from nearly $66,000 at the end of September, dipping to $60,000 on 1st October, before bouncing back. Trading at $63,480 at press time, up by 2.3% over the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency is showing strong bullish signs. Riding on this momentum, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced its acquisition of an additional 108.78 BTC for $6.7 million (1 billion yen), bringing its total holdings to 639.5 BTC, valued at approximately $40 million. Source: Metaplanet Inc./X Remarking on the same an X user noted, “Nice investment choice!” Additionally, Bitcoin Treasuries data revealed that Metaplanet initiated its BTC acquisitions on 23rd April. Hence the recent purchase made on 7th October marks its thirteenth purchase, with the recent accumulation, being of 107.9 BTC, valued at 1 billion yen ($6.9 million). These recent purchases reflect Metaplanet’s consistent strategy to expand its BTC holdings amid renewed optimism in the crypto market’s outlook for the year’s final quarter. That being said, Metaplanet has gained attention for its proactive Bitcoin acquisition approach, drawing comparisons to MicroStrategy and earning the title – “Asia’s MicroStrategy” due to its institutional-level commitment to BTC. Thus, by adopting BTC, Metaplanet seeks to navigate Japan’s challenging economic landscape marked by negative interest rates and extensive quantitative easing. Needless to say, the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs has marked a turning point, shifting mainstream sentiment—especially within Wall Street—from seeing BTC as a risk to viewing it as a strategic opportunity. Subsequently, institutional interest in BTC has surged, with U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now holding 4.6% of BTC’s total supply, equating to $58 billion and approaching the holdings of Bitcoin’s largest owner, Satoshi Nakamoto. This was further confined by data from SoSoValue which showed that BTC ETFs have amassed $57.73 billion in total assets, with BlackRock leading the charge, managing $22.91 billion in its Bitcoin ETF alone. Remarking on the same, Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst in a recent tweet had noted, “U.S. bitcoin ETFs had good day yesterday pushing YTD flows to new high water mark of $17.8b. They’re now 92% of the way to owning 1million bitcoin and 83% of way to passing Satoshi as top holder. Tick tock..” Hence, with the increasing adoption of BTC, it will be intriguing to observe whether Nakamoto will maintain his status as the top Bitcoin holder or if things take a u-turn.

Title: Inside the slow-motion fall of Patrick Drahi
URL: https://qz.com/patrick-drahi-sotheby-altice-john-malone-1851665674
Time Published: 2024-10-07T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
A version of this article originally appeared in Quartz’s members-only Weekend Brief newsletter. Quartz members get access to exclusive newsletters and more. Sign up here. Back at the end of the last century, Patrick Drahi was a fledgling French media entrepreneur, a one-time protege of U.S. cable king John Malone. He was intent on building an empire to rival that of his mentor, who borrowed heavily to build two media conglomerates and today controls significant stakes in Sirius XM and Charter Communications. Within little more than a decade, Drahi, a graduate of the Polytechnique, France’s MIT, had an empire stretching from Israel, across Europe into the U.S., and down to the Dominican Republic. His holdings included France’s oldest phone company and the country’s 24-hour news channel, a chunk of British Telecom, Portuguese mobile phone and cable operators, and mobile phone and TV news networks in Israel. In 2015, he moved into the U.S., buying Suddenlink, a southwestern cable company, for $9 billion. He bought New York-area cable and internet provider Cablevision for $17.7 billion from the Dolan family, and paid $200 million for Cheddar, a youth-oriented cable business channel. For fun, Drahi, who has a 750 million-euro collection of modern art, bought auction house Sotheby’s in 2019 for $3.7 billion. Drahi built his empire buying undervalued and underperforming cable and telecom companies, and applying what he and his aides claimed was telecom engineering — lowering costs with better technology and using the ensuing low prices to win customers. In truth, it wasn’t just telecom engineering, but a large dose of financial engineering that grew Drahi’s empire, most of it under the brand Altice. Drahi and his companies borrowed some $60 billion in bonds and bank loans to pay for it all. But rising interest rates, slower-than-expected growth, the pandemic, and poor management combined to push Drahi and his Altice empire to the brink. Now Drahi is engaged in a fierce battle with creditors, but is nearing the end of his rope, as interest payments rise, revenue is coming up short, and few buyers want to refinance his debt. At a meeting of creditors last fall in Goldman Sachs’ London office, Drahi said everything he owned would be for sale in an effort to cut debt and keep a smaller Altice conglomerate float. “Everything is open, it’s just a question of offer and demand,” Drahi said, according to a transcript of the meeting reported by Bloomberg. “All in man, all in. Plus the Eiffel Tower, OK?” “The house of cards is tumbling like it has never tumbled before,” investment banker Thomas Coudry told Bloomberg at the time. But more than a year later, Drahi has yet to sell enough of Altice’s holdings to right the ship. In fact, the outlook is so bad that the share price of Altice’s U.S. operations, which had almost $25 billion in debt at the end of June, has dropped 93% since the company went public in 2017. Net income for the first half of the year was down 92% from a year earlier, meaning there’s not much cash floating around to service that debt. In the U.S., Altice lost 51,000 broadband subscribers in the last quarter, despite building up its fiber-optic network and vastly reducing the number of trips its repair trucks need to make, and the number of calls to its helplines. Across his empire, which Drahi has largely divided into Altice units in several countries, $21 billion of debt comes due by the end of 2027. Yet Drahi seems in no hurry to sell major assets. Sales so far have included various media and data assets in France for about 3.5 billion euros, $1 billion for Teads, a European video ad platform once worth $5 billion, the giveaway of Cheddar to Archetype, with up to $50 million in payments if Cheddar reaches revenue targets, and the sale of a 24.5% stake in British Telecom to India’s Bharti Enterprises for 3.2 billion pounds ($4.2 billion). But that’s still a small fraction of what Altice owes. Complicating his task is a growing lack of confidence in Drahi’s leadership, exemplified by the arrest last year of his chief lieutenant, Armando Pereira, for allegedly bilking Altice’s various units out of millions of dollars in purchasing scams. Drahi conceded he’d been caught flat-footed by the scheme. “He built his empire on debt,” Coudry, the banker, told Bloomberg. “And it’s starting to crumple because of it. And he built his group with a small circle of people at the helm, which is also turning against him.” The most fashionable part of Drahi’s empire is Sotheby’s, the 280-year-old auction house that has stood alongside crosstown rival Christie’s as a symbol of wealth, taste, and power. But a major market downturn has left Sotheby’s struggling, and Drahi’s penchant for leveraging his assets may cost him control of the auction house. Leaked data published by The Financial Times in August showed Sotheby’s core income down 88%, amid a 25% drop in the value of art and other items sold in its auctions. A newly-opened Hong Kong office failed to muster enough worthy works to even hold its planned inaugural auction in the Chinese territory last month (Christie’s was able to go ahead with its Hong Kong sales). Sotheby’s has other ills: Employees and contractors are finding payments and bonuses delayed, The Wall Street Journal reported, and around New York, at least, Sotheby’s employees say morale at the firm is low. A planned move to new quarters at the former home of the Whitney Museum of American Art, designed in the middle of the last century by the brutalist master Marcel Breuer, has been delayed. New York City real estate records indicate the sale hasn’t yet closed, despite Sotheby’s having already agreed to sell part of its current headquarters. Drahi has also split Sotheby’s into three parts: the auction business, the buildings that house it, and the discrete business of lending money, both to collectors who offer their prizes for auction, and at high rates to buyers who purchase those same works. It’s all part of an effort to keep the market liquid and boost sale prices. But all of those businesses are now in a downturn. Certainly, Sotheby’s has been the victim of an economic cycle that has hit the art market. That market has been contracting for the past two years after a pandemic-fueled wave of exuberance had stuck-at-home collectors paying high prices to cover their walls in trophy art, said Katya Kazakina, who writes the Art Detective column for industry publication Artnews, and closely follows the auction market. Even though the stock market is still up, few works now in collections are coming on the art market, and that’s pushing prices and auction revenue down. “The rich people are still very rich, but psychologically, the market is seen as in a downturn and discretionary sellers are not in any rush to consign anything to auction when values have been falling,” Kazakina said in an interview. But part of the pressure on Sotheby’s is of Drahi’s own making, she added. “He’s leveraged other assets, and he’s leveraging Sotheby’s now, [but] auction revenues are down very significantly.” With the Breuer move still on hold, Drahi agreed last month to take in a new partner and recapitalize the auction house. Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, known as ADQ, has just put $700 million into Sotheby’s for an undisclosed ownership stake, and Drahi himself has put in $300 million. According to the results obtained by the FT, Sotheby’s will use the $700 million to “reduce the company’s leverage” when the deal closes this fall. But with more than $1.8 billion in net long-term debt as of June, Sotheby’s will still be carrying more than $1 billion in long-term debt. The overall debt load is staggering, and observers say there’s a good chance Drahi may lose his empire. Secured creditors, including major financial investors BlackRock, Elliott Investment Management, and Pacific Investment Management Co., are pressing for payment and appear tired of the financial engineering that’s moved some assets out of their reach. They’re proposing a new deal that would give them bonds they could convert into stock, potentially taking control of the companies from Drahi. Meanwhile, Drahi is in talks with Apollo Global Management, a fiercely competitive asset manager founded by Leon Black, to borrow enough cash to start paying back his creditors and win time to turn the companies around. The problem is that, given the vast number of people switching off cable for online subscriptions, and the immense investments needed to keep cable and internet infrastructure up to date, there’s not much chance that Drahi’s various firms can actually generate enough cash to meet their heavy debt load. Or as Malone, Drahi’s one-time mentor, told CNBC last fall, as Altice’s debt load became visibly stressed, “It’s all toast.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Third-quarter earnings season to be focused on "more macro" topics - Evercore ISI

Investing.com -- US third-quarter earnings season is set to kick into gear this week, in what will be a test for a stock market trading near record highs and hovering around lofty valuations. Major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) all report on Friday. Bank results offer an important view into the economy, including the strength of demand for loans. Investors will also be on the lookout for signs of whether the Federal Reserve’s large interest rate cut last month is already influencing the economy through rising auto sales or the purchase of other big-ticket items. Other companies reporting results during the week include PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). Bullish investors are hoping the results will justify increasingly rich valuations in the stock market. The S&P 500 is up 20% for the year so far and is trading near record highs despite recent volatility spurred by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In a note to clients on Sunday, analysts at Evercore ISI argued that the latest quarterly earnings will be more focused on the macroeconomic picture, including the Middle East concerns, the looming presidential election in the US in November, and the possibility of additional stimulus measures from the Chinese government. These topics "will continue to exaggerate the macro, and its very uncertain uncertainties, over micro this earnings season," the analysts said. They added that they expect growth in third-quarter results to slow from a "torrid pace" clocked in the prior period, when income per share expanded by 11.3% -- its fastest rate in more than two years. The Evercore ISI analysts are forecasting earnings per share growth to come in at 6.5% during the third quarter. Wall Street consensus estimates see the figure at 2.9%, Evercore ISI noted. "Earnings strength is likely to come from [artificial intelligence]-exposed sectors Information Technology and Communication Services (both Outperform rated) as well as Defensives Health Care (Outperform) and Utilities (In Line)," the analysts said. "Cyclically geared Energy (In Line) is most at risk. Broadly though, the support from the S&P 493 is likely to moderate in [the third quarter] (albeit still supportive) before improving in [the fourth quarter of 2024] and 2025."

Shares in Asia jumped Monday, building on U.S. gains after Friday’s blockbuster jobs report fueled investor optimism. Oil prices paused their sharp rise as investors awaited Israel’s response to Iran’s missile attack. China’s markets reopen tomorrow after the Golden Week holidays. China: Hong Kong stocks surge again as mainland markets prepare to reopen Hong Kong shares jumped again, rising 1.60% the day before mainland China markets reopen. Beijing said it would explain the details of its economic stimulus plans at a Tuesday morning news conference. Japan: Yen falls and Nintendo jumps The Nikkei 225 jumped 1.8% as the yen fell, at one point touching its weakest level against the dollar in over two months. That’s good news for the country’s big export manufacturers, but a weak yen raises the cost of imports at a time of rising oil prices. Shares in Nintendo jumped 4.4% on news that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund was open to expanding its stake in the game maker. Europe: Middle East worries outweigh jobs optimism European stocks opened higher Monday morning but slid back, as worries about Mideast tensions outweighed optimism inspired by Friday’s strong jobs report in the U.S. Further tempering investors was data showing that factory orders in Germany plummeted in August. The STOXX Europe 600 fell 0.27% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was flat in early trading. U.S. premarket down as investors consider ‘no landing’ scenario All three U.S. indexes fell in premarket trading Monday, as optimism inspired by Friday’s blockbuster jobs report shifted to predictions of a “no landing” scenario—where the U.S. keeps growing and inflation returns, trimming back hopes for more interest rate reductions by the Fed. Pfizer shares rose more than 2% in pre-market trading after the Wall Street Journal reported that the activist investor Starboard Value had taken an approximately $1 billion stake in the struggling drugmaker. Starboard wants Pfizer to make changes to turn its performance around as it struggles with fading sales of COVID-19 products. U.S. markets surged Friday on job numbers. Now, it’s earnings season Stocks surged Friday on news that U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs in September, surpassing estimates and signaling continued economic strength. The S&P 500 closed up 0.90%, and the Dow neared its record, up 0.81%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.22% with big gains for Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices. Now investor attention will turn to earnings. Pepsico kicks it off with its report Tuesday, followed by Delta Air Lines on Thursday and JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and BlackRock on Friday. The CEP inflation index for September also comes out before the bell on Thursday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: US stock futures lower; CPI and earnings ahead this week - what's moving markets

Investing.com -- US stock futures edge lower following a Friday spike on Wall Street that was fueled by a strong jobs report. Markets are now gearing up for fresh inflation data which could provide more clarity on the path ahead for Federal Reserve interest rate policy in the coming months. Elsewhere, global miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) confirms a takeover bid for US-based Arcadium Lithium . 1. Futures lower US stock futures pointed lower on Monday following a rally in the prior session sparked by a bumper September employment report. By 03:28 ET (07:28 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 89 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures had fallen by 13 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had dipped by 46 points or 0.2%. On Friday, the main averages on Wall Street jumped after Labor Department figures showed that the US economy added far more jobs than anticipated last month. The numbers bolstered hopes that the the world's largest economy was on solid footing heading into the fourth quarter. Although the reading dented projections that the Federal Reserve would roll out another jumbo 50-basis point interest rate reduction at its final meetings this year, it served to boost the idea that the central bank was on course to achieve a so-called "soft landing" -- a scenario in which elevated inflation is successfully quelled without a igniting a wider downturn in the economy or jobs market. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a record closing high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 1.2% and the benchmark S&P 500 grew by 51 points or 0.9%. The increases also helped the major indices eke out a fourth consecutive positive week. 2. Data, earnings ahead this week Investors will have more economic data to pour over this week, as well as a raft of new quarterly corporate earnings. Thursday’s consumer price index (CPI) data for September is expected to show that price pressures continued to moderate at the end of the third quarter. The data, coming on the heels of Friday’s robust jobs report is likely to shape expectations around the size and pace of Fed rate cuts in the coming months. Producer price inflation data on Friday is also expected to point to tamer inflationary pressures. “CPI for September will be a key data release. If prices rise faster than expected on top of the stronger labor data, chances for the Fed to skip the November meeting will increase,” analysts at UBS said in a recent note. Meanwhile, US third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, in what will be a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at lofty valuations. Major financial firms -- including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) -- are all due to report on Friday. 3. Rio Tinto confirms approach to acquire Arcadium Lithium Mining giant Rio Tinto (LON:RIO) has made an approach to purchase lithium producer Arcadium Lithium (NYSE:ALTM), the companies announced in separate statements on Monday. Both groups said the approach was "non-binding," adding that they would divulge more about a potential deal when they had "news to share." Should it be completed, the agreement would make Rio Tinto one of the world's biggest producers of lithium, the ultralight metal essential in powering electric vehicle batteries and power storage. Prior to the announcement, media reports had speculated that Rio may pursue a bid following months of slumping lithium prices due in part to oversupply in China and weaker EV demand. No financial details were provided, but Arcadium Lithium has a market capitalization of around $3.3 billion. Shares in the Philadelphia-based firm surged by more than 24% in premarket trading. Reuters previously reported the discussions on Friday, saying that Arcadium could be valued at between $4 billion to $6 billion or higher. 4. Activist investor Starboard Value takes stake in Pfizer - WSJ Activist investor Starboard Value has taken a stake in Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) worth around $1 billion as part of a bid to overhaul the pharmaceutical company, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Starboard has approached two former Pfizer executives -- ex-CEO Ian Read and ex-CFO Frank D'Amelio -- to help in the process, the paper added, citing people familiar with the matter. The report comes as Pfizer's leadership team is facing growing calls to turn around its recently flagging performance. The drugmaker was a key COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer during the pandemic, but it has struggled to plug a subsequent sales gap as the health crisis has abated. In late-2023, Pfizer issued a revenue warning and a disappointing 2024 outlook, along with a $3.5 billion cost-cutting drive. Shares in Pfizer, which are now trading below pre-pandemic levels, were higher in premarket dealmaking following the report. 5. Oil jumps Oil prices jumped on Monday following hefty gains posted in the previous week, as traders eye ongoing tensions in the Middle East. By 03:28 ET, the Brent contract had risen by 0.5% to $78.47 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.8% higher at $74.94 a barrel. Oil prices last week recorded their biggest weekly gains in over a year on the mounting threat of a region-wide war in the Middle East. Israel has sworn to strike Iran for launching a barrage of missiles at the country in retaliation for the assassination of the leader of Tehran-backed Hezbollah.

Title: Bitcoin Dominates 2024 Despite $12B Sell-Off: NYDIG Predicts Bigger Gains Ahead
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/10/bitcoin-dominates-2024-despite-12b-sell-off-nydig-predicts-bigger-gains-ahead/
Time Published: 2024-10-07T07:29:44Z
Full Content:
According to a recent research note by Greg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at NYDIG, Bitcoin posted a modest 2.5% gain in the third quarter of 2024, bouncing back after a decline in Q2. Despite this, Cipolaro notes that the cryptocurrency’s trading has remained largely rangebound, fluctuating between $70,000 and $54,000 for most of the past six months. NYDIG’s report highlights that while Bitcoin struggled to make significant moves, it demonstrated resilience in a challenging environment. NYDIG (New York Digital Investment Group) is a prominent player in Bitcoin financial services, offering a range of solutions tailored to institutions, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals. They focus on Bitcoin custody, financing, asset management, and infrastructure, enabling clients to securely integrate Bitcoin into their businesses. Their services are highly compliant with regulatory standards, helping banks and financial institutions offer Bitcoin-related products without directly holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets​. The firm operates as a subsidiary of Stone Ridge Holdings Group. A significant factor weighing on Bitcoin’s performance in Q3 was the near resolution of several major bankruptcies, including the Mt. Gox bankruptcy, which resulted in the return of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to creditors, according to NYDIG. Cipolaro explains that these developments, combined with notable Bitcoin sales by the U.S. and German governments, contributed to downward pressure on the asset’s price. However, NYDIG’s analysis suggests that the mere fear of these coins coming to market may have had a greater impact on Bitcoin’s price than the actual selling activity. NYDIG’s research also points out that Bitcoin investors found the third quarter frustrating, as traditional asset classes outperformed the cryptocurrency. Cipolaro explains that lower interest rates provided a tailwind for assets such as utilities, real estate, and small-cap stocks, which fared better than Bitcoin during this period. NYDIG also notes that gold set new all-time highs, further challenging Bitcoin’s performance relative to other assets. Despite these headwinds, Bitcoin remains the best-performing asset in 2024, according to NYDIG. Cipolaro emphasizes that Bitcoin’s lead over other asset classes has narrowed, especially as volatility spiked in August. While other assets, including precious metals and equities, gained ground, NYDIG’s analysis shows that Bitcoin continues to outperform on a year-to-date basis. Cipolaro notes that most asset classes are enjoying a strong year, echoing the trends seen in 2023. Cipolaro also highlights that Bitcoin defied typical trends in September, posting a gain in what is historically a weak month for the asset, according to NYDIG. Bitcoin’s correlation with U.S. equities also increased during Q3, ending the quarter with a rolling 90-day correlation of 0.46. However, NYDIG’s report notes that while Bitcoin’s correlation with stocks has risen, it remains low enough to offer significant diversification benefits for multi-asset portfolios. One of the dominant themes in Q3, as outlined by NYDIG, was the emergence of large Bitcoin holders who distributed or sold their holdings. Cipolaro explains that the Mt. Gox and Genesis bankruptcies, as well as government sell-offs, led to the transfer of approximately 204,000 Bitcoins during the quarter, valued at over $12.6 billion. However, NYDIG’s analysis shows that despite the magnitude of these events, there was little evidence of panic selling by creditors. NYDIG’s report also points to continued demand from U.S. spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a key factor supporting Bitcoin’s price during the quarter. According to Cipolaro, U.S. spot ETFs gathered $4.3 billion in total flows, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust leading the pack. NYDIG notes that while Grayscale’s new Bitcoin Mini Trust made a competitive entry into the market, BlackRock continues to dominate ETF inflows. Cipolaro concludes by looking ahead to Q4, traditionally one of Bitcoin’s strongest periods, as noted by NYDIG. He identifies several catalysts that could boost Bitcoin’s performance, including the upcoming U.S. presidential election. According to Cipolaro, a Trump victory would likely deliver substantial gains for Bitcoin, given the former president’s endorsement of the crypto industry. However, NYDIG also suggests that Bitcoin’s strength as an asset detached from traditional financial and political systems could benefit from post-election instability, regardless of the outcome.

Title: European stocks edge higher in payrolls afterglow; eurozone retail sales due

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday, boosted by a largely positive handover from Asia after last week’s strong US jobs report, with the new corporate earnings season drawing near. At 03:05 ET (07:05 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. climbed 0.3%. The main European indices have started the new week on a positive note, boosted by gains in Asia, with Japan’s Nikkei leading the way with gains of 2%, on the back of the latest U.S. jobs report that exceeded expectations. Nonfarm payrolls data, released on Friday, showed the U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, ahead of the near 150,000 forecast. This release has shifted the narrative from worries about a U.S. economic recession to the potential for a so-called "soft landing", a cyclical slowdown in economic growth that avoids the world’s largest economy going into recession. Back in Europe, the economic news is less impressive, as German factory orders slumped 5.8% on the month in August, data showed earlier Monday, a significant deterioration from the prior month’s revised higher 3.9% gain. The business climate in the German retail sector clouded over in September, according to an Ifo survey published on Monday. Retailers assessed their current situation as slightly worse than in the previous month and are more pessimistic about the coming months, the survey showed. However, Monday’s main release will be the latest eurozone retail sales data, as a guide for how the important consumer is holding up during these tricky times. Retail sales are expected to have climbed 0.2% in August, a marginal improvement from the 0.1% gain the previous month. ECB chief economist Philip Lane as well as board members Piero Cipollone and Jose Luis Escriva are all scheduled to speak later Monday, and are likely to follow President Christine Lagarde in signalling a brisk pace of further easing. In the corporate sector, the third-quarter earnings season is drawing near, with the US banking sector leading the way. Major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) all report on Friday, with their European counterparts set to follow shortly afterwards. Elsewhere, Shell (LON:SHEL) stock rose 0.4% despite the energy giant indicating in a trading update that its refining profit margins dropped sharply in the third quarter from the previous three months as global demand sagged, while oil product trading earnings also weakened. Oil prices slipped slightly Monday, handing back some of the previous week’s hefty gains as traders continue to look to the Middle East for developments. By 03:05 ET, the Brent contract slipped 0.2% to $77.86 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.2% lower at $74.25 per barrel. Oil prices last week recorded their biggest weekly gains in over a year on the mounting threat of a region-wide war in the Middle East, with Israel having sworn to strike Iran for launching a barrage of missiles at Israel last Tuesday after Israel assassinated the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah. On Monday, Israelis marked the first anniversary of the Hamas attack that triggered a war, which risks igniting a wider conflict in the Middle East.

Title: Take Five: Rate cuts and politics, say no more

(Reuters) -It's a packed week ahead with U.S. inflation data, the start of Q3 earnings, a French budget and possibly a big rate cut from New Zealand. Investors are also on edge as Middle East tensions escalate, while Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is in the spotlight. Here's all you need to know about the week ahead in global markets from Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Yoruk Bahceli in Amsterdam, Karin Strohecker and Amanda Cooper in London and Kevin Buckland in Tokyo. 1/ ONE YEAR OF WAR One year on from Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the region looks on the brink of a sprawling war that could potentially reshape the oil-rich Middle East. The conflict, which has killed more than 42,000 people, the vast majority in Gaza, is spreading. Israeli troops are now in neighbouring Lebanon, home to Iran-backed Hezbollah; Iran launched a large scale missile attack on Israel last week. Global markets have remained broadly unfazed. Oil prices, the main conduit for tremors further afield, jumped about 8% last week, but soft demand and ample supply globally have kept a lid on gains. A further escalation between Iran and Israel could change that, especially if Israel strikes Iran's oil facilities, an option that U.S. President Joe Biden said was under discussion. The scars of the conflict are visible on Israel's economy, which has suffered a number of sovereign downgrades and seen its default insurance spike and bonds slide. 2/ BUSY TIMES The U.S. third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, posing a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at elevated valuations. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) report on Friday. Other results earlier in the week include PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). S&P 500 companies overall are expected to have increased Q3 earnings by 5.3% from a year earlier, according to LSEG IBES. Thursday's September U.S. consumer price index, meanwhile, will be closely watched for signs that inflation is moderating. Robust jobs numbers could mean smaller rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which kicked off its easing cycle last month. Elsewhere, investors will seek to gauge the economic fallout from a dockworker strike after U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast ports reopened on Thursday. 3/ A RECKONING France's new government presents its long-awaited budget to parliament on Thursday. It's planning a 60-billion-euro belt-tightening drive, around 2% of GDP, next year. It reckons spending cuts and tax hikes should bring the deficit, seen rising to 6.1% this year in the latest upward revision, to 5% by end-2025. The target date for reaching the euro zone's 3% deficit limit is also being pushed back to 2029 from 2027. That's bad news just ahead of rating reviews kicking off with Fitch on Friday. Markets are not impressed. Having eased slightly, the extra premium France pays for its 10-year debt over Germany's widened back to just under 80 bps, near its highest since August. Ultimately, what may matter more is whether Prime Minister Michel Barnier can pass the budget, given a divided parliament that has investors questioning how long his government will last. Left-wing lawmakers filed a no-confidence motion against Barnier's government on Friday, but it is not expected to pass. 4/ FEELING SHEEPISH A reluctant joiner to global easing, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is catching up fast. It meets on Wednesday, and traders reckon the central bank could follow the Fed's example and cut rates by half a point. The RBNZ cut rates by 25 bps to 5.25% in August, a year ahead of its own projections. Markets price in a drop below 3% by end-2025. This will still be above where traders think U.S. and euro area rates will be. Shorter-term investors are neutral towards the kiwi, but hedge funds have lapped it up this year. Positioning and potentially higher rates than others might insulate New Zealand's currency. So could the return of so-called carry trades and in this case, essentially a bearish bet on the yen in favour of bullish ones on high-yielders such as the kiwi. 5/ POLL POSITIONING When Shigeru Ishiba surprised markets by winning the contest to become Japan's prime minister, investors rushed to reposition themselves for higher interest rates. A week on and the landscape looks different, as Ishiba back-flipped not just on monetary policy, but on prior market-unfriendly support for higher corporate and capital gains taxes. It's perhaps not surprising for a hawk to hide his talons with a snap election looming on Oct. 27. Even so, Ishiba was unabashedly blunt, saying after a meeting with the Bank of Japan - whose independence Ishiba has pledged to honour - that the economy is not ready for further rate hikes. The yen, which had been surging, slid past 149 to a seven-week trough on Monday. Japanese stocks rebounded from their steepest slide since early August. Check back in a month from now for any further policy flip-flops.

According to "Naftemporiki" sources, the highest participation was recorded by private investors rather than institutional investors, while in the international book the lead (over 70%) was held by the "heavy" names, such as Lazard Asset Management, RWC, Wellington, Capital World, Blackrock and Fidelity, among others According to “Naftemporiki” sources, the highest participation was recorded by private investors rather than institutional investors, while in the international book the lead (over 70%) was held by the “heavy” names, such as Lazard Asset Management, RWC, Wellington, Capital World, Blackrock and Fidelity, among others. A smaller percentage was secured by investors with a short-term investment horizon such as hedge funds. It is recalled that of the total shares allocated, 15% ended up in the hands of investors in Greece and the remaining 85% to foreign investors. The placement was oversubscribed by 10.4 times in total (12 times in the international offer and 1.5 times in the Greek offer). The final sale price of the HFSF shares was significantly lower than the initial estimates, at 7.55 euros from 7.95 euros that the shareholder had initially set the threshold. Both the war conflicts in the Middle East and the shareholder’s overestimation of the success of the transaction played a role in this development. According to market sources, the HFSF “fell a victim” of its success with Piraeus Bank where the placement was completed with a marginal premium.

Title: BlackRock: Bitcoin is ‘gold alternative,’ Ethereum a ‘technology bet’ – Why?

Here’s BlackRock’s insights and selling points for BTC and ETH. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently presented unique yet different pitch decks for Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH]. The dual pitch deck was presented during a digital assets conference held in Brazil. BlackRock’s Robbie Mitchnick presented BTC as a ‘risk-off’ asset, putting it at par with or better than gold. On the other hand, ETH was pitched as a ‘risk-on’ asset, similar to U.S. stocks. The asset manager praised BTC as a global monetary alternative and an excellent hedge against declining trust in governments and fiat currencies’ relentless debasement (devaluation). Source: BlackRock On the contrary, ETH was showcased as a speculative bet on blockchain technology adoption, an investment that Mitchnick equated to US stocks. He noted, “On one hand, you have BTC, a commodity like gold and an alternative to stocks and bonds. Ethereum, more of a long-term technology bet that this blockchain will provide more use cases and more value to the economy going forward.” Part of the crypto community echoed Mitchnick’s presentations, underscoring that BTC is ‘money’ with less inflationary pressure than fiat currencies, which lose value annually. But it also settled the raging debate that has been going on for a while: ETH isn’t money. In fact, since the introduction of Blobs earlier this year, ETH’s inflation has hiked, making it less of an “ultra-sound money.” If the projections hold, BTC could rally more during future geopolitical tensions, while ETH could decline in such scenarios. BlackRock’s perspective is crucial since it is a trendsetter and widely accredited. Along with Grayscale, the asset managers are perceived to be responsible for the US shift and final approval of US spot BTC ETFs. Since the ETFs debuted, BlacRock’s ETFs have outperformed every alternative offering and crossed key milestones. At the time of writing, its BTC ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust [IBIT], had a cumulative netflow of $21.5 billion with nearly $23 billion in net assets. That said, since it began trading in July, BlacRock’s ETH ETF, ETHA, has netted $1.1 billion in total inflows. Ergo, the world’s largest asset manager, could influence how other investors view the sector. According to some market observers, the message seems clear — Bitcoin is money, while the rest of crypto is speculative. In the meantime, BTC was valued at $62K, down 5% on the weekly charts. On the other hand, ETH was valued at $2.4K, down 8.5% over the same period. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

"What kind of effect did this pernicious predatory culture have on all the bystanders? The boys who were lucky enough to escape being raped, but who watched their fellow pupils being publicly molested and humiliated?" Photo: Getty Of all the accounts I’ve read about the sexual abuse of children at the hands of men in cassocks – purporting to be teachers or counsellors, when in fact they were predatory paedophiles, gaining access to their preferred prey by exploiting the trust of naive, well-intended parents – it was that of Séan Duke that kept playing over and over in my mind. He wasn’t, thankfully (I might once have said thank God, but the cultural influence of the church has waned in every way in Ireland over the course of my life, much of that down to the actions of these craven men) raped himself. Instead he talked about what he bore witness to; the myriad of more minor sexual assaults that took place in plain sight in Willow Park and Blackrock College on a regular basis during his time there.

Title: Tafe and Agco: How did the tractor partners fall out of love?

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Growing anxiety over Tractors and Farm Equipment Ltd's (Tafe) rising ownership in Agco Corp., plus its demand for board-level changes at the US-based tractor maker, prompted the latter to snap its brand agreement with the Chennai-based company, according to Tafe's court filings, as well as a senior company executive. After discontinuing some business ties with Tafe earlier this year, Agco on 30 September terminated its agreement that allowed Tafe to sell tractors under the Massey Ferguson brand, accusing the Indian company of what it called inappropriate and unauthorized actions. The developments come as a possible case of shareholder activism by a homegrown entity rattling a large foreign company. Two reasons“The Tafe-Agco matter has been triggered by two fundamental reasons. One, as you said citing legal documents, is perhaps because the executive (Agco CEO EricHansotia) was concerned about the rising ownership of Tafe in Agco," said T.R. Kesavan, group president, corporate relations and alliances, Tafe. Tafe first acquired a 12.5% stake in Agco in 2012, a year after Tafe chairman and managing director Mallika Srinivasan joined the board of the US company. Tafe has since increased its stake in Agco, touching 16.31% at the end ofSeptember2024, making it the single-largest shareholder in the world's third-largest tractor maker. Also read | TAFE presses AGCO to refresh board, consider alternativesTafe's submission to a Chennai court on 8 August said, “As between 2014-2024, the shareholding of the first plaintiff (Tafe) in the second defendant (Agco Corp) had risen to 16.3% and since the first plaintiff had become the single largest shareholder, the same had made the second defendant uncomfortable. Therefore, to force the plaintiff to a standstill agreement and to reduce its stake in the second defendant, without any justification whatsoever, the defendants issued a letter, dated 26.04.2024, unilaterally terminating the agreement between the parties concerning Turkey". Another angleKesavan provided another angle to the issue. “But the other equally important reason is that the largest shareholder, Tafe, has been urging Agco for a few years now that Agco should split the role of chairman and CEO. Tafe is the largest shareholder, a long-term strategic shareholder, a patient investor whose interests are completely aligned with those of other shareholders," said Kesavan. On the question of whether Tafe would like to increase its stake in Agco, which had a market cap of $7.3 billion as of 4 October, Kesavan said Tafe has written to all shareholders, highlighting its concerns. However, he reiterated a standstill agreement limits Tafe from owning more shares in Agco. “Please remember Tafe has not sold a single share since we invested in Agco in 2012. The commercial matters are sub-judice as it is in court, and I am afraid I cannot comment on these," he said. Also read | Mallika Srinivasan appointed chairperson of Public Enterprises Selection BoardAn email sent to Agco on 1 October remained unanswered. The roots of dispute date to 2022, a year after Hansotia became the chair and CEO of Agco in January 2021. Citing Hansotia's lack of experience running a large business, Srinivasan suggested to the Agco board that the roles of chair and CEO should be split some time in early 2022, a Tafe executive privy to the development said on the condition of anonymity. In April this year, Agco ended some business relationships with Tafe, citing the company’s “continued poor operational performance as a supplier, brand licensee and distributor to Agco" and “continued lack of focus on Agco customers in several key markets". Finally, on 30 September, Agco said it was ending, with immediate effect, its agreement with Tafe that allowed the homegrown company to sell tractors under the Massey Ferguson brand. This prompted a Tafe executive to write to Agco's shareholders, underlining what it said were strategic missteps, poor execution, and underperformance by the US company. Tafe also secured a reprieve from a court in Chennai, which put on hold the dissolution of the agreement between the two companies. Call for changes“Tafe calls for shareholder-driven boardroom changes, citing issues such as missed market opportunities, unsuccessful acquisitions, and ballooning costs," P. Krishnamurthy, corporate advisor to Tafe, said in a letter dated 30 September. “Rather than engage constructively with Tafe, the board has taken measures to disenfranchise Tafe and isolate Tafe’s representative from meaningful boardroom involvement," the letter said. Founded in 1990, Agco does not have a promoter and counts money managers Vanguard and Blackrock as its second and third largest shareholders, owning 10.5% and 7.1% respectively, as of 30 June. Its revenue improved 13.9% from the year-ago period to $14.41 billion in the year ended December 2023, while profit jumped 34.4% to $1.7 billion.

In April this year, 15 of the 20 largest public shareholders, who own 56% of Agco, voted to reappoint Hansotia as director. Sole dissenterThe sole dissenter was Norway’s Norges Bank Investment Management, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, which owns 0.91% of Agco, according to filings reviewed by Mint. “The board should exercise objective judgment on corporate affairs and be able to make decisions independently of management. The roles of chairperson and CEO should not be held by the same individual," reasoned Norges, as it rejected the reappointment of Hansotia. “Where a company founder combines both roles, we may support this for a limited period, provided the board has put in place measures to mitigate any conflicts of interest." Also read | Massey Ferguson scraps 28-year partnership with TAFE over breach of agreementsTafe was founded in 1961 by Srinivasan’s grandfather, Sivasailam Anantharamakrishnan, the founder of the Amalgamations Group. Privately held Tafe is the country’s second-largest tractor maker, behind leader Mahindra and Mahindra. In the year ended March 2023, it had ₹12,619 crore in revenue and ₹1,278 crore in profit. Agco owns 20.7% of Tafe, while Simpson & Co Ltd, the holding company of the Amalgamations group, holds the remaining 79.3% of shares. An Agco executive, Robert Crain, is also on the Tafe board. “The Tafe-Agco matter has been triggered by two fundamental reasons.

Citing Hansotia's lack of experience running a large business, Srinivasan suggested to the Agco board that the roles of chair and CEO should be split some time in early 2022, a Tafe executive privy to the development said on the condition of anonymity. In April this year, Agco ended some business relationships with Tafe, citing the company’s “continued poor operational performance as a supplier, brand licensee and distributor to Agco" and “continued lack of focus on Agco customers in several key markets". Finally, on 30 September, Agco said it was ending, with immediate effect, its agreement with Tafe that allowed the homegrown company to sell tractors under the Massey Ferguson brand. This prompted a Tafe executive to write to Agco's shareholders, underlining what it said were strategic missteps, poor execution, and underperformance by the US company. Tafe also secured a reprieve from a court in Chennai, which put on hold the dissolution of the agreement between the two companies. Call for changes“Tafe calls for shareholder-driven boardroom changes, citing issues such as missed market opportunities, unsuccessful acquisitions, and ballooning costs," P. Krishnamurthy, corporate advisor to Tafe, said in a letter dated 30 September. “Rather than engage constructively with Tafe, the board has taken measures to disenfranchise Tafe and isolate Tafe’s representative from meaningful boardroom involvement," the letter said. Founded in 1990, Agco does not have a promoter and counts money managers Vanguard and Blackrock as its second and third largest shareholders, owning 10.5% and 7.1% respectively, as of 30 June. Its revenue improved 13.9% from the year-ago period to $14.41 billion in the year ended December 2023, while profit jumped 34.4% to $1.7 billion.

In April this year, 15 of the 20 largest public shareholders, who own 56% of Agco, voted to reappoint Hansotia as director. Sole dissenterThe sole dissenter was Norway’s Norges Bank Investment Management, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, which owns 0.91% of Agco, according to filings reviewed by Mint. “The board should exercise objective judgment on corporate affairs and be able to make decisions independently of management. The roles of chairperson and CEO should not be held by the same individual," reasoned Norges, as it rejected the reappointment of Hansotia. “Where a company founder combines both roles, we may support this for a limited period, provided the board has put in place measures to mitigate any conflicts of interest."

Gold prices slipped after a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report poured cold water on expectations for an aggressive rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, boosting the dollar. U.S. job growth accelerated in September and the unemployment rate slipped to 4.1%, further easing pressure on the Fed to deliver another 50 basis point rate cut at its Nov. 6-7 policy meeting. US non-farm payrolls showed job additions of 254K against the expectations of 150K and 72K of upward revisions to the past two months of data. Similarly, unemployment data was also reported lower than expectations of 4.1% v/s 4.2%. The dollar index, opens new tab jumped to a seven-week high against its major crosses, after the jobs data.

Read more The rupee rose 2 paise to 83.97 against the US dollar in early trade on Monday, aided by a weaker greenback in the international market and a drop in crude oil prices. The increase in the country’s forex reserves to a new all-time high of $704.88 billion on Friday further pushed the domestic currency, according to forex traders. However, growing escalation of the conflict in the Middle East and FIIs outflow on Friday capped sharp gains in the domestic unit, they said. Read more Global Business of the Bank grew by 12.00% Y-o-Y to 13.96 trillion as on Sep 30, 2024. Global Advances of the Bank grew by 14.41% Y-o-Y to 6.21 trillion Global Deposits of the Bank grew by 10.15% Y-o-Y to 7.75 trillion Shares traded lower by 2.22% on the NSE to ₹106.35 BULLION Last week, gold and silver prices experienced significant volatility due to the Middle East crisis and a strong U.S. dollar. Escalating tensions increased demand for safe-haven assets, driving gold to record highs and silver to a 12-year peak. However, gains were limited by the strengthening dollar and rising U.S. bond yields. Strong non-farm payroll data in the U.S. pushed both the dollar index and 10-year bond yields to two-month highs. Additionally, rising crude oil prices tempered expectations of aggressive rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, causing gold and silver prices to retreat from their peaks. Gold has support at $2,631-$2,610, with resistance at $2,662-$2,678. Silver has support at $31.82-$31.68 and resistance at $32.35-$32.52. In INR, gold has support at ₹75,880-₹75,670, with resistance at ₹76,450-₹76,650. Silver has support at ₹92,850-₹92,050, while resistance is at ₹94,130-₹94,980. de CRUDE OIL Crude oil prices experienced significant volatility last week, recovering from their lows to reach five-week highs, driven by heightened tensions in the Middle East and better-than-expected U.S. non-farm payroll data. Israel’s military actions against Lebanon and its threats of retaliation against Iran in response to missile attacks on Israel have further unsettled global oil markets. The crude oil prices rose due to positive U.S. economic data, including the non-farm payroll report and the unemployment rate. The reopening of Chinese markets this week, combined with recent stimulus measures, is expected to boost China’s oil demand, providing further support to prices. However, gains are being capped by the upcoming OPEC+ production hike starting in December and the strengthening U.S. dollar. We expect crude oil prices to remain volatile during today’s session. Crude oil has support at $73.10–$72.50 and resistance at $74.20–$75.00. In INR, crude oil has support at ₹6,250–₹6,180 and resistance at ₹6,420–₹6,480. Optival Health Solutions Pvt Ltd, the subsidiary of Medplus Health Services, has received two suspension orders of Drug Licence for stores situated at Tumsar, Maharashtra.

Domestic deliveries were around 4.9 million tonnes, up 5% YoY, broadly in line with the growth in production. On a half-year basis, crude steel production was up 5% YoY, while deliveries increased by 4% YoY. Tata Steel shares trade flat on the NSE at ₹166.56 NATCO Pharma Ltd announced that Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Novo Nordisk have reached a settlement of the US patent litigation related to generic Ozempic (Semaglutide). NATCO and Mylan are partnered on the development of generic Ozempic products. The terms of the settlement are confidential. Stock rose 2.80% on the NSE to ₹1,391.90 Top gainers: Trent (1.71%), ITC (1.70%), Kotak Mahindra (1.15%), HCL Tech (1.07%), HDFC Life (1.05%) Top losers: Titan (-1.65%), Adani Ports (-0.99%), ONGC (-0.81%), Hindalco (-0.55%), HDFC Bank (-0.55%) The most important reason for the decline in Indian equities was FII selling, as they wanted to book profits here and redirect funds into the Chinese markets. Geo-political factors, new SEBI rules on F&O, and October seasonality also played a role. We believe the worst of the geo-political impact and China-related issues is now behind us. We began purchasing equities in a significant way yesterday and will continue to do so in the coming days. In the short term, we are positive about the markets. However, longer term, we remain cautious due to deteriorating global macroeconomic conditions and high valuations. Therefore, we plan to book profits on our current purchases by the end of CY 2024. “Nifty bounced back sharply in the first half on Friday, re-tested the trendline, and made a new low on the hourly chart. However, a positive divergence is visible on the hourly chart. Incase of a pullback, the lower rising trendline which earlier provided support will now act as resistance and its level is 25250 currently. The 40HEMA at 25570, will be a major resistance level in the near term and a trend reversal level as well. On the way down, the low of 24750 is the next major support level.Cross currents on strong equity cues from Wall Street against rising triplets; USD index, crude and US 10 year yields may dominate trade set up for the upcoming week on Dalal Street. Participants may also watch RBI policy outcome (though the expectation is of no change on rate but future direction remains crucial) and the start of Q2 results season. Continue to accumulate stocks on any weakness for year-end melt up but keeping in mind the geopolitical uncertainty and US elections related volatility.” Crude oil futures traded lower on Monday morning after witnessing their largest weekly gains last week due to escalating tensions in West Asia.

Read more U.S. stocks rallied Friday on fresh signs of a strong labor market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending at a record peak while the bond market cut back recession fears. U.S. stocks ended higher Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report, with all three major benchmarks picking up steam in late afternoon trading to end with weekly gains. For the week, the S&P 500 advanced 0.2%, while the Dow and Nasdaq each edged up 0.1%. All three major U.S. equities benchmarks booked a fourth straight week of gains. A stronger-than-expected jobs report underscored the resilience of the US economy and boosted soft-landing hopes. Treasuries sank as traders recalibrated their bets on the size of the Federal Reserve’s next rate cut. U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs in September, marking the quickest pace of hiring since March and exceeding economists’ forecasts of 150,000. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% despite expectations for it to hold steady at 4.2%. A high-stakes corporate earnings season kicks into gear next week, with bullish investors hoping results will justify increasingly rich valuations in a U.S. stock market near record highs. Asian stocks rose after stronger-than-expected US payroll data underscored the health of the world’s largest economy and boosted optimism over a soft landing. Three central banks are set to release their interest rate decisions this week, namely the Bank of Korea, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Reserve Bank of India. Nifty ended lower for the fifth consecutive session on October 4. It recorded its worst week in over two years amid rising tensions in the middle east. At close, Nifty was down 0.79% or 200.3 points at 25049.9. Nifty fell for the fifth consecutive session on Oct 04 forming a bear candle with a long upper shadow. This means that the upward retracement is happening in a running manner. Over the week, Nifty fell 4.45% retracing the gains of several weeks. This is a negative sign though oversold conditions may mean a small pullback in the near term. Nifty could now take support at 24753 and later 24420 while 25453 could act as a resistance in the near term. In the past week, panic-selling hit Dalal Street, pushing Nifty near the psychological 25,000 mark. However, a potential rebound is on the cards as Nifty bulls may regroup following a strong close on Wall Street after the US September Jobs Report eased recession fears. Key upcoming events include the FOMC Meeting Minutes and RBI MPC outcome on 9th October, and the US CPI data on 10th October. Traders should also watch crude oil prices, which have surged to $74.4 per barrel amid Middle East tensions.

The focus will be on the RBI monetary policy outcome and quarterly results of India Inc that will start trickling in from this week. Mandar Pitale, Head Treasury, SBM Bank India, said: The forthcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting from October 7-9 will be conducted with the induction of three new MPC members in place of the retiring members. During the last meeting of MPC held in August, internal RBI members were biased towards an extended policy rate hold. “The September jobs report is hard proof that a soft landing is within the grasp of the Federal Reserve. Obviously, there is healthy momentum in the US labour market — US companies added 254,000 jobs when the projected increase was 150,000. Not just that, US unemployment has also ticked down to 4.1%, when economists expected that the unemployment rate would remain unchanged, or in fact, rise. The report also confirms that we will, most likely, conclude 2024 with two 25 bps cuts in November and December, without any big bang 50 bps rate cut. The jobs report would have strengthened the narrative for market bulls, had it not been for the widening Middle East conflicts. Now, with crude oil prices jumping by $3 a barrel, all eyes would be keenly glued to the fallouts of this geopolitical disturbance.” The market’s recovery faltered, with the Nifty closing at a 3-week low, managing to stay above 25,000. Selling pressure was widespread, and the overall market breadth favored declines. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) are shifting funds away from India, viewing it as a relatively expensive market. Instead, they are turning to China, anticipating an economic revival there. This optimism was fueled by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) cutting interest rates and lowering the reserve requirement ratio, alongside fiscal stimulus measures. These moves triggered a strong rally in both Chinese and Hong Kong markets, pushing up commodity prices. On the domestic front, the market’s focus will also be on the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which is scheduled to meet from October 7 to 9, 2024, with the outcome to be announced on Wednesday, October 9. The RBI is expected to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged in its upcoming policy review, having maintained it at 6.5% for the ninth consecutive meeting in August 2024. This aligns with market expectations, as the central bank aims to bring inflation closer to its medium-term target of 4% while supporting economic growth. The Q2 earnings season is kicking off with key companies like TCS, Tata Elxsi, DMart, and IREDA among others, which will drive stock-specific movements. Domestically, liquidity remains strong, with signs of sectoral rotation from overvalued segments to areas with more attractive valuations. Additionally, commodity prices, the U.S. dollar index, and key U.S. macroeconomic data will play a crucial role in determining market direction. Geopolitical developments will also continue to be a significant factor on the global front. Technically, the Nifty has the immediate and critical support level stands at 24,750, with the next support around the rising 100-day moving average (DMA) near the 24,400 mark. On the upside, 25,500 and 25,700 will act as key resistance levels during any potential pullback. While Banknifty, The 100-day moving average (DMA) at 51,100 serves as an immediate support level, with the 50,000-49,500 range, which aligns with the 200-DMA, acting as the next support zone. On the upside, 52,500 and 53,300 will be key resistance levels during any pullback. Bank of Maharashtra raised Rs 3,500 crore from QIP - allotted at Rs 57.36 against the floor price of Rs 60.37. LIC was allotted nearly 26 crore shares (42.56% of the total QIP) ICICI Prudential Life Insurance allotted over five crore shares - 8.51% of the total QIP Aditya Birla Sun Life was allotted nearly 3.5 crore shares representing 5.67% of the total QIP.

The recent US jobs data raised hopes for soft landing of the world’s largest economy and seems to have reduced the chances of another 50 bps rate cut by the end of this year. The US inflation continued to fall for fifth consecutive month, dropping to 2.5 percent in August, from 2.9 percent in July. Additionally, PPI and wholesale inventories data from the US, retail sales from Europe, household spending & PPI numbers from Japan, and vehicle sales from China will also be watched. 1) 8th results of Haryana and J& K 2) 9th RBI policy 3) 10th Result season start The Indian benchmark indices were knocked down badly last week. Nifty 50, Sensex and the Nifty Bank index tumbled over 4 per cent. Escalating tensions in the Middle East have been weighing on the Indian equities. Last week, we were bullish and had expected the benchmark indices to go up. That view has gone wrong. The sharp fall last week has turned the short-term picture weak. However, there is not threat for the broader uptrend. Although there is room to fall more from here, supports are coming up which can halt the fall and produce a bounce. The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) may prefer to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at their forthcoming meeting as the escalating Iran-Israel conflict could pose inflationary risks due to higher crude oil prices even as growth remains steady. After a wave of initial public offerings (IPOs) in recent weeks, the primary market will experience a brief slowdown, with only two new public issues scheduled for the next week, aiming to raise ₹365 crore. Read more Nine of the top-10 most valued firms together lost a whopping ₹4,74,906.18 crore in market valuation last week, with Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank taking the steepest hit, in line with weak trends in equities. A war of words broke out between Ola founder Bhavish Agarwal and stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra on Sunday on social media platform X over the after-sales and service quality of the company’s electric scooters. It started when Kamra responded to a post on X by Agarwal, who posted a photo of Ola’s gigafactory, by putting a picture of several Ola Electric scooters parked together seemingly waiting for servicing. Read more Mid-cap companies are projected to outperform their large-cap counterparts in FY25 as they quickly adopt emerging technologies and capture market share in niche sectors. Analyst estimates suggest that tier-1 companies, or large-caps, are expected to witness revenue growth of 0.9-3 per cent q-o-q, while mid-caps are expected to grow by 2.1-4.5 per cent. Equipped with ₹17,600 crore fundraising and a zero-debt status, Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group companies — Reliance Infrastructure Ltd and Reliance Power Ltd — are poised to execute their growth strategies, according to officials. In the past two weeks, both companies have announced raising ₹4,500 crore through preferential issues of equity shares and ₹7,100 crore from global investment fund Varde Partners through equity-linked long-term FCCBs, having a long maturity period of 10 years and low interest rate of 5 per cent. Read more The short-term outlook is bearish for IDBI Bank. The stock has been in a strong downtrend since the last week of July this year. The 4.5 per cent fall in the second half of last week has dragged the share price well below the 200-day moving average (DMA). This can continue to keep the stock under pressure.

Title: Five talking points from the weekend GAA club championships

Kilmacud Crokes’ win over Na Fianna kept them on course for a club record fourth successive Dublin football title. They had to pedal hard in the second half, but the champions held on for a 1-12 to 0-12 victory – the decisive goal coming in first-half injury time from Mark O’Leary. Their final against Cuala is something of a neighbourhood squabble but the first time it has been played out at this level. Cuala’s defeat of Ballymun Kickhams on Saturday sent them to a first senior football final since 1988. Back-to-back All-Ireland hurling champions in 2017-18, the Dalkey club have yet to win the Dublin football title. This weekend’s semi-final success was spearheaded by recently confirmed football All Star nominee Con O’Callaghan, who started both All-Ireland club hurling finals and scored 0-8 in the 0-16 to 1-8 win over Ballymun. Southside football in the capital has strengthened considerably in the 36 years since Cuala’s last final. Of the 35 titles contested 18 have been won by clubs from south of the river and none of Thomas Davis, Kilmacud Crokes and Ballyboden St Enda’s had even won their first senior championship. Kilmacud could go clear second on the Dublin roll of honour if they win the final – despite having won the first of their 11 titles in 1992, 46 years after O’Toole’s won their 11th. Although the champions will be hot favourites a few in the club may remember how in 2009 when they reached the Dublin under-21 final against an unfancied Cuala it didn’t go to plan and the underdogs ran out 2-7 to 0-6 winners. The weekend’s two county football finals ended in draws and will go to replays. In Leitrim, Ballinamore Seán O’Heslin’s, winners three years ago, had nearly got home but champions Mohill rallied and replacement Matthew Murphy got a late equaliser. Carlow also featured recent champions – from 2022 and 2021 – in the meeting of Palatine and Rathvilly, and it took two late points from Liam Molloy and Liam Gavin to force a replay. Elsewhere “winner on the day” protocols led to great excitement and heartbreak in Clare where Sixmilebridge beat Inagh-Kilnamona to join Saturday’s victorious semi-finalists Feakle in the hurling final after extra time and penalties. The shoot-out went to a second round before David Fitzgerald’s penalty flew over the bar to send the Bridge through – a cruel sign-off to a brilliant season for Fitzgerald who nonetheless has an All-Ireland and League double under his belt. In the Cork football championship, which has provided a few shoot-outs in recent times, Nemo Rangers qualified for the semi-finals with a 5-4 penalty win over Clonakilty when extra time had failed to separate the teams. The vital kick fell to Ross Corkery, a son of former All Star Colin, and he did the needful. The Cork hurling semi-finals were contrasting events. Divisional side Imokilly had a comfortable nine-point win over Blackrock to reach a 10th final. The east Cork side have established quite a record since breaking through 27 years ago. Since then they have won five titles – two back-to-back and also a three-in-a-row – and lost just the one, in 2001, although they did lose three other finals before they won their first. That 1997 final is to be re-enacted this year as champions Sarsfields, their opponents back then, won their semi-final against Midleton, albeit without any measure of comfort. It looked as if Conor Lehane’s injury-time equaliser had forced extra time but up popped last year’s top gun Aaron Myers to decide the match 0-22 to 0-21. It has been part of the mythology of Kilkenny’s 20th century hurling domination that manager Brian Cody, who led the county to 11 All-Irelands, hadn’t been an obvious choice given his experiences in charge of home club James Stephens. In his autobiography Cody acknowledged as much. “In stark, blunt terms you could say that my years as The Village manager had been a failure – certainly when it came to winning trophies – so there was no obvious reason why county chairman John Healy or the rest of the board would look in my direction.” Since retiring after his record-breaking exploits with the county he has been back involved with the club but with no discernible lift in fortunes, having precipitously toppled in three years from losing a county final to being blitzed in last year’s semi-final and on Saturday being beaten in a relegation playoff by Glenmore after a difficult season. It will be a first campaign outside senior in 70 years. They weren’t the only former All-Ireland champions to find themselves on the downward escalator at the weekend. Galway’s Kiltormer, winners of the Tommy Moore in 1992, slipped into junior hurling for next year after losing a relegation playoff with Kilbeacanty. Both of the Mayo football semi-finals went to extra time before Ballina Stephenites saw off Ballaghaderreen and Knockmore came from behind to pip Breaffy. It will be the fifth year running that the local rivals will be in the county final but the first time that they have played each other in 20 years, Ballina coming out on top on that occasion. On Sunday Ballina emerged on top by 1-18 to 2-12, and had to survive a late goal chance for Shairoze Akram which was somehow scrambled to safety and they will contest a third successive final. Later there were times when Breaffy looked more likely winners but Knockmore refused to wilt. In extra time it appeared as if Pearse Ruttledge’s sending off had swung the match in Breaffy’s direction but they too lost a man when Conor Beirne also picked up a red card. Late goals in extra time from replacements Charlie Bourke and Billy Ruane settled the matter for a 2-15 to 0-18 victory.

Title: Ukrainian refugee families in south Dublin to be ‘uprooted’ and moved to hotels, claim supporters

Ukrainian refugee families living in Blackrock, south Dublin Ukrainian refugee families living in Blackrock, south Dublin, are to be “uprooted” and moved to hotels on Monday, supporters have claimed. Blackrock Supporters Group issued a media alert tonight stating the refugees will be moved to West Dublin hotels. The Irish Independent has asked the Department of Children if this report is accurate and for details. A spokesperson for the group said: “Supporters of the Blackrock Ukrainians were shocked that the Blackrock centre had been prioritised for closure. “They are vulnerable families and are in schools and jobs locally. To be moved now after two years to a remote, out of town hotel setting makes no sense. "The Ombudsman for Children has been clear that long term accommodation in hotels is damaging and inappropriate for children. “Hotels are also much more expensive than this self-catering model. Nothing about this closure makes sense.” The group has claimed the Department of Children and Integration will terminate its contract for Ukrainian refugee accommodation in Blackrock. They added that a “decision to close the state accommodation and relocate the vulnerable tenants has been unsuccessfully appealed by the impacted Ukrainian refugees, as well as the local community and representatives”. The group of 30 Ukrainians had been resident at the Blackrock property since December 2022, the group stated. They claimed the residents are “set to be moved to three different hotels and are advised that the new accommodation is temporary, and they can expect to be moved again”. The group added that it had been “highlighted in a written appeal that their lives will be put into complete turmoil if they are forced to relocate now after two years of settled life in Blackrock”. The Blackrock property has been “converted from commercial office use to emergency use, with up to 42 bedspaces and communal self-catering facilities,” the group stated, “The Ukrainians appealed as a group to the Department of Children and Integration to review the decision as their children are settled in schools and into the community,” it added. “The group learned of the closure on September 2 as schools reopened and have been supported by parents in local schools, as well as neighbours, to appeal to the Department to review the decision or delay the closure to allow them to find appropriate accommodation in the area,” the group said. Supporters and Ukrainians have joined together to now create the Blackrock Community Alliance to “help and representations have been made to the Minister for Children, Roderic O’Gorman and to local TDs and councillors,” the notification explained. A petition had been signed by 1,200 in the area and employers and schools had written letters of support. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Ukrainian families in South Dublin face relocation on Monday
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2024/10/06/ukrainian-families-in-south-dublin-face-relocation-on-monday/

Olha Sheremet’s husband Viktor has stomach cancer, meaning she must cook special food for him, she explains through a translation app while standing at the foot of a staircase in a building in Blackrock, Co Dublin. With tears streaming down her face, she moves her hand over her heart as she shows photographs of her son holding a gun while wearing a military uniform on the front line in Ukraine. She speaks to him once a month, she says. “We cannot live and cook in a hotel. Everything is nearby here, both the hospital and medical centre where my husband is being monitored. We are elderly people and it is very difficult for us to move,” the translation reads. She is one of 29 Ukrainians in a property in the south Dublin suburb of Blackrock who have been told that three buses will arrive on Monday morning to move them to new accommodation. Under plans drawn up by the Department of Integration, the group which has been living at the property since December 2022, is to be split up and moved to three separate hotels near Citywest, Liffey Valley and Temple Bar. [ Ukraine’s weariness with the West grows as war enters new phase: ‘People are tired, but we have no choice’Opens in new window ] The group varies in age with eight children attending schools in the area, five of whom are in primary schools, one in secondary and two at preschool. Living there for almost two years, they have become a “big family”, they say. Half of them are working nearby, in areas such as construction, caring, pharmacy and cleaning while others are in further education or learning English to use their qualifications in Dublin. “Everyone hopes and prays that something will be organised this week so we can stay long-term. It’s very important because we worked so hard to build our lives in this area,” says Diana Tkachuk, a 31-year-old from Sverdlovsk, who lives there with her six-year-old daughter Alisa. Sitting beside her, Natalia Mishchenko shows videos she took in March 2022, of the regional intensive care hospital of Mariupol, where she worked as a nurse, reduced to rubble. The 44-year-old is working in a local petrol station while studying to work as a nurse in the Republic. Her young daughter, Varvara, attends the same school as Alisa and plays camogie locally, she says. “All our lives are organised in this area,” says Ms Tkachuk, who works locally as a florist. “It’s very sad because we have to move out and live separately. I think for some people, it will be harder without support like English, it will be hard,” she says. She does not worry for herself, she adds, but for her daughter who will have to start over again, something that was challenging when they first arrived. “Everyone is upset, stressed and shocked,” she says. Ramziia Zidliaieva, a 66-year-old economist from Crimea, who lives at the property with her son Aider said she will not be boarding the bus on Monday morning, even if it means they will officially have nowhere to stay. “I want to stay here because I like this house and I like the very nice people. It’s very good, they’re beautiful people and they’re fighting for us. I’m very happy I have these people and this family and I thank god,” she says. The employer of Ms Zidliaieva’s son in Dún Laoghaire wrote to the department urging to reconsider the move which they described as “shocking”. Blackrock Community Alliance, a group of locals advocating for the Ukrainians, also urged the department not to proceed with the move. One letter from Carysfort National School said it has worked “tirelessly” to establish a sense of security for the families. It says children living at the property had “fully settled” within the local community, adding that the “proposed disruption would impact severely on these children’s emotional state”. The residents were initially informed on September 2nd, as the children were returning to school. The department explained it is consolidating its accommodation portfolio due to a reduction in the number of Ukrainians fleeing the war and seeking accommodation. [ ‘He called Ukraine his home’: frontline fighters recall Irish soldier Robert Deegan killed by Russian shellingOpens in new window ] A subsequent letter informed them of the buses due to arrive on Monday morning, adding that if they refuse the accommodation, they would not receive further offers, nor could they access the Citywest Transit Hub. “These actions are necessary to ensure the provision of accommodation for all who need it,” the letter reads. The residents wrote to the department asking it to reconsider or at least postpone the move until alternative arrangements could be made, either through private rented accommodation or host families, though no such pledges have yet been made. The majority are refusing to board the buses, hoping an agreement can be reached in the coming days. The owner of the property, who wished for their name and the precise location of the accommodation to remain anonymous, said the department declined a request for an extension to allow a planned transition to private accommodation in the area or at the current property. Applications for rent supplements in the hope of staying on as private tenants have also been declined by the Department of Social Protection as it deemed the property unsuitable for their needs. A spokesman for the Department of Integration said contracts are being ended regularly and that every effort is being made to keep those being moved, as local as possible. “The department appreciates that this is not easy for people and that moving location can be very disruptive, but at all times the department was clear that State-funded accommodation is temporary and subject to change,” he said.

Title: Terenure beat Lansdowne 28-22 in repeat of last season’s Division 1A semi-final

Terenure’s highly rated 19-year-old Austrian-born outhalf Casper Gabriel announced his arrival on the Energia All-Ireland League scene with a stunning cameo off the bench to help seal a 28-22 win over Lansdowne in a repeat of last season’s Division 1A semi-final. Terenure were leading 23-22 with 12 minutes to go when their two 19-year-old debutant halfbacks combined, Chris O’Connor moving the ball to the blindside off a back-pedalling scrum inside the home 10-metre line and Gabriel, with his second touch at AIL level, offloading outrageously to release Craig Adams. The left-winger exchanged passes with O’Connor before scoring and the win was effectively sealed when Lansdowne opted for a scrum from a penalty seven minutes out and 23-year-old prop Marcus Hanan, making his first appearance since Terenure won the AIL final two seasons ago after a neck operation, won a relieving penalty. The classy Lansdowne centre Andy Marks had scored two early tries to put Lansdowne 12-0 ahead, before Chris Cosgrave converted Adam La Grue’s try and landed two long-range penalties to put the home side 13-12 up at the break. An intercept try by Lansdowne’s debutant 19-year-old winger Todd Lawlor put them back in front but following another Cosgrave penalty Henry McErlean set up a try by lock David Maher. Cue the O’Connor-Gabriel cameo. Something also had to give at Temple Hill where the game was brought forward to 1.30pm before rain of biblical proportions arrived. By then Cork Con had eased into 20-0 interval lead through tries by ex-Sevens winger Seán French and scrumhalf Adam Maher. Matthew Bowen added a third, and James Taylor kicked the rest as they ended Young Munster’s unbeaten start with a 25-5 win. This left Clontarf alone atop 1A as they recorded a third bonus-point win away to UCD in what was a highly competitive affair until the visitors’ power game enabled them to pull away and win 30-15. City of Armagh played the sodden conditions better than Garryowen in earning a slightly surprising but deserved 13-6 win at Dooradoyle, while Ballynahinch had five tries by half-time to lead 31-7 before St Mary’s again rallied to return with two bonus points from a 36-33 defeat. Despite winning one match the newly-promoted St Mary’s sit fourth. Blackrock had a very significant 35-34 win at Ollie Campbell Park to end Old Belvedere’s unbeaten start, meaning Nenagh’s 22-22 draw against Old Wesley at nearby Energia Park leaves them as the only unbeaten side in 1B. Corinthians, Barnhall, Cashel and Instonians continue to set their rip-roaring pace in 2A. Each earned a third bonus-point win, the pick of them being Corinthians’ 63-23 win in Navan, where the talented Seán Naughton converted all nine tries, including a brace by fellow Ireland under-20 John Devine. In a reprise of last season’s women’s final Railway Union gained a measure of revenge with a 19-18 win over champions UL Bohs in a game that was moved to Annacotty as a penalty try and a try by Claire Boles sealed a 19-18 comeback win.

Title: ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) Price Targets Adjusted by Analysts; Berenberg and Deutsche Bank Maintain Buy Ratings Amid Advancements in Lithography Technology
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asml-holding-n-v-asml-150324232.html

We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. US technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk. While tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. This has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave — particularly in software and cloud services. Their scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants. Let's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician in a clean room working on a semiconductor device, illuminated by the machines. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81 ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) makes and sells advanced semiconductor equipment systems. The company focuses on making and selling lithography machines. These machines are essential for companies who want to manufacture smaller chips. The lithography machines use photolithography, a process in which a light source is used to expose circuit patterns from a photomask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a meaningful portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips that are faster and more efficient than previous models. Chipmakers require EUV lithography tools developed by ASML to continue past the 10-nanometer process node. Berenberg analyst Tammy Qiu recently lowered the price target on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stock to EUR 945 from EUR 1,100 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. Deutsche Bank analyst Robert Sanders also recently lowered the price target on ASML to EUR 950 from EUR 1,100 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. Overall ASML ranks 17th on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ASML but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

James Docherty. Photo: willowparkjuniorschool.ie Tributes have been paid to the principal of Willow Park School, attached to Blackrock College, Dublin, following his death. James Docherty was a well respected principal at the south Dublin junior school. On the school’s website a tribute reads: “We are heartbroken to share with you the news of the unexpected passing of our beloved and devoted Principal James. Our thoughts and love are with his loving wife and cherished family. “Words cannot express grief at times like this. James was the kindest of men and tried to solve everyone’s problems. James will forever have a massive place in the heart of Willow Park. May his journey ahead bring him peace.” Mr Docherty, originally from Scotland, is survived by a young family. He had been principal of Willow Park School for almost eight-and-a-half years. He held a masters in leadership and management at Trinity College Dublin and a BA in primary school teaching from the University of Glasgow, as well as a higher national diploma in assisting multilingual learners to integrate into mainstream education. An welcome address from Mr Docherty was still on the school’s website earlier today. It read: “A Willow education provides boys with a moral compass for life. Our motto Fides et Robur (meaning faith and strength) pervades Willow daily life, as our pupils prepare for the joys and challenges ahead.” He added that new parents would “come to understand that Willow Park is more than just a school”.

Highlights this week include Tesla's (TSLA) expected unveiling of its self-driving robotaxi at a Thursday event as well as the release of earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) on Friday. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September comes as investors monitor inflation following the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cut. Minutes for the September Federal Reserve meeting will also provide insight into the central bank’s recent actions, while several Fed officials are scheduled to deliver remarks throughout the week. Data on wholesale inflation, consumer credit, and the federal trade deficit are also on the calendar. Monday, Oct. 7 Tuesday, Oct. 8 Wednesday, Oct. 9 Thursday, Oct. 10 Friday, Oct. 11 Tesla is expected to introduce its self-driving “robotaxi” at a Thursday event, where the company could provide more details about several of its products. After delaying the highly anticipated event from August, Tesla will likely show off the driverless vehicle, provide details on its costs, and possibly demonstrate the ride-sharing app used to hail the vehicle that might be called a “Cybercab,” analysts said. In addition to the robotaxi, Tesla could also provide updates on its Optimus Bot humanoid robot, self-driving software, and a low-cost version of its electric vehicle (EV). Also on Thursday, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices will provide updates for its artificial intelligence (AI) products as it hosts its “Advancing AI” event, where its chief executive officer, Lisa Su, will deliver remarks. Investors get a look at the performance of the financial services industry of late as several big banks will report 2024 third-quarter earnings on Friday. Leading the way is JPMorgan Chase, reporting after its prior-quarter results beat analyst expectations on strong revenue from its investment banking services. Earnings for the country’s largest bank come after an executive last month lowered expectations for net interest income following the Federal Reserve’s move to lower interest rates. Wells Fargo reported a decline in net interest income in its second-quarter report, despite its results coming in ahead of analyst projections. BlackRock will deliver earnings after it reported a record $10.6 trillion in assets under management (AUM) in the prior quarter. Delta Air Lines’ report on Thursday will offer insight into the air carrier’s performance during the summer travel season, while soda maker PepsiCo will deliver its financials after scaling back its growth outlook amid mixed results in its previous quarter. Market watchers will get a look at whether inflation continued to decline in September with the Thursday release of CPI. With recent data showing that price increases continue to slow, market participants are looking to see if inflation continues to trend down toward the Federal Reserve’s target. Easing price pressures prompted the Fed to reduce its key federal funds rate in September, which influences borrowing costs across the economy. Updated inflation data could send signals about the next moves for the central bank. Throughout the week, investors will have an opportunity to hear individual Fed officials’ thoughts on interest rates and the economy. Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman’s remarks on Friday will come after the inflation report, while New York Fed President John Williams, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are also on the week's speaking calendar. The Fed will also release the minutes from its Sept. 17-18 meeting on Wednesday, providing another look at how monetary officials are viewing the current economy. Markets could move on other economic data releases this week, including consumer credit on Monday, jobless claims on Thursday, consumer sentiment and wholesale inflation figures from the producer price index (PPI) report on Friday.

Title: Ireland pay for passing up chances as hosts Canada extend winning streak

There was no disgrace in losing this WXV 1 clash but perhaps a pang or two of regret for Scott Bemand’s Ireland team as they produced a gutsy performance against the world number two ranked side, who extended their winning streak to six matches. The vast majority of the home side play their club rugby in the England Premiership or in France. Ireland head coach Bemand, speaking to RTÉ, said: “It shows where we are and where we’ve got to that we’re disappointed with the result. There was a bit of naivety where we copped two seven-pointers late in the first half but then we regroup and win the second half five-nil. “We’re sitting here disappointed that we didn’t execute more chances, that we didn’t execute when we got into their 22. We think we’ve left some points out there. I’m immensely proud of the girls. We came here and said we want to leave respected. “I think we’ve come some way to earning a bit more of that respect. But we quickly wanted to move through the gears and be in them games right at the death.” Canada were worthy winners on the basis that they took three try-scoring chances to Ireland’s one and might have managed more had they been a little more patient in possession. It should be acknowledged that Ireland’s spirit and fight in defence was a factor in them not conceding more points. A 15-minute spell before the interval was match-defining in terms of the outcome. Ireland lost props Linda Djougang and Niamh O’Dowd to yellow cards either side of a penalty try – it was 15 on 13 for 60 seconds at one point before Canada’s Alexandria Ellis was sent to the sin bin for a ruck offence – but did manage to briefly reduce the deficit through a penalty from outhalf Dannah O’Brien. The visitors conceded two further tries in a three-minute spell before the interval, the first from Claire Gallagher while Ireland were still a player down, and the second when a Shoshanah Seumanutafa turnover at a ruck enabled Canadian blindside flanker Julia Omokhuale to race over from 30 metres unopposed. Centre Alex Tessier, who struck the ball beautifully off the tee, landed both conversions to nudge the Canada into a 21-3 interval lead. That scoreboard dominance would have had a harsh look to it from an Irish perspective as they were arguably the better side for the majority of the first quarter but could not translate that pressure into points. Both sides elected to kick for territory early on and the visitors had particular reason to be grateful to Erin King, the Irish blindside nicking a lineout and then forcing a ruck penalty to thwart mounting Canadian pressure. Ireland also had one or two lineout issues which cost them a decent platform. Brittany Hogan made a couple of trademark bursts, while on the other side of the ball Stacey Flood’s tackle on Tessier and turnover not only snuffed out a Canadian attack but allowed O’Brien to push Ireland back into Canadian territory with a superb kick. Djougang was binned for a deliberate knock down, O’Dowd for collapsing a maul, both close to the line. Aoife Wafer provided a brief respite from the Canadian dominance with a typical charge through defenders before she linked with captain Enya Breen. O’Brien kicked the resultant penalty as Ellis was sent to the sin bin for not rolling away. Ireland needed the first score after the interval and got it thanks initially to another outstanding Wafer carry, in which she occupied five defenders. Dorothy Wall carried into contact before O’Brien’s inch-perfect crosskick was caught and dotted down by Eimear Considine. It was to be the final score of the match. Prop Andrea Stock made her Ireland debut off the bench and Deirbhile Nic a Bháird was summoned for a first Irish appearance following an ACL injury. A spiralling error-rate, with Ireland penalised for some maul transgressions, meant that neither side were able to sustain pressure for long enough to create and finish try-scoring opportunities. Nicole Fowley’s right foot earned territory for Ireland but Canada had their moments too, and it took a brilliant tackle from Emily Lane to cut down Laetitia Royer and prevent the home side from increasing their lead. Ireland will play their final game in the tournament against USA next Friday night (8.30pm Irish time). SCORING SEQUENCE – 24 mins: penalty try, 7-0; 32: O’Brien penalty, 7-3; 33: Gallagher try, Tessier con, 14-3; 36: Omokhuale try, Tessier con, 21-3. Half-time: 21-3. 45: Considine try, 21-8.

Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run A bronze statue depicting Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin, was unveiled in ... [+] Hungary in 2021 amid a bitcoin price boom that his unmasking threatens to destroy. A new HBO documentary titled Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery is set to air on Tuesday at 9pm ET, with producers claiming to have cracked the mystery of bitcoin's anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, it was this week reported by Politico. In an email, a publicist drumming up press for the film claimed it will "present a compelling case for who Satoshi Nakamoto may be" without going so far as to claim any sort of proof of Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity or new evidence. Interest in Satoshi Nakamoto's identity has increased along with the value of the 1.1 million bitcoin the anonymous man, woman or group is believed to control, now worth around $66 billion at current prices. Speculators on the Polymarket betting platform think it's most likely that Len Sassaman, a cypherpunk who took his own life in 2011, will be named as Satoshi by the HBO documentary, attracting 38% of punters. However, Twitter posts written by Sassaman from bitcoin's earliest days show he was unimpressed by the technology. "Personally, I think bitcoin is overhyped, but the hype itself is interesting," Sassaman posted, adding in a separate post that "digital cash experts I've talked to [say] that it's bunk." Other names tipped as possibilities include Hal Finney, who received the first bitcoin transaction before he died in 2014, bit gold developer Nick Szabo and Blockstream chief executive Adam Back. However, the prediction market site is also putting a 90% likelihood of Satoshi's identity not being proven in 2024. Adding the excitement, early bitcoin wallets from the Satoshi era—when they were still posting on the BitcoinTalk forum—have recently woken up and begun moving coins, it was recently reported by Bitcoin Magazine. Some 250 bitcoin worth around $15 million have been moved from wallets over the last two weeks. If any of the bitcoin believed to be directly linked to wallets used by Satoshi Nakamoto is moved, it's expected to trigger a market crash as traders scramble to sell ahead of what could be a tsunami of bitcoin flooding the market.

[+] in the real identify of bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto. U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase warned ahead of its 2021 Nasdaq market debut that the unmasking of Satoshi Nakamoto is a major risk to its business. "The identification of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, or the transfer of Satoshi’s bitcoins" is a risk factor, the company’s prospectus read. Meanwhile, new research carried out by X user Wicked has suggested Satoshi Nakamoto conducted a 51% mining attack on the bitcoin network in its first year of existence, ostensibly to test what would happen if a single miner gained full control. A 51% attack involves a bitcoin miner gaining majority control of the bitcoin network by "out hashing" other miners with sheer computational power. If a miner is able to do so, they would be able to reorder the network, triggering a likely fatal crisis of confidence. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead

Investing.com -- This week’s U.S. inflation data for September will be keenly anticipated after Friday’s stronger than expected jobs report reassured investors who had been concerned that the economy was weakening. The Federal Reserve is to publish the minutes of its September meeting, earnings season gets underway, and oil prices look set to remain volatile amid heightened geopolitical tensions. Here's your look at what's happening in markets for the week ahead. Thursday’s inflation data for September is expected to show that price pressures continued to moderate at the end of the third quarter. The data, coming on the heels of Friday’s robust jobs report is likely to shape expectations around the size and pace of Fed rate cuts in the coming months. Producer price inflation data on Friday is also expected to point to tamer inflation. The data is likely to reassure the Fed that inflation is on a sustainable path back towards its 2% target. The Fed kicked off its easing cycle last month with a hefty 50 basis point rate cut and Friday’s jobs report argues against the central bank delivering another outsize cut in November. “Next week, CPI for September will be a key data release. If prices rise faster than expected on top of the stronger labor data, chances for the Fed to skip the November meeting will increase,” analysts at UBS said in a note on Friday. “Keep in mind that in the "dot plot" released following the September FOMC meeting, nearly half of the participants thought that total cuts of 50-75 bps by year-end would be appropriate, meaning only 0-25 bps of additional cuts this year.” The Fed is to publish the minutes of its September meeting on Wednesday with investors on the lookout for indications into how officials may be thinking about the pace of easing going forward. Additional insights into the factors that led to policymakers reaching a consensus around the 50bps cut would also be noteworthy. Investors will also get a chance to hear from several Fed officials during the coming week, including Neel Kashkari, Raphael Bostic, Adriana Kugler and Lorie Logan. Meanwhile, Thursday’s report on initial jobless claims is likely to be impacted by recent weather disruptions. U.S. third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, in what will be a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at lofty valuations. Major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) all report on Friday. Bank results offer an important view into the economy, including the strength of demand for loans. Investors will also be on the lookout for signs of whether the Fed’s large rate cut last month is already influencing the economy through rising auto sales or the purchase of other big-ticket items. Other companies reporting results during the week include PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). Bullish investors are hoping results will justify increasingly rich valuations in the stock market. The S&P 500 is up 20% for the year so far and is trading near record highs despite recent volatility spurred by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Oil prices rose on Friday and settled with their biggest weekly gains in over a year on the mounting threat of a region-wide war in the Middle East, although gains were limited as U.S. President Joe Biden discouraged Israel from targeting Iranian oil facilities. Israel has sworn to strike Iran for launching a barrage of missiles at Israel last Tuesday after Israel assassinated the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah. The events had oil analysts warning clients of the potential ramifications of a broader war in the Middle East. On a weekly basis, Brent crude gained over 8%, the most in a week since January 2023. WTI gained 9.1% week-over-week, the most since March 2023. Iran is a member of OPEC+ with production of around 3.2 million barrels per day or 3% of global output. The group's spare production capacity should allow other members to boost output if Iranian supplies are disrupted, limiting oil price gains. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets on Wednesday and some market watchers believe it could follow the Fed's example and cut rates by half a point. The central bank lowered the official cash rate for the first time in more than four years at its last meeting in August, a year ahead of its own projections, and RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr said he would like to deliver two more cuts by Christmas. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia is to publish the minutes of its September meeting on Tuesday, with market watchers on the lookout for insights on its hawkish hold. RBA Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser on the docket to speak the same day. --Reuters contributed reporting

Title: Sorry, Not Sorry: Hillary Clinton Is Still Waiting for Your Apology
URL: https://freebeacon.com/author/stiles/culture/sorry-not-sorry-hillary-clinton-is-still-waiting-for-your-apology/
Time Published: 2024-10-06T09:00:05Z

Hillary Clinton isn't going anywhere. Why would she? She was right. She tried to warn us. She was treated so unfairly. She deserved it; we betrayed her. We were sexist. We were duped. She was robbed. Putin, Comey, Facebook, Electoral College. The goddamned voters, man. Sorry? She's not sorry. She's still waiting for an apology from you. From all of us. If you're normal, you probably had no idea Hillary was on tour again after writing an angsty post-career memoir, her second in the category. Nevertheless, she persists. It's called Something Lost, Something Gained: Reflections on Life, Love, and Liberty. Naturally, it was written in collaboration with the Evergreen Strategy Group, a woke consulting firm founded by former Clinton aides that helps clients such as Nike and BlackRock "live their values with confidence and compassion." We all know what Hillary lost. For crying out loud, she hosted a "victory" party under a giant glass ceiling on Election Night in 2016. Her campaign ordered a bunch of confetti cannons to blast symbolic shards into the air. She made her goon John Podesta go out and tell everyone to go home after she lost. "We're still counting votes," he sobbed. That was eight years ago. So, what has she gained since then? Ever the politician—ever the Clinton—she knows what she's supposed to say, so that's what she says. Even if it isn't true. Which it's not. Hillary, who turns 77 later this month, would like us to believe she's gained wisdom, perspective, acceptance, humility, all that shit. She's excited about getting older, ready to "fearlessly embrace" physical decline. Could it be that she's lying? That would be more in line with her character. It would also explain why the Annie Leibovitz cover photo is touched up beyond all recognition. All this time after venting her postelection feelings in What Happened, Hillary is determined to prove she's not done venting her feelings. She is Uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite, still harping on about the high school state championship she would have won if coach had put her in the game in the fourth quarter. About the country she alone could have saved. She "flew on Air Force One, dined with kings and queens, and was constantly surrounded by armed guards." She coulda been a contender. As if anyone cares, which they don't, Hillary lauds herself as "the first woman to win a presidential primary, the nomination of a major party, and the national popular vote." Hell, even her MSNBC fans must be getting tired of her by now. (The ones who haven't died yet.) "These days, I find myself thinking mostly about the future," Hillary bluffs as she relitigates old grievances. "Time and so many battles won and lost have given me a thicker skin and a stiffer spine." How she really feels is revealed in the text. Her "pang of vindication" when Trump was convicted of paying hush money to a porn star. "A fraud was committed against the American people, against all of us," she bristles. "I would have won. ... Even now, just thinking about that moment makes fury well up in my chest." She's owed an apology, dammit, even if we don't deserve her forgiveness just yet. It's probably made up, but Hillary claims to have been approached by a groveling FBI dude eager to apologize for the bureau's "devastating and unfair" investigation (her words) into her emails. She was not in the mood. "I stared at him for a minute, trying to contain my anger," she fumes. "You're sorry? Now? Finally, I said, 'I would have been a great president,' and walked away." These little nuggets are like porn but for the sick freaks who bought Robert Mueller prayer candles and waited in line to take selfies with Elizabeth Warren. Your weird aunt who went a little too far with the "Anthony Fauci, sex god" stuff. Bless her heart, Hillary. At one point, she likens herself to Cassandra, a virgin princess from Greek mythology described as having "bulky breasts, small feet" and a "shortish, round-faced, white, mannish figure." Cassandra could see the future, but was cursed to be ignored. By the Trojans, for example, who dismissed her warnings about Greek invaders hiding in a wooden horse. "I take no pleasure in being right. In fact, I hate it," Hillary seethes. "I tried to raise the alarm [about Trump] in every way I could, but the media and many in the political establishment dismissed me as overwrought, even hysterical." Because the Trojans didn't listen, Cassandra was captured and forced into sex slavery. Because the voters didn't listen to Hillary, a similar fate befell America. It's about to happen again, so don't say she didn't warn you. In the chapter "Remaining Awake Through a Coup," Hillary unveils her deranged fantasy of a second Trump term. She envisions "soldiers patrolling streets" alongside "roving deportation squads." Immigrants rounded up in "massive, sweltering camps." Trump has declared war on Mexico. Putin has conquered Ukraine. Smog blankets the sky. Crops rot in the fields. Trump's enemies rot in prison alongside the women and doctors who ran afoul of his pregnancy monitors. Dumpsters overflow with unwanted babies. "I wish the imagined future I've sketched out were just a liberal fever dream, some kind of dystopian MSNBC fan fiction," Hillary bemoans. "But it's not." (It is. Overwrought, even hysterical, one could say.) This coming from the same failed politician who wants us to "work together to restitch our unraveling social fabric and to rebuild Americans' trust in one another." Uniquely ill-suited to the task, she is. Completely oblivious, as well, when preaching against "viewing the other party as traitors, criminals, or otherwise illegitimate," having done precisely that throughout the book. "Soon enough, actual blood gets spilled." (Um, it already has.) Bullshit aside, Hillary relays a cute anecdote about "an editor at a major newspaper" who reached out in 2022 to ask if she'd write an op-ed about "how prescient" she was to denounce Trump supporters as "deplorables." The media can be so unfair. When she's not moping about being right, Hillary tries to convince us she doesn't spend all her time obsessing about politics. That she's fun! You can imagine how persuasive this is. Several chapters recount good times hanging out with old friends who know her as "Big Girl," and her "postmenopausal belly" as "Beulah." (Don't ask.) The girls weekend at the Franklin D. Roosevelt library watching "a film on the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II" sounds like a hoot. Ditto the "fun" story about the time her long-suffering bag servant Huma Abedin struggled to open the "fancy rhinestone-cheetah clasp" on her purse. Even a nice memory about shampooing her hair in the lake with childhood friends is instantly ruined. "I shudder now to think of the environmental implications," she moans. Hillary says her editorial consultant wanted the book to "feel like sitting with me at a dinner party." (Like hell, apparently.) Considering the intestinal fortitude required to make it to the end, I'd say mission accomplished.

Last week closed on a positive note, with two key developments easing concerns about the economy. A strong jobs report helped calm fears of a weakening labor market, while the resolution of the dockworkers’ strike alleviated worries about supply chain disruptions. In addition, oil prices, which had surged early in the week due to Middle East tensions, saw a welcome pullback by the weekend. This week promises to be action-packed, with plenty on the horizon. With this wave of optimism, let’s dive into what the coming week has in store. NVIDIA’s AI Summit kicks off Monday, running from Oct. 7-9 in Washington, D.C. The three-day event will bring together industry leaders to explore how AI can tackle some of society’s biggest challenges. With a focus on healthcare, cybersecurity, manufacturing, and more, the summit will highlight AI’s potential to drive innovation across key sectors. Amazon’s (AMZN) highly anticipated two-day Prime Day sale event kicks off Tuesday, offering a valuable glimpse into consumer behavior and e-commerce trends. The sale will provide key insights into what products shoppers are prioritizing, as well as into the broader state of consumer demand. This event is expected to highlight popular categories and pricing strategies and could serve as a bellwether for the coming holiday shopping season. Amazon’s recruitment strategy is partly driven by expectations that e-commerce spending will surpass overall holiday sales in the fourth quarter. The company’s Prime Day event earlier this year generated over $14.2 billion in online sales, marking one of the biggest e-commerce events of the year. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk will finally unveil the highly anticipated Robotaxi on Thursday at Warner Bros. Studios (WBD) in Los Angeles, California. Dubbed “We, Robot,” the event will show the first look at the prototype and the booking platform for owners and riders. There will be also an update to the company’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, which powers the robotaxis, along with a production timeline and the service launch date. PepsiCo (PEP) is set to report its earnings ahead of the closing bell Tuesday. Then, Thursday, Delta Air Lines (DAL), Infosys (INFY), and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) are scheduled to release their earnings before the market opens. The week will close with major banks taking center stage Friday, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), BlackRock (BLK), and the BNY Mellon (BK) lead off the quarterly earnings season for the financial sector. The Consumer Credit report for September is set to be released Monday. Midweek (on Wednesday), investors will keep an eye on the Wholesale Inventories data for August, along with the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s September FOMC meeting, which could provide insights into the central bank’s next moves. Thursday will bring a trio of key data releases, including initial jobless claims, the consumer price index (CPI), and core CPI, offering a detailed look at inflation and labor market trends. Finally, on Friday, the producer price index (PPI) and core PPI will be released alongside preliminary consumer sentiment data for October, rounding out the week with a comprehensive view of inflationary pressures and consumer outlooks. – Francisco Velasquez contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Western North Carolina has world’s richest lithium, purest quartz deposits: Is Hurricane Helene a land grab by DOD to steal these valuable resources?

Some analysts say there was unusual atmospheric activity during Helene's track that appears to have produced such a high voltage that something was able to "push" it towards the areas that got hit the hardest. The reason could have to do with all those valuable minerals. "We have the richest deposit of lithium in North Carolina," reported 100percentfedup.com. "We have a top producer of lithium, Albemarle, getting a $90 million contract from the Department of Defense to create a lithium mine. Guess who has 12 million shares of Albemarle? BlackRock." Keep in mind that before Helene hit, many local residents were protesting against the creation of lithium mines in their area. Now, many of those same people's homes and livelihoods are destroyed and Albemarle and competitors like Piedmont Lithium, presumably, now have access to exactly what they want without the citizen protests. Albemarle, by the way, received a $90 million grant from the DOD to advance its domestic mining operations â operations that locals throughout western North Carolina do not want in their now-destroyed backyards. "Something doesn't smell right," 100percentfedup.com noted. "Are we seeing a similar tactic that was used in Hawaii for a land grab? Lahaina, Maui 2.0?" ?? Was Hurricane Heleneâs Path & Behavior a Result of Natural Processes or was It Manipulated?

(@PoisonDeathShot) September 30, 2024 (Related: Much of western North Carolina is now isolated from the rest of the world due to blocked and destroyed roads and damaged energy infrastructure.) High-purity quartz facilities in Spruce Pine shut down indefinitely Another valuable mineral that is only found in the mountains of western North Carolina â and specifically in Spruce Pine â is high-purity quartz, a mineral that is critical for the manufacture of semiconductors, solar panels and fiber-optic cables. According to reports, two facilities that mine and produce high-purity quartz, Sibelco and The Quartz Corp, are both closed indefinitely due to extensive damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Just last year, Sibelco announced a $200 million investment to double the capacity of its high-purity quartz mining and production operation. That investment is now on the rocks because of what Hurricane Helene did to the area. All of the company's employees are safe and accounted for, according to a statement. Previously, some of them were "unreachable due to ongoing power outages and communication challenges." "Please rest assured that Sibelco is actively collaborating with government agencies and third-party rescue and recovery operations to mitigate the impact of this event and to resume operations as soon as possible," the company said. Between the loss of high-purity quartz production and these issues with lithium companies trying to barge their way into communities of western North Carolina that do not want them, it sure does appear as though there is much more than meets the eye pertaining to Hurricane Helene. It is nothing short of strange, to say the least, that the Biden regime has really been ramping up its efforts to create a battery supply chain here in the U.S. to support its electric vehicle (EV) pipe dreams. "October surprise," one person wrote about the devastation. "More to come, I'm sure," responded another. The powers that be (TPTB) have apparently amassed so much power that they no longer care if the public knows about their greedy scamming operations designed to steal land and resources away from We the People.
