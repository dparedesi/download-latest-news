Title: Coinbase CEO’s Hot Take: Bitcoin Is Basically A ‘Meme Coin’

Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, has recently made an audacious statement regarding Bitcoin that has caused quite a stir in the crypto industry. He recently proposed that Bitcoin could be regarded as “somewhat of a meme coin,” which sparked a debate among enthusiasts, analysts, and investors. Like meme currencies, Armstrong pointed out that the value of Bitcoin is essentially derived from popular or collective belief. He explained that unlike conventional assets, Bitcoin lacks inherent value connected with actual objects or direct use. Instead, its value is swayed by societal trust and the shared perception of its significance. He also likened Bitcoin to the US dollar, noting that although the dollar’s value has persisted mostly due to mass acceptance and faith in its purchasing power, and it is not connected to the gold standard. This comparison highlights Bitcoin’s status as a store of value rather than a commodity with inherent worth. Armstrong did not intend to undermine Bitcoin’s credibility; however, his statements underscored the expanding influence of meme coins. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two cryptocurrencies that have amassed substantial followings despite possessing minimal fundamental utility. On memecoins… Memecoins have generated a lot of buzz recently, and I’ve gotten some questions on how I think about them. I am personally not a memecoin trader (beyond a few test trades), but they’ve become hugely popular. Arguably, they’ve been with us since the beginning –… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 19, 2025 For example, Dogecoin, which originated as a joke, experienced a price increase of over 15,000% in 2021 as a result of social media publicity and endorsements from prominent figures such as Elon Musk. Shiba Inu reached an all-time market cap of around $40 billion. This trend is a reflection of how sentiment and viral appeal can push asset valuation up, much like what Armstrong suggests applies to Bitcoin. Armstrong agreed that, in spite of the comparison, Bitcoin is still the most well-known cryptocurrency. The crypto continues to dominate institutional adoption, regulatory discussions, and long-term investment strategies. Meanwhile, the legitimacy of Bitcoin has been strengthened even more by the trust big financial firms like BlackRock and Fidelity have in the crypto asset. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and decentralized nature also sets it apart from the typical meme coin phenomenon. Armstrong’s statement has fueled discussions about how cryptocurrencies derive their value. Some critics argue that equating Bitcoin to a meme coin undermines its role as “digital gold,” while others believe it accurately describes the evolving nature of financial assets in the internet era. Featured image from PC World, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) vowed this month that a stablecoin bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, will be passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law within the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s administration. As the bill gains momentum, some experts say the industry may be at a crossroads. While the measure would for the first time provide a pathway to legality for stablecoin giants like Tether and Circle, it would also likely unleash massive competition. A federal framework would embolden countless companies to dive into the $233 billion stablecoin market, according to Niklas Kunkel, the founder of blockchain oracle builder Chronicle Labs. At the least, many firms will consider what strategic advantages stablecoins have, he told Decrypt. “As soon as this legislation passes, there are going to be 10,000 companies looking at this,” Kunkel said. “I would expand that beyond just payment companies and asset issuers. [...] You can include tech companies: the Amazons, Ubers, Metas and Googles of the world." Among interested firms, Kunkel bet 1,000 of them would debut a stablecoin within the following year that stablecoin legislation is passed. In lieu of adopting an existing stablecoin like Circle’s USDC, however, Kunkel said firms will be incentivized to release their own equivalent. “They would love their users to use their own branded stablecoin because they can make the yield on the underlying reserves,” he explained. “They may even be white-labeled.” As an example of a white-labeled stablecoin, Kunkel pointed to Paxos. The company once issued a Binance-branded stablecoin called BUSD, while playing a central role in PayPal’s stablecoin foray as the issuer of PayPal USD (PYUSD). As digital assets are pegged to the price of a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, stablecoins are often backed by reserves of cash and U.S. Treasuries that generate yield. In Coinbase’s fourth quarter, the company disclosed $224 million in revenue from assets backing USDC. A report published by S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday found that the GENIUS Act would increase the adoption of stablecoins in the U.S. The lack of regulation in the U.S. is “one of the main impediments” to broader adoption, the analysts wrote. In November, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla wrote in a letter addressed to Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris—then the Democratic presidential candidate—that America’s opportunity to cement financial dominance through stablecoins had been stifled so far by “countless examples of regulatory overreach.” Though firms like BlackRock have issued tokenized money market funds that resemble stablecoins, S&P analysts wrote that a lack of regulation and supervision has prevented their broader adoption in fields like everyday payments. Chronicle Labs is developing a network for oracles, which allow blockchains to connect with external, real-word data sources. Before starting the Switzerland-based firm, Kunkel worked for five years at MakerDAO, the popular lending protocol behind the stablecoin DAI. (MakerDAO has since rebranded to Sky and replaced DAI with USDS.) Kunkel was part of the founding team at MakerDAO when the organization launched in 2017. And at this point, building something that resembles a bank and operates solely on stablecoin rails is possible, he said. The regulatory backdrop just needs to catch up. “As soon as you get the government involved, everything slows down to a crawl,” he said. “The rate at which that iceberg thaws is going to determine how far into the future that we have to look before we realize this.” When PayPal introduced its stablecoin in 2023, the firm faced criticism from Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a top Democrat on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. She said that “federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential,” expressing deep concern that the payments giant had moved before a framework was passed. Ultimately, stablecoin legislation may further intertwine the U.S. financial system with crypto’s sprawling decentralized finance, or DeFi, landscape, according to S&P analysis. “In our view, the role of stablecoins will continue to evolve and could eventually lead to more integration between traditional finance and decentralized finance,” they wrote.

Title: New UK-Based Climate Group Emerges as Banks Retreat
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/02/20/812605.htm
Time Published: 2025-02-20T15:41:21Z
Full Content:
It was a dank, drizzly February evening when about 120 people gathered in the brightly lit art gallery of London’s Guildhall, surrounded by gold-framed paintings ranging from Pre-Raphaelites to realists. At the event, Alok Sharma, a former member of the UK parliament who served as president-designate of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2021, announced the launch of the Transition Finance Council. The goal of the London-based group, which includes banking executives, is to rally the City of London, companies and policymakers to scale funding for decarbonization efforts at home and abroad. The intention is “to ensure that London is positioned as a preeminent financial hub for transition financing” and to “deliver at scale the finance to transition the global economy” to cleaner energy sources, Sharma said in his speech. As Sharma pointed out, it was five years ago almost to the day that a similar event took place in the same building. The UK government, together with the Bank of England, had rallied six times as many people for the launch of what was called the private finance agenda for COP26. That gathering was a more boisterous affair. The room was “packed to the rafters,” Sharma recalled. Mark Carney, then BOE governor, took the stage to interview legendary biologist and broadcaster David Attenborough. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, dialed in. It was “the point at which talk of sustainable finance and climate action moved from being a [corporate social responsibility] issue to being a C-suite issue,” Sharma said. A year later, Carney introduced the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, an industry initiative uniting firms with more than $70 trillion of assets to accelerate the transition to net zero. Much, of course, has changed since then. Starting in December, all of the largest US and Canadian banks began fleeing the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, itself once part of the broader GFANZ framework. And last week, Australia’s Macquarie Group Ltd. said it too was retreating from the coalition. The defections occurred as financial institutions seek to avoid right-wing attacks on sustainability and renewable energy, a US Republican-led war on behalf of the oil industry that’s only intensified with Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The insurance sector’s climate alliance also has been discontinued, while a similar group in the fund-management industry is on pause as it seeks to ensure that it remains “fit for purpose.” There’s “a lot of turmoil,” said Nina Seega, director of the Centre for Sustainable Finance at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. “Rhetoric is shifting and climate denial is becoming much more mainstream, so you then see a shift in the way different financial institutions are dealing with that.” Some are under more pressure than others, she said, but “none are immune.” Last week, a few minutes before Sharma took the microphone to announce the Transition Finance Council’s formation, one chief sustainability officer (CSO) of a large UK-based investment manager was asking attendees who they thought would be the next company to retreat from net zero. The query wasn’t surprising. CSOs face a more difficult landscape these days, what with big firms like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BlackRock Inc. quitting climate-finance groups. On Wednesday, HSBC announced it’s pushed back its deadline to meet a number of key climate targets by two decades. As more companies back away, there are serious questions about the financial industry’s long-term commitment—and capacity—to help slow increasingly catastrophic global warming. Forced to battle headwinds both inside and outside their firms, many CSOs are concerned they may no longer have the full support of their companies and leadership teams. “Finance is being politicized, if not weaponized,” said Clemens Calice, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who set up his own investment and advisory firm, Cygnum Capital. “Companies are under increasing pressure to align with a side or an agenda.” For CSOs, all of this amounts to a “very challenging operating environment,” said James Alexander, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association. Politics and policy have “become much more fractured,” making judgment calls “much harder to make.” At the same time, he said, “if you’re managing money, your responsibility is to consider risks, and sustainability is undeniably one of those risks.” Britain stands out as a rare example of a country that’s advancing on climate action. Seven of the world’s 10 largest economies missed a recent deadline to file updated emissions-saving plans with the United Nations. The UK was the only one to outline a strategy for the next decade that’s anywhere close to consistent with the Paris Agreement target to keep warming below 1.5C. “I’m very pleased to say” that the UK “has a government which recognizes that there is no trade-off between economic growth and the drive to decarbonize the economy,” Sharma said. The country is “uniquely positioned to lead.” (GFANZ is co-chaired by Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, and Mary Schapiro, the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission.) North Carolina-based Duke Energy Corp., one of the biggest US power providers, removed a mention of climate targets in its latest earnings release as the company builds more natural gas plants and even reconsiders its plans for coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. Duke said in its third-quarter earnings release last year that it was “executing an ambitious clean energy transition” and noted its goals to emit net-zero methane by 2030 and net-zero carbon by 2050. But the company’s fourth-quarter release on Thursday, while stating it was “executing an ambitious energy transition,” omitted the word “clean” and left out emissions goals. Though Duke says its strategy hasn’t changed, the move comes as Trump, who previously called climate change a “hoax” though has occasionally modulated that claim since, is nevertheless trying to increase production of fossil fuels while simultaneously seeking to zero-out net-zero policies. Duke said late last year it would consider shifting its plans for coal plants if the US president follows through on his promises to terminate rules governing power-plant pollution.

Title: Wisconsin More Than Doubled BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Holdings to 6M Shares

Time Published: 2025-02-20T15:00:00Z

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun The state’s investment board’s stake is worth more than $340 million at IBIT’s current price of $56.10. Wisconsin’s investment board saw fit to significantly add to its bitcoin (BTC) bet in the last three months of the year. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) disclosed ownership of just over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of the Dec. 31, per a 13F filing on Friday, up from roughly 2.9 million shares three months prior. The position is valued at $340 million at IBIT’s current price of $56.10 and would be worth about $588 million at bitcoin’s current price near $98,000. The fund in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a bitcoin ETF purchase, initially buying 94,562 shares of IBIT and some shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which it later sold. The State of Michigan Retirement System later also reported owning shares of bitcoin ETFs, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and two of Grayscale’s bitcoin products. SWIB, established in 1951, oversees more than $156 billion in assets including funds from the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and the State Investment Fund (SIF). The board manages investments on behalf of state employees and other trust funds. Today marks the deadline for institutional investors managing at least $100 million in assets to report quarterly holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The market is closely monitoring these filings to gauge whether large traditional finance firms have been adding bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios since their launch last year. UPDATE (Feb. 14, 18:49 UTC): Updates current valuation of State of Wisconsin’s stake in IBIT.

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Rhoda Wilson | Feb 20, 2025 | Coincidence, Conspiracy Fact and Theory, Headline News, Health | 2 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Exposé. Bird flu is a rerun of COVID-19. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The pandemic planners have a playbook; they used it for COVID-19 and now they are using it for bird flu, with one difference. With COVID-19, they targeted us directly. With bird flu, they are targeting us indirectly through our food supply. It is currently being claimed that bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry, dairy cows and cats, and has resulted in several human cases in the US, including a recent case in Wyoming. By coincidence, yesterday, the US Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) gave conditional approval for an updated bird flu vaccine for poultry. An outbreak of bird flu at a farm in New Zealand in December resulted in the culling of almost 160,000 hens. But, warned New Zealand’s Biosecurity Minister yesterday, a different strain of the flu was circulating globally and would likely arrive in New Zealand. At the end of January, GAVI “Vaccines Work” was delighted to announce that restrictions had been put in place in the UK to curb the spread of bird flu. Almost 1.8 million farmed and captive birds have been culled in the past three months due to avian flu outbreaks across the UK. Reuters reported yesterday that there has been an outbreak of bird flu in Canada. And so, it goes on. Countries’ pandemic-vaccine industries are moving in lockstep, just as they did with COVID-19. In the following, Clayton Baker explains more about their pandemic playbook, which they used for COVID-19 and are now using for bird flu. “Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it,” he writes. Although he refers to the pandemic industry in the USA, similar can be applied worldwide. Bird Flu Is a Rerun of the Covid Playbook By Clayton J. Baker as published by Brownstone Institute Bird flu can be very confusing. This is true because, as is so often the case with our government, those who claim to be trying to solve the problem – our so-called “public health” and “pandemic preparedness” “experts” – are actually the ones who created the problem. What is worse, they are actively seeking to perpetuate it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the laboratory-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS-CoV-2, was leaked from a laboratory. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the laboratory leak by denying its occurrence while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing, along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now with H5N1 bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, Georgia. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other laboratories. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatises farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyses decision-makers and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.TheCDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing Health and Human Services (“HHS”) agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the covid era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s biography shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Georgia, should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. 6. The Kawaoka Bird flu laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. 7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. People such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (“OPPR”).Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 million bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled. 10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognise what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

DiLorenzo | Feb 21, 2025 | 1 Comment This article was originally published by Thomas J. DiLorenzo at The Mises Institute. When... Since Trump is intent on issuing as many executive orders as he can, why hasn’t he ordered USDA to stop testing chickens for the (figmentary) bird flu? Not only is that rogue agency culling entire flocks for just one “asymptomatic” positive PCR test, they’re using it as an excuse to cull the flocks of commercial farms within 5-7 miles of the PCR positive flock. Trump’s failure to stop the psychopaths from executing the Covid script against our nation’s poultry farmers is the reason for the eggflation. Now the script has extended to PCR testing cattle, which means higher beef prices are no doubt ahead. SB, its a chess game. My theory is that Trump is letting this kind of stuff (which terrifies the ignorant, the same ones that oppose his efforts) so much of his opposition (press?) is occupied with this stuff and have even more trouble keeping up with and criticizing Trump’s waste and fraud cleansing efforts. I’ve thought on this a while and wondered the same. I think Trump is allowing this to confuse and terrify his enemies. So many are worried about the bird flu and their attention is split away from TDS activities. You must be logged in to post a comment.

Top mutual fund manager Vanguard has paused meetings with portfolio companies while it reviews the impact of new guidance on investor activism from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the matter. In a recent notice, the SEC, whose acting chair was appointed by President Donald Trump, revised its “beneficial ownership reporting” interpretations in ways that could put new burdens on firms like Vanguard that now rely on the SEC’s Schedule 13G form to report major holdings. Going forward, the SEC said managers may need to use the more complex Schedule 13D, which would increase their costs, if they pressure management on matters like climate questions or whether a company has a staggered board or poison pill takeover defenses. Vanguard put the pause in place because it is “trying to process and understand the new guidelines so they can remain a 13G filer and not a 13D filer,” said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Ending the meetings could reduce the power of shareholder activists focused on environmental, social or governance questions, corporate attorneys say, the apparent goal of the SEC’s current leadership. But it could also diminish the input that executives receive from top investors on more traditional corporate questions like executive pay. A Vanguard representative did not respond to questions on Tuesday. Rival asset manager BlackRock had also paused meetings with some of its portfolio companies. A company representative did not immediately comment on the status of these meetings on Tuesday.

February 19, 2025 1:42pm by Barry Ritholtz At The Money: Jeff Hirsch Why Big Federal Spending Plus Inflation = “Superbooms” (February, 19 2025) Wars, national defense spending, technology innovations – historically, these have had big impacts on the economy. The result: A spike in inflation and a huge surge in market prices. How can you take advantage of these Superbooms? Full transcript below. ~~~ Jeffrey Hirsch is editor of the Stock Trader’s Almanac & Almanac Investor Newsletter. For more info, see: Professional website LinkedIn Twitter ~~~ Find all of the previous At the Money episodes here, and in the MiB feed on Apple Podcasts, YouTube, Spotify, and Bloomberg. And find the entire musical playlist of all the songs I have used on At the Money on Spotify TRANSCRIPT: Musical Intro: My feet go boom boom boom Boom boom boom, boom boom boom My heart beats boom boom boom Boom boom boom, boom boom boom The newly elected president, even before he was sworn in, threatened to take over Greenland, recapture the Panama Canal, and to make Canada the 51st state. I’m Barry Ritholtz and on today’s edition of At The Money, we’re going to discuss whether this saber rattling has implications for your portfolio. To help us understand all of this and its implications for your portfolio, let’s bring in Jeff Hirsch, editor in chief of Stock Trader’s Almanac and author of 2011’s Superboom, why the Dow Jones will hit 38, 820 and how you can profit from it. (Full disclosure, Jeff wrote a piece, I want to say it was like 2010, talking about the upcoming Superboom driven by the combination of war and inflation and basically said the data suggests we should hit 39,000 by 2025. And I called him out on this nonsense. This is the single craziest thing I had. And by the time you and I finished that conversation and you showed me the data was overwhelming. Not, only did you convince me, but I wrote the forward to that book that ended up coming out in 2011. So let’s discuss what war plus inflation means. In the late 1970s, your dad very famously said the combination of the Vietnam war and the oil embargo driven inflation was going to lead to a 500 percent bull market, which kind of shocked everybody when he came out with it, but that analysis turned out to be exactly right. Explain the thinking behind this. Jeff Hirsch: Yeah, we’ve still got some of the old 3420 t shirts, Dow 3420 t shirts. But yeah, that’s right. In 76, founder of the Almanac, my late great father, Yale Hirsch, discovered this amazing perennial pattern and how this phenomena is based upon the exorbitant government spending, creates high inflation, and how the subsequent decline of purchasing power, the dollar, drives the market to Heights. You yourself, were incredulous at the time, cycles based on the previous moves from, from World War One, World War Two in Vietnam, which is what Yale was keen on. And, um, the associated massive, uh, government spending and the inflation caused by it. And then the subsequent version that you were writing about was, Iraq and Afghanistan. And there was some surges of inflation during the financial crisis, kind of eased back when, when the Fed took rates down to zero. Tell us a little bit about what you were looking at in 2010 that said, hey, we could get to 39,000 in 15 years. Jeff Hirsch: I remember, you know what? I remember your actual post. I think the headline was WTF. Barry Ritholtz: That’s right. We were about 10, 000 on the Dow at that time. You were calling for going from 10 to almost 40. It felt like it was ridiculous. Jeff Hirsch: I mean, we had Yale’s work behind us. Um, that amazing chart that I, that I redid of his, where it shows the, you know, uh, it’s the log chart of the Dow, which shows the inflation, the CPI and the moves, I mean, there’s, There was some, you know, people talk about these cycles with, you know, the 17 and a half year, the 18 years, they talk about these Sort of arbitrary length of time. We looked at it and what Yale discovered was that these events in history that that create these, these cycles, like Archduke Ferdinand getting assassinated in 1914, the Germany signed the armistice in 2018. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 64, Saigon falling in 75, and then for us currently, what we were seeing in 2010 was this development of after 9/11, which was an act of war, and ahead of the time, we were looking at, we had already gone into Afghanistan, we were, the whole, uh, saber rattling, there was a “buy buy buy“ we put out in 22 when we, in 02, excuse me, when we went in there. But,we were looking for the end of this, this huge military involvement overseas. U. S. boots on the ground in massive numbers is what created this pattern or initially created it. and we were looking for the end of the combat in Afghanistan to sort of spark the end of the the secular bear market and the beginning of the boom. And I think we all kind of have, have looked back a little hindsight around 2013. I think that little bear market bottom in, in 15 and 16 kind of, you know, signifies the end of that, that secular bear, not the ultimate bottom. I mean, we don’t measure the secular bear market from ‘74 to 2000 measure for ‘82. Barry Ritholtz: Right, that was the new highs that were set and arguably this cycle new highs were set in 2013 that eclipsed ‘07 and 2000. I recall early on in, um, the COVID crisis and the first CARES Act and I read a fascinating analysis that pointed out the, the fiscal stimulus of CARES Act 1 and 2 was about 10% of GDP. I think it was just CARES Act 1, about 10% of GDP. You had to go all the way back to World War II and then after that, the Marshall Plan to see 10% of GDP as a fiscal stimulus. And I wonder how that equates to the equivalent of war plus the obvious subsequent inflation we experienced in 2021, 22, 23. Is the quote unquote war on COVID very parallel to what we’ve seen in the past? Jeff Hirsch: 100 percent very parallel. And, and that’s something we’ve spoken about. And it’s really about overall federal spending. I mean, the evolution of this pattern of federal spending, it’s not just war, but spikes, like you just mentioned in federal spending, like we had in COVID where it goes above trend. This probably started to change a little bit going back to FDR with the New Deal ahead of World War II and then the federal interstate highway system spending continued after World War Two. Um, so it’s, it’s really about, you know, past federal spending driven by war conflicts. You know, but spending outside of the normal budget and COVID and the, you know, inflation reduction act, the cares act are prime examples of massive government spending, driving inflation. Barry Ritholtz: It’s a new era. It’s a new presidency. Uh, there has been emphasis on things like military spending, energy production, space exploration. They’re carrying over the previous emphasis on AI and data center builds. How do you look at that? How does federal policy and spending in those areas seem parallel to past military spendings? How does that affect your your projections? Jeff Hirsch: It’s quite parallel. It’s part of my projections. I mean, we’ve updated our superboon forecast. I think we’ve got some further upside to you know, 62, 000 and change which I’ve written about probably by, you know, average 10% gain a year probably by 2030. But that’s all Dow based because it was what starts on but right now, you know, it’s it’s about tech. It’s all about tech. Ukraine and Israel have shown us and proven that the conflict is all about tech now. You’ve got drones and cyber wars. I’d expect the U S military to be spending, and ramping up tech, um, so all that military spending, you may find its way into technology. I mean, I let’s call it defense tech. Barry Ritholtz: And you, you see that in companies like Palantir and Lockheed, not just drones, but signal jamming, and there’s just an endless array of security, it’s clearly causing a big boom in fiscal spending, but let’s bring this back to the newly elected President Trump. Canada, Greenland, Panama . . . Canada! I keep, I can’t believe we’re talking about Canada! So, so that sort of saber rattling, Do you need a hot war for this same thing to take effect? Or do you just need the government’s fiscal spending and the threat of war to lead this to the same sort of cycle? Jeff Hirsch: I think it’s not so much the threat of war, it’s overall federal spending. And, you know, saber rattling, yeah, it’s saber rattling. I’m not convinced anything is going to happen there per se, but it’s really about the spending in general. And if we’re going to be doing deals with Greenland, for security and raw materials, that would be beneficial. We’ve got China doing deals in Africa and around the world. There’s definitely a new push for, for global, you know, security and global dominance. And we’ve got to play in that field. And, and, and Trump’s kind of showing, doing a show of strength, but he’s a deal maker, whether we, you know, you like the man or not, or voted for him or not. He’s going to try to do everything in his power to leave a legacy, like we spoke about previously of a prosperous economy, a raging bull market and global peace and security is what. He’s going to try to do, and that’s going to help our economy. All the spending, whether it’s Stargate or military or otherwise, is going to create jobs and keep the economy going. I mean, it’s really all about the economy as Jim Carville likes to say. Barry Ritholtz: It’s the economy, stupid. So, so let’s look at sectors. We’ve mentioned defense. What about energy? What about consumer staples? Is there any specific sector effect to this war plus inflation long term cycle? Jeff Hirsch: I think it’s tech. I really think it’s tech. You’re talking about, uh, uh, You know, drones, robotics, AI, uh, energy for sure, because we’ve got to power everything. Um, I actually currently have a position in, in the gas and energy you know, explorers and producers, the, the, the equipment people there, the XCS, XLE. It’s a seasonal trade for us as well. I’m not sure staples is the place to be, but, you know general retail and buying of things is up, but I think energy and tech and all this new technology that, that is, that we’re fighting wars with, that we’re operating everything on is, is where it’s at. I mean, you got to own the Qs basically. Right, the Q’s, there’s a BlackRock ETF, um, run by the guy who’s running their technology group for a long time. I want to say it’s their Artificial Intelligence ETF, the symbol is BAI, and I don’t know, some crazy chunk of it is NVIDIA. Microsoft and then everybody else in that space and it’s sort of like a Qs on steroids It’s like 2x Qs Jeff Hirsch: Then there’s the health care AI. We just heard, uh, you know Altman and Ellison talking about it, you know in the White House with Trump there It’s hopefully it’ll help us Barry Ritholtz: Sam Altman from open AI and Larry Ellison from Oracle Jeff Hirsch: how we can cure cancer and do Disease analysis. There’s a small microcap stock. I have that’s trying to do medical You know, AI to, to better diagnose and get you better proper treatments and identify things with all your numbers, you know, medical data, as you know, is still analog, huge, but it’s, it’s not quite digitized enough yet. So that’s, I think there’s some future there. So add that to the list of technologies is, you know, medical and healthcare AI. Barry Ritholtz: So to wrap up, we have a massive shift from just monetary policy, uh, in the 2010s following the financial crisis to the COVID spend, the military buildup, the AI buildup, the energy buildup. These are all policies and sectors of the economy that have been running for decades. fairly hot for the past five or so years. The new administration is expected to really supercharge this. And if historical patterns hold up, according to Jeff Hirsch of the Stock Traders Almanac, we could see this market continuing to rally for the rest of the decade, somewhere in the high single digits, low double digits. Is that a fair way to describe your perspective? Jeff Hirsch: For sure. Think about AI and all the related tech. about where we were in like ‘92 to 95 with windows 95. Early internet days. My look, my view is that we’re kind of at that period of time in this technological boom. I remember the other part of the superboom equation that I added to it on top of war and inflation and peace was the culturally enabling paradigm shifting technology. Which AI and all of its related ancillary items that we, that we spoke about are part of. And I think we’re at that, you know, early, mid-nineties timeframe. Barry Ritholtz: So to wrap up, if you’re a long term investor and you are constructive about both the economy and the market. You should be looking at sectors like defense and energy and technology.

Title: Ireland under-20 coach Neil Doak makes two changes for Wales clash

Full Content:
Ireland head coach Neil Doak has made two changes and a positional switch to the starting team that beat Scotland for Friday night’s Under-20 Six Nations Championship clash with Wales at Rodney Parade (7.45). Cork Constitution’s Eoghan Smyth returns to the side having started in the defeat against England before being sprung from the bench against Scotland. His robust defence and straight running were missed in Edinburgh. Smyth resumes his midfield partnership with one of Ireland’s outstanding players to date, Connor Fahy, who switches back to outside centre. Gene O’Leary Kareem reverts to the replacements. The other change is in the frontrow where Ballynahinch tighthead Tom McAllister gets a chance in the run-on team, swapping places with Blackrock’s Alex McMullan, another standout player, who is on the bench. The other alterations to the replacements see UCD hooker Mikey Yarr, who played last year, return after recovering from injury. Highfield’s Conor Kennelly comes in for a try scorer the last day, Shannon’s Oisín Minogue, while Tom Wood, a son of former Lions and Ireland hooker Keith, is included in the matchday 23 for the first time. Several Ireland players have received a vote of confidence from the coaching team despite lapses in individual, and indeed the collective, performances to date and will need to repay that faith with greater clarity, precision and execution on both sides of the ball. Ireland assistant coach Andrew Browne, who won a Grand Slam at this age-grade as a player in 2007, admitted that the group had spoken about being sharper mentally and physically. “In the England game we had a lot of possession, a lot of 22 entries, [that] we just didn’t convert. We were inaccurate, which was really disappointing. “In the Scotland game we started really well and then tailed off a little bit. Then into the second half, they started the stronger and that’s something we have reviewed, how we came out in that second half because they got that momentum at the end of the first half. We did manage to redress it a little bit, but how can we be more consistent? “We talk about being relentless, we talk about being ruthless and how can we actually live [up] to those words a little bit more. That’s something we have addressed over the last couple of weeks. So, hopefully we can see a bit more of it come Friday night.” On the changes to the team, Browne explained that they wanted to have a look at a few players in a slightly different capacity, including Wood. “Tom’s a really good player. I know he’s under-19, but he was in various camps. We get to see Tom now in a competitive game, a competitive environment; it just builds that strength and depth which you’re always looking for.” Fullback Todd Lawlor is due to play an AIL match in the next couple of weeks having recovered from shoulder surgery, but it is unlikely that wing Derry Moloney, prop Niall Smyth, secondrow Alan Spicer and backrow Luke Murphy will be fit in time to play a part in the tournament, while Alex Usanov won’t. Wales beat Italy 20-18 at the Stade Comunale di Monigo last time out having lost to France in their opening game of the tournament. IRELAND UNDER-20: D Green (QUB); C Molony (UCD), C Fahy (Clontarf), E Smyth (Cork Constitution), C Mangan (Blackrock College); S Wisniewski (Old Belvedere), C Logan (QUB); B Bohan (Galway Corinthians), H Walker (QUB), T McAllister (Ballynahinch); M Ronan (Old Wesley), B Corrigan (Old Wesley); M Foy (UCC), B Power (Galwegians), É McCarthy (Galwegians, capt). Replacements: M Yarr (Lansdowne), P Moore (Blackrock College), A Mullan (Blackrock College), C Kennelly (Highfield), D Walsh (Terenure College), W Wootton (Sale Sharks), T Wood (Garryowen), G O’Leary Kareem (UCC).

Title: Trump’s SEC Leader Shifts Power From Investors to Boardrooms
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2025/02/19/812475.htm
Time Published: 2025-02-19T16:10:44Z

New policies from the top U.S. securities regulator hand corporate boards more power over investors in ways that could curtail investor-initiated reform efforts on everything from climate policy to director contests, experts say. Since last month when U.S. President Donald Trump named Mark Uyeda acting chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency has made it easier for boards to block shareholder resolutions, put stricter filing requirements on passive funds, and limit investors’ communication abilities. The changes give directors more scope to nix efforts to have companies limit emissions or report workforce diversity details, while traditional activists running their own director slates could also find it harder to challenge boards, attorneys say. “It’s a relatively dramatic reallocation of power away from large shareholders back to corporate management, not just to make corporate policy but to protect themselves against activists,” said Tulane University business law professor Ann Lipton. Uyeda and other Republican officials – including Paul Atkins, Trump’s pick to run the SEC – have made clear their skepticism of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment considerations. “Shareholder meetings were not intended under state corporate laws to be political battlegrounds or debating societies,” Uyeda said in a 2023 speech. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Atkins did not respond to questions sent via his current firm. FEWER BALLOT ITEMS The SEC’s changes are in line with other Trump administration efforts such as dismantling diversity programs and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement. ESG resolutions drew significant support in 2021 and 2022, but less so since. In a February 11 legal bulletin the SEC made it easier for companies to skip votes on the resolutions such as by claiming the proposals “micromanage” their businesses. That change could make it harder for ESG-minded activists even to start talks with corporate executives. “If it’s harder to get your resolution through at the SEC, it will be harder to do that kind of work,” said Rick Alexander, CEO of the Shareholder Commons, which tracks and writes resolutions. On Feb. 11, the SEC also revised “beneficial ownership reporting” interpretations to broaden the requirements on firms like asset managers BlackRock and Vanguard, which often rely on the SEC’s Schedule 13G form to report major holdings. Going forward, the agency tightened when managers can use the form rather than the more complex Schedule 13D, which would increase their costs. A new SEC test is if a company “exerts pressure on management” such as tying director votes to whether a company has a staggered board or poison pill takeover defenses. Proxy voting policies of both BlackRock and Vanguard suggest those circumstances could lead to critical votes. BlackRock and Vanguard declined to comment. BlackRock temporarily paused meetings with some portfolio companies as of Tuesday with an eye on the new rules. Jessica Strine, CEO of shareholder advisory firm Jasper Street Partners, said the SEC’s new interpretation could have a potential downside for companies as well if they cannot know what their top investors think. “It’s not a complete gift to management teams if it means they no longer have engagement opportunities with their top shareholders,” she said. “That means they don’t get to make their case” before votes are cast at annual meetings on matters like executive compensation. Caroline Crenshaw, currently the lone Democratic member of the SEC via e-mail said the change could chill the big funds’ outreach. “The interpretation muddies the waters for institutional investors, with the unstated goal of dissuading them from engaging with corporations. At bottom, this policy is bad for capital formation,” Crenshaw said. COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN A third change involves new guidance on when investors can use the SEC’s electronic records system to distribute so-called “exempt solicitations,” or communications with other shareholders. Once meant as a tool to reveal closed-door discussions among bigger institutional holders, smaller investors started filing their own exempt solicitations as a cheap way to make their arguments on issues like whether to oppose a certain director or support a shareholder resolution. In a January 27 update the SEC narrowed their permissible use. The documents are “not intended to be the means through which a person disseminates written soliciting material to security holders,” the SEC said, but rather only to notify the public of written materials sent to security holders through other means. For Tom Quaadman, Senior Vice President for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a top business lobbying group, the SEC’s changes were welcome. “You’re seeing a rebalancing of SEC policies and rules that are designed to take out special interest activism and bring things back to a focus on investor return,” he said.

HOUSE PRICES CLIMBED last year at almost double the growth rate seen in 2023, leaving prices 16.8% higher than at the peak of the Celtic Tiger property boom in 2007. According to new figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO), residential property prices increased by 8.7% in the 12 months to December last year, up from 4.4% the previous year. House prices in Dublin rose by 8.3% in December, with prices outside of the capital up by 9%. The median, or mid-point, price of a house purchased in the year to December was €355,000, compared to €327,500 in December 2023. In the year to December, house prices in Dublin rose by 8.7% while apartment prices increased by 6.9%. The highest house price growth in Dublin was in Fingal at 10%, with South Dublin seeing a rise of 6.9%. Outside Dublin, house prices were up by 9.3% and apartment prices increased by 5.8%. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Border (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo) at 14.2%. At the other end of the scale, the Mid-East (Kildare, Louth, Meath, and Wicklow) saw a 5.9% growth in price. The figures show that 5,177 property purchases by households at market prices were filed with Revenue last December, an increase of 2.3% when compared with the 5,063 purchases in December 2023. Advertisement The lowest median price for a house was €182,250 in Longford, while the highest median price was €660,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to December was A94 ‘Blackrock’ with a median price of €730,000, while H23 ‘Clones’ had the least expensive price of €131,000. Looking at the full year, the median price paid by households for a house was €355,000, compared with €259,000 in 2019, and €155,000 in 2013. A total of 48,775 dwelling purchases by households at market prices were filed with Revenue in 2024. This represents a 2.9% decrease compared with 50,234 purchases in 2023. The annual national index for 2024 reached a value of 183.4, which is 12.7% higher than it was for 2007 when it reached a peak of 162.7. Overall, prices of new dwellings have risen by 130.2% from their trough in the middle of 2013. Prices of existing dwellings are now 161.6% higher than at their trough in 2012. Commenting on today’s figures, senior mortgage advisor with NFP Ireland Gerry Griffin said affordability is an increasing challenge, particularly for first-time buyers. “While the pace of price increases has slowed slightly, demand remains strong, and supply is still struggling to keep up,”Griffin said. He said that if the European Central Bank proceeds with an expected interest rate cut in March, mortgage rates could fall, boosting borrowing power. “While this would benefit buyers, it could also drive further price inflation by increasing competition for available homes,” he said.

Even with lower interest rates, repayments will still be substantial given the high price levels. “For policymakers, the focus must remain on delivering more housing at a faster pace to balance the market and prevent additional pressure on prices.” Rachel McGovern, deputy chief executive at Brokers Ireland, said prices rose last year “at levels beyond what most industry commentators expected. “These levels are not sustainable except for those on high salaries and those wealthy enough to not be dependent upon mortgage finance,” she said. “There are appalling consequences for our society if policymakers don’t turn around housing in the near future and ensure that those on average incomes can achieve the ambition of owning a home. “We would call on the Government to be brave and decisive and not let another year pass before it acts on the recommendations of the Housing Commission in particular,” she said. Earlier this week, Cabinet approved €450 million in funding that is set to provide 3,000 cost rental, affordable and social homes over three years. However, Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin said the government is allocating less capital funding for social and affordable housing in 2025 that it spent in 2024.

Franklin Templeton, a major global asset manager, said Wednesday it has launched its tokenized U.S. Treasury fund in Luxembourg, expanding access to European institutional investors. The launch of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund marks the first Luxembourg-domiciled fund investing in U.S. government securities that's fully tokenized, the asset manager claimed in a press release. This means shares in the fund are recorded and transferred on the blockchain rather than through traditional processes, using Franklin Templeton's proprietary blockchain-based transfer agency platform for handling transactions to offer enhanced efficiency, transparency and security. The fund is available on the Stellar network (XLM) for institutional investors in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, following regulatory approval in October by Luxembourg regulators. The U.S.-registered version of the fund has attracted over $580 million of assets since its 2021 debut and is limited to U.S.-based investors only, per rwa.xyz data. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries have been at the forefront of red-hot real-world asset tokenization efforts, growing into a $4 billion asset class this year. Franklin Templeton was the first among traditional financial institutions to release such a product, and its the third largest tokenized treasury fund by assets under management behind Hashnote's USYC and BUIDL, issued by BlackRock and Securitize.

Title: Vanguard, BlackRock, And Citadel Now Hold 7.8 Million Additional Shares In Trump Media And Technology Group (DJT), With The Company Reporting Actual Billings Of Just ~$200,000 For 2024

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. When some of the biggest asset managers in the world start gobbling up shares of a company that barely makes any money, one is compelled to pause for a bit and wonder: "what do they know that I don't?" Look no further than Trump Media and Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) as an emblematic example of this phenomenon. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Trump Media and Technology Group is the parent entity of the Truth Social platform, the Truth Plus content streaming service, and the soon-to-be-launched asset management and ETF service under the Truth.Fi banner. Despite its growing product portfolio, the company has yet to show any material earnings. For the year that ended on the 31st of December, Trump Media and Technology Group reported just $3.6 million in sales. What's more, when you remove the amortization of deferred revenue from this figure, actual billings for the year amount to just ~$200,000 (unearned revenue on the balance sheet declined from $4.41 million to 1.01 million by the end of 2024, implying unearned revenue recognition of $3.4 million vs. reported sales of $3.6 million). Nonetheless, Trump Media and Technology Group does have one thing going for it: its gigantic post-SPAC-merger cash balance. And, the company is now beginning to deploy its copious cash coffers to bolster its earnings. As we previously reported, Trump Media's board has now approved the diversion of up to $250 million from its current reserve of around $700 million in cash and cash equivalents towards setting up customized Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) and ETFs, including one dedicated to Bitcoin, under the Truth.Fi banner and in partnership with Charles Schwab and Yorkville advisors. Coming back, the requisite Form 13-F filings for the previous quarter - which are now available for public scrutiny - contained a shocker: Vanguard, BlackRock, and Citadel increased their stake in Trump Media and Technology Group by a combined 7.8 million shares, and this is before the launch of the company's asset management service under the Truth.Fi banner. Of course, it is quite likely that these asset managers were simply betting on President Trump's star power to drive further gains. After all, DJT is not a stock that trades on fundamentals. Meanwhile, in another unusual development, Trump Media and Technology Group has now sued a Brazilian supreme court judge in Miami for illegally censoring right-wing voices on social media. The judge in question is currently overseeing a number of investigations into the affairs of the former Brazilian president and a staunch Trump ally, Jair Bolsonaro.

Title: Scalable Capital to open access to private equity

With a new segment on its digital investment platform, Scalable Capital is setting new standards for investors: Soon, suitable investors in Germany will get access to alternative investments such as private equity. 0 19 February 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Through the Scalable Broker, they will be able to invest in companies that are not listed on stock exchanges for the first time. Until now, benefiting from this additional return and diversification potential has been primarily reserved for professional investors. At the start of the new offer, Scalable Capital is the first digital investment platform to offer access to the BlackRock Private Equity Fund. The fund is managed by BlackRock, one of the world's leading private markets investors trusted to manage 450 billion US dollars in alternative assets.(1) After a minimum one-off investment from 10,000 euros, the fund is also available in a savings plan. There are no front-end loads for the fund. This is a further step in the endeavour to open up the entire investment spectrum to long-term oriented investors for their financial future."As alternative investments such as private equity are becoming increasingly relevant for participation in economic growth, we now make them accessible to our investors," says Julius Weller, Vice President Broker at Scalable Capital. "With the expansion of our investment platform to include this segment, clients gain access to the high return potential of private companies. We also achieve the favourable terms and simple handling for private equity that Scalable Capital is known for."An attractive, strongly growing investment market outside of the stock exchangesGlobally, the vast majority (88%) of companies with a turnover of more than 100 million US dollars is privately held - hence not listed.(2) Making these companies investable creates a huge new investment universe that could continue to grow in the coming years, as the share of listed companies has been continuously declining for two decades. In Europe, the number of listed companies has fallen by almost 23% since 2009, while the number of private companies has risen by over 17%.(3) Germany showcases a distinct extreme in relation to this development. Here, over 98% of companies with more than 100 million euro turnover are privately owned.(4) These include numerous ‘hidden champions’ that are global market leaders in their field and represent the strength and innovative power of mid-market enterprises. Companies worldwide instead of going public prefer to remain private completely or significantly longer than before and are increasingly financing themselves via private equity. One reason for this shift is the growing need for long-term financing that private equity can offer, to adapt to advancements like artificial intelligence; additionally, accessing this capital has become more attainable. Private equity also offers more flexibility in the development of business models and strategies, contrary to what was often assumed in the past. As a result, a large part of economic value creation is shifting to the private markets. Their invested volume almost quadrupled globally between 2013 and 2023 to USD 15 trillion and is expected to rise further to USD 29 trillion by 2030.(5) Accordingly, the demand for private equity is increasing, as the asset class offers suitable investors additional investment opportunities to diversify their portfolio with high return potential. For investors who have a long investment horizon, not needing to access their money in the short term and with the corresponding risk capacity, private equity has achieved 14.9% annual growth in US dollars over the past 20 years - outperforming the popular MSCI World Index.(6) In the context of asset allocation, analyses from the BlackRock Investment Institute indicate that a mix of private market investments can be sensible at up to 20% of a portfolio. Such an allocation to a traditional portfolio with 60% stocks and 40% bonds shows a better risk-return profile in historical comparison: the expected return increases from 5.5% to 7.2% over a ten-year period, while the risk disproportionately rises from 11.3% to 12.7%.(7) This return potential is now made available to Scalable Capital clients with the respective risk capacity. Long-standing expertise in modern fund structureThe BlackRock Private Equity Fund focuses on co-investments in which majority stakes in private companies around the world are acquired together with an established network of leading private equity managers (so-called buyouts). In order to make such long-term investments in the real economy accessible to suitable investors, the European Commission created a regulation called the European long-term investment funds (ELTIF) in 2015 and recently simplified it further. Contrary to many previous private equity funds, which were mostly closed, this fund is structured as an open-end fund. This means that investors are more flexible in terms of the time of their investment and can redeem invested capital more regularly as with closed-end funds after the second anniversary of the fund’s launch date. Returns and dividends are reinvested by the fund which may result in higher compound interest and higher returns in the long term. BlackRock has more than two decades of experience in investing in the private equity asset class on behalf of its clients. The co-investment approach enables lower costs relative to similar funds and broad diversification across sectors, investment periods and regions. Fund assets can be invested quickly thanks to broad market access. Co-investments also offer the advantage that several investors thoroughly check and analyse which companies to invest in.Christian Bimueller, Head of Digital Distribution Continental Europe at BlackRock: “We’re very excited to introduce our new Private Equity solution onto Scalable Capital’s investment platform, allowing wealth investors in Germany digital access to BlackRock’s private markets capabilities for the first time. With private companies increasingly driving economic growth, we are offering a unique opportunity for long-term investors to unlock potential returns blending with traditional public markets. By breaking down barriers to investing in private assets, we are enabling wealth investors to diversify their portfolios and access institutional-quality private market investments in a digital format.”Simple investment in private equity through seamless integration into the Scalable BrokerAlternative investments will be seamlessly integrated into the Scalable Broker. The access happens conveniently via the app, where manual and postal steps are no longer required. Investors in alternative investments can also expect automatic offsetting of capital gains against loss pots and exemption orders as natural as for all other securities. Scalable Capital has added numerous functions to its platform specifically for the new asset class: the fully digitalised suitability check, a two-week revocation option for purchase orders and a comprehensive range of information to make an informed assessment of the long-term investment on offer.New asset class first in the Scalable BrokerInterested parties in Germany can from now on sign up to a waiting list to receive regular updates until the planned start in April. They will also receive information on private markets investments and be the first to find out when the BlackRock Private Equity Fund will be available in the Scalable Broker.Shares can be redeemed for the first time two years after the fund's launch. After that, a sale is possible in general once a quarter. Due to the long-term nature of the investments, the total of redemptions are limited to 5% of the fund volume. There are no front-end loads nor redemption fees. The management fee for the actively managed fund is 1.95% p.a. If the fund exceeds its minimum return, the fund manager also receives a performance-related profit share.

In a meeting with the country’s top bankers, the Chancellor set out a plan to speed up settlement of securities trades which will make the UK’s capital markets more competitive to drive economic growth through the Plan for Change and put more money into people’s pockets. 0 19 February 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. The top brass from JP Morgan, Blackrock, Abrdn, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Fidelity, and Schroders were welcomed into No11 Downing Street for breakfast this morning, as part of ongoing engagement with industry to hone the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy - one of the eight key growth sectors identified in the Modern Industrial Strategy.Rachel Reeves spoke about the importance of going further and faster to drive growth and revealed that the Government had accepted all recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group - confirming that the UK will move to a ‘T+1’ standard for settling securities trades from 11 October 2027.The change means that a typical securities trade, such as buying and selling shares, would be settled the day after it is agreed - instead of the current two-day standard. Faster settlement will support economic growth by putting the UK at the forefront of modernised, highly efficient and automated capital markets, bringing the UK into line with key international markets such as the US and reducing costs for investors by limiting risks when making trades.Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said: I am determined to go further and faster to drive growth and put more money into people’s pockets through our Plan for Change. Speeding up the settlement of trades makes our financial markets more efficient and internationally competitive.Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, Nikhil Rathi said: We highlighted how the move to T+1 will make our markets more efficient and support growth in our recent letter to the Prime Minister. We will support industry as they move to T+1 and expect firms to engage and plan early.Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey said: Shortening the UK securities settlement cycle to T+1 will bring important financial stability benefits from reduced counterparty credit risk in financial markets. It is important that firms and settlement infrastructures have robust plans for an orderly transition in October 2027. As part of this effort, the Bank looks forward to continuing dialogue with regulators in other markets which are pursuing similar changes.The government has accepted all the recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group, which has created a detailed implementation plan to ensure a smooth transition to T+1, and confirmed that it will bring forward legislation to implement the change, including setting the date to move to the new standard. Terms of Reference have been published for the next phase of the project, which will continue to be led by the industry taskforce with Andrew Douglas as chair and HMT, the FCA and the Bank as observers. Industry chairs from the EU and Switzerland have also been invited to observe the UK industry taskforce to encourage alignment across Europe.The taskforce will oversee and manage implementation of the recommendations up until T+1 is successfully implemented, and for a short period afterwards to evaluate the short-term impacts.The government, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England support the industry recommendation to move to T+1 settlement in UK markets by 11 October 2027 and call on the industry to engage with the recommendations and start their planning as soon as possible.Notes to editors Stakeholder commentary:Tiina Lee, Chief Executive Officer of Citi UK said: We welcome the move to a T+1 settlement cycle in UK markets and appreciate the hard work in achieving the alignment of timelines with the EU. Based on Citi’s experience with global investors, coordinated market reforms are critical to the growth and competitiveness of the UK. We look forward to working with other industry participants to ensure a smooth transition in October 2027.Conor Hillery, Deputy CEO & Head of Investment Banking in EMEA, JP Morgan, said: We welcome the Chancellor’s continued dialogue with UK financial services on its role in facilitating growth, which requires the right policy and regulatory framework. This move to a modern T+1 settlement cycle will contribute to keeping London as a competitive financial centre, so we support the government’s efforts to make it happen.Clare Woodman, Head of EMEA and CEO of Morgan Stanley said: We welcome the UK Government’s commitment to move to a T+1 settlement cycle in October 2027. The shift to a shorter settlement cycle will generate market efficiencies supporting the competitiveness of UK markets.Additional notes: The Accelerated Settlement Taskforce recommended that the UK should move to T+1 by the end of 2027. The Technical Group was set up to recommend a detailed implementation plan, including determining the detailed technical and operational changes needed to move to T+1 as well as recommending a precise implementation date. The group’s recommendations are set out in The Accelerated Settlement Taskforce Technical Group report, published on 6 February.

Title: Germany Goes To The Polls On The 23rd February

BERLIN, GERMANY - FEBRUARY 03: Friedrich Merz, chancellor candidate and leader of the Christian ... [+] Democrats (CDU), speaks to delegates at a CDU party congress on February 03, 2025 in Berlin, Germany. The congress is taking place following Merz's recent controversial move in the Bundestag, in which he sought to push through legislation on immigration and security, knowing it depended on support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Germany faces snap parliamentary elections on February 23. (Photo by Maja Hitij/Getty Images) We are now a few days away from the German general election (February 23), which is becoming even more significant in the context of the Munich Peace Conference where pronouncements from America officials that the U.S. is pushing Europe to take a greater role in its defense (and in that of Ukraine), and in particular the courting of the far-right AfD by both Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, have proven highly controversial. As we write the center-right CDU has close to 30% in polls, the AfD has 21%, the SDP 15% and the Greens are on 13%. My sense is that the next Chancellor will be Friedrich Merz, the leader of the CDU (allied to the CSU in the south of Germany), and he will lead a coalition, most likely made up of the Social Democrats – where Olaf Scholz might be deposed as leader (by Boris Pistorius) if that party does not perform well. It is possible, given their hawkish stance on Russia that the Green party might also be part of the coalition. At the same time, it is not clear whether the FDP — currently a coalition partner, will garner enough votes to take part in parliament, and the same is true to the far-left, nationalist Sahra Wagenknecht party. The context to the election is important. Germany’s economy has been moribund – weighed down by the shock of the war in Ukraine, a muddled energy policy, the constraints that planning laws put on urban development and a growing debate on immigration, amidst several terror attacks. The economy, immigration and to a lesser extent military spending are the main issues in the campaign. In particular, Merz — a corporate lawyer and former chairman of BlackRock in Germany — has recently upped the ante on immigration, and a week ago proposed a new policy on border control in parliament. The fact that the far-right AfD voted with this proposal caused consternation because the mainstream political parties in Germany have a “firewall” on any form of cooperation with the AfD. In a subsequent public speech Merz stood his ground and re-affirmed his tougher stance on immigration, in a sign that he is prepared to take much bolder policy decisions than Olaf Scholz (who is seen to have had an indecisive chancellorship). The attention that American politicians and Musk have paid to the AfD is not only a sign of poor judgement on their part, but a development that will significantly damage relations between the U.S. and Germany. The AfD have little to no chance of serving in government. Assuming that Merz is elected he has several policy challenges. The first is to reform Germany’s energy policy, potentially by introducing more nuclear and fusion driven power, the second is to pare back planning regulations, and the third will be to find pragmatic ways around Germany’s debt bake in order to permit greater military spending (combat readiness is an very serious issue for Germany’s military). From an economic and investment point of view the question we are focused on is whether the coronation of Merz as chancellor will catalyze a change in sentiment in the German economy, and a recovery in the economy. The DAX index is already powering ahead this year and is one of the best performing equity markets. Once the election is over, the focus will be on the urgency and speed with which a coalition can be formed (compromised will need to be found on issues like tax reform, immigration and foreign policy), and the extent to which Germany starts to play a leadership role on the EU stage.

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead When ad agencies first began signing up to the B Corp movement, execs hoped the climate-friendly status would appeal to new clients and draw industry recruits (as well as further environmental causes). Agency leaders still cling to that hope, but they do so in a changed political environment. Last week, Stagwell media agency Assembly certified its European and Asia-Pacific businesses as B Corps. Its U.S., African and Indian businesses are also going through the certification process. At the same time, global full-service agency Dept re-certified its B Corp status — expanding its climate and social commitments beyond its European base and across its global network. Less attention has been given to the companies pulling back from sustainability promises than to those retreating from diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) commitments in recent weeks and months. Amazon, Meta, Publicis Groupe and McDonald’s are among the companies that have reset their DE&I policies, for example. But following the inauguration of President Donald “drill, baby drill” Trump in January, climate commitments could well be the next frontline between right wing politicians and the advertising world. That month, the six largest banks in the U.S., including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Wells Fargo — as well as asset management firm BlackRock — announced their withdrawal from a collective agreement first signed at Cop26, which pledged to support net zero-aligned investments. The announcement came just a week before the Palisades Fire began tearing through much of Los Angeles County. “There’s quite a lot of negative discourse at the moment surrounding sustainability and companies pulling targets and their commitments,” said Gaby Sethi, head of global impact at Assembly. In addition to its B Corp certification, ​​Wayne Blodwell, Assembly’s recently appointed global svp of programmatic, has been tasked with making the agency’s media trading practices more environmentally sustainable, according to Sethi. “We are using this as a moment to double down on what we’re doing and why we’re doing it, and making sure that our people know that we’re not going to be swayed,” she said. It’s a marked change from the business atmosphere of just a few years ago, when companies forged ahead on climate promises and the industry’s biggest players made public pledges to reduce advertising’s direct impact on the environment. Since 2022 GroupM, for example, has worked to reduce its carbon emissions per media impressions by half, by the end of the decade. It’s unclear how far along the media network is in that goal, but in its most recent update on its progress (in WPP’s 2024 annual report), GroupM owner WPP reported it had reduced its CO2 emissions 18% year-on-year. A spokesperson for the network told Digiday that its commitments are “key” to competitive reviews, but especially for ones covering EMEA. It’s less of a concern for U.S. clients. B Corp status is a difficult label to acquire for many businesses — Sethi said the process took over two years for Assembly — and requires that companies alter the legal “articles of incorporation” documents to include commitments to the planet and society, as well as to shareholders. Where it matters to clients, though, is during the initial stages of a competitive pitch. In October, for example, Chocolate brand Tony’s Chocolonely, for example, partially credited its decision to work with agency Total Mediaplus to its B Corp status. Similarly, Sethi credited two client wins to the agency certifying as a B Corp, though she declined to name the new accounts. “Having the B Corp status has been really important,” she told Digiday. For the most part, however, climate and sustainability commitments remain common ”hygiene factors” for brands reviewing prospective partners — not “deciding factors” — according to MediaSense’s chief strategy officer, Ryan Kangisser. “You want to know that you’re doing business with companies that are focused on the right things,” he said. “I don’t think we’ve won any pitches on being B Corp in itself,” said Dept CEO Dimi Albers, who added that the badge gave agencies a calling card that expressed their values to clients. It hadn’t tipped Dept over the edge in a pitch, but he said: “Informally, I think it’s a massive difference maker.” Even if B Corp status or other environmental commitments aren’t deciding factors for clients, they do help agencies recruit staff. Albers said Dept’s B Corp status had helped it hire new talent since it first qualified, while Sethi told Digiday: “We’ve started to see it come [up] in the conversations we’re having with candidates.” Ultimately, a claim to have access to the best talent can also become a selling point for an agency’s new business team. “For clients, that’s music to their ears,” said Kangisser. Agencies act downstream of their clients, though. Before Citi Bank and JP Morgan Chase cut their ties to the Net Zero Banking Alliance, several brands had already decided their commitments to climate-friendly business had become obstacles. In 2024, Nike laid off sustainability staffers during its summer restructuring; Crocs set its net zero target back another 10 years to 2040; and Coca-Cola and Nestlé missed virgin plastic-reduction targets. That July four Havas agencies — the holding company was the first of the big agencies to embrace B Corp as a vehicle for environmental and social progress — were stripped of their accreditation by B Lab, the company that manages the scheme, after it decided Havas Media Network’s appointment to Shell’s global media account was ”a breach of the B Corp community’s core values.” And the Global Media Sustainability Framework (GMSF), initially unveiled by the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) and Ad Net Zero at Cannes Lions — was then left without its central patron after GARM folded under the pressure of an Elon Musk lawsuit. After years of mounting climate commitments from advertisers, Dept global impact lead Pooja Dingidal said companies must now factor in a political “backlash” to their thinking about risk. Meanwhile, those that would like to jettison eco-friendly policies to aid the bottom line have the political cover to do so. It would be unsurprising if, now that some advertisers are taking their foot off the gas, agencies consider following in their wake. While Assembly and Dept are sticking to their promises — others may decide that if clients aren’t impressed, the work of B Corp accreditation or net zero targets aren’t worth it.

MFC Asset Management is launching Thailand's first Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) to invest in the world's second-largest cryptocurrency amid the boom in the asset class, rallied in part by US President Donald Trump's pro-crypto policies. Thanachot Rungsitthiwat, managing director of MFC, said the company is launching the MFC Ethereum ETF Tracker Fund (METHETF-UI), which is restricted to institutional and ultra-accredited investors (UI). The fund focuses on investing in Ethereum. The company introduced MFC Bitcoin ETF Tracker Fund (MBTCETF-UI) in 2024, which allowed investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, with the fund size topping 10 billion baht. Given that success, MFC decided to introduce the Ethereum ETF to match the growing interest in digital assets. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation after Bitcoin, is a programmable blockchain that enables users to deploy smart contracts, which automatically enforce agreements without requiring intermediaries or disclosing the identities of the contracting parties. Popular innovations built on Ethereum include stablecoins, such as USDC pegged to the dollar, decentralised finance, non-fungible tokens and GameFi, which is a combination of gaming and decentralised finance. Ethereum is the name of the network, while Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency used in the network to pay transaction fees on the platform. Mr Thanachot said the METHETF-UI fund invests in the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF as the master fund in dollars. The master fund is structured as a trust under Delaware state law and is listed on the Nasdaq. The fund is sponsored by iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor Llc and managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors. The master fund aims to reflect the price of Ether before fees and expenses by directly trading Ether on a peer-to-peer basis or through digital asset investment platforms. He said the highlight of METHETF-UI is it allows investors to access Ethereum investments through the stock market by investing in a master fund that focuses on direct investment. The fund is one of the largest Ethereum ETFs approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, with a net asset value of US$3.6 billion, and it reports high liquidity. METHETF-UI is classified as a high-risk or complex mutual fund with a risk level 8+. The fund is offered exclusively to institutional and wealthy investors. The initial public offering is open until Feb 27, with a minimum investment of 1,000 baht.

Title: 4 Under-The-Radar Stock Picks For Q1 2025 From Top Managers

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 24: Stock market numbers are displayed at the New York Stock Exchange ... [+] during morning trading on January 24, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Value stocks have had a difficult time over the last few years, but things could be looking up, especially for investors who seek out lesser-known names. In recent interviews with me, Jim Zimmerman, Abigail Zimmerman, and Ara Laterovian with Lowell Capital, and Ted Rosenthal with TMR Capital each shared their two top under-the-radar stock picks. Lowell Capital chose Macfarlane Group and Academy Sports and Outdoors, while Rosenthal selected REV Group and Celestica. Macfarlane Group is the leading specialist distributor of protective packaging materials in the U.K. It operates in the U.K., Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany, providing industrial and retail customers with a wide range of protective packaging materials. The Lowell Capital team was initially drawn to Macfarlane Group’s “highly cash-generative business model, ‘Ft. Knox’ balance sheet, sustainable and resilient business model, entrenched customer relationships, high ROIC business model, non-capital intensive business, disciplined management team, and long-term growth path.” The Lowell team highlighted Macfarlane’s resilient business model, reporting that it consistently passes along raw material pricing changes to customers. As a result, management focuses more on gross profits than top-line revenues. They believe it’s largely due to high switching costs among customers. Macfarlane Group has also gone through a successful turnaround and growth strategy under CEO Peter Atkinson. “We believe MACF can drive sales growth through accretive acquisitions alongside modest organic growth,” the Lowell team said. “We believe MACF’s highly cash-generative and high-ROIC business model can grow adjusted EBITDA from £36 million in 2023 to £45 million by 2027 with zero net debt and trade for 8x adjusted EBITDA for a market cap and enterprise value of £360 million.” They estimate that Macfarlane Group could be worth £2.25 per share, versus its current price of around £1.12 a share. Additionally, the Lowell Capital team believes the company could be an attractive M&A target. Academy and Sports Outdoors is a sporting and outdoor recreational retailer in the U.S., operating 282 stores across 18 states. The company is the second-largest sporting goods retailer in the country. The Lowell team was initially drawn to Academy and Sports Outdoors for its high cash generation, low cash flow multiple, strong balance sheet and strong growth prospects. They highlighted several characteristics that they like, including a highly resilient business model, a cash-generative business, and a strong focus on value-added services. The Lowell team also likes its attractive valuation at less than 5x adjusted EBITDA and high single-digit free cash flow yield, its record of strong sales and profit growth, its disciplined management plan and “Ft. Knox” balance sheet with net debt of about $100 million, its long-term strategy to grow sales to $10 billion and net income margin to 10% by 2028, and its high-ROIC business model with limited capital requirements. REV Group designs, manufactures and distributes specialty vehicles like fire and emergency vehicles, commercial vehicles, RVs, and related aftermarket parts and services. The company is the result of several bolt-on acquisitions between 2006 and 2020 and was founded by private equity firm American Industrial Partners. Rosenthal was initially drawn to REV Group as a short position because he suspected it might be overearning. However, he switched his thesis from short to long because record backlog growth quickly drove large price increases that haven’t yet appeared in the company’s financials. “As throughput and margins normalize in Specialty Vehicles, and as business rebounds in RVs (from depressed levels), EBITDA margins should expand to 11% by 2026,” Rosenthal explained. “Ten times normalized 2026 EBITDA results in 144% upside for a 49% IRR.” He added that REV Group enjoys a high and growing market share in an attractive oligopoly industry for its Specialty Vehicles segment, while Fire and Emergency demand tends to be stable because it’s driven by replacement cycles. Prices in F&E have risen 3% over the last few decades with no down years, and the industry has consolidated, leading to record-high backlogs and improved pricing power. “Business quality is also decent,” Rosenthal pointed out. “There is a lot of customization/ value add, variable cost structure, low maintenance capex, structural ability to drive attractive levels of return on invested capital, and strong revenue visibility in certain product categories with longer backlogs. Celestica is a leading electronics manufacturing services (EMS) and outsourced manufacturer that manages global networks capable of delivering customized supply chain solutions. Rosenthal was initially drawn to the stock because he was seeking a value-oriented way to gain exposure to artificial intelligence. He feels Celestica is an underappreciated AI play, noting that it’s trading at around 20x P/E. He estimates 12x 2026 EBITDA for 83% upside and a 22% investment rate on return. “CLS has historically been a decent business but always traded at a low valuation multiple because of its low margins and difficulty in predicting the business’ financials,” Rosenthal explained. “EMS businesses operate in a competitive industry (more so with consumer electronics, where CLS has minimal exposure) with very thin operating margins, are subject to the performance of their end markets, and there is very little visibility beyond the next quarter.” Market breadth increased toward the end of 2024, giving many value stocks a boost versus their growth counterparts. However, according to BlackRock, many investors have had limited exposure to value because it’s just a small portion of the market indexes. As a result, it might take a bit of a deeper dive to gain access to this segment of the market, either through value indexes like the SPDR S&P 500 Value ETF or similar actively managed funds. However, investors who are prepared for value to make a comeback will be better positioned for when it happens, like during late 2024. It’s anyone’s guess whether value will continue to hold on in 2025, but so far, things are looking up. The SPDR Value ETF is holding its own against the growth-oriented S&P 500, with both up more than 3% year to date. At this point, it looks like we’re in a holding pattern between growth and value, making it a good time to hold exposures to both.

Some underappreciated cryptocurrencies might yield even higher rewards if Bitcoin gets closer to reaching a record high. Four small-cap coins with significant profit potential are identified in this article. Examine these undiscovered treasures that might hold the secret to riches before Bitcoin hits its next significant milestone. XYZVerse ($XYZ) has introduced a novel idea to the memecoin market by fusing the fast-paced adrenaline of cryptocurrency with the thrill of sports. Developed for ardent supporters of esport, basketball, MMA, and football, this initiative is more than just another token; it’s a thriving community centered around a shared love of the sport. XYZVerse’s ambitious Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision sets it apart from other meme coins. It recently won the title of Best New Meme Project, proving that people are paying attention. What makes $XYZ unique? It is not a passing fad. This project has a committed community that is focused on long-term growth and a clear roadmap. The $XYZ token, driven by the sports mentality, has become the front-runner, poised to overtake rivals and take Elon Musk’s journey to the moon. For people who are passionate about cryptocurrency and sports, $XYZ is headed to the winner’s podium to become a badge of distinction. Access to the token at a unique pre-listing price is possible through the ongoing $XYZ presale. Starting Price: $0.0001 Current Price: $0.002 Within a few months, $XYZ had already risen by more than 2000%! Stage Next: $0.0025 + 25 inbound jump Target for the last knockout: $0.1 From launch to token creation, $XYZ aims for an incredible 99,900% increase! You’re out if you’re not in. With the swiftness of a champion’s knockout shot, the $XYZ presale is already tearing through stages. Jupiter (JUP), one of the most well-known decentralized exchange aggregators, is upending the Solana ecosystem. To provide consumers with the best prices for their token swaps, it aggregates many liquidity pools. Jupiter makes sure you get the most out of your trades by aggregating multiple pools, preventing losses due to price variations among exchanges. Jupiter now offers more services than only coin exchanges. It now offers stablecoin management, perpetual futures, and a new launchpad called LFG that facilitates the beginning of new Solana projects. Jupiter’s potential is found in its capacity to address a prevalent issue in defi. It deals with price differences that can result in users losing money when they trade. It ensures higher rates by pooling liquidity. Jupiter is also taking a step toward decentralized governance with the January 31, 2024, introduction of its native coin, JUP. In exchange for rewards, holders can stake their JUP tokens to vote on crucial issues including ecosystem projects and liquidity plans. Jupiter distinguishes itself in the current market by improving the DeFi experience on Solana, where user control and efficiency are prized. Platforms with greater value and community involvement may draw users as the DeFi space develops. Ondo Finance is bridging the gap between the traditional and modern sectors. It combines the speed and accessibility of blockchain technology with the stability of tradfi by converting dependable, revenue-producing real-world assets into digital tokens. As a result, more people have access to previously unattainable high-quality solutions. The two main components of Ondo are the development of DeFi protocols and tokenized products. Combined, they improve Ondo’s products’ functionality and scalability and aid in the system’s modernization. By collaborating with reputable partners like BlackRock and utilizing Coinbase for safe asset storage, Ondo distinguishes itself in a sector where security and trust are essential. Their product, USDY, is backed by bank deposits and U.S. Treasuries and offers the convenience of a stablecoin along with additional interest. This makes regulated and transparent solutions available to users who are not based in the United States. Ondo stands apart from other coins due to its emphasis on compliance and real-world assets. Ondo’s combination of tradfi and innovation may make it a desirable option in the current market as blockchain technology advances and consumers search for more reliable and trustworthy solutions. A new blockchain platform called Sui is causing a stir in the cryptocurrency community. It is made to be quick, safe, and suitable for usage anywhere in the world. Fundamentally, Sui makes use of Move, a secure programming language, and a special method of managing data. This aids in resolving issues that other blockchains frequently encounter. Sui’s emphasis on the user, however, is what makes it truly unique. It aims to make blockchain simple and available to anyone. With features like sponsored transactions and zkLogin, Sui is removing obstacles and improving the use of blockchain technology. Sui’s robust technology and emphasis on the user experience make it stand out in the current market. It places a higher priority on making blockchain accessible to everyone than some other currency. As more people search for user-friendly platforms, this could offer it an advantage. Although the market is always shifting, Sui’s creative strategy can make it a desirable choice. Sui may be establishing a new benchmark in the cryptocurrency space by fusing robust technology with an emphasis on simplicity. Although JUP, ONDO, and SUI have a lot of promise, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out for bringing meme culture and sports enthusiasts together. One of its goals is to become the “G.O.A.T of all meme coins.” You can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here: https://xyzverse.io/ Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article, and views in it do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, ZyCrypto.

Title: Bird Flu Is a Rerun of the Covid Playbook

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/18/2025 8:48:45 AM PST by MtnClimber Bird flu can be very confusing. This is true because, as is so often the case with our government, those who claim to be trying to solve the problem – our so-called “public health” and “pandemic preparedness” “experts” – are actually the ones who created the problem. What is worse, they are actively seeking to perpetuate it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin https://freerepublic.com/focus/news/4296693/posts?page=48#48 I was in a chain grocery Friday and noticed that a dozen GENERIC eggs was priced at $4.85...and each additional dozen was >$9.00. It was enough to anger me beyond belief, renewed as I grabbed my eggs for breakfast this morning. I penned this email to a local radio station not long after. I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself. 12 posted on 02/18/2025 8:47:01 PM PST by logi_cal869 (-cynicus the "concern troll" a/o 10/03/2018 /!i!! &@$%&*(@ -) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

It was enough to anger me beyond belief, renewed as I grabbed my eggs for breakfast this morning. I penned this email to a local radio station not long after. I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself. 12 posted on 02/18/2025 8:47:01 PM PST by logi_cal869 (-cynicus the "concern troll" a/o 10/03/2018 /!i!! &@$%&*(@ -) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President.

For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices.

This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows.

To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health.

The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2.

The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President.

Title: Mastercard Says It Has Moved Beyond Experimentation in Crypto, Focused on 'Real Solutions'
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/02/18/mastercard-says-it-has-moved-beyond-experimentation-in-crypto-focused-on-real-solutions
Time Published: 2025-02-18T15:59:49Z

Traditional finance firms that have adopted crypto are moving past the experimentation phase and are actively working on real-world solutions, Mastercard’s head of crypto and blockchain, Raj Dhamodharan, told CoinDesk. “Many of us in the industry are moving beyond experimentation; it’s actually real solutions,” he said, noting that Mastercard has already enabled stablecoin payments for financial institutions. Those institutions can choose to settle transactions using stablecoins, reflecting a broader trend in crypto adoption. Last week, the payments giant announced a partnership with crypto compliance firm Notabene, which will integrate Mastercard’s Crypto Credential into its SafeTransact platform to make digital asset transactions more secure and user-friendly. The Crypto Credential system continues to be a focus of Mastercard’s efforts to make crypto more mainstream. It allows users to send funds using familiar identifiers like email addresses rather than complex wallet addresses while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The system also helps prevent misdirected transactions by verifying whether a recipient’s wallet can receive a specific asset. “What is stopping [crypto] from going mainstream is really that consumers need to be able to find each other using what they already know,” Dhamodharan said. Mastercard’s goal, according to Dhamodharan, is to be a connector between traditional finance and blockchain networks, ensuring regulatory compliance while enabling new business models. The company plans to announce additional partnerships and use cases in 2025, reinforcing its commitment to integrating crypto into global payments. “As an industry as a whole, we need to be very open to making [crypto] available as broadly as possible,” he said. Previously, the payments giant partnered with several crypto-native companies, including Binance. The two parted ways in August 2023 after Binance faced a series of legal issues in the U.S. Mastercard re-allowed users to purchase crypto on the exchange again a year later. “Binance is a great partner of ours,” Dhamodharan said. “We continue to partner with them in a number of new ways where we can help them with on-ramp and off-ramp. Those are the continuing conversations.” Dhamodharan is also optimistic about the future of tokenization, which he said will require new business models to feed the growing demand for tokenization real-world assets by companies like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. “​​If there is more clarity over time in terms of how deposits can be represented in some form on the public chain, from a regulatory standpoint, I think this can even go to the next level in terms of how it can scale,” he said. In 2025, Mastercard’s focus lies on the on-ramp/off-ramp between crypto and the banking world, while making that process as smooth and safe as possible as well as expanding features and functions of its Crypto Credential product. The third focus is stablecoins, the company said. “We think the future is going to be a world of both deposits because that's where the money is, and that's where people and businesses hold money and stablecoins, which can move on-chain easily and get settled easily.” Read more: Mastercard and JPMorgan Link Up to Bring Cross-Border Payments on the Blockchain Helene is a New York-based news reporter at CoinDesk, covering news about Wall Street, the rise of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and updates on crypto exchanges.
