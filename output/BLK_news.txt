President Donald Trump said Tuesday the United States had started to take back the Panama Canal after a deal by a Hong Kong firm to sell ports to a U.S.-led consortium. "To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it," he said in a speech to Congress. "We're taking it back." Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings has agreed to sell control of two ports near the Panama Canal to US-based investment company BlackRock, according to an announcement on Tuesday. Trump has repeatedly threatened the use of force to seize the canal, claiming that Hutchison's ownership of two ports, one at either entrance to the canal, gave China control over the strategic waterway that links the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The sale includes transferring 90 percent interests of the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama from CK Hutchison to a consortium that includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, and Terminal Investment. The transaction also includes the consortium receiving units that hold 80 percent of the Hutchison Ports group, which operates 43 ports in 23 countries. The sale will generate cash proceeds of $19 billion for CK Hutchison, said Frank Sixt, the holding’s co-managing director. Sixt said the “transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports” on the Panama ports. But analysts said it came as a relief nonetheless for President Jose Raul Mulino, who had been under fierce pressure to reduce China's footprint in the country without riling the second-largest user of the canal after the United States. South Korea's Air Force said Thursday that one of its fighter jets had accidentally dropped eight bombs in the wrong place during a training exercise, resulting in civilian injuries. German airline giant Lufthansa said Thursday its 2024 profits dived during a turbulent year marked by strikes, rising costs and delayed aircraft deliveries, as a post-pandemic rebound petered out. Fenerbahçe football club head coach José Mourinho has ignited a heated debate following his comments after a Galatasaray-Fenerbahçe derby match on Feb. 24 in which he stated that “everyone on the opposing bench was jumping like monkeys.”

The acquisition marks a geopolitical shift, reinforcing U.S. dominance over the Panama Canal and safeguarding global trade routes. In a landmark $23 billion deal, BlackRock, the worldâs largest asset manager, has acquired majority stakes in two strategic ports at the Panama Canal, effectively pushing out Chinese-linked influence over one of the worldâs most vital trade routes. The transaction, which was announced on Tuesday, transfers control of the ports from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings to a U.S.-led consortium spearheaded by BlackRock. This move aligns with President Trumpâs longstanding warnings about Chinaâs growing influence over global infrastructure and marks a significant shift in geopolitical control over the canal, which handles more than 70% of U.S.-bound shipping. The deal grants BlackRock control of Panamaâs Balboa and Cristobal ports, which are located at the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal, respectively, as well as 43 other ports across 23 countries. The acquisition, executed through BlackRockâs subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) in partnership with Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), underscores the firmâs growing role in global infrastructure investments. A strategic win for U.S. interests The Panama Canal has long been a linchpin of global trade, with its operations critical to U.S. economic and military strategy. For years, U.S. officials have raised alarms about Chinaâs expanding presence in the region, warning that Beijing could exploit its control over ports for intelligence gathering, military positioning, or even disrupting shipping to harm the U.S. economy. âChina is getting kicked out of Panama, and America is winning. Thank you, President Trump. MAGA!â wrote the House Foreign Affairs Committee Majority in a post on X, celebrating the deal. Trump, who has repeatedly emphasized the canalâs importance to U.S. national security, hailed the acquisition as a step toward âreclaimingâ the waterway. âThe United States has a vested interest in the secure, efficient, and reliable operation of the Panama Canal,â Trump said in a Truth Social post. âWe would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!â A purely commercial deal? Although CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt insisted the transaction was âpurely commercial in nature,â the geopolitical implications are undeniable. The deal removes Chinese-linked entities from controlling critical infrastructure near the canal, a move that aligns with the Trump administrationâs broader efforts to counter Beijingâs influence in the Western Hemisphere. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink emphasized the dealâs economic significance, stating, âThese world-class ports facilitate global growth. Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital.â A turning point in geopolitics The acquisition represents a significant shift in the balance of power over global trade routes. By placing control of the Panama Canal ports in American hands, the deal mitigates the risks associated with Chinese influence, such as potential surveillance, military pre-positioning, or economic leverage in geopolitical disputes. As the Trump administration continues to push for greater U.S. control over the canal, this deal marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle for dominance over critical global infrastructure. With BlackRock at the helm, the U.S. has taken a decisive step toward safeguarding one of the worldâs most strategic trade corridors.

Title: CK Hutchison stocks up 25% after Panama ports sale

East Asia FILE PHOTO: An aerial view shows cargo vessels docked at Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, at the Panama Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo HONG KONG: Shares in CK Hutchison soared 25 per cent in Hong Kong on Wednesday (Mar 5) after it agreed to sell its lucrative Panama Canal ports to a US-led consortium under fierce pressure from US President Donald Trump. The firm owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing said it would offload a 90 per cent stake in the Panama Ports Company (PPC) and sell a slew of other non-Chinese ports to a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock. The sellers will receive US$19 billion in cash, the company said in a statement. Hutchison subsidiary PPC has for decades run ports at Balboa and Cristobal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the interoceanic waterway. But since taking office in January, Trump has complained that China controls the canal - a vital strategic asset that the United States once ran. "To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it," he said in a speech to Congress Tuesday. "We're taking it back." Trump had refused to rule out a military invasion of Panama to regain control, sparking angry protests and a complaint to the United Nations by the Central American nation. In a joint press release with the buyers, Hutchison said the deal was motivated by business, not politics. "I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports," co-managing director Frank Sixt said. "This transaction is the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received," said Sixt, who described the chosen agreement as "clearly in the best interests of shareholders." BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the transaction demonstrated his consortium's capacity to "deliver differentiated investments for clients". "These world-class ports facilitate global growth," he added. The Panamanian government, for its part, said the sale was "a global transaction, between private companies, driven by mutual interests". It added that an audit launched into the PPC by the Panamanian comptroller's office that oversees public entities will continue in spite of the sale. The deal entails 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. CK Hutchison Holdings is one of Hong Kong's largest conglomerates, spanning finance, retail, infrastructure, telecoms and logistics. Shares in CK Hutchison soared 25 per cent in Hong Kong after the sale was announced. In February, Marco Rubio visited Panama on his first overseas trip as secretary of state, proof of the canal's importance to the new administration. Rubio won a commitment from Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino to exit the Belt and Road Initiative, China's signature infrastructure-building program. He also pressed for free passage of US vessels through the Panama Canal, which was denied. Since 1999, the canal has been run by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) - an autonomous entity whose board of directors is appointed by Panama's president and National Assembly. The 80km-long canal handles 5 per cent of global maritime trade, and 40 per cent of US container traffic. Beijing has consistently denied interfering in the canal. JPMorgan in a report said while selling the Panama business is "understandable", the deal is a "surprise" given most of CK Hutchison's other ports are not in regions directly exposed to Sino-US geopolitical tension. It could be "an opportunistic deal", JPMorgan said. "Based on our understanding of the management philosophy of CKH, any deal is possible as long as 'the price is right'." The brokerage said the deal would represent a significant strategy shift because ports would only account for 1 per cent of the conglomerate's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, from 15 per cent. The contribution of infrastructure, currently the largest segment, will rise to 33 per cent from 28 per cent.

Title: BlackRock to buy Hong Kong firm's Panama Canal port stake amid pressure

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery An investor group backed by BlackRock has agreed to buy a majority stake in the Hong Kong subsidiary that runs ports along either side of the Panama Canal, giving a U.S. firm control of key docks amid pressure from the White House to take them from China. The $22.8 billion sale by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to U.S. and Swiss investors also includes dozens of ports in other countries, the companies announced Tuesday. The move appears to be a win for U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive diplomacy just hours before he is due to tout the successes of the first six tumultuous weeks of his second term in an address to the U.S. Congress. He vowed to wrest control of the strategic canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans during his Jan. 20 inauguration speech, falsely claiming China is operating it. The transaction appears to hand command of the vital docks on both entrances of the canal to U.S. interests.

Title: Selected Articles: Rebuilding Ukraine for the Ukrainians and Gaza for the Gazans – As a Trump “Deal”?

Rebuilding Ukraine for the Ukrainians and Gaza for the Gazans – As a Trump “Deal”? By Peter Koenig, March 04, 2025 The rare earths deal was not signed. The truth is, a mining deal for Peace would not be ethical. President Trump knows that and would unlikely go down that rabbit hole. But Zelensky fell for the deal, hoping he could incite President Trump to defend his, Zelensky’s, side against President Putin. How wrong he was! Hong Kong Firm Sells Panama Canal Stake to BlackRock, Making It Majority Owner Amid Trump’s Pressure to Curb Chinese Influence By Jim Hoft, March 05, 2025 The $23 billion deal, which includes $5 billion in debt, will effectively place the strategic ports under American control—a move long advocated by President Donald Trump and national security hawks concerned about China’s grip on global infrastructure. Macron, Starmer, Merz: Righteous, Confused and Unwilling Politicians: Europe’s Dangerous Ukrainian Predicament By Dr. Binoy Kampmark, March 04, 2025 European states are divided ahead of the March 6 summit, where the EU will supposedly approve some 20 billion euros for the purchase of missiles and air defence equipment for Ukraine. Universal Healthcare Is the Solution to a Broken Medical System By Dr. Gary Null, March 04, 2025 For over 50 years, there has been no concerted or successful effort to bring down medical costs in the American healthcare system. Nor are the federal health agencies making disease prevention a priority. Regardless whether the political left or right sponsors proposals for reform, such measures are repeatedly defeated by both parties in Congress. It Is All About Energy! US in Artificial Intelligence Race Driving Quest for Minerals By Uriel Araujo, March 04, 2025 Elon Musk’s Starlink is increasingly facing competition from China’s SpaceSail. Meanwhile, Trump’s new “energy Tsar” has said that Washington is doomed to lose the “AI arms race” without fossil fuels. Energy production does seem to be a priority for the new administration. Globalisation with the Chinese Face? By Konrad Rękas, March 04, 2025 Without globalisation, the rapid development of the Chinese economy would not be possible, which is evident every time it has to rely on the internal market, which is huge but disproportionate to the capital and investment capabilities of Beijing, which simply have to find an outlet somewhere, and even then, they can get out of breath. Zelenskyy and Netanyahu – A Tale of Two White House Visits By Gavin OReilly, March 04, 2025 In further contrast to the themes of ending US foreign aid that marked Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington, both Trump and Netanyahu then went on to hold a joint press conference outlining plans to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip in line with Israeli policy, and to use US troops to do so.

Title: BlackRock CEO sees rocky 2025, but bets on long-term tech boom amid escalating trade tensions

Time Published: 2025-03-05T03:09:03Z

Share this article BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expects market volatility and elevated inflation in 2025 but remains bullish about long-term growth opportunities, projecting a “big economic boom” driven by advancements in science and technology. Speaking today at the RBC Capital Markets Global Financial Institutions Conference, Fink said that this year would be a “rocky” year as markets adjust to trade tensions and policy shifts. He noted that the “next six months” will be marked by increased market volatility. “In the next six months, I think we’re going to have a lot of volatility and volatility is creeping up quite considerably,” he said. Yet, Fink anticipates the country will overcome the current social and economic challenges. “The world’s fine. I mean, a lot of noise. We’ll get beyond — we’ll get by this,” Fink said. “All of that is going to be just a reorientation. And ultimately, we’ve — we find ways of fixing it. But in the short run, we’re going to have elevated inflation,” he said. Fink urged investors to buy during the dips, emphasizing his confidence in the enduring strength of the US capital markets. “For long-term investors, if there’s a big dip, good, good time to buy and I truly believe that. I believe we’re getting set up for a big economic boom,” Fink said, anticipating the boom will largely be driven by new technologies and science. Addressing the growing anxiety surrounding tariffs and potential deportations, Fink said they could cause immediate economic disruptions they could cause. However, despite the current climate of trade uncertainty, he stays optimistic about the possibility of a positive outcome, suggesting a potential trade agreement between the US and China. “We expect in the short run volatility, we expect elevated inflation, moderation of the economy in the short run. But over the course of three quarters, four quarters, I think we’re going to be resuming a pretty good trajectory,” he noted. Discussing AI, Fink highlighted the potential of the technology to drive innovation, efficiency, and ultimately, deflation. “The Generative AI is going to transform the science and all the sciences so rapidly,” he said. The CEO pointed out that AI implementation is currently expensive, limiting its accessibility to large corporations. However, he expressed optimism that the cost of AI models will decrease, allowing for wider adoption and “democratization” of the technology. Fink believes that the US technology sector, driven by AI, will be a major driver of stock market growth and investment opportunities over the next five years. Fink also noted the rapid evolution of robotics, where AI and visual technology are enabling robots to perform increasingly complex tasks. He contrasted older, code-driven robots with new AI-powered machines capable of delicate and precise actions. “The ability to overlay AI with robotics with visual technology is going to be transformational,” Fink said. “And that’s why when you think about so many functions and so many things, it will be ultimately very deflationary.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: March 1, 2025
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/03/march-1-2025/
Time Published: 2025-03-05T03:05:37Z

Dear friends, Welcome to the March issue of Mutual Fund Observer. I am surprised, sometimes, at how much I now appreciate some of the stuff that I found most mindless and annoying in high school. (I’m still not there with Moby Dick; the whole idea of a monomaniacally obsessed old guy leading his ship to destruction because he can’t be reasoned with and won’t back down, just strikes me as implausible, but I’m willing to listen.) My secret hope as a professor is that I’m like the gardener scattering seeds too early, in patches that seem disconsolate, for those seeds still sprout whither they would. And so, I teach my students about Thorstein Veblen, one of his age’s most impenetrable geniuses (he coined “conspicuous consumption”), and Sherry Turkle, one of our age’s most thoughtful, who asks “What do we become when we talk to machines?” We read about Hitler, and about the disastrous misjudgments – by mainstream politicians who had faith that they could control him and German industrialists who had faith that they could harness him to their everlasting profit – that led to the rise of Hitler. We read the reflections of the decent, hardworking Germans who convinced themselves that it was better to keep their heads down and pray. This separation of government from people, this widening of the gap, took place so gradually and so insensibly, each step disguised (perhaps not even intentionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes. And all the crises and reforms (real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they did not see the slow-motion underneath, of the whole process of government growing remoter and remoter. . . (A German professor speaking with Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45. University of Chicago Press, 1955) We read the final report of Herbert Hoover’s 1929 Committee on Recent Economic Changes that hailed an “almost insatiable appetite for goods and services,” and envisaged “a boundless field before us … new wants that make way endlessly for newer wants, as fast as they are satisfied.” The kids from Nepal and Mongolia read it alongside the kids from Naperville and Milwaukee, read it very differently from one another, and speak to each other with increasing confidence about how they connect to the readings … and connect to each other. And so, in the spring of my 41st year at the college, I’ll continue scattering seeds and nurturing hope. Heck, perhaps one day they’ll reflect on my classes as I’ve reflected on Dickens. “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.” ― Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities (1859) Our colleague Lynn Bolin continues looking at bonds as an attractive alternative, on a risk-adjusted and valuation basis, to stocks just now. “Spicy Bond Funds” explores “spicier” (higher-yielding) bond investments in the current market environment. Lynn analyzes various risk factors including inflation, duration risk, and policy uncertainty, and provides a comprehensive ranking system for bond funds. Spoiler: you might want to check Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) as a relatively safe way to achieve higher yields in the current market, Lynn complements that with a new take on an old strategy, bond laddering. In “ETF Bond Ladders,” he examines ETFs designed for bond laddering, focusing on products from Invesco (BulletShares) and BlackRock (iShares iBonds). The essay concludes with the note that corporate BBB-rated bond ladders will be Lynn’s mainstay investment, with potential additions of high-yield bonds for near-term investments and municipal bonds for tax-efficient accounts. In “The Great Rotation” (below), I highlight the surprising extent of the change in stock investors’ preferences – small, value, international, and emerging are being rediscovered – and offer up the funds that should be on an investor’s shortlist. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the Trump administration has gutted efforts to minimize global warming, coordinate international responses to it, or maintain a credible information infrastructure for it. In January we noted that the necessary response to allowing such a collapse was a shift to infrastructure investing to manage the effects. In February, we extended the analysis to water infrastructure. In “The Climate Denial Profit Paradox,” we update the state of government efforts and lay out additional investing opportunities. (I’ll go back to being optimistic about the future next month.) After markets get pricier and shakier, asset managers are doing what asset managers do: they’re rolling out new products in new asset classes using new algorithms that guarantee that happy days will be here again. After walking through the sad wreckage of other “can’t miss” innovations, we highlight the risks surrounding three new funds and ETFs in “Liquid Promises, Illiquid Reality.” All of which brought to mind the stunning collapse of Firsthand Technology Value Fund, a tale that continues to this day. Launched in 1994, the fund returned 60% a year in the 1990s and gave rise to a half dozen siblings. Twenty years after launch it became a business development company doing private equity investing in the same sorts of tech companies. And ten years later, the fund is trading for $0.06/share and isn’t even able to liquidate. The cautionary tale is in “The Rise and Fall of Firsthand Technology Value Fund.” Speaking of rising and falling, The Shadow documents the death of Matthews Asian Growth & Income, a fund made famous by Paul Matthews and Andrew Foster as the least volatile, most consistently excellent way to invest in Asia equities from 1994 to about 2011. But thereafter … We can establish two things about the stock market with great confidence: The US stock market has a giant problem. “Giant” in the sense that investors have poured money so steadily and so long into a handful of leaders that their valuations are beginning to redefine “irrational.” Jason Zweig notes, “Even after the stumble in tech stocks late last month, the Magnificent Seven traded this week at an average of 43.3 times what analysts expect them to earn over the next 12 months” (“What You Should Do About the Stock Market’s Giant Problem,” com, 2/7/25). That leaves most of the US market and virtually all of the rest of the world with tolerable valuations. Spencer Jakab reports that “developed-market large growth stocks were trading last week at 98th-percentile valuations… [meaning] they have been more expensive only 2% of the time.” (Ever.) Simultaneously, “developed-market large value is at the 2nd percentile, so it has been cheaper only 2% of the time” (“Stocks have a big, expensive problem,” WSJ, 2/25/25, B10). Morningstar pictures it this way: Source: Morningstar.com, Market Valuation View, 2/28/2025 Leuthold Group reports that small caps are selling at a 26% discount to large caps, adjusted for earnings, and value is selling at a near-historic discount to growth. Investors have noticed. As of March 3, 2025, Vanguard Value ETF is up 4.5% on the year, Vanguard Growth ETF is down 1.2%. Similarly, the Vanguard FTSE EM ETF is up 1.6%, Vanguard Total International Stock ETF is up 5.7% and the value-oriented Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF is up 6.6%. Contrarily, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is down 6% YTD. Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is down 2%. Tesla is down 27% YTD. Google is down 10%. Trump Media & Tech is down 32%. All of this is separate from broader concerns about chaos, tariffs, reciprocal tariffs, escalating tariffs, government shutdowns, and burgeoning deficits. What might an investor consider? If you’re a young investor with a diversified portfolio (think more than 50 stocks representing many different industries, ideally spread over several countries), do nothing to your portfolio. You’re fine. This might be unpleasant, but that’s part of the price of playing the game. If you’re an investor with all of your eggs in one small basket (you have a tech ETF and shares of Nvidia, Google, and Amazon), broaden your exposure. That doesn’t mean selling what you own. It might mean adding something like Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP). At base, the equal weight 500 counteracts the large/growth/momentum biases embedded in many portfolios. It gives equal exposure to the largest and smallest companies in the S&P 500 which creates an immediate contrarian balance. It is more oriented toward less expensive stocks, smaller stocks, old-economy stocks, and dividends than the S&P or the typical portfolio. In Morningstar terms, it is a one-star fund which is precisely its appeal: it invests in the companies left for dead by the FAANG/MAG7 mania. If you want to increase your exposure to value-oriented stocks, consider Wisdom Tree US Value ETF (WTV) or Goodhaven Fund (GOODX). Why these two? We turned to the MFO Premium screener which allows us to assess open-end funds, closed-end funds, and exchange-traded funds side-by-side. We screeners for funds with three essential characteristics: We applied that screener to large value, mid-cap value, and multi-cap value funds for the past three years. Thirty-four value funds and ETFs showed both excellent manager performance and excellent resilience over the past three years. Wisdom Tree US Value had the highest information ratio of all, and Goodhaven had the highest ratio for all mutual funds. If you want to increase your exposure to small cap stocks, consider Vanguard Strategic Small Cap Equity, North Square Dynamic Small Cap, or Adirondack Small Cap. Vanguard Strategic Small Cap Equity is an actively managed, low-cost small-cap blend fund that holds about 500 names (yikes! But it works) with a growth-at-a-reasonable-price discipline. It charges one-third of the category average and is about as diversified as can be. North Square Dynamic Small Cap employs a systematic, quantitative approach to identify behavioral inefficiencies in small-cap equity markets, leveraging sophisticated data science to exploit pricing dislocations caused by investor biases. That “behavioral finance” angle is fairly distinctive. Adirondack Small Cap is the top-performing small value fund, earning a remarkable 11% annual return in one of the market’s left-for-dead categories. The fund specializes in identifying undervalued small-cap companies that have fallen out of favor with investors, seeking to capitalize on these “turnaround situations” before mainstream investors take notice. They target companies that might rebound within three years. The team has been around forever and is heavily invested in the fund. If you want to increase your exposure to international stocks, consider the Janus Henderson Global Research or Moerus Worldwide Value. The Janus Henderson Global Research is a global large-cap growth fund that employs a distinctive sector-driven approach where specialized teams of dedicated sector analysts build high-conviction portfolios of their best ideas worldwide. They also work to hedge away most macroeconomic risks leaving the portfolio performance mostly driven by stock selection. Moerus Worldwide Value is a globally unconstrained deep value fund managed by Amit Wadhwaney, who employs a disciplined approach to identifying companies trading at significant discounts to intrinsic value across developed and emerging markets, with a particular emphasis on strong balance sheets over income statements. Amit has three decades of value investing experience and willingness to embrace market turmoil as an opportunity, seeking out underfollowed businesses, complex situations, and temporarily distressed sectors that most investors avoid, creating a distinctive portfolio of 30-40 high-conviction holdings with minimal index overlap. And if you’re simply freaked out, (a) welcome to the club and (b) increase the strategic cash allocation in your portfolio. Cash and cash alternatives are paying 4-5% a year with minimal downside. If you don’t have any great conviction in risk assets, take a deep breath and invest in some variation of an ultra-short bond fund or money market. CrossingBridge is run by David Sherman & co., and they have an outstanding record of low-risk income investing. Fidelity Conservative Income is a cheap, active, middle-of-the-road ultra-short bond fund. The “cheap” is really useful here. We’ve also included the profile of the money market peer group. In reality, there’s no downside to any of them and precious little upside deviation. So, the whole group sits at 4.2% give-or-take 0.2%. Pick whichever one is convenient to you if you don’t want the prospect of adding just a bit of upside with CrossingBridge or Fido. The bottom line: running around in panic is not your friend. Hiding is not your friend. Taking a deep breath and making rational adjustments is. We’ll help. March has been designated as “B Corp Month.” Hallmark has not yet taken notice. In an era of growing disillusionment with traditional corporate structures, B Corps stand as beacons of a more conscientious approach to business. While many companies prioritize profits at any cost, Benefit Corporations (B Corps) represent a revolutionary paradigm that balances financial success with positive social and environmental impact. B Corps are businesses that meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. Unlike conventional corporations that answer primarily to shareholders, B Corps legally commit to considering all stakeholders: workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the environment. In the US, 2,400 corporations are organized as B Corps. Worldwide, that swells to 9,500. What makes B Corps worth celebrating? They’re proving that business can be a force for good. From fair wages and diverse workforces to sustainable sourcing and ethical production, these companies demonstrate that profit and purpose aren’t mutually exclusive, they’re mutually reinforcing. The B Corp movement isn’t just idealism; it’s pragmatism for our times. As consumers increasingly vote with their dollars for companies that reflect their values, B Corps are showing that ethical business practices create resilience, innovation, and long-term success. The Annual Report of B Lab documents a lot of ways in which these companies really are different. I am not surprised, though I am slightly appalled, by the speed with which Corporate America as a whole has thrown all principles except shareholder (and executive) gains under the bus. By supporting the good guys, you aren’t underwriting the swift abandonment of employees, communities, and the environment by the billionaire-dollar corporations that were cheerleading for it, flying rainbow flags, and signing on to global initiatives … for precisely as long as it was convenient. Support how?? Follow B Lab Global, the certifying body, on social media (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, X) and follow the #GenB or #BCorpMonth hashtag to see the different stuff happening throughout March. You can also use the ‘Find a B Corp’ directory to discover businesses that are part of the community and use your purchasing power to support B Corp companies, and the movement of business as a force for good. You might also consider Bookshop.org as an ethical alternative to Amazon, at least as a bookseller. They’ve donated $36+ million in profits to local bookshops since their launch during Covid. Nice people, good selection. Amazon has recently changed policy, they now forbid Kindle users from downloading their books, giving them permanent control of your purchases. (You might recall their freakish decision to remove the book 1984 from all Kindle readers a few years ago.) Bookshop has e-books and is working with folks like Kobo to make them available on readers. Similarly, a handful of major retailers have recognized the business case of sustaining a diverse and vibrant workforce and have, to date, refused to roll back corporate efforts to support their employees. Those include Costco, Crate & Barrel, Home Depot, Ikea, Kroger, Sprouts Wayfair, West Elm … and Whole Foods (?). To our faithful “subscribers,” Wilson, S&F Investment Advisors, Greg, William, William, Stephen, Brian, David, and Doug, thanks! To, Sara from Brooklyn, Charles of Michigan, Ronald from Alexandria, Marjorie (thank you, ma’am, I also get such a headache some days) of Chicago, The Grinch Redux, and dear Binod from Houston, thanks! And for more than just financial support. You make a difference. It’s planting time. Chip is busily searching seed catalogs for spring-planted garlic (stiff neck mostly, because they generate delicious garlic scapes) and mild onions. I’ll continue searching for the perfect potato. And somewhere in there, more native wildflowers and grass (sheep fescue looks cool) will continue their relentless incursion on our lawn. Planting is an act of hope. Gardening is a gesture of resilience. Pursue both, dear friends. As ever, David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts). Cofounder, lead writer.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican representative from Louisiana, warned against disrupting Trump’s speech. “Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the house and to cease any further disruptions,” Johnson said. He then again addressed the chamber, saying: “Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of the quorum, and the chair is prepared to direct the sergeant-at-arms to restore order to the joint session.” Johnson also directly told Green to take his seat, before ordering the house sergeant-at-arms to remove him from the chamber. Green is a vocal critic of Trump and has filed articles of impeachment against the president. Other Democratic representatives could be seen holding black paddles that said “Save Medicaid”, “Protect Veterans” and “Musk Steals”. Representative Rashida Tlaib, from Michigan, held a whiteboard reading: “That’s a lie.” Representative Melanie Stansbury, from New Mexico, was spotted holding a sign that read: “This is not normal” as Trump entered the chamber. First elected in a special election in 2021 to replace then-interior secretary Deb Haaland, Stansbury represents a solidly Democratic district. She is also the top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee. Someone grabbed the sign from across the aisle and threw it. Some Democratic representatives — including Stansbury and Texan representative Jasmine Crockett — have since walked out of the chamber, after taking off their jackets to reveal words in white on their backs. Some said: “Resist.” Florida representative Maxwell Frost’s said: “No More Kings.” In his speech, Trump declared “America is back” and said his administration had ended what he called the “tyranny” of diversity and inclusion programs across the federal government. “Our country will be woke no longer,” he said, adding he is “getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military”. “We don’t want it — wokeness is trouble, wokeness is bad — it’s gone.” Trump last month signed an executive order banning transgender athletes from taking part in women’s and girls’ sports. He referenced this, say he signed an executive order banning public schools from “indoctrinating” children with “transgender ideology”. In attendance on Tuesday was former high school athlete Payton McNabb, who the White House said “suffered a severe injury by a male competitor in women’s sports”. “Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls’ team, or they will lose all federal funding,” Trump said. “Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America,” he said. “From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. “We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years. “And we are just getting started. “I return to this chamber tonight to report that America’s momentum is back, our spirit is back, our pride is back, our confidence is back, and the American Dream is surging bigger and better than ever before. “The American Dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed and perhaps will never witness again. “It’s never been anything like it. “The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. “We won all seven swing states, giving us an electoral college victory of 312 votes We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country.” After he was escorted out of the chamber, Green said when Trump spoke about his “mandate” it “triggered something”. “It really did,” Green said, “because he doesn’t have a mandate, and he doesn’t have a mandate to cut health care from poor people.” The interview with Green was interrupted by Capitol Police, who removed media from the area where they were speaking. Democratic representatives Maxine Dexter and Andrea Salinas, both from Oregon, have also now been escorted out of the chamber. In response to Trump’s talk of a mandate, Republicans in the chamber stood up and cheered, chanting: “USA!” As he was starting to speak again, however, some politicians started booing him. In his speech, Trump also touched on major political talking points including immigration and health. Trump made “migrant crime” a centerpiece of his campaign, and many family members of victims of such crimes appeared with him either on the trail or in videos produced by the campaign that aired during his rallies. He referenced the Laken Riley Act, which was approved in a bipartisan effort earlier this year. The bill was named for Laken Riley, a nursing school student who was murdered last year in Athens, Georgia. A Venezuelan citizen who had entered the US illegally was convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Trump later praised Robert F. Kennedy Jr. while speaking about autism in the United States, saying there’s “nobody better” than his recently confirmed health and human services secretary to “figure out what’s going on”. “You have the best to figure out what is going on,” Trump said. “OK, Bobby, good luck. It’s a very important job.” Kennedy has long used anti-vaccine rhetoric and his platform to claim without evidence that early childhood vaccines cause autism. In 2018, Kennedy founded Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine nonprofit group. When pressed on the issue by Republican Senator Bill Cassidy at his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy refused to plainly state that vaccines do not cause autism, despite decades of research dispelling any link. Trump later said his administration will be “reclaiming the Panama Canal”, adding that it has “already started doing it”. He mentioned a deal made earlier today, in which the Hong Kong company CK Hutchison said it would sell its controlling stake in a unit that operates two ports on the Pacific and Atlantic sides of the canal to a consortium that includes the US asset manager BlackRock. Trump also addressed “the incredible people of Greenland”, saying that he supports the right to determine their own future and that they are welcome to join the US. “We need it really for international world security — and I think we’re going to get it one way or the other,” Trump said. Clocking in at roughly an hour and 40 minutes, Trump’s speech broke the record for longest presidential address to Congress — including his own — by over 10 minutes. — With CNN 2 min read 2 min read Stream free on 1 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 1 min read 1 min read 2 min read 1 min read 1 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 1 min read 1 min read 2 min read 1 min read Stay informed with the free 7NEWS app. Available on iOS & Android.

Title: Hong Kong Firm Sells Panama Canal Stake to BlackRock, Making It Majority Owner Amid Trump’s Pressure to Curb Chinese Influence

BlackRock Inc. has secured control over key ports near the Panama Canal, stripping away Chinese-linked influence over one of the world’s most crucial shipping routes. The $23 billion deal, which includes $5 billion in debt, will effectively place the strategic ports under American control—a move long advocated by President Donald Trump and national security hawks concerned about China’s grip on global infrastructure. The transaction, announced Tuesday, involves Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings selling its controlling stake in Hutchison Port Holdings and Hutchison Port Group Holdings to a U.S.-led consortium spearheaded by BlackRock, AP reported. This historic acquisition grants control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including major sites in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan, and Panama’s critical ports of Balboa and Cristobal—the two primary gateways to the Panama Canal. Fox Business reported: BlackRock announced the $22.8 billion deal with CK Hutchison’s subsidiary Hutchison Port Holdings, which will see the firm acquire the Panama ports of Cristobal and Balboa, which are located at the Atlantic and Pacific ends of the canal, respectively. It will also acquire Hutchison’s controlling interest in 43 ports in 23 other countries. The world’s largest asset manager will partner with Terminal Investment Limited (TiL) to operate the ports in concert with the BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). “This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP’s combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said. “These world-class ports facilitate global growth. Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.” […] Frank Sixt, CK Hutchison co-managing director, said the transaction was the “result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received” and added that the deal should deliver cash proceeds in excess of $19 billion to the group. “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt added. “China is getting kicked out of Panama and America is winning. Thank you, President Trump. MAGA!” wrote House Foreign Affairs Committee Majority. . Read on X . “Victory for America & our allies. China leverages commercial port operations throughout the Western Hemisphere, including the Panama Canal, to project power, enable surveillance, facilitate trafficking, and pre-position for conflict,” Homeland GOP wrote. . Watch on X . Donald Trump has warned that the United States could seize back the Panama Canal unless the country agrees to lower its costs and counter Chinese influence. In a post on Truth Social, the incoming president urged the Panamanian government to start taking care of the canal or face the consequences. He wrote: The United States has a vested interest in the secure, efficient, and reliable operation of the Panama Canal, and that was always understood. We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands! It was not given for the benefit of others, but merely as a token of cooperation with us and Panama. If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question. To the Officials of Panama, please be guided accordingly! Trump later followed up with another post explaining its role preserving America’s economic and national security: The Panama Canal is considered a VITAL National Asset for the United States, due to its critical role to America’s Economy and National Security. A secure Panama Canal is crucial for U.S. Commerce, and rapid deployment of the Navy, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and drastically cuts shipping times to U.S. ports. The United States is the Number One user of the Canal, with over 70 percent of all transits heading to, or from, U.S. ports. Considered one of the Wonders of the Modern World, the Panama Canal opened for business 110 years ago, and was built at HUGE cost to the United States in lives and treasure – 38,000 American men died from infected mosquitos in the jungles during construction. Teddy Roosevelt was President of the United States at the time of its building, and understood the strength of Naval Power and Trade. When President Jimmy Carter foolishly gave it away, for One Dollar, during his term in Office, it was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else. It was likewise not given for Panama to charge the United States, its Navy, and corporations, doing business within our Country, exorbitant prices and rates of passage. Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, especially knowing the extraordinary generosity that has been bestowed to Panama by the U.S. This complete “rip-off” of our Country will immediately stop…. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: $1.7b NZ non-residential sales in 2H24: CBRE lists 10 biggest deals where prices are declared

Time Published: 2025-03-05T02:00:00Z

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. NZ Safety Blackwoods' new distribution centre, as at February 2025. This base is at Drury South in Auckland. A list of the 10 largest non-residential property sales of last year’s second half was topped by a $66.5 million Drury real estate transaction. Zoltan Moricz, executive director and research head at CBRE in Auckland, released the latest investment transaction monitor listing sales where the price was made public. That showed a total value of 97 New Zealand non-residential sales in 2H24 totalled about $1.7b. The monitor said 2H24’s largest sale where a price was declared was at Drury, in a transaction dated December 1, 2024. Moricz said the top 10 list did not include the $180m planned sale of Precinct Properties' InterContinental Auckland hotel, announced on March 5. CBRE’s top 10 list of 2H24 non-residential New Zealand sales where prices were declared follows. Largest: $66.5m Drury South Crossing sale Calder Stewart Development sold a Drury property on Jack Stevenson Rd to industrial wholesale investment specialist FortHill Property Fund. This was the sale of an industrial property under construction by Calder Stewart. FortHill’s purchase is of the developed or finished asset. FortHill has associations with the vendor. Calder Stewart is a long-term developer from the South Island, where it has an extensive Christchurch portfolio. FortHill has been set up as a wholesale investment fund separate from Calder Stewart but associated. Last month, the Herald reported on the NZ Safety Blackwoods new distribution centre, which Calder Stewart is developing at 22 Jack Stevenson Rd. Sale date: December 1, 2024 Second largest: $63.7m Rolleston sale Active Canterbury investors Andrew and Phillip Carter sold 32 Iport Dr, Rolleston to Private Land and Property Fund. Sale date: July 12, 2024. That part of Rolleston is a fast-growing commercial hub where Costco Wholesale has been tipped to develop its second New Zealand store, although this has never been confirmed. Industrial developer Carter Group’s Rolleston Industrial Holdings won approval from the council for a scheme that potentially tagged Costco as having a base there. Third largest: $63.5m Māngere sale Wine business Indevin Group sold 470 Oruarangi Rd, Māngere to Blackrock. This is part of the former Villa Maria estate, established by founder Sir George Fistonich. In 2021, the Herald reported how Indevin had signed a conditional agreement to buy the vineyard land after owner FFWL was put into receivership by Rabobank and ANZ, owed nearly $212m. NZX-listed Goodman Property Trust bought much of that estate, planning a $500m-plus warehouse and logistics hub. Sale date: July 19, 2024. Fourth largest: $58m Papakura sale CBRE listed Fletcher Building as having sold 76-78 Hunua Rd, Papakura to a private investor, Bruce Miles. But CBRE also said that sale was as yet unconfirmed. Humes Papakura has its manufacturing plant at that address. A Fletcher spokesman today confirmed the $58m transaction: “We have sold the land with a perpetually renewable ground lease.” Sale date: November 1, 2024. Fifth largest: $56m Ōtara sale Private investor Quing Ye sold 291 East Tāmaki Rd, Ōtara to NZX-listed Argosy Property. Argosy said in its FY25 result it had unconditionally bought the property and adjacent titles. “This is a 4.6ha level site in a well-established industrial precinct, just 2km from State Highway 1. The initial purchase price and attendant capital works is $61 million, and the fully-let holding return is 4.8%. The site is currently 58% leased, with the balance expected to be leased up prior to settlement, in August 2025,” Argosy announced. Sale date: December 16, 2024. Sixth largest: $55m Wynyard Quarter sale CBRE listed Orams Marine as selling a Wynyard Quarter property to NZX-listed Precinct Properties. Sale date: December 1, 2024. This transaction was reported last August, the announcement being contained in Precinct’s full-year financial result. The company plans to jointly develop a waterfront site with Orams. Orams has long held plans to develop the waterfront sites it owns. But its three new Beaumont St refit sheds upset the neighbours who filed High Court action against development. The neighbours lost and Orams built the new sheds. But that’s only part of a wider plan for many more buildings on the land. In 2022, chief executive Neven Barbour told the Herald how the business was ploughing $140m into a new hub and far more was to come. Seventh largest: $51m Westgate sale CBRE lists the company, 21 Fred Taylor Dr, as selling Bunnings Westgate to NZX-listed business Investore Property. Companies Office records show the vendor is wholly owned by Cook Property Trust and the sole director of Benjamin David Cook. Bunnings Westgate opened in 2020. In 2020, the Herald reported investor Ben Cook of Cook Property as buying that store and two other properties. Cook declined to say then how much he paid, explaining he had entered commercially confidential agreements and was bound by them. However, market sources confirmed Bunnings Westgate had a market value of about $70m, Countdown Orewa about $30m and Countdown Aotea about $18m. Sale date: August 22, 2024. Eighth largest: $50.2m Kāpiti sale Templeton Retail sold the Kāpiti Landing shopping centre to PropCo No3LP, CBRE said. Colliers described Kāpiti Landing as a sprawling retail precinct, which in March 2020 was being offered for sale. Sale date: September 13, 2024. Ninth largest: $40.6m Christchurch sale Eastgate Holdings sold the Eastgate Shopping Centre to Willis Bond for this sum. Sale date: October 29, 2024. Tenth largest: $38.5m Waipuna sale The Mt Wellington Licensing Trust Board sold the Waipuna Hotel & Conference Centre in Auckland to Primeproperty Group. The Herald has previously reported how that property is valued for rating purposes at $44m. Sale date: September 1, 2024. Could this be even larger? No price was declared by NZX-listed Summerset Group when it bought the Hillary block of land at Belmont on the North Shore for a new village last year. Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei sold the parcel in a deal giving it company shares and employment and education opportunities for the hapū. The 5.7ha housing estate was once owned by the Royal New Zealand Navy but sold to Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei last decade under its Treaty settlement. Scott Scoullar, Summerset chief executive, said his company had bought the land outright. That is different from what Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei did with Ryman Healthcare on the Wakakura block, where Ryman leased it long-term to that listed retirement business. That block is not far from Hillary, but nearer Devonport. This transaction occurred in 2H24. Anne Gibson has been the Herald’s property editor for 25 years, written books and covered property extensively here and overseas.

Title: BlackRock to Buy Chinese Ports on Panama Canal

Time Published: 2025-03-05T01:58:14Z

After significant pressure was exerted by President Donald Trump, Chinese company CK Hutchison has agreed to sell its two ports on the Panama Canal to U.S. investment company BlackRock per a Tuesday announcement. This move comes after Trump's allegations of excessive Chinese influence over the strategic waterway and his threats to reclaim U.S. control. The deal also encompasses an 80% stake in CK Hutchison's global port operations, spanning 43 ports across 23 countries. Trump's administration had expressed concerns over China's potential military use of the canal and its growing influence in Latin America, prompting demands for Panama to reduce Chinese presence. The Panama Canal, managed by the Panama Canal Authority since its transfer from U.S. control in 1999, has become a focal point in Trump's efforts to counter China's global influence.

Title: News Wrap: Massive storm threatens Mardi Gras in New Orleans

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Leave your feedback In our news wrap Tuesday, a massive storm system is threatening to put a damper on Mardi Gras festivities in New Orleans, Arab leaders from across the Middle East endorsed a plan to ­rebuild Gaza, at least three Serbian lawmakers were injured after chaos erupted in the country's parliament and an investor group led by a U.S. firm BlackRock is buying two ports at either end of the Panama Canal. Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Amna Nawaz: We start the day's other headlines with a massive storm system that's rumbling across much of the country, stretching from Chicago all the way down to the Gulf. Woman: This is what we're seeing. Oh, holy… Amna Nawaz: The most severe thunderstorms are carving a path across the South tonight, leaving toppled buildings, debris, and more than 400,000 people without power from Texas to Mississippi. The weather system hasn't brought just rain. It's also kicked up blinding dust storms across parts of the Southwest. And it's threatening to put a damper on Mardi Gras festivities in New Orleans tonight. Officials moved up and shortened the city's two biggest parades, hoping to wrap things up before high winds move in. Turning overseas, Arab leaders from across the Middle East endorsed a plan today to rebuild the Gaza Strip. The measure would allow the territory's two million Palestinians to remain in Gaza. It's a counterproposal to President Trump's vision, which calls for removing Palestinians from the area and creating a beach destination. Experts warned such a plan would be a war crime under international law. At today's summit in Cairo, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi laid out his $53 billion plan, under which Hamas would cede power to an interim independent administration. Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, Egyptian President (through interpreter): The plan starts with immediate relief operations and early recovery efforts, leading to the full reconstruction of the enclave. Egypt calls for adopting this plan at our summit today and mobilizing regional and international support for it. Amna Nawaz: The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, was also there. He told the summit he's ready to hold elections as early as next year if — quote — "conditions allow." The Palestinians have not held presidential elections in some two decades. In Serbia, at least three lawmakers were injured after chaos erupted in the country's Parliament today. Opposition lawmakers threw smoke bombs and flares as the chamber was set to vote on a measure that would increase funding for universities. They say the session was illegal and that Parliament must first confirm the resignation of the prime minister and his government. Milos Vucevic stepped down in January after months of anti-corruption demonstrations related to the collapse of a train station canopy that killed 15 people. Opposition parties say the government has no authority to pass new laws and are calling for new elections. The U.S. Senate has voted not to move forward a bill that would have banned transgender student athletes from participating in women and girls sports. Man: Three-fifths of the senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to. Amna Nawaz: The measure needed 60 votes to proceed. It failed along party lines last night. The House has passed similar legislation with two Democrats supporting that bill. Republicans, led by President Trump, have frequently leaned into the issue of transgender athletes, framing it as unfair to women and girls. Many Democrats argue that such measures distract from more important issues facing the nation and could further isolate and harm transgender youth. An investor group led by U.S. firm BlackRock is buying two ports at either end of the Panama Canal. Those terminals are currently operated by the Hong Kong-based group C.K. Hutchison. They have been at the center of a dispute between the Trump administration and Panama, as President Trump accuses China of influencing the critical waterway. Last month, Panama's president denied that China had any control over canal operations. The roughly $23 billion deal requires approval from Panama's government. And now for some egg-citing news about two celebrity lovebirds who found fame online. Bald eagle power couple Jackie and Shadow of California's Big Bear Valley are now proud parents of two baby eaglets. Yesterday, a livestream showed some cracks in two of their new eggs. Then, just before midnight, new life entered the nest. Over 80,000 viewers tuned into the livestream this morning to watch the protective parents admire the eaglets and monitor a third egg which is expected to hatch in the coming days. So congratulations to Jackie and Shadow and the new members of their family. And from the beginnings of life to the passing of another. Robert Clark has died. He was elected Mississippi's first Black lawmaker of the 20th century in 1967. A teacher and descendant of enslaved people in a deeply segregated state, Clark was ostracized by his colleagues, forced to sit by himself in the House chamber and at official dinners. But Clark rose to the second highest leadership role in the Statehouse, a position he held until he retired in 2004. His son, Bryant Clark, who took over his father's seat, says Robert Clark died of natural causes. He was 96 years old.

Title: Hong Kong-based company to sell Panama Canal ports
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzlk259g2o
Time Published: 2025-03-04T23:28:31Z
Full Content:
A Hong Kong-based company has agreed to sell most of its stake in two key ports on the Panama Canal to a group led by US investment firm BlackRock. The sale comes after weeks of complaining by President Donald Trump that the canal is under Chinese control and that the US should take control of the major shipping route. Through a subsidiary, CK Hutchison Holding operates ports at the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean entrances to the canal. It said Tuesday that it would sell its interests as part of a deal worth $22.8bn (£17.8bn). CK Hutchison, founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, is not owned by the Chinese government. But its base in Hong Kong means it operates under Chinese financial laws. It has operated the ports since 1997. The deal includes a total of 43 ports in 23 countries around the world, including the two canal terminals. It will require approval by the Panamanian government. The 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal cuts across the central American nation and is the main link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Up to 14,000 ships travel through it each year, including container ships carrying cars, natural gas and other goods, and military vessels. It was built in the early 1900s. The US maintained control over the canal zone until 1977, when treaties gradually ceded the land back to Panama. After a period of joint control, Panama took sole control in 1999. Trump has made several arguments for retaking control of the canal and the surrounding area. He argued that Chinese influence is a national security threat, that the US investment in the initial building of the canal justifies taking back control, and that US ships are charged too much for using the waterway. In a visit to Panama in February, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio demanded that the country make "immediate changes" to what he calls the "influence and control" of China over the canal. Panama rejected the US government claims and President Jose Raul Mulino has said the canal "is and will remain" in the central American country's hands. In a statement announcing the business deal, Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said: "I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports." BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management companies. The group buying the ports also includes Terminal Investment Limited, a Swiss company. Newly released footage shows Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost making the second-ever commercial moon landing. The Justice Department said Chinese agencies paid as much as $75,000 (£58,200) for each hacked email inbox. Phil Goff asked if Trump "understands history" as he contrasted him with Sir Winston Churchill. Trump says he will exempt cars from the new import taxes, while continuing his criticism of Canada. Officials say the group, which was skiing via helicopter, may be buried under 100ft (30m) of snow. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: American interests regain control of key parts of Panama Canal

By Bob Unruh March 4, 2025 One of the major targets of President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign is the Panama Canal. That asset, he pointed out, was built with American lives and American money, and turned over to Panama to operate. However, he charged that China had embedded itself in the control functions of the canal, and he said that wouldn’t be allowed, suggesting that America could “take it back.” Now that has happened, more or less.

The acquisition secures control over 40% of the canal’s container traffic.” It said, “Trump has long claimed China ‘runs’ the canal and vowed to ‘take it back’” Now, BlackRock’s move effectively does it for him. With two-thirds of the canal’s cargo linked to the U.S., this deal reshapes control over a critical global trade route.” Business Insider said BlackRock’s acquisition brings ports “on both sides of the Panama Canal” under U.S. control and the move “removes them from the control of CK Hutchison Holdings.” The report explained BlackRock is acquiring “a 90% interest in the Panama Ports Company alongside Global Infrastructure Partners and container terminal group Terminal Investment.” Panama’s participation in China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” in which China takes control of various infrastructure around the world earlier was canceled. CBS pointed out that the deal transfers control of “43 ports in 23 countries,” including Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia and Pakistan. “This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP’s combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients. These world-class ports facilitate global growth,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said. The report explained, “U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President José Raúl Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.” Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists.

Title: Volatility of btc vs MSTR

Time Published: 2025-03-04T21:43:16Z
Full Content:
MSTR, or MicroStrategy, is a company heavily invested in Bitcoin, and its stock price tends to be more volatile than Bitcoin itself. Recent analyses, such as from Portfoliolab, indicate MSTR’s volatility at 22.14% annualized, compared to BTC’s 17.13%. This suggests MSTR experiences larger price swings, making it riskier for investors. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has stated that MSTR’s volatility is approximately twice that of Bitcoin, which aligns with market observations. This higher volatility is partly due to MSTR’s leveraged strategy, using debt and equity to acquire more Bitcoin, amplifying price movements. An interesting aspect is that MSTR’s volatility isn’t just tied to Bitcoin’s price but is also influenced by its business operations and market sentiment, creating a complex risk profile not fully mirrored by BTC. This note provides a comprehensive examination of the volatility comparison between MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock and Bitcoin (BTC), drawing from recent data and market analyses as of March 4, 2025. Volatility, defined as the degree of variation in trading prices over time, is a critical metric for investors assessing risk. Here, we explore historical data, correlation, beta, and expert insights to understand the relative volatility and its implications. MicroStrategy, a company known for its business intelligence software, has pivoted significantly toward Bitcoin, holding substantial amounts as part of its treasury strategy. This shift, led by CEO Michael Saylor, has made MSTR a proxy for Bitcoin exposure, but with added layers of risk due to its corporate structure and financial strategies. Bitcoin, as a cryptocurrency, is inherently volatile, but its volatility has shown a declining trend over recent years, as noted in analyses from iShares – Blackrock. However, MSTR’s volatility appears to exceed BTC’s, driven by leverage and market dynamics. Recent data from Portfoliolab, published on February 23, 2025, provides a direct comparison: Another dataset from the same source, dated August 17, 2024, shows: These figures suggest MSTR consistently exhibits higher volatility, with variations possibly due to different time periods analyzed. The discrepancy highlights the importance of context, as market conditions can affect volatility measurements. This table underscores MSTR’s higher volatility, with a notable gap, especially in the more recent data. Michael Saylor’s statement, referenced in an X post by r/MSTR, claims MSTR’s volatility is twice that of Bitcoin. This aligns with Coindesk reporting MSTR’s volatility outpacing BTC by 2.5 times, based on a 30-day implied volatility (IV) of 140.86% for MSTR versus BTC’s lower figure. Such statements suggest a leveraged effect, where MSTR’s financial strategies, including debt issuance for Bitcoin purchases, amplify price movements. Correlation between MSTR and BTC varies by source. Portfoliolab reports a low correlation of 0.20, suggesting price changes are not closely related, which might seem counterintuitive given MSTR’s Bitcoin holdings. However, Coindesk cites a 65% correlation using 12 months of daily closing price data, indicating a moderate to high relationship. This discrepancy may reflect different time frames or methodologies. Beta, a measure of volatility relative to a benchmark, is less straightforward for BTC as it’s not a stock. For MSTR, Yahoo Finance lists a 5-year monthly beta of 3.37 against the market, indicating high volatility. Analyzing the Correlation Between MicroStrategy’s Stock and Bitcoin suggests MSTR’s beta relative to BTC is around 1.10 to 1.14 over recent periods, implying it moves slightly more than BTC, supporting the volatility gap. MSTR’s volatility is not solely tied to BTC’s price. Its strategy involves issuing convertible bonds and equity to buy more Bitcoin, as noted in The math behind MicroStrategy’s bitcoin bet. This leverage creates a 2.5x volatility effect compared to BTC, according to Coindesk. Additionally, MSTR’s business intelligence operations and market sentiment, as discussed in Strategy vs Bitcoin, add further volatility, making it a complex investment vehicle. For investors, MSTR’s higher volatility means greater potential returns but also increased risk, especially in bear markets. Seeking Alpha notes MSTR moves 1.5 times more in the same direction as BTC, suggesting amplified gains in bull markets but sharper declines otherwise. This aligns with Reddit discussions, such as r/MSTR, where users observe MSTR moving 2x BTC up and down, reflecting leverage risks. Based on the data, MSTR exhibits higher volatility than BTC, with recent figures suggesting a range of 18.49% to 22.14% for MSTR versus 10.40% to 17.13% for BTC. CEO statements and market analyses reinforce this, with MSTR’s volatility estimated at 2 to 2.5 times that of BTC due to leverage and operational factors. This makes MSTR a riskier but potentially more rewarding investment compared to direct BTC exposure. When in Doubt, Buy More Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Watch CBS News Updated on: March 5, 2025 / 7:34 AM EST / CBS/AP The Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports near the Panama Canal has agreed to sell shares of its units that operate the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., after President Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane. In a press release, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and all shares in Hutchison Port Group Holdings, in a deal valued at $22.8 billion. The two units hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group that operates 43 ports in 23 countries, including two of the four major ports that exist along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. The consortium, comprised of BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited will acquire 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, according to the filing. "This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP's combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients. These world-class ports facilitate global growth," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a joint announcement with TilL of the deal. "Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment. In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports "give China ready observation posts" to take action. "This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security," Cruz said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President José Raúl Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations. Panama quit China's Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio's visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing. Mr. Trump touted the move in his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, saying that "to further enhance our national security, our administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it." "Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal, and a couple of other canals," the president said. With 40 million container ships passing through every year, the Panama Canal — a 51 mile waterway that cuts through Central America, linking the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans — is vital to the U.S. economy. Disputes over the canal were first sparked in 2024 when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, made accusations that Chinese companies have taken control of the ports. But while much attention was focused on Mr. Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the canal's key ports, at either end of the canal. As a result of BlackRock's deal with CK Hutchison Holding, those two key ports will be placed under American control. The United States is the canal's largest user, with about 70% of shipping traffic going through the canal either coming to or from the U.S. Its second largest user is China. Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

A consortium of firms led by BlackRock is buying two key ports in the Panama Canal from a Hong Kong-based firm as part of a $23 billion deal after President Donald Trump expressed concern that the strategic waterway was falling under Chinese influence. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with a portfolio of investments valued at $11.5 trillion, has agreed to purchase majority stakes in ports on both sides of the Panama Canal from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison in a multipart transaction worth $22.8 billion, the companies announced on Tuesday. Beyond the Panama Canal ports, the deal with CK Hutchison includes 43 additional ports across 23 countries. The deal would shift control of the strategic ports of Balboa and Cristobal into American corporate hands, a move that aligns with the Trump administration’s concerns over foreign influence near the canal. While Panama retains full sovereignty over the canal itself, the presence of Chinese-controlled ports has been flagged as a potential security risk by US officials. Earlier this month, Panama decided not to renew its participation in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), becoming the first Latin American country to exit the program. President José Raúl Mulino announced the decision after discussions with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who raised concerns about China’s expanding influence in the Panama Canal region. BlackRock — headed by billionaire CEO Larry Fink — has briefed both the Trump administration and Congress about the acquisition, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The sale is expected to ease fears about China’s role in Panama’s infrastructure, as Beijing has expanded its presence in the region through state-backed firms. CK Hutchison told the Wall Street Journal that the transaction was “purely commercial in nature” and unrelated to recent political discussions regarding the Panama Canal. Trump has voiced strong concerns over the Panama Canal, claiming that China holds too much influence over its operations. In his inaugural address on Jan. 20, he declared, “China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China; we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” Before taking office, then-President-elect Trump alleged that Panama was charging “exorbitant” fees to American ships, suggesting this violated the Torrijos–Carter Treaties, which transferred the canal from US control to Panama in 1999. He further stated that the canal was “falling into the wrong hands,” implying Chinese influence over its operations. Trump has also indicated that military intervention remains a possibility to counter what he sees as China’s growing control of the canal, emphasizing its strategic importance to US economic security. His statements have sparked strong reactions from Panamanian officials, who insist the Panama Canal remains under their sovereign control and operates independently. They have repeatedly denied any foreign control, particularly by China. Concerns about China’s influence over the canal have been debated in Washington for years. Some policymakers argue that Chinese port operators could monitor US ship movements or use the facilities for potential military operations. However, Panamanian authorities and former US military officials have denied these claims, emphasizing that the ports pose no security threat and that the canal remains neutral. The deal represents BlackRock’s largest-ever infrastructure acquisition and highlights the firm’s growing push into private infrastructure investments. The purchase is being carried out in partnership with BlackRock’s infrastructure arm Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Geneva-based Terminal Investment Limited. BlackRock’s Fink has aggressively expanded the firm’s infrastructure investment strategy, particularly after acquiring GIP in 2023. GIP manages a vast portfolio of energy, transportation, and utilities assets, including London Gatwick Airport, US natural gas pipelines and data centers. If finalized, the BlackRock-led acquisition could mark a significant geopolitical shift, reinforcing American influence in one of the world’s most critical trade routes. The Post has sought comment from BlackRock and the White House. Advertisement

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. An LPG tanker leaves the Miraflores Locks at the Panama Canal, on the outskirts of Panama City, Panama December 17, 2023. REUTERS/Roberto Cisneros A BlackRock-led consortium has reached “in principle” agreements to acquire port assets owned by CK Hutchison Holdings Limited at the Panama Canal. The deal, valued at $22.8 billion, includes port terminals in Panama that have been at the center of geopolitical tensions. The transaction covers two major components: Hutchison Port Holdings’ (“HPH”) 90% interest in Panama Ports Company, which operates the strategically important Balboa and Cristobal ports on opposite ends of the Panama Canal, and CK Hutchison’s 80% controlling interest in companies operating 43 ports with 199 berths across 23 countries. HPH is the port and terminal division of CK Hutchison. Notably, the sale excludes any ports in China and HPH Trust operations in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and South China. This acquisition comes amid heightened scrutiny of Chinese influence over the Panama Canal. During his January 2025 inaugural address, President Trump claimed that “China is operating the canal,” prompting a Senate hearing on China’s growing influence on the Panama Canal. CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate with no ownership ties to the Chinese government, has operated the Balboa and Cristóbal ports since 1997, with concessions that were automatically renewed in 2021 for another 25 years. Importantly, the controversy has centered on the two CK Hutchinson-operated port terminals. The Panama Canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, the independent agency of the Panamanian government that is responsible for the operation and management of the canal. Frank Sixt, Co-Managing Director of CK Hutchison, emphasized that the transaction is “purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports.” The deal is expected to deliver cash proceeds exceeding $19 billion to CK Hutchison after adjustments for minority interests and loan repayments. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described the agreement as “a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP’s combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients,” adding that “these world-class ports facilitate global growth”. The Blackrock-led consortium also includes Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Terminal Investment Limited (TiL). Bayo Ogunlesi, GIP Chairman and CEO, highlighted the consortium’s “substantial expertise in owning and operating ports” and their ambition for the assets “to continue to be world-class ports operators.” Terminal Investment Limited, part of MSC Group (Mediterranean Shipping Company), brings significant maritime industry experience to the consortium. Diego Aponte, Chairman of TiL and President of MSC Group, expressed confidence in the commercial viability of the investment and noted their “longstanding and terrific relationship” with BlackRock and GIP. The Panama Ports transaction will proceed separately, pending confirmation by the Panamanian government of the proposed terms. Definitive documentation for this portion is expected to be signed by April 2, 2025. The broader acquisition will proceed on an expedited basis, subject to due diligence, regulatory approvals, and other standard conditions.

Title: Trump may have less to do with bank's net zero exit than meets the eye

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN analysis Topic:Climate Change Macquarie Bank has become the first Australian bank to pull out of the global Net Zero Banking Alliance. (AAP: Dan Himbrechts) In the wake of Donald Trump's election, Macquarie Bank has become the first Australian bank to pull out of a global initiative supporting banks to reach net zero, but the reasons are more complicated than a straight rejection of climate action. Macquarie's decision came after America's biggest banks withdrew from the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) ahead of Trump's inauguration as US president. A number of Canadian banks also followed suit. In recent years, Republican politicians have been on a warpath against companies that factor climate change into their business decisions and future plans, in what they described as "woke" green capitalism. On face value, these exits are a significant blow to the world's efforts to reduce carbon pollution and cut fossil fuels. But there is more to Macquarie's exit than meets the eye. With record amounts of money flowing into the energy transition and the costs of climate change mounting, banks are increasingly caught between short-term fossil fuel profits, and a strategy that avoids long-term exposure to climate risks and cashes in on the renewables boom. The NZBA was established in 2021 around the time of the Glasgow climate conference among a number of net-zero alliances in the finance industry. President Donald Trump has wasted no time dismantling climate policies and promising a new era of fossil-fuel dominance, withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement on his first day back in office. The aim of these alliances was to help their members transition their investments in line with the Paris Agreement. Under the NZBA, members had to set targets for how they would bring down emissions in their lending and investment portfolios; however, the targets weren't binding. Melbourne Law School's Rebekkah Markey-Towler researches the intersection of financial and climate change regulation. She described net zero goals as an important "north star" for financial organisations, but said it also made business sense to start aligning their long-term decisions with the Paris Agreement. Net zero goals are just one branch of Enviromental, Social and Governance policies, known as ESG. These consider factors like climate change, diversity, or slavery in a company's decisions and investments. The business world's ESG movement sparked a culture war against "woke capitalism", mostly in the US, but with its impact rippling beyond. Opponents of these net zero alliances claimed that the policies "boycotting" fossil fuels worked against the principles of a free market and were tantamount to cartel behaviour. A multi-billion-dollar backlash to net zero followed. Some US states have banned their entities from investing in firms considered hostile to fossil fuels, and Texas pulled $US8.5 billion ($13.7 million) from the world's largest asset manager, Blackrock. And last year, 11 states sued the world's biggest three asset managers under anti-trust laws. Climate alliances started to collapse under the political and legal attacks. The Net Zero Banking Alliance was formed around the time COP 26 was held in Glasgow in 2021. (Supplied: UNFCCC) A few years after the net zero fanfare at Glasgow, the sustained attacks against the financial world's climate shift have hit hard. The net zero alliances covering asset managers, insurers and now banks have all lost members and some have folded, promising to reform and return. Ahead of Trump's January inauguration, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo all withdrew from the NZBA. Big US banks knew where the wind was blowing and left the banking alliance. (Chris Hondros: AFP) Announcing its exit last month, Macquarie said the principles of its net zero strategy "continue to guide activity as our climate strategy evolves to meet the needs of our clients and the requirements of governments and regulators, which differ across markets." "The Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) helped develop global frameworks and assisted member banks as they established their initial decarbonisation plans. With those building blocks now in place, like many peers, Macquarie will no longer be a member of NZBA," its statement read. Criticism of these climate alliances has come from both sides. For the climate community, its biggest criticism has been if they actually result in any reduction in fossil fuel investments or if they are just a veneer of climate concern covering business-as-usual. Jacco Minnaar, an executive at European ethical bank Triodos, took aim at the net zero alliance for allowing member banks to invest in fossil fuels, which drive climate change. Ethical banking executive Jacco Minnaar criticised the Net Zero Banking Alliance for allowing members to continue investing in fossil fuels. (Supplied: Triodos Investment Management) JP Morgan Chase had been a member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance when it invested $US40.8 billion in 2023 into fossil fuels. Similarly, Macquarie Bank had still been investing in companies with oil and gas expansion plans while it was an NZBA member, according to research from energy analyst think tank IEEFA. "In financing practice, there is hardly any difference between banks that are members of a climate alliance and those that are not," Minnaar wrote. His response also highlights how different climate sentiments are in the US compared to Europe, where the green transition is widely accepted and supported in the finance world. Donald Trump's return to the White House hasn't just raised the spectre of a net-zero witch hunt, it's also potentially changed the direction of the US economy. Ultimately, banks have an obligation to follow the trends of the market and make money for their shareholders. Donald Trump's promise to unpick climate policy could be at his peril. At the time of the Glasgow climate conference, green investments were the rage, says Gordon Noble, a research director with the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) who focuses on sustainable finance. "When there were commitments being made around net zero … there was a lot of economic opportunity to do so. In the US, there was the Inflation Reduction Act, there was big money being thrown at effectively incentivising investment into green technology and renewable energy," he explained. Now, Trump's "drill baby drill" mantra is more than just a slogan; he has also signed executive orders to boost the fossil fuel industry. It's not just Trump with his fingers on the scales. Vladamir Putin's invasion of Ukraine caused global coal and gas prices to skyrocket, leading to short-term profits in fossil fuels and putting financial institutions at odds with their green horizons. Russia has already reduced gas supply to Europe, and it's pushing prices up. (Reuters: Denis Sinyakov, file photo) "If your country was heading towards net zero and it's now heading towards drill, baby, drill, if you're a financial institution, your paramount duty is to your shareholders. That's the way the corporation is set up, you are responsible to your shareholders to make a financial profit," Melbourne Law School's Markey-Towler said of the US. "That's the direction that money is travelling at the moment. It's very short term, isn't it?" That's what ESG initiatives were meant to factor in, according to UTS's Gordon Noble, especially for long-term investors like superannuation funds. "The whole argument around ESG from a financial materiality perspective is that issues like climate change are going to play out in your portfolio," he said. For example, an investment in a fossil fuel project scheduled to operate for 30 years might close early and at a loss. Short term, banks believe money is to be made in fossil fuels. (ABC News) Caught in this theoretical long- or short-term play of the financial world are the world's trillions of dollars and the destructive heating of the planet. To bring it back home, the reality in Australia is very different. Being part of a net-zero group does not breach competition laws, as Australia's watchdog made clear in its new guidelines for financial institutions on sustainability and climate action. Instead there is a lot of scrutiny on greenwashing. ASIC, the country's financial agency, has been acting on greenwashing incidents as part of its role to regulate misleading and deceptive conduct in the financial industry. Australia's corporate world is also entering a new era with climate disclosure laws that kick off in the new financial year. Why does this matter? Well, large businesses and corporations will now have to report on what climate action they're taking, what climate goals they have, if any, as well as their emissions and risks relating to climate. Anna Skarbek, CEO of Climateworks Centre, says climate transition plans are becoming standard practice in business. (Supplied: Climateworks Centre) Anna Skarbek, CEO of the Climateworks Centre, an independent not-for-profit within Monash University, says this reporting is in line with international standards. "Climate transition plans are becoming a standard part of business and investment. "Ambitions for this remain strong. We have the tools we need to solve this, now it is just a matter of how fast we can get there." UTS's Gordon Noble believes these new reporting standards will bring a new era of transparency around what corporations are actually doing on climate change. "The challenge will be for those organisations that wish to have their cake and eat it. They wish to have renewable energy investments; they acknowledge that climate change is serious, but also they're going to finance fossil fuels," he said. Despite the instability, investments in clean technology in 2024 were expected to set a new record and double that of fossil fuels. At the same time, banks are increasingly exposed to the impact of hotter temperatures and more extreme weather on their portfolios. It's too early to say whether the retreat of America's wealthiest banks, and one of Australia's, will result in a new gold rush for fossil fuels, or if it's a discreet attempt to avoid the net-zero backlash. As ethical banking executive Jacco Minnaar writes, "This is not the time to lose hope." "Their departure is distressing because it reduces our scope for action, but it also provides an opportunity for a strong 'coalition of the willing' to take the NZBA forward and show what climate action really looks like."

Title: BlackRock Issues Bitcoin Supply Shock Warning, Says There’s Not Enough Coins for US Millionaires
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/03/04/blackrock-issues-bitcoin-supply-shock-warning-says-theres-not-enough-coins-for-us-millionaires/

Full Content:
The largest asset manager in the world says there is not enough Bitcoin (BTC) to meet the demand from American millionaires. In a new report titled “Why bitcoin? A perspective from model portfolio builders,” BlackRock analysts Michael Gates and Brett Wager details how Bitcoin is inelastic to demand, unlike gold. Unlike the yellow metal, the analysts point out that BTC has no ability to meet excess demand with increased supply, as its supply is hard-capped and its inflation schedule is already set in stone. “As many know, there is a predictable issuance schedule of new bitcoin until 2140 with a pre-programmed max supply of 21 million tokens. However, less widely known is that the real available float is likely far smaller, with a conservative estimate of 3 to 4 million issued bitcoins visible on the blockchain but considered permanently inaccessible (and therefore out of circulation) due to lost, forgotten, or otherwise destroyed keys. To illustrate how few available bitcoins there are, if every millionaire in the US asked their financial advisor to get them 1 bitcoin, there wouldn’t be enough.” BlackRock says that its Model Portfolio Solutions team sees several “substantive arguments that support Bitcoin’s long-term investment merit.” “Namely, to potentially serve as a novel store of value and global monetary alternative, hedge to US dollar hegemony and political instability, and proxy play on the broader ‘offline’ to ‘online’ digital transition of goods and services – supercharged by ‘boomer-to-millennial’ demographic tailwinds. Collectively, these features may help provide unique and additive sources of risk premia and diversification to traditional multi-asset portfolios.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $85,381.

Title: Grind school expansion in South Dublin sparks concern among school principals over loss of students
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/03/04/grind-school-expansion-in-south-dublin-sparks-concern-among-school-principals-over-loss-of-students/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T19:02:31Z
Full Content:
One of the country’s fastest-growing grind schools is expanding to include transition year students in a move which some principals fear will draw students away from secondary schools in the South Dublin area. The Dublin Academy of Education in Stillorgan in South Dublin, which has about 340 full-time fifth- and sixth-year students, is oversubscribed and has confirmed that it is moving to a larger premises in Blackrock where it plans to expand enrolment to 500 students in September. The academy, where full-time students pay €10,495 a year, is moving to Frascati House, the old Zurich Insurance building, which is the subject of a €7 million retrofitting project to turn it into a 28,000 square foot campus. Its larger competitor, the Institute of Education on Dublin’s Leeson Street – which has 1,650 students and charges annual fees of up to €11,000 a year – is also oversubscribed. Privately, some school principals in the South Dublin area complain that they are losing students to grind schools during senior cycle against the backdrop of a CAO points race for entry to third level. Some school leaders say students who leave school to move to grind schools risk dropping out of team sports and cultural activities, as well as losing a sense of connection to their school communities, although grind schools dispute this. The Dublin Academy of Education made the announcement on Tuesday as it also disclosed that it is now part of a newly established education group comprising Independent College, International House Dublin and Public Affairs Ireland. The Axis Education Group is jointly held by education entrepreneur Chris Lauder, who founded the Dublin Academy of Education, and investor Donagh Barry. [ Grind schools are booming. Would they offer any advantage in a properly resourced education system?Opens in new window ] The new group employs more than 220 academic and administrative staff and serves over 20,000 learners through in-person and online educational services, with a combined turnover of €20 million. [ ‘We’re fully booked’: How grind schools became big businessOpens in new window ] As part of the group’s establishment, Mr Lauder has taken on the role of group chief executive. Padraig Hourigan – who is president and chief executive of Independent College – recently sold his stake in the company. He has been appointed group director of strategy and partnerships for the Axis Education Group.

Title: Tesla Sales in Europe Suffer from Political Fallout

Both platforms cover financial and business news as well as sport and… More Info Tesla sales are collapsing in Europe as the public are put off by Elon Musk’s vocal support for Donald Trump. It’s an object lesson in how politics can come at a cost to business, says Eliot Wilson Last week it was reported that Tesla sales in Europe fell by 45 per cent in January compared to the same month in 2024, despite the market for electric vehicles being otherwise buoyant. This has led to inevitable speculation that the European public is turning away from the brand because of the high-profile and controversial involvement of its CEO, Elon Musk, in the provocative antics of Donald Trump’s second presidency: politics is costing him money. Let us get some technical aspects out of the way which Musk’s supporters will – with justification – offer in mitigation. First, Tesla sales have tended to dip in January over recent years, though not by such a substantial margin. Second, the company’s Model Y compact crossover SUV, its bestselling model, is undergoing a facelift: the new version was launched in China in January for delivery there and in the United States, Canada and Mexico beginning in March, and it has only just become available to order in Europe. The evidence suggests it is more than this, however. Electrifying.com, an advice site and marketplace for electric vehicles, found that 60 per cent of car buyers have been put off purchasing a Tesla because of Musk’s political views and activities. It is at least a contributory factor. Musk is a deeply unpredictable and volatile personality. His views can change hugely – he supported the Democratic candidate in every presidential election from 2008 to 2020 – but he never pursues his ideology du jour with anything less than absolute and fervent dedication. When he eventually endorsed Donald Trump in July last year, he followed that up with $277m and became the largest individual donor of the election. In the same way, Musk has used his position as head of Trump’s new Doge(Department of Government Efficiency, not in fact a department but a temporary organisation within a rebranded US Digital Service) to attack the bureaucracy of the federal government with an impulsive, reckless ferocity. His supposed efficiency savings, through mass redundancies and unilateral institutional changes, have been carried out with hyper-partisan relish. When you own a social media platform with more than half a billion active monthly users like X, you can be sure your message will be heard. Donald Trump’s popularity in Europe lags far behind his domestic approval ratings. A recent survey showed that in many countries, only a third of people think the president’s re-election is “a good thing” for US citizens, falling to a fifth who expect it to benefit their own country. This will matter not at all to Trump with his relentless “America First” focus, and Musk, who sleeps little anyway, will not lose any of it over associated unpopularity in itself. But the Tesla sales figures suggest that his political reputation is having commercial and financial consequences, even if, as the richest person in the world, he can afford to shrug it off. It is worth noting, however, that Musk’s estimated net worth has fallen by $100bn in the past two months. His wealth, on paper at least, is so great it loses any real meaning: it is comparable to the GDP of Chile or Pakistan. But so substantial a fall demonstrates a relationship which Musk and others on the Trumpian right are eager to point out to their opponents: in business, politics isn’t cost-free. Two of the most totemic objects of hatred for many right-wingers are diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social and governance (ESG). They are regarded as policies which have been foisted on private enterprise by a pious, do-gooding liberal elite – the unrepresentative obsessions of people who are either misguided or actively malign. DEI and ESG are intrinsically political activities, says the Right, and the private sector will suffer financial consequences for pursuing them. It may be, however, that Musk himself is the object lesson in the dangers of politicisation There has been a movement away from these priorities. Last year, BlackRock significantly downgraded its ESG investments with some proposals labelled “overly prescriptive [and] lacking economic merit”. Similarly, whether it is accurate or not, DEI has created a perception of reverse discrimination and a diminution of meritocracy, and is now firmly in the sights of Doge. Musk inevitably took criticism to the extreme in January 2024 after an Alaskan Airlines Boeing 737 MAX suffered a mid-air panel blowout. “Do you want to fly in an airplane where they prioritized DEI hiring over your safety? That is actually happening.” DEI and ESG are intrinsically political activities, says the Right, and the private sector will suffer financial consequences for pursuing them. It may be, however, that Musk himself is the object lesson in the dangers of politicisation. He waded heedlessly into the political arena, and customers are deserting him. Businesses should choose their causes carefully. By CityAM More Top Reads From Oilprice.com Back to homepage Previous Post Will $100B be Enough to Save Europe’s Heavy Industry?

Title: Deal struck to bring ports on both sides of Panama Canal under American control

A Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell its controlling stake in a subsidiary that operates ports near the Panama Canal to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control after President Donald Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane. In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, as well as others in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. The transaction, which must be approved by Panama's government, does not include any interest in a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China. Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Trump and his supporters have also complained about the fees that ships are charged to use the waterway and alleged that China has been operating the canal, an assertion denied by Panama's government. In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports “give China ready observation posts” to take action. “This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,” Cruz said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President José Raúl Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations. Panama quit China’s Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio’s visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing. Belt and Road is Beijing’s global development strategy to build roads, ports and railways to open up new markets. But while much attention was focused on Trump’s threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the ports key ports at either end of the canal. Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over. Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports," Sixt said. In addition to BlackRock, a New York-based global investment management company with $11.6 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, the consortium includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited. BlackRock declined to comment outside of a press release touting the deal. Shares in BlackRock fell 1.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events
