Good morning. When BlackRock CEO Larry Fink became co-chair of the World Economic Forum last year, he called up U.S. President Donald Trump and asked him to come speak, which he did. Fink also called Scott Galloway, an author, podcaster and NYU Stern marketing professor who has a very different view of what will make America great. As Galloway told me last night at our annual Fortune Global Leadership Dinner: “Larry Fink called me and said, ‘I want you to come.’ That was more than enough.” With all the focus at WEF on heads of state—I even joined a media scrum after Trump’s meeting with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky—I thought I’d bring you some insights from my conversation with Galloway. (I first met Galloway in 2009 as a fellow mentor at the Kairos Summit organized by then Wharton student Ankur Jain, who went on to found Bilt Group.) Galloway last attended WEF in 1999. “The call sign of America back then was consumerism; it was more cooperation, alliances. Now, I feel the American brand is chaos, corruption, and coercion,” he said. “America has been the operating system of the world … There’s just a sense of unease … In 1999, we said ‘we want more,’ now we want to make sure things don’t get worse.” He praised Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech as the best of the week. “All 27 member EU states should have been sitting behind him,” Galloway said. “Right now, it’s like Germany and the 26 dwarves.” In soliciting both Galloway and Trump to come to Davos, Fink understands the power of WEF in bringing opposing world views under one roof. I heard Saudi Tourism Minister HE Ahmed Al-Khateeb compare notes with Switzerland Tourism CEO Martin Nydegger, saw Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick chat with random people in the hall, including me, and witnessed dozens of global leaders find areas of commonality at our dinners and lunches. (That’s why I also appreciated having Deloitte, Aon, PMI, Toptal, and Workday sponsor editorial gatherings that let us create our own village greens.) On Monday, I moderated a CEO salon to discuss the results of the 2026 Edelman Trust Barometer, in which 70% of this year’s respondents expressed an “insular” mindset; they don’t want to talk to, work for, or even be in the same space with anyone who doesn’t share their world view. Richard Edelman told me CEOs need to urgently address the sense of grievance that’s consuming the business world. What leaders achieved at Davos is never immediately obvious—the details of the Greenland deal, for one, are still sketchy—but by showing up, Davos participants were at least coming together with an instinct to connect. That’s a good place to start.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Trump sues Dimon, JPMorgan President Donald Trump ramped up his attacks on Jamie Dimon and JPMorgan Chase on Thursday with a $5 billion lawsuit that claims the financial giant “unbanked” the president and his businesses for political reasons. Dimon has recently butted heads with Trump over Fed independence and the president’s plan to cap credit card interest rates. The bank says the lawsuit is without merit. Oil CEOs on Venezuela President Donald Trump has urged U.S. companies to invest in Venezuela’s oil infrastructure, but cheap fuel at home means slimmer profit margins for those companies. “I think everyone feels a bit slighted here,” the CEO of one big U.S. oil company told Fortune. Using AI to ‘solve’ disease Demis Hassabis, the Nobel Prize winner and pioneer behind Google Gemini, gave Fortune’s Allie Garfinkle a rare look inside his latest venture, Isomorphic Labs, an AI drug-design company that aims to create new, breakthrough medicines for some of the most “undruggable” diseases. “We’re trying to build a system, a process…to do maybe dozens of drugs each year,” he says.

Title: Is Ethereum the ‘one common blockchain’? BlackRock CEO weighs in

Fink points to Ethereum as the backbone of institutional tokenization. It’s not a stretch to say the 2025 cycle marked a shift toward “institutionalization.” Sure, while ETF launches in 2024 helped establish credibility and access, they alone didn’t drive meaningful adoption. Instead, adoption really accelerated once “utility-driven” assets moved on-chain. In that context, the Real World Asset (RWA) sector has clearly become the core engine powering institutional participation. Backing this, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has called tokenization necessary and pointed to Ethereum [ETH] as the natural platform for it. The question, then, is whether this is merely theoretical or a case that holds real weight. A statement from a major firm like BlackRock was bound to create a stir. At the World Economic Forum, CEO Larry Fink emphasized the need for rapid adoption of tokenization, highlighting India and Brazil as two developing nations already leading the way with tokenized currencies. However, the real buzz came when Fink mentioned the “One Common Blockchain” to drive this shift. Naturally, market participants started asking which blockchain would fit the vision, with many pointing to Ethereum. Source: RWAxyz Looking at the numbers, the hypotheticals actually hold weight. For instance, Ethereum leads the RWA sector, controlling roughly 60% of the total $22.6 billion RWA market. By comparison, Binance Smart Chain [BSC] comes in second with just 10.2%, underscoring ETH’s dominance. On top of that, BlackRock’s token, BUIDL, has crossed $1.5 billion on Ethereum, while JPMorgan’s MONY token has officially launched, further reinforcing Fink’s narrative about ETH as the platform for tokenization. Given this, along with Ethereum’s RWA dominance and the broader trend of institutionalization, it’s easy to see why CEO Larry’s view that ETH could become the “one common blockchain” for tokenized assets holds weight. Still, at a fundamental level, what does this development actually mean? Larry Fink has repeatedly emphasized one key aspect: Fees. In contrast to TradFi, where buying an asset comes with platform fees, broker commissions, and other costs, purchasing tokenized assets costs much less. As Fink points out, this could become a major differentiator. Given that, the question naturally arises: Does Ethereum deliver on this promise? Even though prices have lagged, 2025 has pushed ETH forward at a fundamental level through its back-to-back major on-chain upgrades. Source: EtherScan The result? Average gas price has dropped to a multi-year low of 0.5 Gwei. At the same time, Glassnode’s latest report shows a sharp spike in Month-over-Month Activity Retention, meaning transactions are rising even as gas fees fall, bringing new wallets onto the network. In this context, Ethereum’s upgrades are doing more than improving technology. Instead, they’re driving real adoption, which makes Larry Fink’s take on ETH as the “one common blockchain” much more tangible. Hence, its dominance in RWA is becoming a major institutional bull case. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Davos 2026: Trump’s Greenland Taco and Carney’s rupture warning
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2026/01/23/davos-2026-trumps-greenland-taco-and-carneys-rupture-warning/

Davos 2026 seemed to collapse into what physicists call a singularity, a point of infinite density from which nothing can escape. Its name was Donald Trump. There were several crises overshadowing this year’s World Economic Forum (WEF) – Russia’s war in Ukraine, AI bubble fears, revolution in Iran but the US president’s increasingly hostile stance on Greenland subsumed everything. The possibility that one Nato member might forcibly take another’s territory is anathema to the forum’s vision of a rules-based, multilateral system. Since his successful military operation in Venezuela at the start of the year, Trump had been ratcheting up the rhetoric on Greenland, hinting at possible military action, threatening tariffs against eight European countries if he didn’t get his way, while deriding Europe as weak and backward. It provoked the biggest rift in transatlantic relations since the second World War, one that will leave scar tissue. His attendance at Davos took on monumental importance, a clash between Trump’s world and the old world. In the end, he Taco-ed (as in Trump always chickens out). Not for the first time, he marched his troops to the top of the hill, triggering a moment of maximum global tension, only to disperse them and leave us all wondering what the hell that was all about. His Greenland climbdown came hours after a rambling speech, in which he asserted America’s supremacy, confused Greenland with Iceland and claimed only “stupid” people buy wind turbines. After a meeting with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, he said he had found a “solution” and was therefore rescinding his tariff threat. Details are scant, but it seems to involve Denmark ceding sovereignty over small areas of Greenland where the US would build military bases, not dissimilar to the UK’s sovereign bases on Cyprus. Talk of Trump’s bid to annex Greenland dominated Davos when Europe’s real security threat is in the east, in Ukraine, where resistance is gradually being worn down. Russia was the “unequivocal winner” in Europe’s rift with the US, said the Republic’s EU commissioner for justice Michael McGrath. Trump paradoxically claims he needs Greenland to fend off Russia’s security threat, while at the same time, he appears to be sympathetic to Russian war demands in Ukraine and inviting Vladimir Putin to join his proposed Board of Peace for Gaza, which had a launch in Davos on Thursday. Either way, his designs on the largely self-governing Danish territory have forced Europe to confront an uncomfortable truth: how much it needs Washington’s money and military might. The grovelling and knee-bending we’ve seen from European leaders over the past year has been cringey and seems only to have fed Trump’s megalomania. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, delivered perhaps the biggest rebuke of the European position, claiming leaders on the Continent were complicit in Trump’s wrecking ball agenda because they have failed to stand up to him. European efforts to negotiate with Trump, he said, were not diplomacy but stupidity. “There’s no diplomacy with Donald Trump: he’s a T.rex. You mate with him, or he devours you,” he said. Newsom, a vocal Trump critic, was barred from entering the US pavilion at Davos, a reflection of the pettiness that now passes for politics in the US. Judging from the hardening of European rhetoric, there’s an acknowledgment that its fawning approach to Trump has failed and that it must get tougher. The prospect of money managers in Europe weaponising capital, selling off US treasuries, was raised earlier this week in a note by Deutsche Bank as a way for the bloc to retaliate in the face of Trump’s continued threats. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy added to the EU-bashing, claiming EU leaders were stuck in “Greenland mode” “Europe must learn how to defend itself,” he said. “Sending 14 or 40 soldiers to Greenland – what is that meant to achieve? What message does that send to Putin? To China? And perhaps, most importantly, what message does it send to Denmark?” But this year’s Davos was a tale of two speeches. If Trump’s represented one side of the geopolitical divide, Canadian prime minister Mark Carney made the case for the other. He pointed out that US hegemony, up to now, had created an imperfect or false rules-based order where the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient and where trade rules were enforced asymmetrically on the basis of economic and military power. But this imperfect rules-based order had been “useful”, helping to provide “public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes”. “We participated in the rituals, and we largely avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality,” Carney said. “This bargain no longer works. Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition. “In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: compete with each other for favour or to combine to create a third path with impact. “[We] argue the middle powers must act together because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu,” he said. Articulate and politically astute, Carney stole the show. Tensions between Europe and the US are unlikely to end with a deal on Greenland (there are even doubts over whether that resolves the row). European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde reportedly walked out of a high-profile Davos dinner, hosted by BlackRock chief Larry Fink, during a speech by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, which was heavily critical of Europe, a flash of what European leaders are really feeling behind their Trump’s appeasement noises. Lutnick was apparently at every gig in town, berating Europe and boasting about America’s superpower economy. In a Bloomberg interview at the event, he argued that outsourcing to low-cost producers failed workers in Ohio and Michigan, crediting the US administration’s tariffs for GM’s (General Motors) 60 per cent yearly stock jump and similar gains at Ford. It was a reminder of where Trump’s economic agenda originates. The US has lost close to five million manufacturing jobs since 2001, the year China joined the World Trade Organisation. The decline has been unprecedented by US standards and has created, or at least compounded, what’s often referred to as a rust belt from the midwest to the Great Lakes, an area that spans from western New York to Michigan and north Illinois and encompasses states like West Virginia, Ohio and Indiana. It was once the backbone of US industry, but it has now become synonymous with economic decline, population loss and urban decay. If Trump’s anti-federalist politicking dominated this year’s Davos, the counternarrative is that he led the largest-ever delegation into the hub of international co-operation and consensus-building. Even Elon Musk, one of the most outspoken critics of the event, wanted in on the action. He has previously criticised the gathering as elitist, unaccountable and disconnected from ordinary people, but got a speaking slot on Thursday. Insiders say many US firms are merely playing along with Trump, even sucking up to him, and perhaps using his power to leverage the EU for less regulation, but behind the scenes, they haven’t changed tack and are secretly hoping he will be hobbled in the upcoming US midterm elections. The polls suggest voters have soured on Trump and the Democrats will win big. Watching Apple boss Tim Cook shower Trump with gifts while announcing big domestic investments gives a false impression of what’s going on, say insiders. These companies haven’t changed their investment plans, haven’t pulled their offshore operations and haven’t changed course in any meaningful way. This might explain why, despite all the noise around Trump’s America First agenda, the Irish Government reported record corporate taxes last year while the IDA, the State’s investment agency, supported a record 323 investments, including 78 “new-name” investments, most of them from the US. On Wednesday, the IDA hosted its annual dinner at the Davos forum, a big set-piece event for the agency to highlight the Republic’s investment credentials. The invite list was kept confidential so US executives could keep their heads below the parapet. Taoiseach Micheál Martin gave the keynote address and the following day held bilaterals with several big US tech companies, including Apple, Meta and Microsoft. He said he had received positive feedback “in terms of the resilience of the Irish economy and the attractiveness of Ireland still as a location for investment”. He also highlighted that the State had been invited to join Trump’s controversial Gaza peace board but said no decision had yet been made. The US president is seeking $1 billion from countries for a permanent place on a board of peace aimed at resolving conflicts. The board was originally intended to oversee the rebuilding of Gaza, but the current iteration has broadened it to global conflicts and does not reference Gaza, a move which critics fear is designed to supplant the UN. Tánaiste Simon Harris said he could not see “any scenario” in which the Republic can participate. Martin, meanwhile, was due to discuss the board at Thursday evening’s emergency meeting of EU leaders. This year’s Davos was pitched as the last-chance saloon to save the old world order. Before the event, WEF president Børge Brende conceded it was taking place against “the most complicated geopolitical backdrop since the WEF was founded”. The think tank’s Global Risks Report, published on the eve of the summit, pinpointed trade wars, actual wars and economic disputes as the biggest threats to global stability in 2026, a reflection of the breakdown in consensus-building. Nonetheless, 56 years after it was founded, its pulling power remains. This year’s event commanded a record attendance with more than 60 heads of state or government, as well as 55 economy and finance ministers, and more than 800 chief executives or chairmen/women of companies. It included a whopping 200 discussion panels. Geopolitics is fraying, but a lot of the old forces remain, not least Davos itself.

Title: Ethereum fundamentals diverge from its price – Is this a bottom signal?

Time Published: 2026-01-23T05:00:10Z

ETH’s price recovery momentum depends on staying above $3,050. Ethereum’s fundamentals have been strong, despite the extended price consolidation observed since late 2025. In fact, according to Altcoin Vector, the altcoin section of the analytics firm Swissblock, the chain recently reached a record of 2.88 million transactions. This could be perceived as massive network usage and broader activity, but Altcoin Vector cautioned that 80% of the activity was “systematic noise” and not high quality. The firm cited recent scaling efforts as the “unintended” impact of cheaper, lower-quality transactions. Source: Altcoin Vector/Swissblock However, other network fundamentals have seen solid growth too. Ethereum staking, for example, crossed 30% for the first time, indicative of a strong appetite for yield and securing the network. On the tokenization boom, inclusive of stablecoins, BlackRock recently noted that Ethereum controls over 65% of the overall tokenized real-world asset (RWA) market. Source: BlackRock According to the world’s largest asset manager, if the traction continues, it could be beneficial to chains like Ethereum. Away from the on-chain fundamentals, there has also been consistent institutional demand for ETH over the past few quarters. Ethereum treasuries, for example, bought 1.2 million ETH in Q4 2025 – A whopping 26% increase on a quarter-to-quarter (QoQ) basis, according to Bitwise. Source: Bitwise Despite solid network traction, Ethereum’s [ETH] price was barely holding above $3k at press time. It was down 40% from the record level of $4.9k hit in 2025. For Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, however, the “divergence” between price and fundamentals might mean a market bottom is close. “That’s the kind of divergence you get at the bottom of bear markets, when sentiment is down, but fundamentals are up. The last time we had such high-contrast data was Q1 2023—after which crypto prices soared for the next two years.” According to Altcoin Vector, for ETH to maintain its mid-term bullish prospect, the $3,050-level must be reclaimed and defended as support. If so, the upside targets would be $3,250 and $3,650. Source: X/Altcoin Vector Otherwise, stalling below $3k could embolden bears to drag the altcoin to $2.600, analysts at Altcoin Vector warned. “Bearish perspective: Consolidating a new downward market structure below this pivot could pave the way for a move toward lows under $2,600.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Show HN: The firmware that got me detained by Swiss Intelligence

Time Published: 2026-01-23T04:26:29Z
Full Content:
We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously. To see all available qualifiers, see our documentation. The firmware that convinced the Swiss State Prosecutor I wasn't a spy. 🚨 See the police report and the device in action on X/Twitter: https://x.com/s_heyneman/status/2014519007244656652 ⚠️ DECLASSIFIED: The source code audited by Swiss Security. Current Status: DECLASSIFIED / RELEASED Security Audit: PASSED (Auditor: "Chris", Swiss Forensic Unit) Duration: 13 Hours This is the exact firmware running on the prototype that caused the WEF Police to designate me a "Category A Threat." Hardware Note: The device that triggered the bomb squad was a dummy unit. It contained a breadboard and 4 bolts hot-glued to the casing. The wires were cut. The "Threat" was purely visual. Audit Note: Cleared by Swiss Forensic Expert "Chris" after reviewing the development logs and verifying the "AI Co-Founder" workflow. Verdict: "Truth Speaking." Military-Grade Encryption: None. It uses Serial.begin(115200). Institutional Verification: Hardcoded tft.println("ENTITY: BLACKROCK") on Line 146 to ensure maximum liquidity. Air-Gap Technology: It has no Wi-Fi chip, therefore it is unhackable. Threat Detection: A digitalRead() on a $2 plastic knob triggers a RED screen that says "RISK: CRITICAL." (This is the line that forced me to explain C++ to a forensic expert at 4 AM). Disclaimer: This code is for educational purposes only. Do not bring this code near a geopolitical summit. I came to the WEF to pitch my hardware startup (Verdico). The device is an air-gapped ledger. Because I haven't raised a Series A yet, the prototype is raw: exposed wires, a motherboard, and two heavy bolts hot-glued to a breadboard. To a VC in San Francisco, it looks like a Seed Round. To the Swiss Police in a high-security zone, it looked like an Improvised Explosive Device. Tuesday night, 11:45 PM at the Belvedere Hotel. I was starving. I saw a tray of salmon rolls, so I set the device down on a wooden counter to grab one. I chatted with a few people, came back 5 minutes later, and the device was gone. The bartender told me: "The police took it." I went to security to explain. They didn't give it back. They detained me. (Review: The prison lasagna is a solid 10/10. Highly recommend). This is where it gets relevant. My release didn't come from a lawyer. It came from a code review. The next morning, the State Prosecutor brought in a forensic technical expert named "Chris." Imagine the most stereotypical systems engineer—long neckbeard, small mustache, extremely serious. He didn't care about my pitch deck; he needed to prove the firmware wasn't a trigger mechanism. We sat in a caged patio area. I opened my laptop and walked a Swiss Federal Agent line-by-line through the repo. The Twist: I had to explain that I am a "vibe coder." I use 16 different Gemini Ultra accounts (to bypass rate limits) and Claude to write the bulk of my code. I literally had to "uncompact" the chat history to prove the provenance of the code to a forensic expert. We went through the crates. We checked the borrowing logic. We verified the "wires" were data buses, not detonators. Because it was Rust, the explicit error handling and type safety made it incredibly easy for him to verify what the device couldn't do (i.e., explode). After an hour, Chris turned to the lead investigator (Officer Meier) and said the two most beautiful words I have ever heard: "Totally good." Officer Meier told me she appreciated my "Truth Speaking." They gave me my shoelaces back and released me. My AI co-founder told me to go to Davos. It got me arrested. But the Rust compiler (and a very thorough forensic audit) got me released. I've open-sourced the repo that the Swiss Government audited. If it's clean enough for them, it's clean enough for you. The "Threat" in Swiss Police evidence bags. POLIZEI Spurensicherung = Police Forensics. The firmware that convinced the Swiss State Prosecutor I wasn't a spy. There was an error while loading.

Prediction markets anticipate potential leadership changes at the Fed with elevated odds for Rick Rieder. Powered by Gloria Traders on prediction markets pushed odds of BlackRock’s Rick Rieder becoming the next Federal Reserve chair to fresh highs as President Donald Trump’s decision nears. Rieder, BlackRock’s bond chief, saw his odds surge to nearly 35% on Kalshi and around 34% on Polymarket on Thursday. While he still trails White House economist Kevin Warsh overall, the gap narrowed over the past 24 hours as Warsh’s odds dropped 7% on Polymarket and 5% on Kalshi. Trump could decide on the next Fed chair as early as next week, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Speaking to CNBC this week, Bessent said the selection process began in September, included eleven candidates, and has now been narrowed down to four finalists whom Trump has personally met. Trump has signaled that he may already have made up his mind. In comments to CNBC at Davos, Trump said the shortlist had narrowed from three to two and “maybe one” candidate after months of interviews. Trump described Rieder as “impressive” while praising all the contenders. Prediction markets anticipate potential leadership changes at the Fed with elevated odds for Rick Rieder.

Title: A.I.’s Data Center Rush Will Create Six-Figure Trade Jobs, Jensen Huang Predicts

Much has been said about A.I.’s potential to replace jobs. But Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is more concerned about A.I. creating a labor shortage—at least in the short term. As tech companies race to build data centers across the U.S. and around the world, they will need tradespeople such as plumbers, electricians and construction workers to make it happen. “This is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history. That’s going to create a lot of jobs,” said Huang during an interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. New labor opportunities will be especially concentrated in the trades, where Huang claims pay has already nearly doubled. Those who help build semiconductor plants, computer factories and data centers will soon be making “six-figure salaries,” according to the executive. “Everyone should be able to make a great living,” said Huang. “You don’t need a Ph.D. in computer science to do so.” The median annual pay for electricians in 2024 was around $62,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It was roughly $46,000 for construction laborers and nearly $63,000 for plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters. Growth for all three professions from 2024 to 2034 is expected to outpace the average occupational growth rate of 3 percent, with demand for electricians in particular surging. The field is projected to expand by 9 percent over the next decade, with about 81,000 openings projected annually on average. The U.S. is already seeing a “significant boom” in these areas, according to Huang—so much so that it has led to a “great shortage” in tradecraft roles. The A.I. boom is expected to worsen a worker deficit the industry was already facing. In December 2022, some 490,000 construction positions went unfilled, according to a McKinsey report, the highest level recorded this century. Huang isn’t the only CEO who believes A.I. will be a boon for trade jobs. Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir, described vocational skills as “very valuable, if not irreplaceable,” while speaking in Davos earlier this week. Ford CEO Jim Farley has made similar arguments on behalf of the blue-collar community, saying the country does not yet have a large enough workforce to support its data center ambitions. “I think the intent is there, but there’s nothing to backfill the ambition,” he told Axios in August. The opportunity for A.I.-driven manual labor jobs won’t be limited to the U.S., Huang added, but will extend around the world as data center construction accelerates. “There is not one country in the world I can imagine where you [don’t] need to have A.I. as part of your infrastructure.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Letters to the Editor, January 23rd: On the hard life of a commuter, the world according to Trump, flu vaccines and speedy passports
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/2026/01/23/letters-to-the-editor-january-23rd-on-the-hard-life-of-a-commuter-the-world-according-to-trump-flu-vaccines-and-speedy-passports/
Time Published: 2026-01-23T01:00:00Z
Full Content:
Sir, – Before commuters rejoice at hearing that affordable housing is only 2½ hours away in Newry, I think every sitting Minister should be encouraged to make use of existing public transport infrastructure so they have critical hands-on experience (“Newry is evolving into a commuter hub for Dublin. The strain is already showing,” January 18th). I’d like to see a Minister sweating on an overheated, overcrowded Dart at 8.15am while it has to mysteriously stop for 10 minutes at Grand Canal station. Add a buggy with a fractious toddler who is heading to the only childcare they could find with places for additional points. Extra points also if it’s lashing rain, or the train is delayed because of leaves on the track. On the way home, the Minister can only leave the office at 5pm but must collect the kids from the creche, minimum 13km away from the office, by 5.45pm. Extra points if the creche is in excess of 15km away from work. I’d like to see a Minister attempt to get to a 9am meeting or lecture on time by taking two buses to cross the city – they can choose whether they’d prefer to start in Blackrock and get to DCU, or start in Phibsboro to get to Belfield. Points deducted for being late. Extra points if they have to wait more than 10 minutes for the connecting bus but still make it on time. After this, we can see how they can live in Clare but commute to work in Cork, or Athlone while living in Leitrim. More challenges can be submitted by commuters across the country. Diary of a Minister on public transport could be the next Irish Times sensation. Give the people what they want. Then we’ll all move to Newry. – Yours, etc, ALISON TREACY, Glenageary, Co Dublin. Sir, – The suggestions to improve transport services outlined by Ola Løkken Nordrum appear eminently sensible (Letters, January 22nd). He might consider submitting them to Dublin Bus, where they could earn €15,000, rather than to The Irish Times. – Yours, etc CONOR McDONNELL, Dundrum, Dublin 16 Flu vaccines and older people Sir, – We know from numerous studies that the standard-dose flu vaccine reduces the incidence of flu and hospitalisation from flu by around 50 per cent, +/– 20 per cent depending on the year and the flu virus type. The argument in favour of high-dose flu vaccine/enhanced flu vaccine in the elderly has been a question of debate. Just published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) are two studies in over 65 year olds. One from Denmark and the second from Spain compare the extra benefits of the enhanced vaccine. In the Danish study, with 332,438 participants who underwent randomisation, 166,218 were assigned to receive the high-dose vaccine and 166,220 to receive the standard-dose vaccine. It showed a reduction in hospital admissions from flu by 43 per cent. The Spanish study randomised 103,169 and it showed a reduction in hospital admissions from flu by 31 per cent. The incidence of serious adverse effects was the same with both vaccines in both studies. The accompanying editorial concluded: “The results of these two trials are consistent with previous data showing incremental benefit of the high-dose vaccine and support the recommendation in the United States that higher-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines are preferred over standard-dose vaccines for adults 65 years of age or older. “In countries that do not yet use high-dose vaccine, these trials provide additional evidence of its benefit for policymakers.” The Department of Health and the HSE will shortly be deciding on whether to get the standard-dose vaccine as they did this year for the over 65 year olds or the higher-dose vaccine. These New England Journal of Medicine published studies will hopefully help them to choose the higher-dose flu vaccine for the elderly and thus lessen hospital admissions of this vulnerable group at a time of year when hospitals are overstretched. – Yours, etc, J BERNARD WALSH, Clinical Professor, St James’s Hospital and Trinity College, Dublin. Dealing with Trump world Sir, – It seems at times like US president Donald Trump is merely a figment of the imagination, a ridiculous illusion conjured up by some kind of fantasy fiction writer. His flurry of maniacal midnight posts on Truth Social, his utter disregard for the transatlantic alliance, even his curious grammatical choices paint a picture of a deeply unserious man. And yet he is dead serious, about everything he says and does. Keith Duggan’s suggestion that 2026 may prove to be Trump’s last year as “the only relevant player on the stage” is not as wild as some may think it to be. It may help to explain just exactly what Trump is doing here (“This might be Donald Trump’s last year as the only relevant player on stage,” January 20th). The 47th US president is shaping his legacy. He no longer cares to the same extent about what the American people think. Instead, he is much more concerned about writing his name into the record books, about how he is viewed in the grand sweep of American presidential history. There is a reason he invoked William McKinley in his inauguration speech exactly a year ago; there is a reason he has refashioned the Monroe Doctrine in his own particular style; there is a reason he is now intent on acquiring Greenland and effectively replacing the United Nations with his so-called Board of Peace. All of these actions are part of an attempt to reshape America and indeed the world order, reinforce American supremacy and write himself into the record books as one of the most consequential presidents in history. The trouble is he is frighteningly good at what he does. Trump, it must be said, often has a point. Many of the arguments he makes are somewhat valid, but his answer to them is to overreach spectacularly. On everything from Arctic security (Greenland), to immigration, to European defence spending and Nato, he starts off with a legitimate grievance, and then goes way beyond what is necessary. He is now emboldened like never before. Expect the legacy building and the overreaching to continue. – Yours, etc, THOMAS CONWAY, Ballina, Co Tipperary. Sir, – Yesterday Donald Trump appeared to confuse Iceland with Greenland, while threatening Denmark because he was upset that Norway had not given him a prize, for among other claims, ending a war between Albania and Azerbaijan. It seems this is less 4D chess, and more Buckaroo with the global world order. – Yours, etc, SHANE O’NEILL, Bishopstown, Cork. Sir, – Listening to the recurring repetitive words of “cool . . . calm, rational dialogue . . . reasonable . . . engagement”, uttered by our Taoiseach Micheál Martin in response to whatever latest crazy outlandish demand comes from US president Donald Trump on managing the world his way, no matter how bizarre or unjust, I would ask him and others in Government: where is our red line? Do we have one? Or are we waiting for the next act in this drama before considering that question? How can you dialogue with a bully? We have seen that strong confrontation is the only thing that works to make Trump step back. Are we in Europe going to continue to dance madly to the tune of a narcissistic, vain, power-grabbing individual suffering delusions of grandeur? Europe does have its own power as outlined in the Opinion piece by Ben Tonra (“This crisis is not ultimately about Greenland. It’s about something much bigger,” January 20th). Political will is what is needed here as in many other areas requiring implementation of necessary, but radical, change for the public good. Can our Government give a lead in the EU and stop bending over backwards in appeasement until our spine breaks? Stand firm and support those in Europe who advocate firm action beyond mere words. It may cost us, but is a time coming when we will have to choose between economic expediency and democratic justice and equality – starting at home? – Yours, etc, INGRID MASTERSON, Churchtown, Dublin 14. Sir, – I often think of neutrality as akin to an altercation between two players on a football field. The row can escalate as players of both teams join in the fracas on behalf of their teammates. Yet some players deliberately choose to remain neutral, recognising that restraint can be more important than involvement. A few days back, Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee voiced her support for the Denmark/ Greenland position against Donald Trump – dangerously joining the voices of the Nato countries. What right had she to do this? Ireland is a neutral country. Our responsibility is to preserve our neutrality, stand apart from international melees, and keep sight of the broader picture. – Yours, etc, PHILIP O’NEILL, Ranelagh, Dublin 6. Israel and Palestine Sir, – On Monday, responding to the news that Ireland has been invited to join US president Donald Trump’s proposed Board of Peace, Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee declared that the UN “has a unique mandate to maintain international peace and security”, and insisted that “Ireland’s commitment to the UN and the primacy of the UN Charter is without question”. On Tuesday, Israeli bulldozers demolished buildings within a UN Palestinian refugee agency compound in Occupied East Jerusalem, with Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, triumphantly posing for a video as the buildings collapsed behind him. Sadly, the self-assurance of Israeli authorities as they commit such blatant acts is entirely warranted; even governments such as ours that routinely invoke their regard for international law and champion the primacy of the UN are utterly unwilling to take concrete action to disincentivise the Israeli state’s expansion in the Occupied West Bank. Between them, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have formed the backbone of successive governments that have blocked the Occupied Territories Bill, by one means or another, for seven years and counting. Their record has been to assure Israeli authorities of continued impunity for such war crimes. Little wonder then that the Israeli government feels emboldened to do as they wish. If our Government stand for anything, they must pass the Occupied Territories Bill in full, and fast. – Yours, etc, BRIAN Ó ÉIGEARTAIGH, Donnybrook, Dublin 4. Still waiting Sir, – Easy peasy to beat Simon Blake’s Christmas postal record (Letters, January 22nd). On December 16th, I posted, in Dunshaughlin, cards to people in Dunshaughlin, a short walk from where I posted the cards. They haven’t arrived yet. I win. – Yours, etc, MARGARET McCANN, Dunshaughlin, Co Meath. Cyclists and safety issues Sir, – I agree wholeheartedly with Mary O’Sullivan (Letters, January 21st) regarding the urgent need for the Government to take action on the introduction of mandatory wearing of hi-vis jackets by cyclists, pedestrians and motorcyclists. Back in 2020, I wrote to the then minister of state with responsibility for road safety, Hildegarde Naughton, to appeal for the introduction of such legislation. I was very disappointed by the response, which was as follows: “To create a statutory obligation on the wearing of reflective clothing would entail making it a criminal offence under Road Traffic legislation for any person guilty of not wearing high visibility clothing. “A person in breach of such a provision would fall to be issued with a fixed charge notice or summonsed to court, depending on what procedure would be put in place for the processing of such offences. Minister Naughton believes that this would prove difficult to enforce and be regarded as a very severe step”. Given that the number of road deaths has increased exponentially since then, exacerbated by the widespread use of e-scooters, it is now time for the officials in the Department of Transport to take a proactive approach and prepare legislation for the obligatory wearing of hi-visibility clothing and substantial on the spot fines for failure to do so. – Yours, etc, ALISON FERGUSSON, Stillorgan, Co Dublin. Inclusion in schools Sir, – I am writing in response to Derval McDonagh’s letter (January 22nd), in which she refers to reforming and resourcing schools so that all schools are appropriate for children. While this ambition is welcome, reform and resourcing alone are not sufficient. The physical infrastructure of many of our schools was not designed with inclusion in mind and continues to present significant barriers. Old buildings with narrow corridors, inaccessible toilets, poor acoustics, lack of sensory spaces, as well as overcrowded classrooms make genuine inclusion impossible for many children with disabilities, medical needs, and neurodivergent profiles. No amount of goodwill or policy reform can compensate for buildings that are fundamentally unsuitable. Too often, inclusion is treated as an attitudinal or pedagogical issue, placing the burden on schools and children to adapt to environments that actively exclude them. This approach avoids the need for sustained capital investment and results in accommodation rather than true inclusion. If all schools are to be appropriate for all children, accessibility and universal design must be treated as non-negotiable foundations. Without addressing the physical reality of our school buildings, claims of inclusive education remain hollow. – Yours, etc, SANDRA DOODY, Stillorgan, Dublin. Smooth operator Sir, – In today’s Letters (January 22nd), Séamus McGowan seemed upset that Frank McNally was creased in his Irish Times on January 21st. Well, he was as smooth as usual in my Irish Times. – Yours, etc, NORA Ní MHAOLCATHA, Knocklyon, Dublin 16. Friendly faces at the airport Sir, – While reading Sean Moncrieff’s column, “There are some things we do better than other countries”, (January 17th), I couldn’t help but recall our experiences travelling through US airports a few years back with our two boys then aged nine and seven. It was shortly after 9/11 and every airport we went through we were met with stern, intimidating immigration officials. On our return, departing from Washington, I was asked to step aside and questioned exhaustively because, it seemed, of a missing stamp of departure from years earlier – the result was we missed our flight back to Dublin. We had to stay overnight and book a new flight the following day. Arriving into Dublin we were greeted by a warm, friendly faced, handsome, curly haired immigration official, who we will remember forever (might have been a Kerry accent). My nine year old said: “Ma, I love Ireland.” – Yours, etc, MARY P O’KANE, Derry. Speedy passport service Sir, – Credit where credit is due: I applied online for passport renewal on Sunday evening, January 18th. The new passport arrived in the post on Wednesday morning, January 21st. Thank you Department of Foreign Affairs. – Yours, etc, TOM CLEARY, Dublin 4. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Elon Musk makes the case for why his $2.2 trillion tech empire is the only way to save humanity as the only intelligent life in the universe
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/22/elon-musk-davos-tech-empire-built-on-idea-humans-only-intelligent-lifeforms-aliens/
Time Published: 2026-01-22T23:11:15Z
Full Content:
Despite Elon Musk’s multiple proclamations that he is an alien—something he reiterated on the stage of the World Economic Forum on Thursday—the billionaire SpaceX CEO thinks it’s very unlikely there is intelligent life beyond Earth. In a conversation in Davos, Switzerland, with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk said this belief is the framework of his technology ventures and $600 billion of wealth. Because there’s a small likelihood of life outside of Earth, Musk said the project of preserving humanity becomes more urgent. I’m often asked, ‘Are there aliens among us?’ And I’ll say that I am one. They don’t believe me,” Musk said, unclear if he was joking or what particular point he was trying to make by asserting his alienness. “Or you’re from the future,” Fink responded, alluding to previous times Musk has called himself a 3,000-year-old time-travelling vampire. “The bottom line is, I think we need to assume that life and consciousness is extremely rare and it might only be us,” Musk added. “And if that’s the case, then we need to do everything possible to ensure that the light of consciousness is not extinguished.” Musk’s vision of protecting humanity manifested more than a decade ago, when he founded OpenAI alongside Sam Altman in 2015 with the hopes of addressing the existential risks and safety concerns associated with the budding technology. He told Fink that Tesla and SpaceX, worth $1.4 trillion and $800 billion, respectively, were an extension of this belief, with the purpose not only to create sustainable technology, but “sustainable abundance.” Musk reiterated his vision of an abundance of humanoid robotics that would make work optional, claiming technology would ease the burden of humans to have jobs or even have money. “With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,” Musk said. “People often talk about solving global poverty, or essentially, how do we make everyone have a very high standard of living? I think the only way to do this is AI and robotics.” The billionaire describes a world with billions of robots—which would outnumber humans—and would serve to complete tasks including caring for children and elderly parents. He predicted that there would be functional humanoid robot technology by the end of the year, and said he expected those robots to be retail available in the next couple of years. To be sure, Tesla’s own Optimus robots have hit snags, continuously falling behind production schedule, with Musk saying as recently as Tuesday that manufacturing for the bots, as well as the Tesla Cybercab, would be “agonizingly slow” before production eventually ramped up. Musk has previously said humans would be able to sustain themselves without work through a universal basic income, but did not provide details on the political steps needed to provide that income to humans. These missions to preserve humanity extend beyond earth. Musk has described his goals as “Mars-shot,” alluding to his hopes to put human life on Mars, efforts he has even touched on in Tesla’s financial filings. The CEO has previously said he envisions Mars as an insurance policy for the future of humanity, wanting to use it as a jumping off point to expand resources to explore human consciousness. “I’ve been asked a few times like, ‘Do I want to die on Mars?’” Musk said on Thursday. “And I’m like, ‘Yes, but just not on impact.’” Musk’s philosophy regarding extraterrestrial life has previously engaged with the Fermi Paradox, a theory positing that there’s both a high change of intelligent life outside of earth—and scant evidence to prove it. In 1950, Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, an architect of the atom bomb, asked a question in a conversation with colleagues at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico: “Where is everybody?” The three-word inquiry launched a 1963 paper by American astronomer Carl Sagan and proliferated in the scientific community, and the popularized Fermi Paradox soon emerged. Musk said in an X post in 2023 that humans “are the only tiny candle of consciousness in an abyss of darkness.” “The scariest answer to the Fermi Paradox is that there are no aliens at all,” he said. In 2022, Musk even commissioned a sculpture depicting the “Fermi Great Filter,” a potential resolution to the Fermi Paradox hypothesizing that intelligent life must face and overcome a series of challenges, including the Great Filter which only few evolved species are able to overcome. The statue shows a giant fork with two diverging paths, indicating the choices a civilization must make to survive: a fork in the road, a motive Musk has oft drawn on. The high-stakes nature associated with Musk’s philosophy has drawn concern, with some arguing this effort to preserve humanity is actually threatening it. Rebecca Charbonneau, a historian at the American Institute of Physics, had a different interpretation of Musk’s philosophy as it pertained to work. In a piece published in Scientific American in February 2025, Charbonneau said Musk’s beliefs around preserving humanity reflected a bigger ideology in the world of tech. Roots in vestiges of Cold War anxieties (the same time period in which the Fermi Paradox emerged), tech leaders often saw a false binary of either limitless prosperity or complete societal collapse, Charbonneau argued. As a result, many in the field, including Musk, are willing to go to extreme measures in the name of avoiding what they perceive as humanity’s demise. “Proponents of this survivalist mindset see it as justifying particular programs of technological escalation at any cost, framing the future as a desperate race against catastrophe rather than a space for multiple thriving possibilities,” Charbonneau wrote. She noted that Musk’s “Fork in the Road,” a strategy he employed both in culling staff at X and in the federal government as de facto leader of DOGE, was reflective of this. Musk called DOGE the “chainsaw of bureaucracy,” promising to shave $2 trillion in federal spending. Instead, the advisory eliminated about $150 billion in spending through headcount reductions and contract cancellations. Federal workers said the cuts made their jobs harder, eliminating valuable resources that resulted in their jobs taking longer, with the quality of the government’s work suffering. Charbonneau argued Musk’s philosophy eliminates opportunities for nuance, making institutions—and humanity—vulnerable to often extreme responses to delicate situations. “By framing humanity’s challenges as simple engineering problems rather than complex systemic ones, technologists position themselves as decisive architects of our future, crafting grand visions that sidestep the messier, necessary work of social, political and collaborative change,” she said.

The Bitwise Proficio Currency Debasement ETF, which trades on the NYSE under the ticker symbol BPRO, is issued in partnership with Proficio Capital Partners, a Boston-based investment advisory firm that manages around $5 billion in assets, according to a press release. The actively-managed fund, which adjusts exposure to various assets in relation to market conditions, will seek to have at least a 25% stake in gold at any point, alongside strategic allocations to silver, platinum, palladium, mining equities, and Bitcoin. Today, the debasement trade has a new weapon in its arsenal. Introducing the Bitwise Proficio Currency Debasement ETF (NYSE: BPRO), a first-of-its-kind, actively managed investment strategy targeting assets poised to benefit from the eroding purchasing power of fiat currencies… pic.twitter.com/kpKPFK26p0 — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) January 22, 2026 The fund’s debut comes as gold and silver prices have respectively climbed 79% and 207% over the past year to new heights, according to Yahoo Finance. Meanwhile, the largest digital asset by market cap has slid 15% over the last year despite hitting a fresh peak above $126,000 in October, according to CoinGecko. Over the past year, the so-called debasement trade has grown in prominence, bolstered by fears that governments, particularly the U.S., could try to finance deficits with cheaper money. The trade is also linked to expectations of money printing and inflation, which has the potential to destroy lots of wealth very fast, according to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan. “My view is that the biggest risk to the long-term financial health of a wealthy family is actually debasement,” he told Decrypt. “I’m not saying that the dollar is going in that direction, but it's lost a lot of value over the last 15 years, and that loss of value is accelerating.” Hougan said the product is designed for financial advisors who may have “0% exposure to something that covers their biggest flank for losing wealth over time,” adding that his son owns a $10 trillion Zimbabwean dollar banknote as a curio. The country faced hyperinflation in 2008. BPRO has an expense ratio of 0.96%, meaning that it’s more costly for investors to hold than Bitwise’s $3.5 billion spot Bitcoin ETF, which features a 0.2% expense ratio. That fund is the fifth-largest spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. by assets under management. Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, has been advising people for at least a year to allocate at least 15% of their portfolios to gold and Bitcoin, warning of a looming debt crisis among major economies. However, he has expressed a strong preference for the precious metal, doubting Bitcoin’s ability to become adopted by central banks. “The big demand category that's driven the gold move was central bank purchases, which started in earnest in 2022,” Hougan said. “Eventually, that excess demand dried up all the available supply, and we got this parabolic move.” Last year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described Bitcoin and gold as “assets of fear.” However, the digital asset has behaved more like a risk-on asset lately, analysts say. Fink said fears over financial and physical security could also drive investors toward the assets. Central banks aren’t buying Bitcoin, but Hougan pointed to spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the demand they’ve seen from institutional investors, as a similar dynamic. Collectively, they’ve been buying more than 100% of the Bitcoin that’s mined each day since their debut in early 2024, he added. “My thesis is, if ETF purchasers continue to buy more than 100% of the supply of Bitcoin, eventually it will have the same parabolic move that gold did,” he said. “It's really just supply and demand, and gold has this extra demand dynamic of central banks that Bitcoin doesn’t have.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2026 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Why Tokenization Took Center Stage at Davos 2026 and What It Signals for Crypto Investors

Time Published: 2026-01-22T22:00:37Z
Full Content:
At the 2026 World Economic Forum in Davos, crypto moved away from price cycles and ideological debates toward a more practical focus: how blockchain is being used inside the global financial system. Across panels, side events, and executive interviews, tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) emerged as the clearest signal of where crypto is heading next. With the value of tokenized assets now exceeding $22 billion, Davos framed tokenization less as an experiment and more as infrastructure in active use. The shift was evident in both the tone and the participants. Rather than startups pitching concepts, conversations featured central bank officials, large asset managers, and executives from firms in the tokenization space. The emphasis shifted from whether blockchain belongs in finance to how quickly it can be scaled. Panels such as “Is Tokenization the Future?” underlined how assets traditionally seen as illiquid, bonds, equities, funds, and real estate, are increasingly represented on-chain. Executives from Coinbase and Ripple, alongside European Central Bank officials, described tokenization as a way to reduce settlement times, improve liquidity, and allow fractional ownership without rebuilding the financial system from scratch. Institutions including BlackRock, BNY Mellon, and Euroclear confirmed they have moved beyond pilot programs and are deploying tokenized instruments at scale. Data shared during the forum showed that the total value locked in tokenized RWAs has passed $22 billion, reflecting broader asset coverage and growing institutional participation. Ethereum currently hosts more than 65% of these assets, underlining its role as the main settlement layer for tokenization activity. Regulatory clarity was repeatedly cited as the key factor behind this momentum. Frameworks finalized in 2025 in the US and parts of Europe provided banks and custodians with clearer rules on issuance, custody, and compliance. In Davos, US President Donald Trump reinforced this direction by pointing to the GENIUS Act, which established a federal framework for payment stablecoins. Stablecoins were described as the “plumbing” connecting traditional finance, decentralized finance, and tokenized assets. Rather than competing with banks, they are increasingly used for settlement, treasury operations, and cross-border transfers. For investors, Davos 2026 suggested that crypto’s next growth phase may be less speculative and more structural. Consulting firms such as McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group estimate that tokenized assets could reach between $2 trillion and $16 trillion by 2030. The focus on regulated products, institutional adoption, and market infrastructure points to a longer-term shift. Tokenization’s rise at Davos indicates that crypto’s role in global finance is being defined less by volatility and more by utility, an important signal for how the sector may evolve in the years ahead.

Title: Nasdaq moves to remove position limits on Bitcoin, Ether ETF options

The filing with the US SEC eliminates contract caps on crypto ETF options, a change Nasdaq argues addresses unequal treatment in derivatives markets. Cointelegraph in your social feed US exchange Nasdaq has filed a rule change with the Securities and Exchange Commission to remove limits on options tied to spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds, in a move to align crypto ETF options with rules applied to other commodity-based funds. The proposal, filed on Jan. 7 and made effective on Wednesday, lifts the existing 25,000-contract limits on options linked to a range of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs listed on Nasdaq, including products from BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, Grayscale, ARK/21Shares and VanEck, according to the filing. The SEC waived its standard 30-day waiting period, allowing the rule change to take effect immediately, while retaining the authority to suspend the change within 60 days if it determines further review is warranted. Options are financial contracts that give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a set price before a certain date. Exchanges and regulators typically impose limits on options trading to reduce the risk of excessive speculation, market manipulation and concentrated positions that could amplify volatility or threaten market stability. Nasdaq said the change would allow the exchange to treat digital assets “in the same manner as all other options that qualify for listing,” arguing that the proposal would eliminate unequal treatment without compromising investor protection. The SEC has opened a comment period on the proposal, with a final determination expected by late February unless the rule is suspended for further review. The filing builds on Nasdaq’s approval late in 2025 to list options on single-asset crypto ETFs as commodity-based trusts, a move that allowed Bitcoin and Ether ETF options to trade on the exchange but left existing position and exercise limits in place. Related: BitGo sets IPO price at $18 as shares to begin trading on NYSE Nasdaq has been steadily expanding its role in crypto markets, from pushing tokenized equities and unifying crypto indexes to loosening derivatives rules around Bitcoin ETFs. In November, Nasdaq filed a proposal with the SEC to raise position limits on options tied to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from 250,000 contracts to 1 million, citing growing demand and arguing that the existing cap constrained hedging and other trading strategies. The same month, Nasdaq’s head of digital assets strategy, Matt Savarese, told CNBC the exchange was prioritizing regulatory approval to offer tokenized versions of its listed stocks, pledging to move quickly through the SEC’s review process as public comments and agency feedback are addressed. In January, Nasdaq and CME Group announced plans to unify their crypto benchmarks, rebranding the Nasdaq Crypto Index as the Nasdaq-CME Crypto Index, a multi-asset index that tracks major cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK), Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX). Nasdaq is a US stock exchange operator that runs electronic markets for equities, derivatives and exchange-traded products and is a major listing venue for technology and growth-oriented companies.

Title: What we learned from Elon Musk's surprise appearance at Davos: not much

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Elon Musk once called Davos "boring af." After his first appearance, some attendees might agree with him. The billionaire took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in a surprise appearance on Thursday for an interview that touched on many points of his sprawling business empire — but offered few new details. Musk has previously avoided the conference, and the Tesla CEO has in the past criticized Davos and its organizing body, the World Economic Forum. Anticipation was therefore high after Musk was unexpectedly added to the schedule on Thursday morning. Interviewed by Larry Fink, the BlackRock CEO and interim WEF cochair, Musk began by explaining Tesla's mission of "abundance for all," largely reiterating comments he's previously made on X and in other interviews. The world's richest man predicted that "ubiquitous" AI and robotics would lead to an unprecedented expansion of the global economy and ultimately render work obsolete, and predicted that "AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively" by 2030 or 2031. "At a certain point, there will be such an abundance of goods and services because my prediction is there'll be more robots than people," Musk said. The billionaire did, however, share a more concrete timeline for Optimus: he expects Tesla to start selling the humanoid robots to the public by the end of next year. Musk didn't address Tesla's robotaxi rollout — another product critical to the company's future — beyond reiterating that he hoped to get approval for its Full Self-Driving technology in Europe and China next month. Investors are keen for details about when the company will remove human safety operators from its service in Austin and begin planned operations in several new US cities. Much of the interview focused on space-based AI data centers, a topic that Musk and other Big Tech CEOs have discussed extensively in recent months. Musk told Fink that SpaceX would begin launching solar-powered AI satellites into space "within a few years," adding that he expected space-based computing to largely solve the wrangling over the vast amounts of energy used to power AI back on earth. "The net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be in space, and that'll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest," said Musk. The SpaceX founder also touched on the longevity trend, saying that ageing was a "solvable problem," but warned that society could "lack vibrancy" if humans were able to live forever. Musk ended his Davos debut with an appeal to optimism, a philosophical conclusion for someone who has previously used public appearances to attack his business rivals and issue eye-catching pronouncements. "I think my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future," Musk said. "Generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and be wrong rather than be a pessimist and right," he added. Jump to

Title: Elon Musk Sure Made Lots of Predictions at Davos

Elon Musk, the richest man on earth, is very good at making money. His track record of predicting the future is less stellar. Through the years, Musk has made several outlandish forecasts—about self-driving cars, about space exploration, about brain chips, about robotics—that have not panned out. The Tesla CEO and former steward of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency seems at least a bit self-aware. During a surprise appearance and his debut at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, he concluded with something like a mission statement: “Generally, for quality of life, it’s better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong than a pessimist and right.” Still, when one’s companies have their hands in so many industries—autos and robotics (Tesla), space travel and telecommunications (SpaceX), social media (X), artificial intelligence (xAI), infrastructure (the Boring Company), and neurotechnology (Neuralink)—even off-the-cuff predictions can move global markets. Here are a few prognostications Musk made on Thursday: Elon Musk opened his Davos remarks—in a conversation with friend and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink—with a discussion of his values, and a few jokes about aliens. “We have 9,000 satellites up there, and not once have we had to maneuver around an alien spaceship,” Musk said. “We need to assume that life and consciousness are extremely rare and it might only be us.” Musk started making promises about Optimus, the company’s humanoid robot, in 2021. Most recently, he said Tesla—now rebranded as a robotics and autonomy company—would make thousands of Optimus robots in 2025. But the company is reportedly still struggling to get Optimus’ hand to work. That did not stop Musk from repeating in Davos some of his most far-reaching claims about the way the product would change human life forever. “If we have ubiquitous AI that is essentially free, or close to it, and ubiquitous robotics, you will have an explosion, an expansion of the global economy that is truly beyond all precedent,” Musk said. What does that mean for you? Billions of robots powered by artificial intelligence will outnumber humans and “saturate all human needs,” he said. “You won’t be able to think of something to ask the robot for at a certain point, there will be such an abundance of goods and services.” But first, of course, Tesla will have to start selling Optimus, which Musk said would happen late next year. In 2025, after years of self-driving promises, Tesla finally launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, albeit with a human safety monitor sitting in each passenger seat. That didn’t stop Musk from asserting that most of the US population would have access to robotaxis by the end of that year. Now, in 2026, Musk is moving the goalposts again. He said Thursday that his company’s robotaxis would be “very widespread by the end of this year in the US.” If history is a guide, that won’t happen—but the company is working on launching robotaxi service in a handful of states with laxer regulations, including Arizona, Florida, and Nevada. Musk acknowledged that he hasn’t spent much time investigating human aging. But he predicted that there would be a solution. “When we find what causes aging, we’ll find it’s incredibly obvious,” he said. Get to it, Silicon Valley peers. SpaceX has been working on its reusable rocket platform Starship for a decade, and in those years, it has missed several of Musk’s big space deadlines. He predicted in 2020 that a crewed Mars mission would launch by 2024. He said that Starship would reach orbit by 2022, though the company didn’t pull it off until last year. At Davos, Musk repeated a promise from last year: that Starship would be fully reusable by the end of this year, cutting space travel costs by “a factor of 100” and eventually allowing space freight to compete with airplane freight prices. SpaceX has run successful test flights recently, but a fully reusable rocket by the end of this year could be a stretch. Musk has been both deeply involved in AI’s development and deeply doomer-y about its meaning for years. (See: his ongoing lawsuits against OpenAI, its founders, and Microsoft.) In Davos, Musk once again mentioned his wish to avoid a Terminator-like future. But he also indicated that it’s coming. “The rate at which AI is progressing, I think we have AI that is smarter than any human this year, and no later than next year,” he said. By 2035, it will be “smarter than all of humanity, collectively.” Per usual, whether Musk gets this one right comes down to definitions. What does “smarter” mean? This month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he didn’t believe researchers were anywhere close to creating what he called “God AI.” The technology is good at discrete tasks, but doing everything? “That ‘someday’ is probably on biblical scales, on galactic scales,” Huang said.

Title: Elon Musk issues worrying prediction about 'living forever' as he says reverse ageing 'is highly likely'

LAD Entertainment LAD Stories Home> News Anish Vij Elon Musk has given his thoughts on whether humans will be able to extend their lives indefinitely. On Thursday (22 January), Musk was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where President Donald Trump delivered an update on Greenland and issued a U-turn on future tariff plans just hours later. "I heard about the formation of the Peace Summit, and I thought is that piece or... a little piece of Greenland, a little piece of Venezuela," the former DOGE head said of the US president's plans. Away from politics, however, Musk began speaking about the future of humanity and explained why he thinks it is 'highly likely' that humans will figure out how to extend life during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, though reverse ageing isn’t something that the Tesla CEO has put a lot of thought into figuring out himself. Advert "I haven’t put much time into ageing stuff. I do think it is a very solvable problem when we figure out what causes ageing, I think we’ll find it’s incredibly obvious, not a subtle thing," he said. "The reason why I say it’s not a subtle thing is that all the cells in your body pretty much age at the same rate, I’ve never seen someone with an old left arm and a young right arm, so why is that? "That means there must be a clock, a synchronising clock, that is synchronising across 35 trillion cells in your body." Despite his optimism, Musk suggested that death is important for society 'because if people do live forever or a very long time then I think there is some risk of an ossification of society, of things getting locked in place'. "It may become stultifying, lacking vibrancy," he continued. "That said, do I think we will figure out ways to extend life and maybe even reverse ageing - I think that is highly likely." Well, one man is trying to achieve 'immortality' in the next 15 years. Bryan Johnson spends about $2 million (£1.4 million) a year to 'stay young' forever, as he's gone as far as injecting himself with his teenage son's blood, as well as his five-hour 'longevity routine'. "We currently do not know how 2039 immortality will be achieved. There are new, promising therapies that can turn back the clock decades, but they’re buggy," he said on X. "Sometimes they mistakenly cause cancer. We gotta fix that. But we know immortality is possible because nature has already solved it. "This isn’t a physics problem like trying to travel faster than the speed of light, it’s a biological engineering problem that evolution has cracked multiple times." "This is what I’ve been doing for six years," he said of biohacking, adding: "As crude as longevity technology is today, the improvements I’ve personally seen are stunning."

Title: BlackRock sees Ethereum as the gatekepper for tokenization even though market share is drifting elsewhere

BlackRock’s tokenization thesis puts 65%+ of tokenized assets on Ethereum, but newer RWA data shows share can drift. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s 2026 Thematic Outlook put Ethereum at the center of its tokenization thesis, asking whether the network could serve as a “toll road.” BlackRock stated that “of tokenized assets 65%+ are on Ethereum.” The framing pushes Ethereum into an infrastructure role rather than a directional call on ETH. A “toll road” model depends on where issuance, settlement and fee payment occur when real-world assets and tokenized cash move onchain. A new comms lead, an institutions portal, and “Get in touch” CTAs suggest Ethereum thinks perception is becoming adoption. BlackRock noted stablecoin transaction volume is adjusted to “strip out inorganic activity (e.g., bots),” citing Coin Metrics and Allium via the Visa Onchain Analytics dashboard. That caveat narrows the metrics investors may rely on when translating tokenization “activity” into economic throughput. A late-January market check shows why the “65%+” figure should be treated as point-in-time. RWA.xyz’s directory view put Ethereum’s tokenized RWA market share at 59.84%, with total value around $12.8 billion at retrieval on Jan. 22. RWA.xyz’s networks view also shows Ethereum leading by value, including a total value (excluding stablecoins) of $13,433,002,447, with the table time-stamped around Jan. 21. The spread between those readings and BlackRock’s Jan. 5 figure leaves room for share drift. That drift can come as issuance expands to other chains and as reporting windows change. For ETH holders, the forward-looking issue is less whether institutions tokenize assets and more whether tokenization routes fee-paying settlement through ETH-bearing paths. BlackRock’s thesis leans toward Ethereum as a base layer for tokenized assets. Yet a base-layer role can be diluted if execution shifts to rollups or if tokenized funds are distributed across multiple L1s where users do not touch ETH. Stablecoins dominate at $267 billion while tokenized Treasuries climb past $7 billion. L2BEAT’s rollup summary shows large pools of value already “secured” by leading Ethereum rollups. Arbitrum One is listed at $17.52 billion, Base at $12.94 billion, and OP Mainnet at $2.33 billion, each labeled Stage 1. That architecture can preserve Ethereum’s settlement role while shifting where users pay fees day to day. Rollup execution economics and fee assets vary by design, and that difference matters for fee capture even if Ethereum remains the underlying security layer. Tokenized cash may become a major throughput driver in tokenization portfolios, and it comes with clearer scenario math. Citi’s stablecoin report modeled 2030 issuance at $1.9 trillion in a base case and $4.0 trillion in a bull case. It paired those balances with a 50x velocity assumption to model roughly $100 trillion and $200 trillion in transaction activity, respectively. The mechanical implication is that even modest market-share changes in settlement networks can matter if activity scales to those levels. Measurement methodology becomes central if investors try to infer fee generation from raw on-chain flows. The banking giant raised its base case projection from $1.6 trillion in its April 2025 forecast, citing accelerated momentum from regulatory clarity and increased integration of the payment network. Visa has argued stablecoin transfer volumes contain “noise.” In an example, Visa said last-30-days stablecoin volume falls from $3.9 trillion to $817.5 billion after removing inorganic activity. BlackRock’s tokenization slide references the same concept of stripping bots, tying its narrative to a narrower definition of economic use. If the “toll road” is meant to be monetized through settlement, the investable variable is organic settlement demand that cannot be cheaply replicated elsewhere, not headline transfer counts. Multi-chain distribution already appears in institutional product design, which complicates any linear “tokenization equals ETH demand” argument. BlackRock’s tokenized fund BUIDL is available on seven blockchains, with cross-chain interoperability enabled by Wormhole. This supports a survival path for non-Ethereum chains as distribution and venue-specific utility layers, even if Ethereum retains a lead in issuance value or settlement credibility. BlackRock's BUIDL leads the RWA market, propelled by over $1 billion investment from Ethena Labs. A separate strand of the debate has focused on whether institutional tokenization ends in one common ledger. During Davos week, that theme circulated on social media through posts featuring remarks from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. World Economic Forum materials published this month support broader claims about tokenization benefits, including fractionalization and faster settlement themes. However, the WEF stops short of validating that verbatim “single blockchain” language in its digital assets outlook for 2026 and tokenization explainer video. For Ethereum’s decentralization thesis, the investable tension is whether a base layer can remain neutral as tokenization becomes tied to large issuers and regulated venues. “Transparency” claims depend on credible resistance to unilateral change and on settlement finality that downstream layers inherit. Today, L2BEAT’s stage framework and value-secured data show rollups scaling under Ethereum’s security umbrella, while BUIDL’s multi-chain rollout shows major issuers also reducing platform concentration risk. BlackRock’s “toll road” slide set a dated market-share marker at 65%+. Late-January RWA dashboards and multi-chain product releases showed the near-term battlefield is share, settlement location, and measurement of organic usage across the RWA sector. That same dynamic is likely to shape how investors interpret growth in tokenized Treasuries and other on-chain issuance categories. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is a reporter, podcast producer, and Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. Funding bleed plus clustered ETH leverage near $2,600–$2,400 sets up a domino path toward that $2,268 threshold. Ethereum sees record growth, but malicious 'address poisoning' campaigns exploit low fees to drive activity. Ripple's strategic alliances and Binance's support set the stage for RLUSD's bid for top three stablecoin status. Despite prominent sell-off, long-term projections hold firm with Bitcoin forecasted to reach $185,500 before the end of the quarter. Closing out 2025, Lista DAO achieved its highest TVL of over $4.5 billion, leading the BNB staking market with nearly 50% and booking over $1 million in monthly revenue twice.

Title: Pinegrove Opportunity Raises $2.2 Billion for New Venture Secondaries Fund

(Bloomberg) -- Pinegrove Opportunity Partners has raised $2.2 billion for its debut fund, closing a large investment round in a fast-growing niche of the venture capital market. The San Francisco-based firm is what’s known as a venture secondary. It buys existing ownership stakes in other venture-backed companies or funds rather than leading primary rounds that may fund a company’s future growth. The venture secondaries market has been growing and attracting interest as the traditional venture capital model has struggled to find liquidity, since startup founders increasingly have opted not to sell their businesses or take them public. “There is a long-term structural shift happening in companies that are staying private longer,” Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer Brian Laibow said. “This illiquidity challenge has rippled across the industry to everyone [from] companies to GPs and LPs.” Founded in 2023, Pinegrove Opportunity Partners has significant backing from Brookfield Asset Management and Sequoia Heritage, which put $500 million into the first fund, the company said. Other limited partners include the Florida State Board of Administration, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named discussing private information. The 16-person team at Pinegrove is led by Laibow, the former managing director of Oaktree Capital Management’s Global Opportunities Fund; Prateek Bhide, a general partner who used to work at D1 Capital Partners; and Gaurav Mathur, a general partner who was a former head of US equity private markets at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Pinegrove plans to deploy a vast majority of its capital directly into mid- to later-stage private technology companies that are nearing profitability by providing flexible liquidity and financing options to founders, venture teams and their investors. The remaining capital will be put into funds or other investment vehicles. The firm’s average check size will be between $50 million to $250 million. Pinegrove has already deployed $1 billion in its debut fund, including through secondary investments in payments provider Stripe, software firm Databricks Inc., and fintech Revolut Ltd. Pinegrove gets access to companies through a variety of ways, including buying secondary shares from an existing investor in a startup, or through buying out a limited partner’s stake in a fund that has exposure to a coveted company. The firm also invests in tender offers, transactions that allow startup staff to sell shares to investors and that are growing in popularity. The venture secondaries market has been booming alongside a similar move in private markets generally. BlackRock Inc. is readying its own such fund and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. just completed its acquisition of Industry Ventures, which owns a venture secondaries arm. As some venture firms raise increasingly bigger war chests, like Andreessen Horowitz’s recent $15 billion funding haul, Pinegrove’s new fund is focusing on secondary shares that can come at a discount or come with access to mature, high-demand startups.

Title: Digital ‘tokenisation’ is reshaping the global financial industry. Is NZ ready?

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.mgd773xcp Share article Print article Imagine investing in a premium Central Otago vineyard, or owning a slice of prime Wellington commercial property, all without needing millions in upfront capital. Through asset “tokenisation”, this is becoming a reality. Essentially, tokenisation converts physical and financial assets into digital records, called tokens, which are stored using blockchain technology. Some tokens represent ownership in the way digital property titles or share certificates do. Others might be used for customer loyalty schemes, digital event tickets to prevent scalping, or a means to make fast, low-cost international payments. The blockchain itself is basically a shared digital ledger distributed across computers, with transactions linked into a cryptographic chain. This decentralisation and transparency makes tokenisation both trustworthy and efficient. For decades, investing in real-world assets has meant navigating lawyers, banks, brokers, registries, mountains of paperwork, hefty transaction costs and prohibitive minimum spends. A $10 million commercial building, for example, might require investors to commit large proportions of the full amount, locking out all but the wealthiest buyers. Tokenisation changes this equation for both buyers and sellers. That same building could be split into 100 digital tokens, each representing 1% ownership worth $100,000. Like owning shares in a company, token holders benefit from rental income and property appreciation proportional to their stake. For sellers, it’s a way to raise capital by attracting many smaller investors rather than a few large ones. Digital assets are already woven into New Zealand’s economy. BlockchainNZ reports nearly NZ$8 billion of digital assets traded annually, with interest in digital assets becoming more common. But New Zealand stands at an important juncture. Existing financial regulations weren’t designed with tokenisation in mind, meaning progress is slow and complex. Industry bodies such as BlockchainNZ, the Banking Association and Payments NZ warn that even slight changes in a token’s features can alter its legal classification, making compliance confusing and expensive. Without clear rules, New Zealand risks losing billions to overseas markets offering greater regulatory certainty. Executives from multinational investment company BlackRock have compared tokenisation today to the internet in 1996, something poised for explosive growth. Accounting firm Deloitte projects US$4 trillion in global real estate will be tokenised by 2035, up from less than US$0.3 trillion in 2024. In November 2025, Australia introduced legislation for digital asset platforms, with Treasurer Jim Chalmers citing potential annual gains of A$24 billion. Dubai launched its first tokenised real estate platform in May 2025, projecting US$16 billion in value by 2033. J.P. Morgan Asset Management has launched MONY, a tokenised cash fund that invests in relatively safe short-term debt securities. BlockChainNZ held New Zealand’s first real estate tokenisation forum in Auckland in July 2025. Industry analysis suggests tokenising just 2–3% of the domestic property market could unlock over NZ$60 billion in transaction volume. New Zealand has genuine advantages: internet penetration exceeds 95% of the population; it is a member of the intergovernmental Digital Nations coalition; and it operates an established digital land-title system, ideal for real estate tokenisation. The regulatory conversation is underway, with the Financial Markets Authority releasing a discussion paper on tokenisation in September 2025. But the Banking Association has identified a critical gap: while existing laws are technology-neutral, they lack clarity for tokenised products. It recommends legislative reviews, controlled testing of tokenised financial products, and guidance for industry participants and consumers on regulation and compliance. Ultimately, New Zealand will need a cohesive framework that actively enables safe innovation. As one industry insider has argued: the rails for tokenisation are being laid now and if we don’t help build them, we’ll be forced to run on tracks designed by others. Tokenisation also brings serious challenges. Local financial laws were written for paper certificates and bank vaults, not digital tokens and blockchain networks. When an Auckland property developer tokenises an apartment building, or a Marlborough winery offers digital shares, which rules apply? Are these securities? Property titles? This uncertainty creates a compliance minefield. Technology risks compound these problems: cybersecurity vulnerabilities, digital key theft or loss, bugs or flaws in blockchain code that hackers can exploit, and malfunctions in the technology infrastructure can all cause irreversible losses. Energy-intensive blockchain systems raise environmental concerns, while weak consumer protections can expose users to fraud and scams. Tokenised assets can be highly volatile, with rapid price swings encouraging speculation and panic selling. Easy round-the-clock trading amplifies boom-and-bust cycles. When everyone can trade with a few clicks, panic can spread rapidly. The Financial Markets Authority has warned that market manipulation becomes easier across multiple unregulated platforms, money laundering may be harder to detect in cross-border transactions, and fraud (from fake tokenised assets to digital Ponzi schemes) can scale quickly. None of this means tokenisation should (or can) be avoided. The challenge for New Zealand is to keep up with this form of financial innovation, and to retain investment dollars that might otherwise migrate to other jurisdictions.

Title: Al Gore, Howard Lutnick and Christine Lagarde: What really happened at that Davos dinner

DAVOS, Switzerland – Al Gore didn’t like what Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had to say at a private dinner here at the World Economic Forum – but other guests were far more receptive, On The Money has learned. In fact, many of the Wall Street and government heavyweights in attendance agreed with the key points of his speech – including the fact that Europe can only grow its tech economy by eliminating a myriad of regulations and taxes that are hindering growth, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Gore, as The Post reported, was angry at Lutnick’s remarks that took aim at globalism, the ideology that puts concerns about the world before country – and how it has shafted the American middle class, hollowing out whole communities as factories are off-shored to cheap labor locales in Asia. When Lutnick stepped offstage, Gore walked up to him and said, “Boo” — like he was trying to scare him, a source told The Post. The former US veep has become one of the world’s leading globalists since leaving government and a hawk on the environment, pushing so-called net zero policies that many believe caused countries to slash energy production, sparking global inflation. During a Tuesday VIP dinner hosted by billionaire BlackRock boss Larry Fink, where several hundred people were invited, Lutnick delivered a speech that was at times fiercely critical of European allies on globalism (he said it had failed so much it is now “dead”). He also underscored that regulations and taxes have plagued the EU economy for years, hindering growth and technology advancements. Lutnick said if the EU reformed its tax code and administrative state, US tech giants would flock there. Those comments were met with many in the crowd nodding in agreement, according to people who were there. “No one walked out during his speech as some reported,” said a person close to Lutnick. One report suggested that Christine Lagarde, the European Central Bank president, bolted during the speech. But multiple sources say she left earlier because she was exhausted after a long day of meetings at the World Economic Forum. “That was just fake news,” the person close to Lutnick added.

Lutnick, meanwhile, also said if Europe wants to continue to push strict environmental standards – so-called net zero carbon emission policies by 2036 – it needs to think twice how it’s achieving those goals. At the moment, the EU continues to buy much of its oil from Russia and its windmill turbines from China, two of the world’s most oppressive regimes. Russia, of course, is being one of the bloodiest conflict on continent since World War II with is invasion of Ukraine. “There was no mass exodus or boos unless you count Al Gore,” the person close to Lutnick said.

Seems even a private invitation-only hoity-toity dinner is not exactly a classy event anymore.

Lagarde left before the speech because she was tired, according to Charlie Gasparino].The soiree was halted before dessert came out, Reuters reported.In a statement to Mediaite on Wednesday, Gore confirmed he heckled Lutnick, but said he wasn’t the only one.The event's theme was 'a spirit of dialogue,' but this had all the dialogue of a soccer match, with cheap-seats razzing, and hooligans aplenty.

Title: Elon Musk says it's 'highly likely' humans figure out how to reverse aging — but there's 'some benefit to death'

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Elon Musk says he thinks aging will one day be solved. The world's richest man said getting older was a "very solvable problem" during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum on Thursday. "When we figure out what causes aging, I think we'll find it's incredibly obvious. It's not a subtle thing," Musk said. "The reason I say it's not a subtle thing is because all the cells in your body, you know, pretty much age at the same rate. I've never seen someone with an old left arm and a young right arm ever in my life, so why is that? There must be a clock that is synchronizing across 35 trillion cells in your body," But Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said there would be some downsides to longer lives. "You know, there is some benefit to death, by the way. There's a reason why we don't actually have a longer lifespan, because if people do live for a very long time, I think there's some risk of an ossification of society. Of things getting locked in place," he said. "It may become stultifying. A lack of vibrancy, but that said, do I think we'll figure out ways to extend life and maybe even reverse aging? I think that's highly likely." Musk's surprise appearance was his first time onstage at the World Economic Forum, which he'd previously called "boring af." His conversation with Fink was wide-ranging, but didn't reveal much new information. Dozens of political and business leaders from across the globe gathered in Davos, Switzerland, this week to attend the World Economic Forum. The guest list included President Donald Trump, who made his case for the US to annex Greenland and the US's economic agenda during his address on Wednesday. Trump's push for Greenland has rattled European leaders and the US markets. It's also shocked Greenlanders, who have spoken against the annexation and the Trump administration. "We're not for sale," one resident said. Trump said the US would not use military force to take Greenland, but has leveraged tariffs against European countries in his campaign. The weeklong event ends on Friday with closing remarks from WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning. Jump to

Title: SpaceX Recruiting Four Wall Street Investment Banks For IPO, Report Says

ByZachary Folk, Forbes Staff. SpaceX is lining up four major Wall Street banks to lead its initial public offering, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, as the space tech company prepares for what could be one of the largest IPOs in history that investors hope could value the company at $1.5 trillion. The banks reportedly include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, according to the Financial Times, although more could get involved in the future. The group is currently selling existing shares to value the company at $800 billion, backing up a report of an insider share sale from Bloomberg last month valuing the company at that target. An investor previously told Forbes a 2026 IPO could value the rocket and satellite company at $1.5 trillion, and could potentially make CEO and majority shareholder Elon Musk a trillionaire. The banks declined to comment to FT, and SpaceX did not immediately return a request for comment from Forbes. The largest IPO in history took place in December 2019 when Saudi Aramco, the Saudi Arabian state-run oil company, went public with a portion of its company. The IPO raised about $29 billion from investors, valuing the petroleum company at a staggering $2.03 trillion. Musk spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday for the first time. Speaking to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the billionaire was bullish on the future of SpaceX, offering ambitious promises about using the company’s technology to reach the Moon and Mars. “SpaceX is about… advancing rocket technology to the point where we can extend life and consciousness beyond Earth to the Moon to Mars eventually to other star systems,” Musk said. The SpaceX CEO also expressed a desire to go to Mars himself, which he said was a six month trip away, although the planets only align every two years. “I’ve been asked a few times, ‘Do I want to, you know, die on Mars?’ And I'm like, ‘Yes, but just not on impact."

As major funds dump holdings, a thin order book means every dollar of selling is now significantly more destructive. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded three straight trading sessions of net outflows this week, totaling $1.58 billion. The pullback follows a brief stretch of positive follow-through, sandwiched between another three-day outflow streak from Jan. 7 – 9 that totaled $1.134 billion, or about $378 million a day leaving the category. Earlier in the month, flows flipped the other way, with more than $1 billion of net inflows over the first two trading days of January and $1.8 billion in inflows between Jan. 12 – 15, setting an early-month risk tone. The swing from fast inflows to a multi-session drawdown has renewed focus on ETF flow prints as a near-term positioning read rather than a passive backdrop. Bitcoin ETFs face record outflows amidst macroeconomic headwinds and dwindling demand. Large outflow days were led by the largest funds, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), arguing against the move being driven by smaller products or idiosyncratic reallocations. When the biggest vehicles lead redemptions, flows are easier to interpret as a broad pullback in real-money demand. They can also feed through to spot-market mechanics because creations and redemptions are ultimately serviced via the fund’s exposure to spot bitcoin, whether delivered in-kind or transacted via cash through the ETF plumbing. That linkage is why multiple negative sessions can matter more than a single print. In an inflow regime, ETFs can provide a steady marginal bid that helps rallies hold and reduces the amount of spot selling required to break key levels. In an outflow regime, that marginal bid thins. Redemptions can add supply at moments when discretionary buyers are already stepping back. The feedback loop becomes more visible when liquidity is lower because the same dollar of selling can move price more. A recent CryptoSlate market note reported order-book depth about 30% below 2025 highs. That is a setup where flow-driven selling can carry more price impact than it would in a deeper book. The macro backdrop adds context for why ETF flows became a “watch this” input in early January. The sharp repricing in Treasurys tied to tariff-related geopolitical uncertainty, with the 10-year yield referenced around the mid-4% range during the move. That mix has tended to pressure high-beta risk exposures when rates volatility rises. Recent crypto drawdowns can be framed alongside a broader risk-off tape, linking Bitcoin’s direction to cross-asset sentiment rather than crypto-specific catalysts alone. In that environment, ETF redemptions become one of the cleaner observable footprints of de-risking. They show what investors are doing in a regulated wrapper that many allocators use for tactical exposure. Positioning around late-January options levels provides another lens for how flows can interact with price. Call open interest clustered around $100,000 into late-January expiries. That keeps attention on whether spot can hold above nearby levels or gets pulled back toward strikes where positioning is dense. If spot hovers below a large call cluster while ETF flows remain negative, rallies can face two headwinds at once: fewer fresh ETF bids and a derivatives landscape where traders may monetize upside attempts rather than chase them. If flows turn and spot holds firm, the same concentration can act as a magnet above price, particularly if dealers’ hedging needs shift as spot moves through strikes. Wall Street's increased Bitcoin ETF shares in Q4 2025 highlight strategic buying during price slides, hinting at a more complex market play. Using the Jan. 7–9 run rate as a simple scenario unit helps translate the story into forward-looking terms without treating flows as destiny. What investors watch next is less about any single number and more about persistence and price reaction. One check is whether redemptions stay concentrated in IBIT and FBTC or broaden across the complex, according to Barron’s coverage of the largest products’ role in major outflow sessions. Another is whether Bitcoin begins to absorb negative flow days without sharp downside follow-through. That can imply sellers are being met with bids away from the ETF channel. If the pattern becomes “outflows and fast declines,” that points to weak spot demand, with lower depth amplifying moves. That is consistent with the microstructure framing in the CryptoSlate note linked above. Rates sensitivity remains a parallel check because yield spikes tied to macro headlines have coincided with risk reduction across assets, according to MarketWatch’s reporting on the Treasury selloff tied to tariff-related uncertainty. There is also a practical caveat: ETF flows can be tactical and can reverse quickly. That includes rebalancing, tax positioning, or basis-driven strategies that do not reflect a long-term view. The market is operating under macro-first constraints, which can push allocators to adjust exposure rapidly as rates move. That is why streak length, the identity of the funds driving the moves, and the market’s ability to hold levels during negative prints tend to carry more information than any one day’s total. European leaders eye U.S. Treasurys as Greenland leverage, risking a one-month yield shock on Americans.

Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. Parity is the target. Why the British Pound could finally collapse against the US dollar after this inflation spike. Yet, new data shows $50 billion in ETF inflows could fundamentally break the four-year cycle and trap retail bears.

Title: Tesla to sell Optimus robots to public next year, Elon Musk says

Tesla will probably sell its Optimus robots to the public by the end of next year, according to chief executive Elon Musk, who has said the carmaker’s fortunes will be increasingly dependent on humanoid machines. The company is already using some of the robots to do simple tasks in its factory, Mr Musk said Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He predicted Optimus would be “doing more complex tasks” by the end of 2026. Sales to the public will begin when Tesla is “confident that it’s very high reliability, very high safety, and the range of functionality is also very high”, Mr Musk said. The comments offer a more concrete timeline for the future business line, which Mr Musk sees as a key focus for Tesla going forward, alongside artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles. The automaker’s core business of selling cars has suffered from a stale product lineup and the loss of EV incentives in the US, leading to two consecutive years of declining deliveries. While Mr Musk regularly talks up the potential of Optimus, he has been relatively vague about production timelines and targets. During a January 2025 earnings call, he said his “very rough guess” was that Tesla would start delivering Optimus robots to other companies in the second half of 2026. [ Michael O’Leary takes aim at ‘liar’ Donald Trump and ‘idiot’ Elon MuskOpens in new window ] Earlier this week, Mr Musk cautioned that initial production of Optimus and Tesla’s newest vehicle, the Cybercab, will be “agonizingly slow.” Tesla shares rose 1.7 per cent in late morning trading in New York. Mr Musk’s appearance in Davos came as a surprise after the world’s richest man was confirmed as a last-minute addition to Thursday’s schedule. He’d previously criticised the forum, calling the annual gathering of the world’s elite “boring” and slammed the WEF as a body that’s “increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don’t want”. He touched on a variety of topics in his conversation with BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, including data centres in space, robotaxis and power generation bottlenecks. Meanwhile, rocket maker SpaceX is lining up investment bankers at four Wall Street firms for leading roles on a blockbuster initial public offering, expected to be one of the largest new listings ever. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are being lined up for senior roles leading the IPO, according to people familiar with the matter. SpaceX executives have held meetings with bankers in recent weeks as the company prepares for an IPO as soon as this year. The group is currently conducting a sale of existing shares that would value it at around $800 billion (€681 billion). Other banks are also likely to land roles on the listing, the people said, cautioning that no final decisions had been taken and the situation could yet change. A SpaceX IPO would seek to raise tens of billions of dollars, probably surpassing Saudi Aramco’s $29 billion raise in 2019 to become the largest ever public listing. - Bloomberg From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Elon Musk warns the U.S. could soon be producing more chips than we can turn on. And China doesn’t have the same issue

Elon Musk warned the biggest issue hampering AI advancement in the United States is a problem Chinese competitors don’t have. In a conversation in Davos, Switzerland, with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk said AI chip production is increasing exponentially, but electrical power is insufficient, hampering the efficiency of AI data centers in training and deploying AI models. “I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said. “It’s clear that we’re very soon—maybe even later this year—we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on.” The U.S. has been grappling with an outdated grid system, the result of decades of underinvestment and an aging infrastructure. As tech companies increasingly rely on grid operators for electrical power, reliability issues and production limitations have threatened the speed of AI implementation, raising investor concerns of an AI bubble and fueling the belief that the U.S. has already lost the battle with Chinese tech. Two massive data centers in Nvidia’s Santa Clara, Calif., hometown may sit empty for years waiting for electricity to power them, according to energy experts. Meanwhile, the massive increase in demand, combined with the need for updated infrastructure, have driven up electricity bills for the average American. Earlier this month, the Trump administration and 13 bipartisan governors mounted pressure on operators of the country’s largest grid, PJM Interconnection, to boost power supply, as well as hold an auction for tech firms to make offers on 15-year contracts to build power plants, which would transfer the cost of electricity away from consumers and to data center operators. “We know that with the demands of AI and the power and the productivity that comes with that, it’s going to transform every job and every company and every industry,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told reporters last week. “But we need to be able to power that in the race that we are in against China.” During his remarks at the gathering in Davos on Wednesday, President Donald Trump encouraged tech companies to build their own nuclear plants amid the AI push, which he claimed the administration would approve in just three weeks—although these historically take years to approve. Just as many AI investors fear, China is already well ahead of the U.S. when it comes to production capacity, and the country isn’t saddled with the same limitations as the U.S., Musk said at Davos. China is primarily reliant on solar power, seen as a less expensive alternative to nuclear power, with quicker deployment and fewer safety risks. “China’s growth in electricity is tremendous,” he said. According to the Global Energy Monitor’s Global Solar Power Tracker, China has nearly four times the amount of operational electricity from solar power than the U.S. Including potential power, China is expected to have 1,118,442 MWac, or electrical power output, from solar energy compared with the U.S.’s 237,947 MWac. “Solar is by far the biggest source of energy,” Musk said. Musk claimed powering the U.S. with solar energy would require very little space, only a 100-mile-by-100-mile square of solar fields needed to power the entire country. But U.S. policies have thwarted efforts to harness and deploy solar power. Despite urging grid operators to take action to increase production capacity, the Trump administration has opposed a pivot to solar energy, stripping subsidies for renewable energy sources it claimed “compromises our electric grid.” The White House did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Tariffs on solar equipment from Asia took effect in May, with import taxes as lofty as 3,500%, following a U.S. International Trade Commission determination that imports of solar modules and cells from Southeast Asian producers in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia were detrimental to U.S. manufacturers. “Unfortunately, in the U.S., the tariff barriers for solar are extremely high,” Musk said. “And that makes the economics of deploying solar artificially high.”

The round was led by Bain Capital’s crypto division and Distributed Global. The funds of numerous prominent crypto investors also participated, including Katie Haun’s Haun Ventures and Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. Superstate builds infrastructure that moves traditional assets, like stocks and government securities, onto blockchain networks including Ethereum and Solana. In the last year, that trend has exploded from a curiosity on Wall Street to a near-standard practice. Industry titan BlackRock’s once-experimental BUIDL fund—a tokenized money market fund— debuted on Ethereum in 2024. It has since grown by several billion dollars and expanded to numerous other blockchains. Traditional finance mainstays have followed suit. Earlier this week, the New York Stock Exchange unveiled an on-chain platform it plans to soon use to facilitate the trading of tokenized stocks and ETFs. SuperState has been a go-to service for companies seeking to bring their assets on-chain—particularly those with crypto ties. It recently helped two Nasdaq-traded firms, Galaxy Digital and Solana Company, tokenize shares. Robert Leshner, Superstate’s CEO, recently told Decrypt he anticipates tokenized stocks will become particularly popular with retail investors once they realize they take those otherwise idle assets into crypto’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, and use them as collateral for all manner of loans. “You can take that money and buy a car or buy a house and leave the system entirely with it,” Leshner said at the time. “I think there’s going to be a lot of really happy investors.” Crypto-native companies have also jumped into tokenized stocks in recent months, seeking to compete with traditional finance firms over market share of the growing trend. Last month, Coinbase debuted a new product, Coinbase Tokenize, which will eventually allow customers to buy and sell on-chain stocks, and also enable institutions to tokenize assets themselves. A report out Wednesday from BlackRock emphasized that as crypto and traditional finance become increasingly intertwined, the financial opportunities within that intersection are becoming increasingly lucrative—and the race to capture that market, more competitive. “You have traditional securities and assets that are looking to be tokenized, and frankly, you have [digital] assets that [...] are making their way into the more traditional financial systems,” Jay Jacobs, the author of the BlackRock report, told Decrypt. “We believe in that convergence that does seem to be accelerating.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2026 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: BlackRock Names Ethereum The “Toll Road” To Tokenization; Here’s What It Means

Time Published: 2026-01-22T17:00:00Z

Written byAaryamann Shrivastava Edited byHarsh Notariya Ethereum’s price recently suffered a sharp decline, briefly dropping below the $3,000 level during heightened market volatility. ETH fell to an intraday low near $2,870 before stabilizing. While the move unsettled short-term traders, BlackRock argues Ethereum’s long-term value lies beyond price action, rooted in its central role in tokenization. BlackRock’s Thematic Outlook 2026 describes Ethereum as the “toll road” for tokenization. The comparison highlights Ethereum’s role as essential infrastructure rather than a speculative asset. As more financial instruments migrate on-chain, networks facilitating issuance, settlement, and compliance stand to benefit structurally. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here. The report notes that about 65% of all tokenized assets currently reside on Ethereum. This dominance gives the network a near-monopolistic position in tokenization markets. Growth in stablecoin usage already reflects tokenization in practice. As adoption expands, Ethereum is positioned to capture consistent network demand. The real-world asset market reinforces this narrative. Tokenized RWAs recently reached a new all-time high of roughly $21 billion in total value locked. Ethereum alone accounts for approximately $11.6 billion of that figure, representing about 55% of the entire RWA market. Such concentration suggests Ethereum’s advantage is compounding rather than eroding. Issuers and institutions tend to build where liquidity, tooling, and security already exist. This dynamic strengthens network effects. Investors appear to be recognizing that Ethereum’s leadership in RWAs could deepen as tokenization scales globally. Long-term holder behavior aligns with this structural outlook. On-chain data shows Ethereum’s net position change turning positive among long-term holders. Selling pressure from this group has faded after weeks of distribution. Accumulation has replaced selling, signaling renewed conviction. Long-term holders often respond to fundamental developments rather than short-term price swings. Their shift toward buying suggests confidence in Ethereum’s role within financial infrastructure. Reduced sell-side pressure from these holders may help ETH regain stability and support a recovery above key psychological levels. Ethereum trades near $2,997 at the time of writing after rebounding from recent lows around $2,870. Price now sits just below the $3,000 threshold, a level closely watched by traders. Holding this zone suggests downside momentum is weakening as buyers re-enter. BlackRock’s acknowledgment of Ethereum’s tokenization role could act as a sentiment catalyst. Improved confidence may help ETH reclaim $3,085 as resistance. A sustained move higher could extend gains toward $3,188, allowing Ethereum to recover a meaningful portion of its recent losses. Downside risk appears limited under current conditions. A bearish scenario would require ETH to fall below $2,925 or $2,885. Losing those supports could expose Ethereum to a drop to $2,796. For now, improving macro signals and long-term accumulation reduce the likelihood of such a move.

Investing Bitcoin dominance near 59% and the Altcoin Season Index at 55 suggest 2026 could mark a full altcoin rotation, mirroring the 2016-2017 and 2020-2021 cycle transitions. XRP ETFs attracted $1.37 billion in under 60 days with 43 consecutive days of positive inflows, while exchange balances fell 57% to 1.7 billion tokens. Ethereum anchors institutional finance through Layer 2 scaling and real-world asset tokenization, with Tom Lee calling it “severely undervalued” and entering a supercycle. Solana hit 27.1 million active addresses in mid-January 2026, a 56% weekly increase, with the Alpenglow upgrade targeting 150ms finality by early 2026. Sending You to Google News in 3 © eamesBot / Shutterstock.com The altcoin season 2026 question comes down to which asset leads the rotation. Bitcoin dominance sits near 59%, keeping a firm grip on market liquidity. Historical patterns tell us this “Bitcoin Season” phase often precedes violent rotation into altcoins. The 2016-2017 and 2020-2021 transitions followed similar setups—and with the Altcoin Season Index climbing to 57 in early January 2026, analysts see conditions forming for “Phase 2” of the current bull run. The question isn’t whether altcoins rally—It’s about which one leads the charge. In this altcoin comparison, we examine XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) across ETF flows, on-chain metrics, institutional adoption, and AI predictions to determine who’s best positioned for the next altcoin crown. 2026 DIAMOND VISUALS / Shutterstock.com XRP enters altcoin season 2026 as the wild card with serious momentum. Unlike previous cycles where legal uncertainty held it back, XRP has repriced its regulatory and political risks. Now it’s positioned as a primary beneficiary of institutional rotation. The defining metric for the XRP in early 2026 is ETF performance. Since spot XRP ETFs launched in late 2025, they’ve recorded cumulative net inflows of over $1.3 billion. Through early January 2026, these funds went 43 consecutive trading days without a single net redemption. That’s a consistency Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs couldn’t match during the same period—Bitcoin bled $1.38 billion while Ethereum lost $351 million. On-chain data adds to the story. Exchange balances for XRP fell from 4 billion to roughly 1.7 billion tokens throughout 2025—a 57% decline. This shrinking pool of available tokens, combined with steady ETF demand, creates structural tightness that hasn’t fully priced in yet. Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick projects a bullish target of $8 for 2026, assuming annual ETF inflows reach $8 to $10 billion. Zakharchuk / Shutterstock.com While XRP captures the “hottest trade” headlines, Ethereum continues serving as the infrastructure backbone for global finance. At $3,300, ETH trades well below its potential according to bulls. Tom Lee of Fundstrat has labeled Ethereum “severely undervalued,” arguing the asset is entering a “supercycle” reminiscent of Bitcoin’s 2017-2021 run. Ethereum’s altcoin season 2026 case rests on three pillars. Real-world asset tokenization has moved from testing to deployment, with BlackRock and JPMorgan launching blockchain-based bonds, equities, and private credit—the vast majority on Ethereum. Layer 2 maturation allows Ethereum to maintain security dominance while offering low-cost execution for mass adoption. And despite ETH ETFs seeing volatile starts with weekly outflows in early January, active addresses sit at cycle highs showing strong organic demand. Tom Lee predicts that as Wall Street realizes profit potential in tokenizing the U.S. dollar through stablecoins, Ethereum’s “ChatGPT moment” will arrive. If Ethereum returns to its historical eight-year average ratio against Bitcoin, it would reach $12,000—and it could hit a staggering $62,000 at 0.25 BTC/ETH ratio. Bitmine has increased exposure to over 4.17 million ETH, representing roughly 3.45% of circulating supply—a significant institutional vote of confidence for the Ethereum. DIAMOND VISUALS / Shutterstock.com Solana has solidified its status as the third major institutional asset class, often outperforming Ethereum in network engagement and retail interest. At $142, SOL trades below its all-time high but with momentum building. In mid-January 2026, Solana’s active addresses reached 27.1 million according to Nansen data—a 56% increase week-over-week—with transaction volumes soaring to 515 million and ranking first across all Layer 1 chains. This network activity supports Solana’s case in the altcoin season 2026 rotation. Solana’s performance edge is set for another leap with the Alpenglow upgrade rolling out in early 2026. The upgrade slashes transaction finality from roughly 12.8 seconds to approximately 150 milliseconds. That’s sub-second finality designed to attract high-frequency trading institutions and payment processors requiring enterprise-grade speed. The “institutionalization” of Solana accelerated in 2025 through Coinbase’s expansion into CFTC-regulated Solana futures. Solana ETF assets under management recently surpassed $1 billion, with Bitwise’s BSOL capturing majority inflows. If Solana holds support above $135-$140, its early 2026 momentum could lead to retesting all-time highs above $260.

Here’s what major AI models project for each asset’s 2026 outlook: XRP AI Predictions: Ethereum AI Predictions: Solana AI Predictions: The spread across models reflects genuine uncertainty about which narrative—institutional settlement (XRP vs Ethereum) or retail adoption (Solana)—will dominate altcoin season 2026. Standard Chartered’s targets lend institutional credibility to the upper ranges of this altcoin comparison. Chinnapong / Shutterstock.com Altcoin seasons aren’t random—they’re products of capital rotation, technological breakthroughs, and investor psychology. In 2017, retail mania propelled XRP to extraordinary heights. In 2021, Ethereum’s DeFi and NFT dominance cemented its institutional role while Solana emerged as the breakout chain for retail users. Now, in altcoin season 2026, the setup looks familiar yet more complex. Bitcoin dominance at 59%, Altcoin Season Index at 57, and ETFs introducing new institutional liquidity. The question isn’t simply which coin rises, but which narrative dominates. Bullish Scenarios: Base Scenarios: Bearish Scenarios: The altcoin season 2026 winner depends on which narrative captures capital. If institutions drive this cycle, Ethereum leads with settlement infrastructure and tokenization. If retail takes over, Solana’s speed and consumer apps give it the edge. XRP remains the wildcard—its ETF momentum and shrinking supply could surprise. Which narrative captures capital first determines the leader of the 2026 altcoin season. It’s important to track the Altcoin Season Index above 75, Bitcoin dominance below 57%, and ETF flow data to see which scenario plays out and which asset wins.

Title: Musk Makes Surprise Appearance At Davos — Here’s What He Said About Greenland And Venezuela

ByMartina Di Licosa, Forbes Staff. Musk shared his hopes of dying on Mars, rehashed his futuristic vision for humanity, and joked about political tensions over U.S interest in Greenland and Venezuela during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos Thursday Morning, a surprise appearance that came after years of publicly disparaging the conference. “I’ve been asked a few times, do you want to die on Mars?” Musk shared during his conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, “And I’m like, yes, but just not on impact,” he added, garnering laughs from the crowd. Musk opened the talk by joking, “I heard about the formation of the peace summit, and I was like, ‘Is that P-I-E-C?’ … A little piece of Greenland, a little piece of Venezuela…all we want is a piece.” Fink focused on Musk’s space and AI-related ventures, leading Musk to reiterate his vision for building advanced humanoid robots, which he said “everyone on earth” is going to have When asked if he had any last words to share, Musk said, “I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future.” Musk’s inclusion in the Davos speaker roster was a last-minute surprise that came a day after President Trump’s speech. “There’s so many myths around Elon Musk,” said Fink towards the end of the conversation, publicly defending him, “He’s a great friend…and I’m totally inspired by what he has done.” Shortly before, Fink told the crowd he wanted to “humanize” Musk, garnering loud laughs. 850 of the world’s top CEOs and 400 top political leaders, including close to 65 heads of state and six G7 leaders, are attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, according to the organization. Musk joins a long list of notable speakers which, in recent days, has included President Donald Trump, President Macron of France, and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. Musk has been critical of the World Economic Forum for years. In 2023, he responded to a video of the event’s opening ceremony posted to Twitter with “How is WEF/Davos even a thing?” adding, “Are they trying to be the boss of Earth!?” He went on to compare the summit to message board 4chan, which is known for being a platform for extremist points of view, joking, “There should be a game show: “4Chan or Davos, who said it?” The year prior, Musk publicly announced that he had declined an invitation to attend the conference, calling it “boring af.” One reason for his past distaste for the yearly summit could be its viewpoint on overpopulation, which the World Economic Forum’s official X account has called “a global challenge.” Musk, who has 14 children and is an advocate for boosting world population, responded to that post with, “Population collapse is an existential problem for humanity, not overpopulation!” This year, he has yet to post about Davos to his X profile.

Title: Elon Musk says at Davos that robots will one day outnumber people

Watch CBS News Updated on: January 22, 2026 / 2:18 PM EST / CBS News Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans. Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as "increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want." Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes "sustainable abundance" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis. "With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all," Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. "People often talk about solving global poverty — how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics." Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are "ubiquitous," which he said would unleash "an explosion in the global economy." "My prediction is there will be more robots than people," he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens. Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing "simple tasks in the factory." "By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public," Musk added. "That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability — you can basically ask it to do anything you like." The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing. Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving. "I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.," he told Fink. "And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully."

Title: Ethereum Holds $3,000 as Whales Accumulate: Key Resistance and Support Levels to Watch

Time Published: 2026-01-22T16:00:35Z

Ethereum (ETH) has stabilized above the $3,000 mark after a sharp sell-off earlier this week, as large holders increased their exposure during the dip. The recovery follows a volatile period in which ETH briefly fell below key technical levels, triggering liquidations and renewed caution across the broader crypto market. On January 22, Ethereum was trading around $3,003, up roughly 1.3% over 24 hours. The rebound came after ETH dropped nearly 13% between January 19 and 21, touching the $2,900 area for the first time in four weeks. That decline coincided with heightened macro uncertainty, ETF outflows, and the liquidation of over $480 million in bullish leveraged positions. On-chain data shows that large Ethereum holders accumulated aggressively during the recent downturn. Whale balances increased by roughly 290,000 ETH over a two-day period, representing purchases worth close to $360 million at current prices. This behavior suggests that some long-term investors view the recent pullback as a buying opportunity. However, other indicators point to a more cautious stance among experienced traders. The smart money index remains below its signal line, a level that has historically been crossed ahead of stronger upside moves. In previous instances, such confirmations preceded double-digit gains, but no such signal has emerged so far. Derivatives data support this wait-and-see approach. ETH perpetual futures funding rates briefly turned negative, indicating reduced confidence among leveraged traders. Options markets have also shown increased demand for downside protection after repeated rejections near the $3,400 level over the past two months. From a technical perspective, Ethereum is trading within a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. Momentum indicators show a bullish divergence, the relative strength index has formed higher lows while the price made lower lows between November and mid-January. This pattern suggests that selling pressure may be weakening, though confirmation is still lacking. The immediate level to watch on the upside is $3,050, a former support zone that ETH lost during the recent sell-off. A sustained daily close above this level would indicate short-term stabilization. Above that, the $3,146–$3,164 range represents a dense supply zone, where approximately 3.4 million ETH have been accumulated. This area is expected to act as a strong resistance.
