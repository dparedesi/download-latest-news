(USD1SWAP members with Bithumb CEO Eric Lee) The summit brought together global industry leaders, capital institutions, and technology innovators to discuss the future of RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization, public blockchain ecosystems, and brand digitalization. Beyond exploring global trends in the digital economy, the event also provided an important platform for USD1SWAP and the MOVA ecosystem to showcase their latest developments. USD1SWAP: Bridging the Real and Digital Asset Worlds As a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, USD1SWAP became one of the highlights of the event. USD1SWAP’s Chief Marketing Officer, Smith, delivered a keynote speech elaborating on the project’s strategic positioning within the global digital economy—particularly focusing on liquidity solutions and decentralized financial infrastructure built on the MOVA blockchain. Smith emphasized that USD1SWAP aims to provide a secure and transparent channel for global asset exchange through innovative cross-chain liquidity protocols and intelligent risk control systems. “In the future, USD1SWAP will be more than just a decentralized trading platform—it will become a vital bridge between traditional finance and the Web3 world,” said Smith. As a major application on the MOVA chain, USD1SWAP is driving the tokenization of real-world assets, opening new possibilities for the circulation of digital assets worldwide. Global Collaboration in RWA Tokenization and Brand Digitalization The summit centered on two major themes: RWA tokenization and brand digital transformation—both of which align with USD1SWAP’s long-term strategic direction. Smith noted that as stablecoin models and cross-chain technologies mature, traditional assets such as real estate, energy, and commodities are entering a new era of digital transformation. “Digital assets are no longer confined to cryptocurrencies—they are increasingly linked to real-world asset value, forming an entirely new global capital structure,” Smith explained. Through its RWA on-chain protocol, USD1SWAP enables liquidity and value mapping for real assets, helping traditional financial assets transition smoothly into the decentralized digital economy. This strategy complements the MOVA ecosystem, jointly advancing asset digitalization and public blockchain development—ultimately creating a seamless, secure cross-chain value exchange network for users worldwide. MOVA: Strategic Partnership Empowering USD1SWAP’s Growth As a core component of the MOVA blockchain, USD1SWAP collaborates closely with MOVA on asset mapping, cross-chain liquidity, and brand digitalization initiatives. MOVA CEO Wael Muhaisen also delivered an inspiring address at the summit, highlighting the pivotal role of the MOVA chain in advancing decentralized finance and brand ecosystems. Wael noted that MOVA is not just a smart contract platform—it is the foundational engine for global decentralized asset exchange and ownership verification. The distinguished guests at the summit discussed the latest trends in RWA tokenization and cross-chain liquidity in the global financial market, offering strategic insights and validation for the USD1SWAP and MOVA ecosystems. By fostering deep integration among global capital markets, governments, and technology sectors, USD1SWAP is not only laying the technological groundwork for decentralized finance but also providing strong momentum for the convergence of capital and innovation.

Title: The Next Chapter For Crypto: Legislative Clarity, Institutional Support Set Stage For Major Growth

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The crypto market, despite experiencing throughout the year major price fluctuations, security incidents, and legal hurdles, has experienced remarkable growth. This can be attributed to the expansion of digital asset treasuries (DATs), increased institutional adoption, and new initiatives aimed at integrating digital assets, particularly stablecoins, into traditional financial sectors. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) recently shared their projections for the crypto landscape for the remainder of the year and years to come, highlighting nine key trends expected to be major catalysts for the industry. Firstly, market structure legislation in the US is expected to emerge as a critical priority for policymakers and Congress, establishing a clear regulatory framework that supports crypto developers. The passage of the GENIUS Act in July of this year also marked a pivotal moment, garnering bipartisan support and providing builders with much-needed certainty in their endeavors. Secondly, the adoption of stablecoins is set to accelerate as network effects take hold among financial institutions, merchants, and consumers, thereby enhancing the global standing of the US dollar. Furthermore, major players like JPMorgan, Citi, BlackRock, and Fidelity are amplifying their crypto offerings through new product launches, partnerships, and acquisitions. The infrastructure supporting blockchain technology is also advancing rapidly. Current networks can process over 3,400 transactions per second, marking a 100-fold increase over the past five years. Moreover, a new wave of real-world assets (RWAs) is transitioning onto the blockchain as the worlds of crypto and traditional finance converge. The market for tokenized real-world assets has expanded to nearly $30 billion, with significant contributions from Treasuries, money market funds, and private credit. In parallel, the crypto sector is attracting a growing pool of talent, driven by a more favorable regulatory environment and the emergence of new opportunities for developers. The focus on revenue generation is also shifting within the token ecosystem. More tokens are implementing fee mechanisms, redirecting attention toward fundamental value. In the past year, users have paid $33 billion in fees, resulting in $18 billion for projects and $4 billion for token holders. Innovative consumer products are also expected to drive the next wave of crypto adoption. Although approximately 716 million people now own cryptocurrency, only 40 to 70 million are considered active users. Ultimately, 2025 is poised to lay the groundwork and establish the foundations for the years to come. It is expected to be a transformative year for the crypto industry, characterized by widespread institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and tangible utility.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed the names of five candidates to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the powerful Federal Reserve next year WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed the names of five candidates to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the powerful Federal Reserve next year. On an Air Force One flight to Asia with President Donald Trump, Bessent said he would engage in a second round of interviews in the coming weeks and present a “good slate” of candidates to Trump “right after Thanksgiving.” Trump said he expected to decide on Powell's replacement by the end of this year. The five people under consideration are: Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman; former Fed governor Kevin Warsh; White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett; and Rick Rieder, senior managing director at asset manager BlackRock. The names suggest that no matter who is picked, there will likely be big changes coming to the Federal Reserve next year. Bessent, who is leading the search for Powell's replacement, last month published extensive criticisms of the Fed and some of the policies it has pursued from the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009 to the pandemic. Trump on Monday, meanwhile, repeated his long-standing attacks on Powell, charging that he has been too slow to cut interest rates. “We have a person that’s not at all smart right now," Trump said, referring to Powell. “He should have been much lower, much sooner.” The Fed is expected to lower its key rate Wednesday for the second time this year. Trump's goal of selecting a new chair by the end of this year could reflect some of the tricky elements surrounding Powell's status. His term as chair ends next May, but he could remain on the Fed's board as one of seven governors until January 2028, an unusual but not entirely unprecedented step. Such a move would deprive Trump of an opportunity to nominate another governor for several years. Still, current governor Stephen Miran was appointed by Trump Sept. 16 to finish an unexpired term that ends next Jan. 31. Trump could nominate his candidate to replace Powell for that seat, and then elevate that person to chair in May after Powell steps down. Hassett is currently the chair of the National Economic Council at the White House and was also a top Trump adviser in the president's first term, and a frequent defender of the administration's policies on television. His longtime loyalty to the president could give him an edge, some Fed watchers say. Warsh is a former economic advisor in the George W. Bush administration and was appointed to the Fed's governing board in 2006 at age 35, making him the youngest Fed governor in history. He left the board in 2011. Warsh is now a fellow at the Hoover Institution and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Waller was appointed to the Fed by Trump in 2020, and quickly established himself as an independent voice. He began pushing for rate cuts in July and dissented at that meeting in favor of a quarter-point cut, when the Fed decided to leave its key rate unchanged. But he voted to reduce rates just a quarter-point in September, along with 10 other Fed officials, while Miran dissented in favor of a half-point. Michelle Bowman is the Fed's vice chair of supervision, making her the nation's top banking regulator. She was appointed by Trump in 2018, and before that was Kansas' state bank commissioner. Bowman also dissented in favor a rate cut in July, then voted with her colleagues last month for a quarter-point reduction. Rieder has the most financial markets experience of any of the candidates and has worked for Wall Street firms since 1987. Rieder joined BlackRock in 2009. His focus is in fixed income and he oversees the management of roughly $2.4 trillion in assets. Bessent has set out a wide-ranging critique of the Fed while interviewing for Powell's replacement. In particular, he has criticized the central bank for continuing unconventional policies, such as purchasing Treasury bonds in order to lower longer-term interest rates, long after after such steps were justified, in his view, by emergency conditions. “It is essential the Fed commit to scaling back its distortionary impact on markets," Bessent wrote. “It also likely requires an honest, independent, and nonpartisan review of the entire institution and all of its activities.” Bessent's criticisms aren't entirely new, but they have gained greater traction in the wake of the 2021-22 inflation surge. The Fed is mandated by Congress to seek stable prices as well as maximum employment. Bessent's critiques have also inevitably been tangled up with Trump's insistent calls for lower interest rates, which have threatened the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics. Trump has also taken the unprecedented step of trying to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee, to open another seat on the board for him to fill. Cook has sued to keep her seat and the Supreme Court has allowed Cook to remain on the board while it considers the case. Trump's attacks on the central bank have left some longtime Fed critics skeptical of the Trump administration's approach. Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian and professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, cautioned against placing “loyalists” on the Fed “who are there to push the president’s narrative.” “Those are the ones that we want as his advisers and spokespeople and his lawyers, not his central bankers,” he said.

Rieder has the most financial markets experience of any of the candidates and has worked for Wall Street firms since 1987. Rieder joined BlackRock in 2009. His focus is in fixed income and he oversees the management of roughly $2.4 trillion in assets. Bessent has set out a wide-ranging critique of the Fed while interviewing for Powell’s replacement. In particular, he has criticized the central bank for continuing unconventional policies, such as purchasing Treasury bonds in order to lower longer-term interest rates, long after after such steps were justified, in his view, by emergency conditions. “It is essential the Fed commit to scaling back its distortionary impact on markets,” Bessent wrote. “It also likely requires an honest, independent, and nonpartisan review of the entire institution and all of its activities.” Bessent’s criticisms aren’t entirely new, but they have gained greater traction in the wake of the 2021-22 inflation surge. The Fed is mandated by Congress to seek stable prices as well as maximum employment. Bessent’s critiques have also inevitably been tangled up with Trump’s insistent calls for lower interest rates, which have threatened the Fed’s independence from day-to-day politics. Trump has also taken the unprecedented step of trying to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee, to open another seat on the board for him to fill. Cook has sued to keep her seat and the Supreme Court has allowed Cook to remain on the board while it considers the case. Trump’s attacks on the central bank have left some longtime Fed critics skeptical of the Trump administration’s approach. Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian and professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, cautioned against placing “loyalists” on the Fed “who are there to push the president’s narrative.” “Those are the ones that we want as his advisers and spokespeople and his lawyers, not his central bankers,” he said.

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed the names of five candidates to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the powerful Federal Reserve next year. On an Air Force One flight to Asia with President Donald Trump, Bessent said he would engage in a second round of interviews in the coming weeks and present a “good slate” of candidates to Trump “right after Thanksgiving.” Trump said he expected to decide on Powell’s replacement by the end of this year. The five people under consideration are: Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman; former Fed governor Kevin Warsh; White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett; and Rick Rieder, senior managing director at asset manager BlackRock. The names suggest that no matter who is picked, there will likely be big changes coming to the Federal Reserve next year. Bessent, who is leading the search for Powell’s replacement, last month published extensive criticisms of the Fed and some of the policies it has pursued from the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009 to the pandemic. Trump on Monday, meanwhile, repeated his long-standing attacks on Powell, charging that he has been too slow to cut interest rates. “We have a person that’s not at all smart right now,” Trump said, referring to Powell. “He should have been much lower, much sooner.” The Fed is expected to lower its key rate Wednesday for the second time this year. Trump’s goal of selecting a new chair by the end of this year could reflect some of the tricky elements surrounding Powell’s status. His term as chair ends next May, but he could remain on the Fed’s board as one of seven governors until January 2028, an unusual but not entirely unprecedented step. Such a move would deprive Trump of an opportunity to nominate another governor for several years. Still, current governor Stephen Miran was appointed by Trump Sept. 16 to finish an unexpired term that ends next Jan. 31. Trump could nominate his candidate to replace Powell for that seat, and then elevate that person to chair in May after Powell steps down. Hassett is currently the chair of the National Economic Council at the White House and was also a top Trump adviser in the president’s first term, and a frequent defender of the administration’s policies on television. His longtime loyalty to the president could give him an edge, some Fed watchers say. Warsh is a former economic advisor in the George W. Bush administration and was appointed to the Fed’s governing board in 2006 at age 35, making him the youngest Fed governor in history. He left the board in 2011. Warsh is now a fellow at the Hoover Institution and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Waller was appointed to the Fed by Trump in 2020, and quickly established himself as an independent voice. He began pushing for rate cuts in July and dissented at that meeting in favor of a quarter-point cut, when the Fed decided to leave its key rate unchanged. But he voted to reduce rates just a quarter-point in September, along with 10 other Fed officials, while Miran dissented in favor of a half-point. Michelle Bowman is the Fed’s vice chair of supervision, making her the nation’s top banking regulator. She was appointed by Trump in 2018, and before that was Kansas’ state bank commissioner. Bowman also dissented in favor a rate cut in July, then voted with her colleagues last month for a quarter-point reduction. Rieder has the most financial markets experience of any of the candidates and has worked for Wall Street firms since 1987. Rieder joined BlackRock in 2009. His focus is in fixed income and he oversees the management of roughly $2.4 trillion in assets. Bessent has set out a wide-ranging critique of the Fed while interviewing for Powell’s replacement.

Full Content:
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed President Donald Trump has five potential successors to serve as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s successor when his term ends in May 2026. On Air Force One Monday, Bessent told reporters Trump is considering nominating Kevin Hassett, former Kevin Warsh, Michelle Bowman, Christopher Waller, or Rick Rieder to replace Powell. The Federal Reserve Chair serves a four-year term, which is renewable. However, Trump has been vocal about wanting to replace Powell, whom he sees as an obstacle to enacting his economic agenda and rescuing America’s middle class from the decline it had under the Biden administration. While all of Trump’s potential replacements are described as inflation hawks who generally favor interest rate cuts, their stances differ on supporting Trump’s ambitious economic agenda, which includes lower interest rates to boost growth, reduce debt servicing costs, and support policies like tariffs. President Trump says he expects to make a decision on the next Fed Chair before the end of the year. Bessent confirms the five finalists to reporters on Air Force One: – Governor Christopher Waller – Governor Michelle Bowman – Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh – NEC Director… — annmarie hordern (@annmarie) October 27, 2025 Kevin Hassett (White House Economic Adviser): Hassett, as Trump’s longest-serving economic advisor and National Economic Council (NEC) Director, is among the leading candidates to be the next Fed chair, according to a July Washington Post article. He has been a vocal critic of Powell’s tenure at the Federal Reserve and has publicly argued that rates should be at least three percentage points lower than they are now. He has accused Powell and the rest of the board of partisanship in decision-making for refusing to cut rates, the Economic Times reported. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!) While he publicly supports Fed independence from political influence, his alignment with Trump’s economic policies, including tariffs, suggests he would prioritize lower rates to reduce debt costs and stimulate the economy. During Trump’s first term, Hassett championed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, defending it as a driver of middle-class benefits through increased investment and earnings growth. He has advocated pro-growth stimulus and tax policies to achieve 4 % GDP growth, emphasizing opportunities for the middle class. Kevin Hassett is both kind and brilliant. As Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, he has been instrumental in advancing this Admin’s pro-growth economic agenda & lifting America’s hard-working families. Kevin is a dear friend & will be missed! Thankful for his service! — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) June 7, 2019 This makes Hassett the most likely to support an economic agenda that promotes middle-class growth. Kevin Warsh (Former Fed Governor): Warsh served on the Fed Board under the administration of former President George W. Bush. Like Hassett, Warsh has criticized the Fed’s decision not to cut interest rates. In April, speaking at a conference organized by the Group of Thirty, an international body of financiers and academics, Warsh urged the Fed to stop relying on “stale” government data in setting monetary policy. He also warned against sharing their “latest musings” on economic forecasts, as it makes it harder to secure “stable prices and full employment.” Kevin Warsh on Fox Business: The Fed can “lower interest rates a lot” to get mortgage rates down. Warsh also says the Fed should shrink its balance sheet to “redeploy that money to Main Street so that Main Street can have the strong economy that we’re seeing in financial… — Nick Timiraos (@NickTimiraos) October 24, 2025 “The more the Fed opines on matters outside of its remit, the more it jeopardizes its ability to ensure stable prices and full employment, and the more vulnerable it becomes to the body politic,” Warsh said, adding, “Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope, encroaching further on other macroeconomic domains.” While Warsh has been a vocal critic of the Fed board since his departure, he has historically been staunchly pro-free trade, which clashes with Trump’s tariff policies, making him slightly less aligned with aggressive middle-class-focused fiscal agendas than Hassett. Michelle Bowman (Current Fed Governor): Bowman, a Trump appointee from 2018, has repeatedly signaled that she supports raising rates to combat inflation if it does not reach the Fed’s 2% inflation target, rather than Trump’s wish for massive rate cuts to induce rapid easing to stimulate the economy. Bowman’s preference for restrictive monetary policies makes her among the least likely to advance Trump’s agenda to cut rates. However, Bowman’s desire to push gradual rate adjustments to maintain full employment and economic resilience aligns exceptionally well with Trump’s plan to grow the middle class. They may not see eye to eye on how to get there, but their end goal seems the same. Christopher Waller (Current Fed Governor): Waller, another Trump appointee from 2020, supported massive rate hikes during the Biden Administration to combat rising prices. Similar to Bowman, Waller advocates gradual rate adjustments to maintain the Fed’s progress on slowing inflation without overstimulating the economy. His balanced approach aligns somewhat with Trump’s push for lower rates. Still, his emphasis on data-driven caution runs counter to Warsh’s view that government data is an unreliable marker because it is constantly revised. Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller: “We need to start cutting rates at the next meeting… Over the next 3-6 months, we could see multiple cuts coming in.” pic.twitter.com/LLqx6biszH — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) September 3, 2025 He has analyzed the inflationary effects of tariffs and advocates cautious rate cuts to avoid labor-market risks. And while Waller supports stable growth, there is no indication that his monetary policies would help a middle-class boom. Rick Rieder (BlackRock Executive): Unlike the other four picks, Rieder has never worked on the Federal Reserve Board or in any federal economic role. Instead, Rieder comes from the private sector, serving as BlackRock’s chief investment officer for global fixed income. He is a veteran of the bond market. He aligns with Trump’s economic agenda, which argues that the Fed’s high interest rates could contribute to inflation by boosting corporate incomes and spending while restricting middle-class growth. However, like Waller, Rieder sees Trump’s trademark tariffs as an inflation driver. Despite his tariff concerns, he supports rate cuts. Rieder is a unique choice as he’s one of the few who focus on U.S. growth driven by AI. As a fixed-income investor, he favors lower rates and opportunities in income-generating assets, which could indirectly benefit middle-class savers. However, his focus is not on growing America’s middle class, but rather market growth, making him less likely to push Trump’s middle-class agenda if it conflicts with his more market-oriented agenda. (ROOKE: Biden Deep Stater Sings Trump’s Praises On Foreign Policy Wins) Of the five possible Powell replacements, Hassett seems most focused on middle-class growth. And while his Fed Chair role would center strictly on monetary tools rather than policies, he could coordinate closely with Trump’s economic agenda to amplify the middle class.

Title: Inside BlackRock’s Approach to Systematic Investing

Jeff Shen, co-head of BlackRock Systematic Equities, discusses in depth how his team uses data and technology to generate consistent alpha. October 27, 2025 In a world where asset managers strive to differentiate themselves from the competition and capture the attention of financial advisors, one approach has been systematic investing. Systematic investing involves using a repeatable, rules-based process, often paired with the use of technology, to come up with investment recommendations based on insights gleaned from both traditional economic and alternative data. According to BlackRock Systematic, a division of global investment giant BlackRock with $336 billion in AUM, its approach to systematic investing is aimed at delivering consistent alpha returns, even through periods of market volatility. Over a five-year period, BlackRock Systematic claims that roughly 90% of its funds have outperformed peer medians. BlackRock’s Systematic investing team, which comprises 230 people globally, has experimented with techniques such as using machine learning for portfolio construction and works on an investment horizon of three to four months, according to Jeff Shen, PhD, co-chief investment officer and co-head of BlackRock Systematic Equities. The number of market signals the team relies on to make its investment decisions has grown from just three when it started in 1985 to over 1,000 today. WealthManagement.com recently spoke to Shen about the evolution of systematic investing approach, what types of data sets it uses, how it incorporates AI and large language models into the process and why Shen’s team focuses on active equities strategies. Related:Wealth Management Invest: Building Resilient Portfolios with Vanguard’s Todd Schlanger This Q&A has been edited for length, style and clarity. WM: Can you talk about how BlackRock’s approach to systematic investing is different from competitors? Jeff Shen: What we do is try to take interesting data—could be traditional data, could be alternative data—and use advanced techniques, such as machine learning, AI and translate that data through modern techniques into forecasts for active portfolios. We are hoping it will generate consistent and differentiated alpha over different market cycles. Compared to our competitors, what sets us apart is the usage of alternative data through modern techniques, especially learning AI systems. Also, having an investment horizon that’s three to four months is a little bit distinctive. A lot of quant shops can have pretty short investment horizons, sometimes intra-day. For us, it’s an intermediate horizon. The last thing I want to mention is that we think about this as a team sport. It’s 230 people working together across the globe, across asset classes and trying to bring that together in one platform. Related:Morningstar: Short-Term Active Fund Outperformance Is Often Random WM: Can you give me some examples of the alternative data you’ve mentioned? JS: One is a macro example. The labor market is certainly a big variable that the Federal Reserve looks at very carefully. We have been looking at job posting data over the past six to seven years. At any moment in time in the U.S., there are about 30 million job postings populated on different websites—company websites, some of the aggregated websites. That gives you a bit of a sense of the health of the economy, who’s hiring, the velocity of hiring, wage inflation because some of the postings indicate their wage range. In that way, you can get a bit of a sense of the propensity of the labor market, the health of the labor market, but also forward-looking inflation indications. It covers both private and public companies, so it gives you a pretty good sense of the overall labor market. A second example has a little more to do with social media information. We are not interested in individual posts, but the aggregated market sentiment we can draw from social media to use a company as a unit of analysis and see what people, whether retail investors or maybe other firms, are saying about different stocks. And then we try to draw a little bit of the retail sentiment through social media on different companies. Related:Orion Unveils Portfolios Combining Direct Indexing, Third-Party Models The technology underneath it is the use of language processing, and large language models clearly come into play as well. WM: What has changed over the past several years in terms of the kind of data and tools you might be using? What new techniques are you seeing rapidly developed in this field? JS: If you go to the last couple of years, one obvious one is the large language model. ChatGPT was released about two years ago. We had a couple of natural language processing insights that we were already using to transform our technology six or seven months before the release of ChatGPT. Nevertheless, we are using a lot of those technologies, generative AI, large language models, to read through a lot of these alternative data sets and social media, financial news, regulatory filings. You can really think about using machines to read through a lot of these texts, to try read between the lines, to try to find sentiment and interesting insights. That stack of technology continues to evolve, and there are a lot more exciting things on the horizon—multi-language, multi-modal. In addition to text, think about voice, video, image. The less obvious development has to do with thinking about using machine learning for portfolio construction. Mean variance optimization—maximize returns, minimize risk—has been around for a long time, and there have been pretty interesting developments in using machine learning, using neural networks in particular, for portfolio construction. That part may come as a bit differentiating and may be a surprise to people. We don’t really see too much application of that type of technology in portfolio construction, but we’ve been doing quite a bit of work on that over the past couple of years, and it has been showing quite a bit of promise. WM: When it comes to using AI in your work, can you talk about the main advantages it offers and maybe some of the limitations of AI in the field of systematic investment? JS: Maybe I define AI in the narrow sense. When people talk about AI it probably has more to do with the generative AI or large language models. But in the broader sense, if you look at any of the AI book, that’s just one part. A very important part, but there are a lot of other things that are the bread and butter of AI. I’ll focus on generative AI and large language models first. The benefits are that these things are very good at reading texts and finding insights, meanings, and investment theses. So, we’ve applied that in our security selection, some of the macro investments. In that sense, it’s played the role of a financial analyst. With that investment analysis piece, you can use generative AI and large language model to not only provide efficiency, but to provide scalability. You can do this beyond one stock or one company at a time. You can do it on a large scale 24/7 with very timely updates. That creates huge efficiency and productivity, but also there is precision in terms of finding meaning from the text aspect of it. In terms of the limitations, clearly, there are two things. One is the generic large language model that you can get from a third party—Open AI, or Gemini, or Anthropic. It doesn’t necessarily cater to financial services as a vertical. So, there are limitations on deep understanding of the particular domain. The second limitation that’s particular to systematic investing is that time is an interesting challenge for large language models. If you were to do a back test or simulation, you need to make sure that the large language model only knows up to that particular time what’s going on in the world. Otherwise, you get this very strong peek-ahead bias by using an off-the-shelf large language model. If you ask, “Is Nvidia a good investment or not?” today, a large language model knows it’s a phenomenal investment. But would it be able to think about Nvidia without that knowledge in the simulation set 10 years ago? So, point in time in a large language model is certainly an important part. The last part that I want to raise is to zoom it out slightly. I do think there is a lot of excitement about generative AI and large language models, but there is a whole list of additional technologies and systems that we use that I don’t hear people talking about too much. There is reinforcement learning. There is deep learning. There is a lot more depth in AI. The fortunate thing is that a big part of our group is based in San Francisco, so we’ve had the front row seat to AI revolution for the past 15, 16 years. That’s why we are investing heavily into the space. WM: A lot of the focus in systematic investment is delivering alpha. In the past couple of years, there has been a particular focus on actively managed funds to achieve that. However, from the research we’ve seen from Morningstar, as well as comments we’ve gotten from financial advisors, it’s tough for any given fund to outperform beyond the short term. How do you deal with this dilemma, and where does the systematic investing approach come in? JS: Active management is definitely not easy. It’s a zero-sum game. From our perspective, the benefit is our history. Our U.S. equity fund was launched in September 1985. So, we have a 40-year track record of trying to beat the S&P 500, and it’s done very much that. We’ve also expanded our universe internationally, in global markets, emerging markets. There is definitely the difficulty for active managers to outperform. We come with a certain level of confidence, legacy and history. But on a forward-looking basis, to deliver that consistency of alpha over time, in our mind, it’s about innovation and innovation at scale. You’ve got to think about new insights and what’s going to be driving the market, which is always going to be a little bit different from what was driving the market before. I do think using AI and machine learning and things we have been talking about to essentially build scale for investment is becoming more important. When I say “scale,” it means “how many data sets do you have?” We spend millions and millions of dollars every year on data—technology, systems development. We are also using the BlackRock scale and reach. Trying to drive that scale for the benefit of alpha generation to try to deliver that consistency is a differentiator relative to some of the maybe smaller-scale players. WM: How do you work with financial advisors on all this? JS: We have three main sets of products that we engage with financial advisors on. There are quite a few benchmark-driven active mutual funds that we help to run to try and deliver returns that are above and beyond the S&P 500. We do have market-neutral liquid alts funds. We have a Global Equity Market Neutral Fund [BDMIX] that has actually been around for a while and is gaining quite a bit of traction, given that it’s got market-neutral characteristics. But it still delivers that alpha return for advisors. (Over a five-year period, BDMIX delivered a total return of 10.85%. The Morningstar average for the category is 7.14%.) And we’ve also gotten a few active ETFs that have gained traction. We’ve got a rotation series—it’s rotating between different factors, different themes. And we’ve got some income active ETFs as well. So, active ETFs is another way to engage with the financial advisors. WM: Among these three types of products, do you find that they appeal to different segments of the advisor ecosystem? JS: It’s a bit more firm-specific. There are people who certainly prefer an ETF type of vehicle. For model builders, active ETFs can be quite attractive. For the benchmark-driven mutual funds, clearly, among some of the wirehouses, there is quite a bit of interest in that. It’s consistent alpha with a reasonable fee, and that’s why there is a lot of traction there. And then the liquid alts fund [BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy Fund (BIMBX)], from a portfolio construction perspective, the advisors are essentially using it as a fixed-income replacement, as a diversifier in a portfolio. We’ve seen a high rate of adoption for that across RIAs and wirehouses. So that appeals across the spectrum. [BIMBX has delivered a total return of 4.94% over a 10-year period compared to a Morningstar category average of 3.02%.] WM: What do you include in the definition of “liquid alts”? JS: We have essentially a global equity market-neutral long-short fund. In any given country or sector, we go long on a bunch of names or short a bunch of names to keep it reasonably market-neutral so there is not too much of a net exposure. It’s very similar to a long-short equity hedge fund, but it has all of the liquid alts characteristics associated with it. It’s a daily liquidity fund. But if you take the return we generate in it and correlate it to the S&P 500, you will have a correlation pretty much close to zero. WM: In terms of building up your capabilities, have you made any outside firm acquisitions in recent years? JS: Within the BlackRock systematic group, we haven’t made any acquisitions. On the overall talent perspective, we’ve continued to invest. It’s really been an ongoing journey, investing in technology, data science, AI, machine learning, talent. What we do here, given this three-to-four month investment horizon, is try to get people who have finance/economic background, alongside people who have engineering/computer science/machine learning background and blend the two to solve the problem. From the talent strategy perspective, we’ve been continuously trying to hire top talent. One thing I want to mention that BlackRock as a firm has an AI lab that has been a firm commitment for the last six, seven years and there are a few Stanford/Berkeley professors we’ve been working with.

Anticipation is building ahead of Ripple Swell 2025, the company’s flagship conference scheduled for November 4 to 5 in New York, with a welcome reception on November 3. This year’s edition is set against a backdrop of growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, and Ripple is bringing some of the world’s most powerful financial names to the stage. For the first time, the event will feature an extensive lineup of speakers from the White House and major traditional finance institutions, including BlackRock, Nasdaq, Bloomberg, and Citi. Ripple’s 2025 edition of the Swell event is turning out to be filled with the biggest roster yet. Ripple has confirmed that the 2025 edition of Swell will host top executives from some of the largest names in both the crypto industry and in traditional finance. Among the notable names are Maxwell Stein, Director of Digital Assets at BlackRock; Adena Friedman, Chief Executive Officer at Nasdaq; Sandy Kaul, Head of Innovation at Franklin Templeton; and Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management. Other confirmed participants include senior representatives from Citi, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, Mastercard, CME Group, Moody’s, State Street, DBS Bank, Bloomberg, and Société Générale, among many others. This roster of names is the strongest representation of traditional finance in Swell’s eight-year history. Each of these executives brings deep institutional experience in asset management, banking, and capital markets, areas that are now embracing tokenization, digital payments, and blockchain settlement, and where Ripple is looking to become a major player. Nobody wants to be left behind in the blockchain/crypto movement. Therefore, discussions are expected to focus on how these institutions are preparing to integrate blockchain-based systems into global finance, particularly for cross-border transactions, stablecoin infrastructure, and regulated digital-asset investment products. Observers are also going to be watching for major announcements from Ripple at Swell, like new partnerships, new tokenization offerings, developments regarding Ripple’s RLUSD, institutional partnerships, and possibly some information regarding the launch of Spot XRP ETFs in the US. “From stablecoins and payments to regulation and real-world adoption, Swell brings together the conversations shaping the future of finance,” noted Ripple in a social media post. Adding a new dimension to this year’s event is the confirmed participation of Patrick J. Witt, Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisors on Digital Assets (PCADA). Witt, who serves directly under the White House, will be making his first appearance at Ripple Swell, making this the first time in the event’s history that a sitting US government official has joined the speaker lineup since 2018. The inclusion of a White House voice at Swell 2025 upgrades the conference’s importance beyond the crypto community. It also shows the crypto-positive approach held by the current US administration.

Title: The Fed 5: Bessent's short list for Powell's job

EJ Antoni, chief economist at The Heritage Foundation, explains why the Fed has been behind the curve in managing monetary policy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has whittled down his short list of candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to five individuals, he said on Air Force One, The Wall Street Journal reported. Some have connections to the central bank and the White House, while another is a Wall Street powerhouse. President Donald Trump has kept up his verbal criticism of Powell for not cutting interest rates fast or deep enough, calling the chairman a "stubborn moron" and "Jerome Too Late Powell", among other things in social media posts and publicly. Bessent plans to brief Trump on the candidates in full after Thanksgiving, although Powell's term as chairman ends on May 15, 2026. FOX Business takes a look at the contenders ahead of the Federal Reserve’s October meeting on Wednesday in which policymakers are seen cutting interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering the target to a range of 3.75% to 4%. The anticipated rate cut follows the same move the Fed made at its September meeting. Markets also expect another rate cut of that size at the Fed's subsequent meeting in December. TRUMP SLAMS POWELL AS 'MORON' AND CALLS FOR FED'S BOARD TO TAKE CONTROL OF POLICY MOVES Here's the list in alphabetical order. Michelle Bowman was one of the first dissenters at the July meeting. (Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg/Getty Images / Getty Images) Federal Reserve Governor Bowman, who also serves as the Fed's vice chair for supervision, became one of the first dissenters at the July meeting, favoring rate cuts, while the central bank left rates unchanged. She has also made her case for future rates through year-end. Kevin Hassett is the director of the National Economic Council. (Allison Robbert/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Hassett is on his second spin through Trump's orbit. He is the director of the National Economic Council. In the first Trump administration, he was a senior advisor and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Both agencies work in tandem with the White House on economic policies. Hassett said the latest consumer inflation data, which showed a less-than-expected 3% annual increase, is a sign costs are falling. "Our expectation is that inflation is decelerating and that will take all the pressure off the Fed to keep on the path that they are on," he said during an interview on FOX Business Network's "Varney & Co." FED EXPECTED RATE CUT COMES WITH OTHER DILEMMAS FOR CENTRAL BANK BlackRock Global Allocation Team Head Rick Rieder predicts the Fed's next moves on interest rates on 'The Claman Countdown.' Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, oversees $3.2 trillion in customer assets for the world's largest asset manager. BlackRock has more than $10 trillion under management. During an interview with FOX Business' Liz Claman in August, Reider was asked about being considered for the role. "When I first heard it, I thought it'd be the greatest honor of my life. I mean, to actually be considered in a position like that and think about the responsibility, and quite frankly, what I thought about is the ability, and I think why serving your country is such a powerful dynamic, is the ability to help people through monetary policy, through economic transmission, is really powerful," he said. CHEVRON CEO TOUTS AMERICA'S ENERGY COMEBACK Christopher Waller, (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) Waller, like his colleague Bowman, was also among the dissenters in July. The duo signaled a growing divide within the Federal Reserve, which has come under fire for waiting too long to cut rates amid higher inflation and a slowing labor market. WALLER, BOWMAN EXPLAIN DISSENTS AMID FED PRESSURE Former Federal Reserve Board Gov. Kevin Warsh discusses the significance of ADP ending data sharing with the Federal Reserve and the return of inflation data on ‘Maria Bartiromo’s Wall Street.’ The former Federal Reserve governor, who was one of the early contenders for Fed chair, has been a longtime critic of the central bank. "I think their track record is really quite poor in forecasting the growth of the economy from policies like the ones the president put in place. And their inflation forecasts have been terrible, too. That's why they were so late, and that's why we had this surge of inflation that's done the most harm to the hardest-working Americans among us. So, that track record, I think, still matters," he said during an appearance on "Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street." READ MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS FOX Business' Eric Revell contributed to this report.

Title: Coffee Break: American Politics Follow the Money & Power Edition
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/10/follow-the-money-power-trump-mellon-mamdani-east-wing-bunker.html
Time Published: 2025-10-27T18:00:20Z
Full Content:
Follow the money has been a rule of thumb for understanding American politics since the Watergate scandals of the 1970s, but in the Trump 2.0 era it should be expanded to include following the kinetic power as well. Let’s dive right in and start with the Trump Family, for, as we’ve been reminded by John Helmer, Trump is primarily motivated by personal (and familial) profit. Follow the Money With Drones: The Trump Family Business Just in: Florida-based Unusual Machines, a little-known drone company backed by Donald Trump Jr, said the US army had contracted it to manufacture 3,500 drone motors, alongside various other drone parts. https://t.co/7tgpoLaeIn pic.twitter.com/FBh29vhXgY — Financial Times (@FT) October 24, 2025 In a way, Trump’s devotion to being the pater familias of a political grift dynasty is touching. Along with his sense of humor, and taste for junk food, it’s one of his more relatable traits. The Financial Times has the latest on Donald Trump, Jr.’s latest score, who knew he was a drone builder? A little-known drone company backed by Donald Trump Jr has won its largest contract from the Pentagon, as the US government expands its procurement of the drones. Florida-based Unusual Machines, in which Trump Jr has held a $4mn stake, said the US army had contracted it to manufacture 3,500 drone motors, alongside various other drone parts. The company added the army indicated it planned to order an additional 20,000 components from Unusual Machines next year. Allan Evans, the company’s chief executive, said he believed it was the largest order for Unusual Machines parts from the US government to date, but declined to disclose the value of the contract. … Shares in Unusual Machines jumped as much as 13 per cent on Friday. Unusual Machines brought Trump Jr on as an adviser in November 2024. The Financial Times earlier this year found shares in the company almost tripled in price in the weeks leading up to its disclosure of the move. Soon after Trump Jr came on board, Unusual Machines disclosed he owned 331,580 shares, which would currently be worth roughly $4mn. Trump Jr is not required to disclose whether he has since sold any of his stake, but Evans earlier this year said the president’s son had continued to invest in recent fundraising rounds. … Unusual Machines has struck deals with other US defence suppliers in recent months, inking a $12.8mn agreement with Strategic Logix in September and a $1.6mn deal with an unnamed domestic defence drone maker in August. The company, which is working on manufacturing more of its components in the US, has also been harmed by Trump tariffs. In the first quarter of the year, it said the levies contributed to a $3.3mn operating loss. Unusual Machines has warned the cost of sourcing components from countries other than China could impact profits. Follow the Money to Iowa Where Trickle Down Is Soaking Trump’s Constituents “Since siding with Barack Obama twice, Iowa has become a stronghold for Mr. Trump. Yet perhaps no state has struggled more with his economic policies. During the first quarter of 2025, Iowa’s GDP dropped by 6.1 percent, more than any other state aside from neighboring Nebraska.”… — Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) October 26, 2025 Unfortunately, there’s no indication that Trump’s interests expand enough to include his most loyal rural voters. In his defense, it’s completely unclear that he or his trade team understand the havoc they’ve wrought on American agriculture. Let’s follow the money to Iowa. Per The New York Times When President Trump announced a $20 billion bailout for Argentina this month, Larry Ory, 86, a farmer in Earlham, Iowa, could hardly believe it, especially after boatloads of Argentine soybeans began shipping to China, a once-critical customer for Mr. Ory’s family. For Iowans, losing China’s soybean market in the president’s trade war was only one of many economic shocks that have hit the state since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term. … Since siding with Barack Obama twice, Iowa has become a stronghold for Mr. Trump. Yet perhaps no state has struggled more with his economic policies. During the first quarter of 2025, Iowa’s gross domestic product dropped by 6.1 percent, more than any other state aside from neighboring Nebraska. Manufacturing, which drives 17 percent of Iowa’s economic output, has been hit with higher production costs in part because of steep tariffs on inputs like aluminum and steel. Meatpacking plants, which help make Iowa the nation’s leading pork producer, rely heavily on foreign-born workers, hundreds of thousands of whom saw their legal status stripped away by the president. Mr. Trump’s war on renewable energy also threatens the wind industry that produces more than half of Iowa’s electricity. For now, times are tough. Iowa is the country’s largest producer of corn and second-largest producer of soybeans. America exports as much as half its soybeans, and the vast majority of that had gone to China — $12.6 billion worth last year. But this year, China stopped purchasing soybeans from the United States to retaliate against Mr. Trump’s tariffs. American producers have spent decades working with people in China on how to use soy in animal feed, part of an effort to build up that growing market. Mr. Leeds said he has traveled to the country 25 times and used dollars paid by Iowa farmers to foster strong bonds with Chinese importers. … Iowa’s large beef industry then recoiled after Mr. Trump suggested he would try to lower the cost of beef by importing more from Argentina. … As he deals with those higher prices, Aaron Lehman, a fifth-generation farmer in rural Polk County, said he will continue to use his more than 25-year-old, worn combine. A machine with greater power and a more sophisticated GPS system would cost upward of $100,000 used and more than $250,000 new, he said. Follow the Money: Who’s Paying the Troops? While Trump’s policies may be stressing the economy of key supporter states, the government shut down may be interfering with his plans, or at least Secretary of State/National Security advisor “Little” Marco Rubio. As the Armchair Warlord reminds us on Twitter, failing to pay troops has been an imperial achilles heel through the ages. I feel like the fact that the US military is about to miss a paycheck and we're still moving to attack Venezuela isn't getting enough press. It's a pretty basic military principle dating back to antiquity that you make sure your troops are paid before you start a campaign. https://t.co/bRLaclws8Q — Armchair Warlord (@ArmchairW) October 25, 2025 Into the breach steps Trump Donor Timothy Mellon, per the NY Times: Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and a major financial backer of President Trump, is the anonymous private donor who gave $130 million to the U.S. government to help pay troops during the shutdown, according to two people familiar with the matter. … Shortly after departing Washington on Friday, Mr. Trump again declined to identify Mr. Mellon while talking to reporters aboard Air Force One. He only said the individual was “a great American citizen” and a “substantial man.” “He doesn’t want publicity,” Mr. Trump said as he headed to Malaysia. “He prefer that his name not be mentioned which is pretty unusual in the world I come from, and in the world of politics, you want your name mentioned.” It remains unclear how far the donation will go toward covering the salaries of the more than 1.3 million troops who make up the active-duty military. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Trump administration’s 2025 budget requested about $600 billion in total military compensation. A $130 million donation would equal about $100 a service member. Mr. Mellon, a wealthy banking heir and railroad magnate, is a longtime backer of Mr. Trump and gave tens of millions of dollars to groups supporting the president’s campaign. Last year, he made a $50 million donation to a super PAC supporting Mr. Trump, which was one of the largest single contributions ever disclosed. A grandson of former Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, Mr. Mellon was not a prominent Republican donor until Mr. Trump was elected. But in recent years, he has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into supporting Mr. Trump and the Republican Party. The Daily Beast goes into the source of Mr. Mellon’s hard-earned hundreds of millions: Mellon’s grandfather was the longtime Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, who served from 1921 to 1932 under presidents Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover. Andrew was the son of Thomas Mellon, who founded Mellon Bank, which made his family filthy rich for generations. The donor’s dad, Paul Mellon, was a breeder of thoroughbred racehorses who benefited from the family’s banking riches. By 1957, when Fortune published its first list of the wealthiest Americans, it estimated that Paul Mellon, his sister, and his two cousins were among the eight wealthiest people in the United States. Timothy Mellon’s cousin, Matthew Mellon, was an early crypto investor who struggled with drug addiction. He died in Mexico in 2018, aged 54, just as he was about to check himself into rehab in Mexico. He was divorced from Jimmy Choo co-founder Tamara Mellon, who once wrote that she was “snorting her way through alpine ranges of cocaine” during her marriage to the Mellon heir. “He’s a great gentleman,” Trump said of Timothy Mellon, who appears to be more clean-cut than his younger cousin. “He’s a great patriot. He’s obviously a very substantial man, and he contributed $130 million toward the military in order to make up any difference. So he wanted to see the military get paid.” The same piece points out that the $130 million won’t go far to cover the U.S. military payroll: it averages out to about $100/soldier. Armchair Warlord piles on to that point: People keep on saying this will keep troops from missing a paycheck next Friday. The DoD payroll in 2024 was approximately $192 billion dollars, or about $8 billion per bimonthly payday. This is less than 2% of what's required to make payroll on October 31st. https://t.co/8CZDBPG8ta — Armchair Warlord (@ArmchairW) October 25, 2025 Follow the Money Down the Jeffrey Epstein Conspiracy Path Mellon’s famous last name and the 2025 zeitgeist inevitably led social media sleuths down the rabbit hole Epstein allegations, citing an October lawsuit against the Bank of New York (and Bank of America) by another unnamed alleged Epstein victim. The Wall Street Journal has background on that suit: The suit against BNY claims that since at least 2006 the bank had a relationship with MC2, a modeling agency that Epstein and modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel created. The suit claims that the men used funds from the bank to facilitate Epstein’s sex trafficking. Brunel, who was arrested in 2020 on sex-trafficking charges, died in jail in 2022. The suits were brought by lawyers, including Brad Edwards and David Boies, who have represented many of Epstein’s victims and previously filed similar class actions against JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank in 2022. “The other banks responsible for allowing Epstein’s trafficking should have contacted us during the previous litigation to do the right thing for these victims,” Edwards said. “It is sad that only through lawsuits and Congress are we able to bring justice to this obvious problem.” … JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank have said they regret their relationships with Epstein and settled the suits in 2023, without admitting wrongdoing. JPMorgan agreed to pay $290 million to victims and Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $75 million. Epstein’s estate recently turned over to Congress a list of more than 20 banks that held accounts for Epstein and entities related to him, and several had accounts with Epstein in his later years, the Journal has reported. Right up front, let me quote The Economic Times (India) on the matter so that it’s clear I’m not among those making these claims and am merely reporting on them to show the public mood online: After the NYT report, several posts online began suggesting that Mellon may have been linked to Jeffrey Epstein, due to a lawsuit filed against the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon). The lawsuit, filed on October 16, accuses the bank of facilitating financial transactions linked to Epstein’s operations. However, there is no verified evidence showing any connection between Timothy Mellon and Epstein. BNY Mellon has rejected the allegations and described the lawsuit as baseless. A company spokesperson said, “The claims in the lawsuit are meritless, and we will vigorously defend against it.” Confusion about the Mellon name has contributed to false links. BNY Mellon was formed after a merger between Mellon Financial and the Bank of New York in 2007. After the merger, the Mellon family did not retain ownership or control in the company. The firm became a publicly traded corporation, and institutional investors, including Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, hold the major shares. So case closed, right? Seems like that’s not enough to turn off the X.com rumor mill: But the Mellon's were out of BNY bank by 2008… Oh… wait. pic.twitter.com/5i10VFIRc0 — Diligent Denizen 🇺🇸 (@DiligentDenizen) October 26, 2025 Follow the Money to the Power Under the East Wing Ballroom There’s been a fair amount of MSM handwringing over Trump’s new ballroom which is being built over the rubble of the East Wing of the White House. Most of it irrelevant boo hoo about the brilliant architecture of the Roosevelt era. CNN accidentally mentions something far more important going on underground in the demolition zone: Initially a carriage entrance during the term of President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, it became the modern East Wing as millions of tourists see it each year — or did — under his distant cousin, President Franklin Roosevelt some 40 years later. The build-out was a practical matter: With World War II raging, an emergency underground bunker had been constructed on the spot and needed the building to hide it. … The East Wing was not totally separated from more dire business. The bunker below — officially called the Presidential Emergency Operations Center — is where Vice President Dick Cheney went during the 9/11 attacks, and where Trump was taken during protests in his first term. President George W. Bush used the East Wing to practice his State of the Union address in 2004. Carlyn Beccia has more on Medium: According to the National Capital Planning Commission, no full architectural plans have been submitted — no elevations, no blueprints, no site approvals. Yet demolition has begun. The White House maintains that “preparatory work” doesn’t require review. This neat little loophole somehow allows an entire wing of the most protected building in America to be erased without oversight. … Unofficially, it sits on top of the country’s most secure hideout — The Presidential Emergency Operations Center, or PEOC. The US government built the bunker during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration after Pearl Harbor scared the hell out of everyone in Washington. Today, most White House officials refer to it as “the shelter” or PEOC — pronounced Pee-ock, (as in the sound the Founding Fathers would make if they saw Trump’s renovation). It’s the kind of 5-story bunker that was meant to survive a direct hit — reinforced concrete, steel doors, filtered air, the whole “end of the world but make it dignified” package. …FDR used it as a communications hub; Truman and Eisenhower beefed it up during the Cold War; Dick Cheney was ushered into its lair during the 9/11 attacks. And every president since has at least had a look around, just in case democracy ever needed to hide under the table. After 9/11, the Bush administration realized the White House’s emergency bunker was about as cutting-edge as a rotary phone. Congress quietly funded a massive upgrade, and by 2010, the Obama team was digging under the North Lawn. The official story? “Air-conditioning and mechanical upgrades.” …By 2018…: a new, high-tech command bunker was born, stocked with the latest communications systems, computers, its own air supply, food supply, and enough filtration gear to outlast the apocalypse in style. …The PEOC wasn’t just a bunker; over the decades, it’s rumored to have sprawled into a labyrinth of tunnels connecting to the Treasury, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, and possibly even Lafayette Park. Washington’s soil is laced with secrecy — a place where the Metro can’t dig without bumping into classified concrete. … You don’t just slap a ballroom on top of that without “reconfiguring” something underneath. Which is why this new project, wrapped in secrecy and gold leaf, should have Americans asking the same question: Is Trump building a bigger ballroom or a bigger bunker? All of this sheds new light on what happens when we follow the money to Trump’s alleged “ballroom” donors. The Washington Post has more about that, including the full list of donors: But ethics experts and Democrats say they are turning to a question related to the next phase of the project: whether the donors behind the planned $300 million ballroom that will replace the demolished annex will receive any benefits in return. Tech companies and defense contractors such as Google, Lockheed Martin and Microsoft, as well as wealthy individuals such as longtime GOP donors Stephen A. Schwarzman and Isaac “Ike” Perlmutter, have collectively covered the cost for Trump’s project, according to a list the White House released Thursday. Many of the firms and individuals have business before the administration, such as seeking future federal contracts or eyeing potential acquisitions. … Meredith O’Rourke, a longtime fundraiser for Trump, is coordinating the donations, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the efforts. O’Rourke referred questions about her role to the White House, which did not immediately respond. The donations, which are tax-deductible, are being managed by the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit that helps manage federal projects. Donors to Trump’s ballroom project have been told to expect some form of recognition, such as the placement of etchings of their names in the ballroom, according to the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Trump said this week he has raised $350 million for his long-desired ballroom, which will be built on the site previously occupied by the East Wing, the longtime home to a visitor’s entrance to the White House. The annex also provided office space for the first lady and included other features such as a movie theater. The president, who did not specify what he would do with the extra $50 million for the project, said that he has donated “millions of dollars” himself for the beautification of the White House grounds and pledged to personally cover any shortfall in funding for construction of the ballroom if costs continued to rise. Follow the money and it leads to the power, more often than not. Follow the Money to the GOP Congressional Split I’m pushing my follow the money metaphor just to please Google who loves to see “key phrases” repeated ad nauseam, so my human readers will have to forgive me. But I wanted to cover this little swerve in the politics of the U.S. government shutdown fight. It’s not just your usual GOP vs. Democrats split. Hapless MAGA Speaker of the House is Mike Johnson using the shutdown to control the dissident GOP house caucus according to The New York Times: Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to put the House on an indefinite hiatus that is now stretching into its second month while the government is shut down is the latest in a series of moves he has made that have diminished the role of Congress and shrunken the speakership at a critical moment. It’s an approach born of political expedience that could have far-reaching consequences for an institution that has already ceded much of its power to President Trump. And Mr. Johnson, who without the president’s backing wields little influence over his own members, has chosen to make himself subservient to Mr. Trump, a break with many speakers of the past who sought in their own ways to act more as a governing partner with the president than as his underling. … His strategy of indefinite hiatus means that Mr. Johnson has not engaged in the typical political theater that speakers often employ during shutdown fights to jam the party out of power: scheduling tricky votes on bills to reopen parks or pay certain categories of federal workers, like agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection. Democrats had been bracing for him to do so. But instead, he has spent much of the shutdown appearing daily at news conferences at the Capitol, hammering them for refusing to fund the government and making the case that Republicans need not negotiate. He is insistent that the House has nothing to do but wait for the stalemate to end. And he defends a growing list of extreme moves by Mr. Trump. The absenteeism, people around Mr. Johnson said, is a strategic calculation that the best way to keep his unruly rank and file in line is to place them on an extended leave. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who often serves as a sounding board for Mr. Johnson, said in an interview that if the House were in session, “other issues will begin to clutter this up, and there is some small danger that some Republicans might begin to have a mixed message on the shutdown.” In fact, such dissonance has already begun bubbling up even with everyone working remotely. The divide among Republicans over whether to extend expiring health insurance subsidies — Democrats’ central demand in the shutdown fight — has highlighted a political vulnerability for the party. It has all created a strange dynamic on Capitol Hill: Mr. Johnson appears to be using the considerable power of the speakership to render the House irrelevant. This reinforces the arguments of those (like me) who claim the U.S. is in a post-Constitutional order (also see here). For now we can leave the Replubicans behind and apply our follow the money and power lens to the doings of some Democrats. Follow the Money Behind the Platner, Mamdani, Sanders, Porter & Fetterman Campaigns 🧵My latest article on Substack exposes the political consulting firm that turned the Bernie movement into a $134M cash cow, while repackaging and selling centrists like John Fetterman as "leftist change-makers." https://t.co/FXY9akGPhE pic.twitter.com/1C95L2rBNu — Zeynab Day (@ZeynabDay) October 23, 2025 I covered the contested Democratic primary in the U.S. Senate race challenging long-time GOP incumbent Susan Collins last week, but I forgot to include this key nugget about Platner’s consultants. I also could have mentioned this nexus of operatives when covering Katie Porter, who has also employed some of their services on occasion. So in the interest of advancing today’s follow the money theme, I’m going to add some key details from The New Yorker to today’s post: It was three days before a video titled “Platner for U.S. Senate” would drop, catapulting this local oyster farmer, harbormaster, and former marine onto the national stage. The video was produced by Morris Katz, a top political strategist for New York City’s Democratic mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani. … The campaign rollout, which was orchestrated by Platner’s senior adviser, Joe Calvello (John Fetterman’s former director of communications), raised half a million dollars in its first four days; volunteer sign-ups for the campaign averaged three hundred a day. “No one was expecting this,” Calvello told me. The Times, ABC, NBC, and Fox News covered the launch, focussing on Platner as a political novice who represented a new approach for the Party. The Bullhorn Bulletin obeys the “follow the money” edict and it leads to more on the coterie of “progressive” consultants profiting off the split in the Democratic party: One of the biggest names in that business is Middle Seat, a self-described “visionary, persuasive, disruptive, and dynamic” digital firm that built its empire branding establishment politicians as grassroots crusaders. Their website showcases glossy ad reels and testimonials celebrating their “progressive” clients and reads like a leftist wish list: racial justice, climate action, immigrant rights, intersectional feminism. The branding is perfect. The business model is cynical genius, raking in a whopping $134 million since 2017. At the top of their portfolio is John Fetterman. Middle Seat’s site features multiple campaign videos of the Pennsylvania senator, portraying him as a blue-collar hero standing up to the system. The problem is, once the cameras stopped rolling, Fetterman stood with the very system he claimed to fight, making what appeared to be a sharp right turn to his supporters, but not surprising to those familiar with Fetterman’s record. Middle Seat’s growing client list raises a serious question: Do they vet their clients? Are they critical about who they sell their branding to, or do they simply offer it to anyone seeking a veneer of leftist populism? The firm claims to be “a full-service media and fundraising firm for progressive causes and candidates,” implying that its work is guided by shared values. Its website even boasts, “We bring our values to work,” and “We build movements that honor the authentic perspectives of our clients.” But do they? Now that we’ve connected previous subjects of these columns, Platner, Porter, and Mamdani, let’s turn our follow the money and power lens to the New York mayoral race as it wraps up. Follow the Money to Mamdani’s New York? The mainstream media seems to have cut Andrew Cuomo’s campaign loose as Zohran Mamdani looks like a sure winner in the NYC mayoral general election, if Politico is representative at least, and it is: Pretty much everyone — including Trump himself, per the WSJ — reckons Mamdani is certain to win next week. The fascinating question for our national politics is what happens next. Even as Republicans issue dire warnings about what they believe New York’s first self-described socialist mayor would do to the city, some will privately admit that — whisper it — they kinda want him to win. Zohran the Boogeyman: That’s because GOP strategists believe Mamdani represents a major opportunity for their party — a politician they can, bluntly, demonize in the eyes of Americans as the sort of terrifying far-left figure that the Democratic Party now represents. And if you thought Trump vs. Gov. Gavin Newsom in Los Angeles or Trump vs. Gov. JB Pritzker in Chicago was something … just wait until the president turns his attention to a new-look New York next year. There’s one more aspect of the New York race I haven’t seen getting enough attention. What will Mamdani do when he catches the car and actually has to administrate the city, including the NY Police Department? Never forget the NYPD has a budget of more than $5 billion per year. Oh and they train with the Israeli Defense Forces and consider the Keffiyeh and Watermelon to be anti-Semitic symbols and therefore violations. So you can guess how many of the rank and file NYPD and their bosses view the incoming Muslim mayor. Mamdani Seems to Be Aware of Kinetic Reality Zohran Mamdani is already making the kind of compromise moves that show he’s aware of his political difficulties with the enforcement arm of the city government he will be running. However, it’s unclear if he realizes the magnitude of what’s he’ll be up against. pic.twitter.com/damDAHVJD0 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) October 27, 2025 I’m referring specifically of his stated intention to retain Eric Adams’ Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. From The New York Times: Mr. Mamdani has faced deep skepticism from police union leaders and withering campaign trail attacks from former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, his chief rival, portraying him as hostile to law enforcement and soft on crime. Embracing a figure like Ms. Tisch before Election Day could help the Democrat address both potential vulnerabilities — and send a clear signal that he is serious about building an administration staffed by experts who need not agree with him ideologically. In this case, the differences are stark. He is a democratic socialist who once called the department “racist” and “anti-queer” and supported defunding it. (He has since disavowed those positions.) Ms. Tisch is a billionaire heiress appointed by Mayor Eric Adams who has pushed for stricter criminal justice laws. Ms. Tisch’s allies have signaled for months that she would want to stay in the job regardless of the election’s outcome. The campaign officials declined to detail any conversations between the candidate and the commissioner, but said they were confident she would accept. Some of the more vocal members of X.com’s anti-Zionist contingent have a more critical view of Ms. Tisch: holy shit, Jessica Tisch is actually a fanatical genocidal Zionist maniac Likudnik. Listen to her speech at the ADL event recently, where she fully identifies as an Israeli genocidal Zionist and describes October 7 as "a war on us", launders the genocide and smears anti-genocide… pic.twitter.com/5zNrHvivoh — ☀️👀 (@zei_squirrel) October 23, 2025 Follow the Money and Power: NYPD vs Mayor di Blasio’s Family Edition De Blasio 'proud' of daughter Chiara's arrest during George Floyd protests https://t.co/WlcwkFIEAD pic.twitter.com/QOUqZOsgkV — New York Post (@nypost) June 1, 2020 And those of use whose memories extend all the way back to 2020 and the BLM protests in New York can think of at least one compelling reason the mayor should pay very close attention to “his” police department. They doxxed and threatened the daughter of then Mayor Bill di Blasio during the Black Lives Matter protests. From The New York Times: Among the hundreds of protesters arrested over the four days of demonstrations in New York City over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, only one was highlighted by name by a police union known for its hostility toward Mayor Bill de Blasio. The name of that protester? Chiara de Blasio, the mayor’s daughter. The union, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, used Twitter to post a police report documenting the arrest on Saturday night of Ms. de Blasio, 25. The Police Department does not normally release internal police reports, and Ms. de Blasio’s contained personal details, including her height, weight, address, date of birth and driver’s license information. The post was removed for violation of Twitter rules, and the union’s account was suspended Monday morning. “The account is temporarily locked for violating our private information policy,” a Twitter spokesman confirmed. Citing safety concerns, Twitter prohibits users from posting other people’s “private information” without their consent, a practice known as “doxxing.” The practice has been used as a social-media weapon in culture wars, but the publishing of someone’s physical address, for example, could endanger that individual’s physical safety. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was hip to the scene back in the day, per Business Insider: “Last night the NYPD Sergeants’ union *publicly threatened the mayor’s daughter* while they held her. Indefensible,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Monday. “If police budgets bought peace, the $6 *billion* NYPD budget would’ve bought the most sophisticated de-escalatory operation in the world. Clearly, it didn’t.” And there’s also a follow the money angle to the Tisch-Mamdani relationship that the potentially future mayor may be ignoring: Nepo baby and Eric Adam’s crony, Jessica tisch, family is donating millions to Andrew Cuomo against Zohran mamdani. Yet, Zohran still wants to keep her as head cop. Absolute buffoonery going on behind DSA curtains. https://t.co/4cT3N2aNuM — Luis.Documents🎃👻 (@mfsgottenshook) October 23, 2025 Di Blasio’s non-response got him immortalized by the satirical web site The Onion: De Blasio: ‘It Is An Honor To Have My Daughter Doxxed By The Greatest Police Force In The World’ https://t.co/Z3sfVhwTzq pic.twitter.com/P0jkcYDg2n — The Onion (@TheOnion) June 2, 2020 Only time will tell if Zohran Mamdani becomes New York City mayor only to leave office as an emasculated laughing stock like di Blasio. That’s plenty for today’s Coffee Break, I’ll be back with more attempts to follow the money to the power and anywhere else it leads. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. I wondered about this move on Mamdani’s part, and hope it doesn’t pan out. but honestly I expect the NYPD to be the least of his troubles after the election. Truth is that enough multiple power groups will have their knives out to make the Ides of March look like a picnic. And then there are the two biggies. Hochul might not be the 800 pound gorilla that Cuomo was but Albany will still be a giant brick wall. (You could almost count the beats between DiBlasio attempting something and Cuomo would stomping on his efforts in the most humiliating way possible. Cuomo might not be as flamboyant as Trump but their governing styles have much more in common than “Fix the City” might want to admit.) And then there is the City Council of course. It is still better than being an afterthought yet again from Andy’s endless attempt to sell out to the right people to get a Cuomo in the White House. Back in the early 20th Century (maybe late 19th Century also), there were publications called “Blue Books”. A man would arrive in the city and purchase one of them to find a specific kind of entertainment and companionship. (Being diplomatic). Years later, some said (gossip heard while working in the TV biz) the old Hollywood Blue Book Modelling Agency was more than just a modelling agency. The more things change… mamdani isn’t stupid – he must know that entrenched interests are going to stymy 95% of his proposed changes. his job needs to be communicating to new yorkers and americans at large 1) what he’s trying to achieve for everyone and 2) who exactly is blocking it. name and shame every single one of them. this needs to be daily, specific, and unrelenting. if he can’t or won’t do thar, he’s just more obama hopium for the pussy hat crowd. Ok, now I’m a lot more skeptical of Platner and Mamdani. Platner using Fetterman’s PR guy is a big red flag. Mamdani kissing up to Tisch who is kind of the epitome of everything he claims to be against is a betrayal. Maybe he should find out the cops’ opinion of her before aligning himself too closely, especially since she has no police experience. Of course these issues are ones the establishment has no problem with, so we get the ridiculous smears as their oppo instead. Thanks for bringing up some very valid problems Nat. My pleasure. But I should say, I wouldn’t view their consultant choices as too disqualifying. In my experience, candidates know nothing or next to nothing about campaigns or communications in this era (after all, who would vote for a former campaign manager or political operative?). Therefore, the consultant-candidate relationship is a predator-prey relationship as much as anything. Nor do the campaign consultants follow along to Capitol Hill. After the big Dem sweep in 2006, I was chagrined when so many congressional clients ended up staffed by ex-Lieberman types. Yeah, I’m not discounting Platner completely for that, but it’s good info to have. Earlier people were leery of getting another Fetterman in Platner but I didn’t see much connection between the two. Now there is one. As much as I’ve tried to defend Platner against baseless smears, the thing for me that’s most disqualifying is the fact he’s running as a Democrat to begin with. We have ranked choice voting in Maine and so far I have left Republicans and Democrats completely off my ballot. For me, this is about whether I put Platner as my 2nd choice. If he ran as an independent, which I think he should do if Mills manages to win the primary, I’d consider listing him first. The thing about Mamdani trying to make nice with Tisch is much more concerning. There are many reasons not to trust Platner. For me, the primary and disqualifying one is that, after serving two tours as a machine gunner in Afghanistan, he then spent time as a civilian before, years later, working for Blackwater in Iraq in 2018. That makes his talk about Gaza transact at a very high discount in my mind. Also, as with Fetterman, his Working Class Hero talk is a fraud: he comes from a prominent PMC family near Bar Harbor (which also means he wasn’t an economic draftee in the military). Combine that with his work for Blackwater and you can’t help but question his character or his commitment to his stated positions. Oh, and that “oyster farmer” shtick he uses to brace up his working class cred? Meh: he bought the company a couple of years ago, so he’s more Petit Bourgeois than Working Class Hero. If I were a Mainer, I couldn’t vote for Collin’s or Mills, and still might vote for Platner as a way to highlight the positions he claims to believe in, but I certainly wouldn’t expect much. Thanks MF. I’d like to know a bit more about his family background, but from what I can tell they aren’t squillionaires at least. Taibbi and Kirn were going off about him being a rich guy yesterday and I couldn’t even finish listening – too much trying to ‘own the libs’ without thinking things through, at least in the parts I did listen too. They seemed to think Platner’s campaign was a plan of the Democrat establishment, and I didn’t hear them mention how Schumer tasked Mills with running against him, which would seem to be a clear sign he is not a preferred establishment candidate. I’m wary of those trying to tag these candidates as some elite rich guys. I think you are correct – Platner isn’t a working class hero at all, and much more petit bourgeois, but the petit bourgeois are the ones who have the ability to make some changes more so than the poor working class. They were the ones in charge of both the American and French revolutions back in the day. The candidates educational backgrounds have also been used against them, the elite schools they attended supposedly showing they are phonies. The reason I’m wary about painting with too broad of a brush is because I also went to an elite liberal expensive college, in fact the very same one Mamdani graduated from. But my parents weren’t titans of industry, far from it. As I’ve noted, my family were long time dairy farmers, I got accepted to that school due to getting good grades at a public high school, and went with a lot of financial aid. Yeah, there are a lot of kids from squillionaire families at those schools, but not all of them. So I’m trying to give some benefit of the doubt until I get more info. All that said, I don’t expect much at all. I have a fairly close relationship with an already elected member of the US Congress, and they haven’t amounted to a pisshole in the snow after several terms now. I almost entirely agree with you: in and of themselves, his military service and business ownership are far from disqualifying. After all, the Left should want ex-military people to find its message attractive, and breakaways from Trumps real Petit Bourgeois base are also to be welcomed. We laud FDR for being a class traitor (sort of), and should be open to others doing likewise. Having sent my older daughter to an elite college in Maine (Bates: for some reason we didn’t tour or consider Colby or Bowdoin), I’m in no position to throw stones about educational choices. The problem for me is the way Platner markets himself and elides that background, rather than honestly puts it to the fore. He has the political room to talk about the costs of empire, personally and broadly, but he doesn’t: his criticism of events in Gaza echos a little too closely Obama’s “dumb wars” opposition to the war in Iraq, which we later learned was just part of his overall hustle. And the Blackwater thing is a stench he seems to want to ignore, and for me that’s a far bridge to cross, though others may feel otherwise. What can I say? Twice Obama-ed ( though in self-defense, while I voted for Obama, I never had much faith in him) and Fetterman-ed, thrice shy. PS : Hoping our dear Lambert is well, it would be great to hear him weigh in on this, given his long-time Maine residence. PPS: As for Kirn and Taibbi: I find Kirn slippery, and Taibbi sad: I stopped paying attention to them a long time ago, and I get why someone might feel sympathy or support for their targets, but questions about Platner are justifiable, whatever they might say. Agree, and I’d definitely like more info on his time at Blackwater. Looks like he wasn’t there long – months I think – so maybe he was disillusioned about the whole operation. But I’d like to know for sure. And on an unrelated note, you must be familiar with the annual Colby-Bates-Bowdoin football tournament, the loser of which is deemed to be the absolute worst college football program in the nation. Not sure if that has been determined for this year yet or not. What’s the matter with Iowa? I voted to make America great, and all I got was a soybean boycott. ….So, you actually voted to make America grate. The DJT Jr. and Unusual Machine’s is quite interesting. Looking at the stock chart you would see the expected as in the stock going north once Jr was on board, and the dates mentioned above, but they were not violent moves. One that looks funny to me, and I can’t find any news, was June 2nd. The price had peaked and was trending down. On the 2nd direction changed and it went from around 5.50 to 15. Don Jr is also a partner at 1789 capital, a fund started by NY investment banker, a Thiel sidekick (Buskirk), and Rebekah Mercer. Trump-linked venture fund 1789 Capital tops $1 billion in assets (Reuters, 8th sept) In the months following Donald Trump’s return to the White House, a little-known venture fund with ties to the Trump family quietly crossed a milestone: $1 billion in assets. The firm, 1789 Capital, was once a niche experiment that aimed to align equity investing with conservative political values. This year, it has grown into a financial powerhouse following two strokes of fortune: Trump’s election in November and the addition of his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., as a 1789 partner that same month. Interviews with people close to the firm, along with financial records, reveal a dramatic expansion in its portfolio to include defense contractors, AI startups and other companies that ethics experts say could benefit from federal contracts and regulatory changes. Same fund made the news for opening a Georgetown social club with a $500k membership fee earlier this year. Great find. Mercer, wasn’t she involved in Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal too? Indeed: Mercer was on the CA board Thiel’s Palantir (or at least an employee of theirs) were also majorly involved If I had more time, yarn, and focus, I could create a huge visual of all the connections between the Thielverse/SV VCs and the Trump admin. Short version: AI/defence VC funds are the favoured mode of corruption /slush fund. See also: Dan Caine. Oh and crypto scams obviously. ‘Oh and they train with the Israeli Defense Forces’ Maybe Mamdani can shut down that program on the grounds of ‘patriotism.’ That America has a pop of 335 million with the best police departments in the world so why do they need to train with foreigners. I mean, New York City alone has almost the pop of Israel so what can they really teach American police. The true answer is that Israelis are teaching US police how to treat fellow Americans as Palestinians but he does not have to mention that. RE: “Only time will tell if Zohran Mamdani becomes New York City mayor only to leave office as an emasculated laughing stock like di Blasio.” Only to leave? More like how he began. Immediately after being elected, Bill de Blasio had a secret meeting with AIPAC. He told them it was his job to “defend Israel.” Billy dB tried to keep this meeting secret, but a patriotic staffer leaked it to the media. (The Village Voice?) He cucked out from day one.

Title: Trump Mulls More Aid to Argentina as Americans Set to Lose Food Stamps
URL: https://newrepublic.com/post/202292/trump-more-aid-argentina-americans-lose-food-stamps-shutdown
Time Published: 2025-10-27T15:43:53Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump hasn’t ruled out giving more money to Argentina, he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday. The president claimed that the country’s midterm election results on Sunday, which went very well for right-wing President Javier Milei, are good for the United States because bonds have gone up, making “a lot of money for the United States.” When a reporter asked if Argentina would need “more support,” referring to the president’s $40 billion bailout of the country, Trump replied in the affirmative. “They might. Yeah, we would consider it,” Trump said. Trump on Argentina: I think we've made a lot of money based on that election because the bonds have gone up… That election made a lot of money for the US… Reporter: Will they need more support or would you consider it?Trump: They might. Yeah, we would consider it. pic.twitter.com/0YMd750W1Y Trump’s comments come as SNAP funding is set to expire in five days thanks to the government shutdown, with millions of Americans expected to lose food stamps across the country. Health care subsidies are also on the verge of expiring in the U.S., causing health insurance premiums to skyrocket for millions of Americans. Meanwhile, the up to $40 billion bailout for Argentina that Trump has already approved benefited major hedge funds, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Pimco, as well as Robert Citrone, a close friend of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who founded the hedge fund Discovery Capital Management. Thus, when Trump brags that Argentina’s right-wing government is making money for the U.S., he’s not referring to the average American struggling to make ends meet, but rather financial executives and hedge funds. But Trump never was too worried about how the average American is doing. Donald Trump is economically punishing Canada (and the American public) for daring to televise Ronald Reagan’s position on tariffs. The president announced Saturday that America’s northern neighbor would literally pay for Ontario’s decision to air portions of one of Reagan’s 1987 radio addresses, in which the conservative icon argued that tariffs undermine economic prosperity and only serve to “hurt every American.” The 35 percent tariff on Canadian goods would increase by at least 10 percent, Trump said. The advert really irked Trump, who claimed that the very real speech was a “fake.” Trump also cited the advertisement as his reason for canceling trade talks with Canada and then deciding to actually impose more levies on America’s Hat as recompense for the stunt. “Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan’s Speech on Tariffs,” Trump posted to Truth Social. “The Reagan Foundation said that they, ‘created an ad campaign using selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan. The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address,’ and ‘did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter.’ “The sole purpose of this FRAUD was Canada’s hope that the United States Supreme Court will come to their ‘rescue’ on Tariffs that they have used for years to hurt the United States. Now the United States is able to defend itself against high and overbearing Canadian Tariffs (and those from the rest of the World as well!).” While the ad stitched together some of Reagan’s quotes from different parts of the speech, none of the soundbites used in the ad were made up. In fact, the speech in its entirety reveals Reagan was much harsher on tariffs than the ad made him out to be. The ad was developed by Ontario’s provincial government. The goal of the ad, per Ontario Premier Doug Ford, was to reach as many Americans as possible. After a conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Ford announced the decision to pull the ad, which will officially stop airing on Monday. But ultimately, Trump doesn’t appear able to grapple with the reality that his Republican hero considered his favorite economic stratagem a total dud. “Ronald Reagan LOVED Tariffs for purposes of National Security and the Economy, but Canada said he didn’t!” Trump continued in his post. “Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD. Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10 percent over and above what they are paying now.” Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One Monday, Trump said he had no interest in meeting with Carney to resolve the matter, further elaborating that he wouldn’t be meeting with Carney “for a while.” President Trump on Monday bragged about passing a dementia test, while challenging Democrats decades younger than him to try and do the same. “[We] have a great group of people, which they don’t,” Trump said while taking questions inside Air Force One. “They have Jasmine Crocket, a low-IQ person. [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] is low IQ.… Have her pass, like, the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed. Those are really hard, they’re really aptitude tests, I guess, in a certain way. But they’re cognitive tests.” The “cognitive tests” that Trump is bragging about so proudly—and condescendingly telling two outspoken, progressive women of color to take—is most likely some variation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The MoCA is a 10-minute assessment designed to identify signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s, and yet Trump talks about it like it was the Graduate Record Examinations or the LSAT. Trump visited Walter Reed Medical Center earlier this month, raising questions about whether he once again took the dementia test on this visit. The president has been bragging about this test for years now. “It was 30 to 35 questions.… The first questions are very easy. The last questions are much more difficult. Like a memory question. It’s, like, you’ll go: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. So they say, ‘Could you repeat that?’ So I said, ‘Yeah. It’s: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV,’” Trump said back in 2020. “They said nobody gets it in order.… It’s actually not that easy, but for me, it was easy.” “I think it was 35, 30 questions,” he said again last year. “They always show you the first one, like a giraffe, a tiger, or this, or that—a whale. ‘Which one is the whale?’ OK. And that goes on for three or four [questions], and then it gets harder and harder and harder.” The test itself is controversial within the medical community, and Trump’s misrepresentation of it has been thoroughly debunked over the years. “It’s a very, very low bar for somebody who carries the nuclear launch codes in their pocket to pass and certainly nothing to brag about,” Jonathan Reiner, a George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences professor and cardiologist, told The Washington Post last year. And yet Trump, in the midst of a government shutdown, continues to place the MoCA on a pedestal, using it to disparage Representatives Crockett and Ocasio-Cortez even though they could likely pass it with flying colors. Especially if it just consists of “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.” President Donald Trump’s administration claims that its hands are tied against funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program while the government is closed, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s own shutdown plan says that’s not the case. The USDA published a memo in August claiming that SNAP contingency funds could not legally be used to cover regular benefits for the 42 million Americans that use them, and that any states trying to cover the cost would not be reimbursed, Axios reported Monday. “SNAP contingency funds are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover benefits,” the memo stated. “The contingency fund is not available to support FY 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists.” Now the funds could solely be used for so-called contingencies, such as natural disasters, USDA claimed. “For example, Hurricane Melissa is currently swirling in the Caribbean and could reach Florida,” the memo stated. “Having funds readily available allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to mobilize quickly in the days and weeks following a disaster.” But the USDA’s Lapse of Funding Plan, published a month later and which Axios reported has been removed from the agency’s website, stated just the opposite. “OMB’s General Counsel provided a letter to USDA on May 23, 2025 stating that there is a bona fide need to obligate benefits for October—the first month of the fiscal year—during or prior to the month of September, thereby guaranteeing that benefit funds are available for program operations even in the event of a government shutdown at the beginning of a fiscal year,” the disappeared document states. “In addition, Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue since the program has been provided with multi-year contingency funds that can be used for State Administrative Expenses to ensure that the State can also continue operations during a Federal Government shutdown,” the plan stated. “These multi-year contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year.” The memo also claimed that using the contingency funds would prevent additional transfers to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, which has reportedly been funded using Trump’s tariff money during the shutdown. This latest memo from the USDA is part of a wider campaign from the Trump administration to hold the health and well-being of millions of Americans hostage, while suggesting it is the Democrats who are responsible. In fact, the USDA website currently has a banner at the top explicitly blaming Democrats for the shutdown. But in reality, it is the White House that is picking and choosing which projects to fund and what to withhold to make Americans hurt—so it can pressure Democrats into signing a clean continuing resolution. Earlier this month, the USDA sent a letter to states warning that a lapse in appropriations had resulted in “insufficient funds” to pay SNAP benefits through November. Last week, states began to issue warnings to their most vulnerable residents that benefits would be suspended starting in the middle of October. President Trump is doing absolutely nothing to dispel the growing rumor that he will completely disregard the Constitution to run for an illegal third presidential term. “Steve Bannon said in a recent interview that there would be plans for you to be able to run and potentially win a third term in 2028,” a reporter asked Trump on Air Force One on Monday. “Is that something you’d be willing to challenge in court?” “Well, I haven’t really thought about it, we have some very good people as you know,” he replied. “But uh, I have the best poll numbers I’ve ever had.” After saying Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio could run for president in 2028, Trump again brought it back to himself. “I would love to do it,” he emphasized. Asked by a reporter if he wasn’t ruling out a third term, Trump replied, “Am I not ruling it out? I mean you’ll have to tell me.” Reporter: Bannon said there could be plans for you to be able to run and potentially win a third term Is that something you'd be willing to challenge at the court to be able to do?Trump: I haven't really thought about it. We have some very good people as you know.. but I have… pic.twitter.com/gNnSAYsOoi The president is wrong about the poll numbers, as they are currently some of the lowest he’s experienced. And more importantly, the president has absolutely thought about 2028—he’s already had the hats made. Steve Bannon, his former right hand, has made the actual plans abundantly clear. “Trump is gonna be president in ’28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,” Bannon said in an interview with The Economist published last Thursday. “There’s many different alternatives. At the appropriate time, we’ll lay out what the plan is, but there’s a plan and President Trump will be the president in ’28.” Trump’s complete nonanswer, combined with everything Bannon and the deep MAGA base has said about it, should raise alarm for anyone still holding onto whatever constitutional values still apply in this country. The most corrupt president in modern history is planning a constitutional coup, and it’s highly unlikely that he’ll let tradition and custom—things he’s never cared about—stop him. The head of CNN reportedly wants his network to tone down its coverage of President Trump destroying the White House’s East Wing as he builds his enormous ballroom. Status reports that CNN CEO Mark Thompson told his staffers on a conference call Thursday to reduce the network’s coverage of the White House’s destruction, one day after he had paid a visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The Wednesday meeting at the White House was supposedly about CNN’s upcoming streaming product and an opportunity for Trump administration officials to appear on the network, but Thompson’s words to CNN employees raise the question of whether Trump officials told him to alter the network’s coverage. Staffers at the network are suspicious, according to Status, especially considering that CNN anchor Jake Tapper has been trying to get an interview with the president. CNN has denied the report. “This is reckless and irresponsible conjecture without any fact checking done prior to publication,” a spokesperson said in a statement to The New Republic. The network has a historically bad relationship with Trump, with its correspondents often butting heads with the president going back to before his first term, and its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, is up for sale with Trump ally David Ellison among the leading suitors. During his second term as president, Trump has made no secret of his grudges against media outlets, seeking to punish them through the FCC and defamation lawsuits. Despite Thompson’s reported words during the editorial call, the outlet has still covered the destruction of the East Wing since Thursday. Could Trump be trying to take advantage of CNN and engineer softer coverage? Is Thompson trying to save his own job in the event Ellison acquires CNN? Either way, it’s another example of the Trump administration infringing on the freedom of the press. This story has been updated. Senator Rand Paul is on a campaign to knock President Donald Trump off of his warpath. During Paul’s appearance on Fox News Sunday, host Shannon Bream asked the Kentucky Republican what information he wanted the government to provide about its military strikes in the Caribbean Sea. But Paul said that a briefing wasn’t what he was after. “A briefing’s not enough to overcome the Constitution,” Paul said. “The Constitution says that when you go to war, Congress has to vote on it. And during a war then, [there are] lower rules for engagement and people do sometimes get killed without due process. “But the drug war, or the crime war, has typically been something we do through law enforcement. And so far they have alleged that these people are drug dealers. No one said their name, no one said their evidence,” Paul said. “So, at this point, I would call them extrajudicial killings. “This is akin to what China does, to [what] Iran does with drug dealers; they summarily execute people without providing evidence to the public, so it’s wrong,” Paul said. Both Iran and China have been known to secretly execute drug dealers, without providing due process. Paul, a Libertarian, has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration’s policy on the strikes, pointing to the military’s likely illegal drones, as well as the statistical likelihood that some of its targets are mistaken. The U.S. conducted its tenth strike on a foreign vessel on Friday, killing another six people without providing any actual evidence linking the boats to any drug cartel. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed the ship was operated by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. Trump also ordered an aircraft carrier strike group to the Caribbean, in a major escalation of military tension between the U.S. and Venezuela. Last week, Trump stated his intention to expand his lawless strikes to dry land—bragging that Congress wouldn’t stop him. Donald Trump’s latest doctor visit turned out to be a fairly serious medical evaluation. The president stopped by Walter Reed Medical Center earlier this month, but the president’s team refused for days to explain why. Apparently it was for MRI scans, a medical tool typically used to assess tumors, joint injuries, or heart conditions. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Monday, Trump claimed the visit was little more than a “routine yearly checkup”—despite the fact that he had his annual physical just six months ago. “I got an MRI,” he said before touching down in Japan. “It was perfect.” The president did not elaborate on what the doctors were looking for or what they had found, though the 79-year-old did emphasize that the doctors allegedly told him he had “some of the best reports” they had ever seen. “You can ask the doctors,” he said. “Nobody has ever given you reports like I give you.” Trump then went on to brag about his IQ, claiming that “aptitude tests” he received at Walter Reed proved he was superior to his political opponents—especially compared to a couple of healthy young women. “You give her an IQ test. Have her pass, like, the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed,” Trump said referring to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “I took—those are very hard—they’re really aptitude tests, I guess, in a certain way.” Trump also derided Texas Representative Jasmine Crockett, suggesting that she too should grapple with the “very hard” tests, which he said included questions about “tigers, an elephant, a giraffe.” It’s unclear what test this could be referring to, but it sounds remarkably similar to Trump’s infamous “person, woman, man, camera, TV” test—which health experts have revealed is a test to check for signs of dementia, Alzheimer’s, or other cognitive issues. The White House said that the president was in “excellent overall health” after his October 10 visit, referring to the testing as “advanced imaging.” Press secretary Karoline Leavitt refused to clarify that language during a White House press briefing last week, rejecting a reporter’s query as to whether that meant Trump had received MRI scans. “Advanced imaging is something that presidents receive and people receive when they go to the doctor, and so we provided a detailed readout of that physical, and I would encourage you back for that,” she said. When pressed again on the matter, Leavitt said: “I don’t know the exact imaging that took place, but as the physician’s note said, the president is in incredibly good shape and I think that’s evidenced here every single day.” Trump’s health has been a topic of concern since he was on the campaign trail, when reports circulated that he couldn’t remember the contents of the cognitive exams he claimed to ace. Since then, the president has been spotted with odd discolorations on his hand, routinely appears discombobulated and lethargic during critical meetings with world leaders, and had a drooping expression during 9/11 ceremonies in September that onlookers suggested could be a sign of a stroke. It looks like President Donald Trump’s family is once again using the White House as a personal piggy bank. A Florida-based drone manufacturer linked to Don Trump Jr. just received its largest ever contract to supply parts to the Pentagon, the Financial Times reported Friday. Unusual Machines, a company that builds and sells drones, said that the U.S. Army had contracted it to make 3,500 drone motors, among other parts, and the Pentagon indicated that it would order an additional 20,000 components in 2026. CEO Allen Evans said that he believed it was the largest order the company had ever received from the U.S. government, but he did not disclose the value of the contract. The Defense Department appears to have stopped posting daily contract notices since the government shutdown began on October 1. Trump Jr. joined the company’s advisory board in November 2024, shortly after his father became commander in chief of the U.S. military. Trump Jr. previously disclosed that he owned a roughly $4 million stake in the company, although it’s unclear whether he has retained his shares. Earlier this month, Evans told Bloomberg that the president’s son had continued to participate in fundraising rounds. There are obvious conflicts of interest that surround the president’s son being positioned to profit off the defense industry—and the Trump administration has already done plenty to pave the way for buying more American-made drones. In June, Trump signed an executive order to “unleash American drone dominance,” and in July, the Pentagon removed restrictions in order to accelerate drone procurement. Trump Jr.’s involvement immediately boosted Unusual Machines’ beleaguered stock, and Evans said that the first son’s public endorsement made it easier to get meetings with potential partners, allowing the company to raise more than $80 million from investors this year. But Evans insisted that Trump Jr. wasn’t involved in the massive deal, and a spokesperson for Trump Jr. said that “Don has never communicated with anyone in the administration on behalf of Unusual Machines or about the contract in question.” The president’s family has pocketed more than $1.8 billion in cash and gifts since Trump’s return to the White House, according to the Center for American Progress. That figure includes more than $1.2 billion from their cryptocurrency side hustle. On Thursday, Trump pardoned the founder of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, who helped launch his family’s cryptocurrency platform, World Liberty Financial, with a massive $2 billion favor for its stablecoin. The ballroom replacing the White House East Wing will share Donald Trump’s name. The $300 million project has yet to receive a formal designation, but it is already being referred to as the “President Donald J. Trump Ballroom,” a moniker that will likely stick, senior administration officials told ABC News Friday. Practically every detail that has emerged about the ballroom—and the East Wing’s complete destruction this week—has been uncovered by media outlets that refused to take the administration’s plan at face value. After promising Americans in July that his ballroom proposal would “be near but not touching” the historic building, Trump plowed ahead without prerequisite approval from the National Capital Planning Commission (which has been closed since the government shutdown began earlier this month) and without the express permission of Congress. The project’s price tag also inexplicably grew by 50 percent over the last week. What Trump had pitched as a $200 million project was instead referred to this week as a $300 million development plan that the White House suggested would be funded, in part, by some of the country’s wealthiest families and biggest corporations, including the likes of Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. Government officials are still trying to ascertain whether Trump’s sudden, unauthorized decision to demolish the White House was legal, but at least two Americans have already opted to sue him over it in an attempt to suspend the construction. The White House’s partial destruction is, ultimately, another illustration that the country’s constitutional system of checks and balances has eroded. The international real estate mogul’s desire to destroy the government—and with it, the architectural face of American democracy—has received practically zero pushback from his allies in Congress, who appear all too willing to sit back as Trump courts billionaires to fund his golden banquet hall. Resisting Trump’s drafts for the East Wing would require someone in power to actually hold the president accountable. But his desire to destroy and redevelop the White House as he sees fit should come as no surprise, since he’s never appeared to be a fan of the national symbol. During his first term, Trump reportedly called the White House “a dump” (an allegation that he has publicly refuted), and he has spent no small part of his second term living and dining at his own properties rather than the executive mansion.

Dublin pub group Grand Slam Bars saw pretax profits nearly double to €983,000, as revenues grew following the group’s midyear acquisition of McSorley’s in Ranelagh. In newly filed financial accounts, the group said its performance “has continued to improve year on year” noting that turnover has increased from €9.4 million to €11.3 million. The bar group is owned by Noel Anderson, the former chairman of the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA), along with four former Irish international rugby players Jamie Heaslip, Sean O’Brien, and the Kearney brothers Rob and Dave. Grand Slam Bars owns the Bridge bar in Ballsbridge, the Blackrock in the south Dublin suburb of the same name and the Lemon & Duke and Little Lemon in the city centre. During the financial year, it bought McSorley’s pub in Ranelagh, Dublin 6, for €5.5 million. The majority of the group’s turnover – €7.3 million, or around two-thirds of revenue – was generated from the sale of alcoholic drinks. This represented a significant increase on drinks sales in the previous year at €5.75 million. Food sales also increased, up marginally to €3.8 million, alongside tea and coffee sales which rose from €44,000 to €133,000. The group saw pretax profits increase by 90 per cent from €518,000 in the financial year ending in February 2024 to just over €983,000 this past year. The group’s assets have risen to €14.6 million from just over €8 million in 2024. Buoyed by the acquisition of McSorley’s pub, the company had an average of 153 employees, an increase of 16 jobs on the previous year. Staff costs also rose to just over €4.1 million from nearly €3.8 million. Borrowings at the firm are up from €2.1 million in 2024 to €7.28 million with a mortgage, which is secured against the group’s pubs, having been added to the company. The former international rugby player investors in the group serve as directors on its subsidiary firms and directors “ambassador fees” during the year came to €55,000. Mr Anderson is also a shareholder in the Changing Times Brewery, which is making local stout and lager, which owed the group early €150,000 at year end.

Title: Standard Chartered Says This Could Be the Week Everything Changes for Bitcoin | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee because this week could quietly redefine the tone of the entire market. Between shifting US-China trade winds, a looming Fed decision, and Bitcoin’s tightening grip above six figures, the mood feels different — almost expectant. This could be one of those weeks where the market quietly shifts from uncertainty to conviction. According to Standard Chartered’s Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoff Kendrick, a wave of surprisingly positive US-China developments has turned market sentiment “from fear into hope.” Kendrick highlighted that US Treasury Secretary Bessent signaled an imminent breakthrough over the weekend. He indicated that China is expected to suspend rare earth export controls for a year and increase soybean purchases from the US in exchange for Washington dropping its threatened 100% tariffs. Details of this potential deal will be finalized after the Trump-Xi meeting in Korea later this week. The news has already rippled through the markets, with Bitcoin benefiting from the positive sentiment. In the same tone, the USD-CNH pair has fallen to near year-to-date lows, signaling a stronger yuan and renewed confidence in global trade stability. This easing tension has, in turn, fueled a rebound in Bitcoin’s correlation to risk appetite, as investors rotate away from defensive positions. “The Bitcoin-gold ratio, highlighted last week, continues to push higher,” Kendrick wrote, noting that it now sits just above levels seen before the tariff scare earlier this month. “I’ll watch for this ratio to break back above 30 to signal an end to such fear.” For Kendrick, the coming days may mark a critical turning point for Bitcoin and how investors interpret its long-term cycle. He pointed out that over $2 billion exited US gold ETFs last week, suggesting an appetite shift that could soon favor Bitcoin. “It would confirm a more positive backdrop if even half of that re-entered Bitcoin ETFs early this week,” he noted. The broader setup looks equally intriguing. Wednesday’s FOMC meeting is expected to deliver a 25 basis-point rate cut, despite the Fed operating in what Kendrick described as a “data blackout.” It's FOMC week!There's a 96.7% chance the Fed will cut interest rates by 25bps. What’s your prediction? pic.twitter.com/SRVPczDYcL He also hinted that growing speculation over the next Fed Chair could prove “Bitcoin positive” if it raises concerns about central bank independence. Add to that, the looming earnings releases from five of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ — Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, and Amazon — and the macro calendar looks loaded with catalysts. “This week is about to be pure chaos…the government shutdown is about to hit day 30. The Fed decides rates on Wednesday. Powell speaks right after, during a data blackout. Then, we’ve got Microsoft, Apple, Google, Meta, and Amazon, all reporting earnings. That’s $15.2 trillion in market cap dropping numbers in the same week. And just when you think it’s over… Trump meets President Xi on Thursday, 48 hours before his 100% tariff deadline. Buckle up. This week could move everything,” Mario Nawfal corroborated. Kendrick argues that a fresh Bitcoin all-time high would serve as the “death knell” for those still clinging to the halving cycle as the primary driver of BTC’s value. “ETF flows matter more now…If this week goes well, Bitcoin may never go below $100,000 again,” he said. This statement echoes remarks highlighted in a recent US Crypto News publication. Whether or not that prediction holds, this week’s mix of diplomacy, data, and digital gold could prove decisive for the next phase of Bitcoin’s story.

Title: Saudi Power Broker Pitches Kingdoms AI Pivot to Wall Street

(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s annual investment showpiece kicks off this week against a steady drumbeat of headlines on the kingdom’s strained finances: The deficit has grown as oil prices persist below levels needed to balance the budget, forcing spending to be reprioritized and parts of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s trillion-dollar ambitions to be scaled back. At the center of it all will be Richard Attias, who has spent the past decade courting investors to back the kingdom’s economic transformation. The Moroccan-born power broker is ensconced at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s global outreach, often pictured with Prince Mohammed, Yasir Al Rumayyan, who runs the $1 trillion Public Investment Fund, and even US President Donald Trump. “The show must go on,” he said on the sidelines of last year’s Future Investment Initiative that opened under the shadow of war. Tensions shrouding the region may have ebbed, but this year’s event presents challenges of its own — mainly the kingdom’s pivot from being an exporter of capital to a seeker of foreign cash. In an interview in Riyadh, Attias credited the FII with playing a crucial role in driving investment, generating as much as $190 billion in deals since its 2017 launch. He characterized the kingdom’s growing emphasis on domestic investment as “extremely fair” and said financiers’ interest in the country remains strong. “We didn’t create FII for people to come, take the money and run,” Attias said. “We created FII for people to understand where the money should go.” Wall Street is paying close attention. This year’s forum will lean more heavily into technology and artificial intelligence, two industries central to the crown prince’s diversification plan. It will feature marquee names, including Blackstone Inc. Chief Executive Officer Steve Schwarzman and BlackRock Inc.’s Larry Fink, who are both vying to invest billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia’s new AI firm, Humain. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO David Solomon and others will be eying opportunities in the kingdom’s emerging private credit market. The Davos Rival About a decade ago, officials in Riyadh wanted an event to rival Davos as part of efforts to lure foreign investors into an economy long fueled by oil. They turned to Attias, a former World Economic Forum insider, who helped the kingdom set up FII. At its inaugural 2017 edition, MBS — newly elevated as crown prince — laid out his vision for Neom, a planned $500 billion city on the Red Sea that signaled the kingdom’s outsize ambitions. Eight years later, Neom’s costs have ballooned to an estimated $1.5 trillion, and progress has slowed. The ninth edition of the FII comes amid growing scrutiny of those projects and renewed doubts over whether Saudi Arabia can sustain its breakneck development agenda. Even the local stock market — once a regional bright spot — has struggled, with recent listings underwhelming. For Attias, whose eponymous firm counts the kingdom and FII as key clients, the stakes are uniquely personal. Richard Attias & Associates produces dozens of events worldwide in addition to the Saudi confab, and is now preparing for a listing that could earn its founder millions. But those fortunes are tied to the success of the Saudi story Attias helped craft. Get the Mideast Money newsletter , a weekly look at the intersection of wealth and power in the region. The event typically attracts thousands of people each year. Since 2023, attendance requires a $15,000 annual membership with the FII Institute, a nonprofit that manages the Riyadh-based conference and the wider brand. Attias describes the fee as “modest” compared with global peers such as Davos or the Milken Institute Global Conference, where tickets start at around $25,000. Although often dubbed “Davos in the Desert,” Attias rejects the comparison. “Number one, we’re not in Davos, and number two, we’re not in the desert,” he said. “Riyadh today is one of the most developed cities in the world.” In any case, FII has now become an integral part of the kingdom’s broader investment strategy and is expanding its global reach. Attias is helping set up a satellite edition of the conference in Tokyo, on the back of a turn in Miami that marked one of Trump’s first public appearances after being sworn in for a second term. Saudi Arabia’s success snagging Trump to headline the gathering spotlighted the close relationship between the two sides and their growing financial ties. The crown prince is set to meet Trump in the White House in November, in his first visit to the US since 2018. This year’s line-up features dignitaries from about 20 countries ranging from China’s vice president to the UK’s chancellor of the exchequer, showing how the kingdom balances competing global interests. Gulf governments are “quite adept at working both ends of the political economy spectrum to advance their interests on the global stage,” said Robert Mogielnicki, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. The event also places Attias at the highest echelons of power in Saudi Arabia. He says he communicates with world leaders via WhatsApp, and that Crown Prince Mohammed “trusts totally what FII is doing.” For all its successes, the FII has faced its share of crises. The 2018 murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi caused top business leaders, including Bill Gates, Jamie Dimon and Richard Branson to distance themselves from the event, citing human rights concerns. Attias said that year’s edition still drew more delegates than before, buoyed by participants from Russia, China, the Middle East and Africa. By 2019, most who had shunned the event had returned, lured by the promise of mega-deals tied to the Vision 2030 economic transformation agenda. Many, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., have since deepened ties to the kingdom. The bank underwrote a $20 billion debt facility to help investors including the PIF take Electronic Arts Inc. private in a $55 billion deal last month, and secured a regional headquarters license in Saudi Arabia days before FII. Chief Executive Dimon is scheduled to speak at this year’s event. Global Player Financier Ken Moelis was among dealmakers who stuck it out in 2018. His firm landed major mandates, including Aramco’s record $29 billion IPO, earning him the nickname “Ken of Arabia.” Moelis & Co. is now advising Attias’s firm on its planned listing, expected to involve about 30% of the company’s shares. Both Attias and Sanabil, an investment arm of the PIF, are considering selling part of their stakes. Attias said he expects Sanabil to “make good money” from the offering but insists the goal is to institutionalize the business rather than cash out. He also hinted at the possibility of a future secondary listing. “We have offices in Dubai, Riyadh, New York, Paris and Africa,” he said. “So we’re a global player.” RA&A has evolved beyond producing the FII, which now accounts for only about 10% of its revenue, and organizes more than 50 conferences a year. Ahmad Al-Husseini serves as CEO, though Attias’s personal imprint remains. His wife Cecilia — previously married to former French president Nicolas Sarkozy — and daughter both work at the firm. At the FII Institute, Attias took over as acting CEO after Penny Richards, formerly of the Aspen Institute, resigned just months into the job. A permanent successor is expected by year-end. “It’s not easy to follow the traces of someone who has a very strong fingerprint,” Attias said, acknowledging that his deep involvement makes succession harder. The intensifying competition for events across the Gulf presents another challenge. Dubai plans to launch Future Finance Week with the Institute of International Finance in May 2026. The regional circuit already includes Abu Dhabi Finance Week in December and Doha’s Qatar Economic Forum, a pre-summer fixture. While these events will mean more opportunities for firms that help organize them, it will also mean more competition for existing conferences, including FII. Attias, though, remains confident FII has carved out its own space. “I am told by many people, ‘Richard, give me the dates of FII for the next three to four years,’” he said. The government of the State of Qatar is the underwriter of the Qatar Economic Forum, Powered by Bloomberg. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: The worst bull run ever? How institutions, memes, and macro turned crypto’s glory cycle into a grind

One frustrated altcoin trader says the quiet part out loud: this isn’t the euphoric bull cycle crypto hoped for; it’s a stripped-down reality check. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. For a market supposedly in a bull run, it doesn’t feel like one. Sure, Bitcoin may have set a couple of record highs this cycle, but the rallies have been uneventfully yawn-inducing, and the corrections have been savage. Altcoins are down 90% or more. Retail has vanished. And even the diehards are wondering if this so-called bull cycle deserves the name at all. This is, by many accounts, the hardest bull market crypto has ever seen. Bitcoin has doubled since its 2023 lows, but the soul of the market feels hollowed out. What happened? Altcoin trader “Crypto Birb” breaks it down into three main reasons. Wall Street didn’t just arrive this cycle; it moved in and redecorated. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Goldman didn’t come to speculate; they came to own infrastructure, custody networks, and tokenized real-world assets. Institutional adoption is the tidy headline, but what it really means is extraction at scale. They’re not playing memecoins or hunting airdrops. They bought the pipes, liquidity rails, and compliance corridors that everyone else has to rent. As Telcoin Magazine and Fortune both note, institutional adoption in early 2025 was “foundational, not speculative.” That’s great for Bitcoin, terrible for the culture. As Crypto Birb comments: “Smart money took what’s valuable – good on them.” If the institutions professionalized the space, memecoins disfigured it. What began as satire became the dominant narrative of 2024 and 2025. Every week brought a new “community” token, a new animal, a new political in-joke, and a new wave of burned holders. Memecoins turned crypto into a casino with no exit doors. Token after token pumped on virality alone, then cratered. Even industry veterans who should’ve known better got caught chasing hype over substance. It was the perfect storm of self-sabotage: retail greed met web3 irony, and both got wrecked. Even the macro backdrop worked against risk. President Trump’s trade wars and tariffs, praised by some for protectionism, triggered a 20% drawdown in equities and sapped liquidity. Combined with persistently high interest rates, capital became expensive, speculative flows dried up, and risk assets like crypto flatlined.​ Ironically, the “pro‑crypto administration” ended up freezing the retail comeback. With rates high, consumer spending slowed, and the average investor’s appetite for 100x tokens evaporated. What should’ve been the era of abundance turned into a patience test. And yet, amid all the wreckage, Bitcoin persists, slow, steady, and sovereign. Institutional capital has cemented its legitimacy while everything else burns. As a16z’s State of Crypto report shows, Bitcoin’s strength is underwritten by macro forces and regulatory acceptance.​ This is what maturity looks like: less euphoria, fewer parabolic charts, and a market that’s finally behaving like a financial system rather than a playground. But for those who came here for “number go up,” it feels like a punishment. This bull cycle isn’t exciting; it’s exhausting. Bitcoin’s resilience proves crypto can endure. But the rest of the market, its creativity, its retail energy, and its wild optimism were collateral damage. Maybe that’s the price of progress. Or maybe it’s a sign that somewhere along the way, we lost the script, chasing the meme at the expense of the mission. As Crypto Birb states: “We got played. BY OURSELVES. This is our punishment for choosing hype over utility.” Either way, this bull run will go down in history not for its gains, but for its lesson: not all cycles are meant to make you rich.

October 26, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Oct. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to the 26th issue of our Weekly Report. First, let’s go over the key progress made in the EAI Flywheel. On S1 User Ecosystem: Faraday Finance Inc. was officially established and has submitted its auto finance license application to the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI). The company aims to promote new vehicle sales by soon offering customized finance solutions for FF and FX users — including vehicle financing and leasing services. Through flexible and customer-centric payment options, Faraday Finance could enhance vehicle affordability, improve purchase conversion, and drive substantial sales growth. This is an important step for potentially boosting sales and delivery of models including the FX Super One. In the U.S., most customers either buy cars with a loan or choose to lease them. The progress of our finance company would give our future users more choices and help FF and FX attract new buyers faster. The company could also help manage financial assets and cash flow more efficiently.It will lay the foundation for a fully integrated and dedicated finance ecosystem that supports users through their entire ownership journey. Last weekend, we participated in ComplexCon, one of the world’s most influential pop-culture events, held at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The event brought together hundreds of top streetwear and pop-culture brands and over 50,000 attendees. Both the FF 91 2.0 and FX Super One became spotlight products at the show, attracting significant attention from visitors. On S2-S4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production, and Delivery: As mentioned earlier, the first batch of full-set parts procurement agreement for FX Super One has been signed. This week, key team leaders traveled to the Hanford factory to review preparations for the first vehicle off-line milestone. The whole team is now in full sprint mode for the year-end off-line target for our first FX Super One vehicle. This marks a key milestone for FX, from R&D and design to prototype development, pilot validation, and eventually the potential for mass production, subject to securing necessary agreements, funding and permitting. The entire company — especially the factory team — is now fully mobilized and making thorough preparations to achieve this milestone, which holds great significance not only for the FX brand, but also for the entire company. Moving on to S5 Capital Markets and Finance: The biggest highlight this week is that BlackRock—one of the world’s largest asset managers—increased its holdings in FFAI once again. According to its latest 13G filing with the SEC, as of September 30, 2025, BlackRock owned about 6.8 million FFAI common shares, up from 5.38 million shares at the end of last quarter—an increase of roughly 1.41 million shares, or 26%. Let’s take a look at S6, Middle East progress: We’re now just two days away from the FX Super One Grand Launch in Dubai, which will take place on October 28 at the Armani Hotel, Burj Khalifa. We invite everyone to join the live stream and witness this milestone together. I’m also thrilled to share that we have officially signed one of the greatest sports legends of all time — a true GOAT — who will become the first global owner and Co-Creation Officer of the FX Super One. This exciting partnership will be officially unveiled at the Middle East Final Launch this coming week. On Crypto Flywheel: The Crypto Flywheel also saw solid progress this week. QLGN announced a strategic partnership with BitGo and kicked off its first batch of C10 Treasury allocations. The next day, daily trading volume surged to nearly $300 million. Looking ahead to next week’s plan: After the FX Super One Middle East Final Launch, we’ll share more updates on our Middle East operations, first vehicle off-line progress, and details of our partnership with our first global GOAT owner.We’re now entering one of the most important growth phases in our company’s history—and we’re confident in delivering on our commitments to our stockholders, investors, partners, and users. See you next week.” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Title: St Finbarr's pip Nemo in Cork nailbiter

RTÉ Sport contributor St Finbarr's 1-14 Nemo Rangers 1-13 St Finbarr’s are the Cork Premier Senior Football Champions for 2025 following a nail biting 1-14 to 1-13 victory over their great rivals Nemo Rangers at SuperValu Páirc Uí Chaoimh. Steven Sherlock kicked 0-05 and dual star Brian Hayes was named Player of the Match after tallying 1-02 as the Andy Scannell Cup was draped in blue and yellow ribbons for the first time since 2021. This is the club’s 11th victory overall in the competition and perhaps the sweetest of the lot as it is the first time that St Finbarr’s have beaten Nemo Rangers in the decider, with this being the fifth meeting in the final between the two clubs. The result also marks just the second time in 36 years that the blue and yellow has triumphed over the green and black at senior level. Nemo Rangers had their own demons, as Robbie Dwyer’s side were out to avoid losing three consecutive county finals following successive defeats to Castlehaven. The Barr’s edged it in the second half, despite trailing 1-09 to 0-10 at the break with Kevin O’Donovan’s goal in the 21st minute ultimately the difference after a period of play that saw the two clubs level four times. Things exploded after the restart as Sherlock converted a free and Brian Hayes rifled the roof of the net in the 32nd minute to make the scoreboard read 1-12 to 1-09. Two quick goal chances then fell to both clubs, and good goalkeeping by Darragh Newman and Micheál Aodh Martin increased the tension around the ground as the clocked ticked on. Sherlock followed that up with a point from play, and Mark Cronin immediately replied for Nemo Rangers at the Blackrock End. The corner forward had and opportunity to reduce the arrears down to one with his next touch, but the free for a two pointer hit the post in the 47th minute. Cronin did not miss with his next placed ball, this time from inside the arc, and it was 1-13 to 1-11 with just under five minutes left to play. Both clubs went to their bench in search of something, as the nervous feeling inside the ground seemed to reach new levels. Paul Kerrigan was one of those brought on by Nemo, with the 2010 All Ireland winner entering the pitch seeking his 11th county title. Conor Horgan was the one to equalise with an orange flag, just as the clock turned red, and a grandstand finish was set up. A substitute did decide the destination of the Andy Scannell Cup, and it was Cillian Myers Murray who curled the ball over in the second minute of time added on. Nemo poured forward in search of an equalising or match winning score, but they could not get through the blue wall. St Finbarr’s: Darragh Newman; Billy Hennessey, Jamie Burns, Sam Ryan; Dylan Quinn, Alan O’Connor, Ciaran Doolan; Ian Maguire, Brian Hayes (1-02, 1tp); William Buckley (0-02), Steven Sherlock (0-05, 1tpf, 2f), Conor Dennehy (0-01); John Wiggington Barrett, Ethan Twomey (0-02), Rickey Barrett (0-01).

Title: Germany is doing to itself what even its defeat in WWII couldn’t
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/626988-germany-deindustrialization-ww2-defeat/
Time Published: 2025-10-26T17:32:37Z

By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory Toward the end of World War II in Europe, the US government pondered a plan to not only demilitarize but also disintegrate and deindustrialize postwar Germany. Named after its main proponent, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, the Morgenthau Plan proceeded from the insane assumption that “it is a fallacy that Europe needs a strong industrial Germany.” If it had been implemented, the remains of defeated Germany would have been deliberately turned into a post-industrial wasteland. But then the Cold War happened, everyone, East and West, wanted their Germans making modern things in factories again, and so it was Marshall Plan in and Morgenthau Plan out. Lucky Germans. Now the US-Soviet Cold War has been over for a third of a century already. You’d think that for the Germans – finally free of the odd obligation to kill each other on behalf of Washington and Moscow in case of World War Three and (sort of) happily re-united – Morgenthau’s dark fantasies would just be a tale of bad times long gone-by. But there you would underestimate the often badly overlooked German gift for eccentricity. In reality, post-Cold War Germany’s governments have set out on a resolute course of self-Morgenthauing economic auto-asphyxiation, adapting and obstinately clinging to policies that look as if they had been deliberately devised to deindustrialize and wreck their own country. How can this be? For starters consider the case of global chemistry giant BASF: “What’s happening to Germany you’ll see first at BASF,” some say. And they have a point. Until recently, the German-headquartered company was considered the “crown jewel” of the country’s industry. Now, Germany is “mired in its longest period of stagnation since the Second World War” – says not Moscow’s RT but London’s FT – and BASF exemplifies much of what went so very, very badly wrong. Like much of German business in general, the country’s traditionally powerful and vital chemical industry “is stuck in the greatest crisis” since, at least, the early 1990s. Since 2019, German industry as a whole has shed a total of almost a quarter-million jobs. Regarding BASF – originally founded in 1865 smack in the middle of modern Germany’s Time of Founders (“Gründerzeit”) as the “Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik” – it is true that it is still the largest chemical industry company in the world with subsidiaries in over 80 countries and 112,000 employees. But in Germany, at its original production site in the city of Ludwigshafen – for now still the largest such facility worldwide – it has been enduring billions in losses for years. As a whole, BASF’s business at home, in Germany, is contributing nothing to the company’s profits, at best. If BASF is still doing alright, then not because but in spite of its historic German base. As its former CEO Martin Brudermuller (now with Mercedes Benz, in the other key German industry) put it in 2024, BASF was “making profits everywhere in the world, except Germany.” And that – together with China’s rise (now constituting half of the global chemical industry market) – is why BASF is reducing operations not only in Ludwigshafen but all of Germany, while building a giant new production site in Zhanjiang in China. An up-to-date “mirror image” of the company’s trademark full-integration or composite production concept (“Verbund”) originally pioneered in Ludwigshafen, BASF Zhanjiang is the greatest single investment in the company’s history. In short, Germany’s chemical giant is cloning and optimizing its historic core – not elsewhere in Germany, not in Europe, and not in the US either, but in China. While Brudermüller, an outspoken man, has been warning of Germany’s comprehensive deindustrialization. And though no one will admit it, it is easy to guess what will happen to the dated, ever less competitive original in Ludwigshafen. The open secret of success of BASF’s Ludwigshafen flagship was two-fold: German science and engineering, management, and work ethic played a key role, but so did inexpensive gas from Russia, used as energy source and raw material. Both the German and the Russian inputs were indispensable. Ludwigshafen’s success, as much of the German economy, was a direct result of successful German-Russian, mutually beneficial cooperation. No longer. The EU and Berlin’s – both, ironically, run by Germans – self-destructive policy of re-defining mutual benefits as oh-so-horrible “dependence” to be replaced with some real dependence on the incredibly reliable US and cutting themselves off from Russian natural gas is the decisive factor in Ludwigshafen’s ongoing decline. There are other problems as well, but without this suicidal strategy, longstanding issues – such as, for instance bureaucracy, a mishandled “green transition,” and US tariff warfare – could be resolved or, at least, managed. Yet without inexpensive energy and raw materials, the decline is irreversible. Indeed, by now, BASF is warning of scenarios in which Ludwigshafen will soon stop its gradual descent, but not with recovery. Instead a total crash may loom. The cause? A massive potential gas shortage. None of the above is exceptional in today’s Germany. Of course, economic sectors and individual companies have their specific features. But what matters is how much BASF’s fate represents that of Germany’s economy as a whole. Except the latter is usually worse, often much worse, as in lethal. Consider a few data points: Germany is experiencing a twenty-year peak of insolvencies, as the co-leader of the AfD (Alternative for Germany) party has recently pointed out. And it’s not just Germany’s opposition (and single biggest party in the polls). Even the thoroughly government-aligned de facto state-TV channel ZDF has to admit that “Made in Germany is crumbling.” From 2024 to 2025 alone, 2.1% of Germany’s industrial jobs have gone missing. If you are one of the many Germans busy developing and assembling cars, your chances of employment survival have been even worse: in that sector, a whopping 51,000 or 7% of jobs were axed in just one year – and there’s no end in sight. Profits have been cratering: by over 50% between January and June at Mercedes-Benz, by over a third in the second quarter of 2025 at VW. And that was before some very stable geniuses in Washington made the Dutch government steal – that’s the correct term – Chinese-owned chip maker Nexperia. Inevitably, China is retaliating. Unlike Germany, it’s not run by strange people who take things such as, say, a terrorist attack by “allies” on vital infrastructure with an obsequious grin and a bow. Nexperia is duly out of action and German car companies are among the worst hit by the resulting supply shortages: Hildegard Müller, the head of their national association, has warned of “significant production restrictions, depending on circumstances even full interruptions.” Slow claps for you again, great master trade war strategists of the West. If BASF’s Ludwigshafen is ground zero for the (still) relatively slow decline of the German chemical industry, Stuttgart is shaping up to be one of the cities most devastated by the more rapid fall of the car makers. With 17%, or a quarter of a million, of Stuttgart’s population earning their living from cars – whether at Mercedes-Benz or Porsche directly or one of the many local suppliers, such as much less well-known Mahle or Eberspächer – the city has reason to be afraid. Some are already talking about a bleak future as Germany’s Detroit, the epitome of US rustbelt deindustrialization and dilapidation. The news is certainly not reassuring: Car parts supplier Mahle has already shed 7,000 jobs, for instance. Multinational engineering and technology company Bosch, originally from Stuttgart and now headquartered just a few kilometers to its West, has put 22,000 on the chopping block in Germany as a whole, including almost 2,000 in Stuttgart. Zoom out again, and the picture remains dismal: The reputable Ifo Institute predicts microscopic growth of 0.2% for this year. Next year, they guess, things may look up a little, with 1.3% growth. But even if that actually happens – downward revisions have happened only recently – it is going to be due to the government’s reckless militarist-Keynesian debt-and-spending splurge. Berlin’s current “elite” may be masochists, delighting in taking rough treatment and insults from the US, Ukraine, and even Poland. But Germans as a whole are, of course, less bizarre. By now two thirds are dissatisfied with the coalition in power. If their national misery has a face it is that of its leader, chancellor Friedrich Merz, an ex-BlackRock cadre who charmingly combines tone-deaf, offensive pep talks implying the nation consists of lazy lay-abouts with rants about Russia, drones, and, of course, the AfD, now also accused of being in cahoots with – drumroll – Moscow. Merz, it must be said in Germany’s honor, is unpopularity personified. Think of a German version of Keir “I work for Israel, not you” Starmer in the UK or Emmanuel “please go, please just go!” Macron in France. And that is a sign of national health. In a country whose rulers are systematically running its economy into the ground via an obviously demented policy of self-crippling, popular discontent stands for hope. Perhaps, at long last, enough Germans will soon have had enough.

St Mary’s moved five points clear of the chasing pack atop Division 1A of the All-Ireland League. Ballynahinch, Terenure College and Clontarf are all on 14 points after statement wins, while Lansdowne beat Young Munster 40-35 in the match of the day at Tom Clifford Park. St Mary’s had a bonus point by half-time at UCD when leading 26-10, including a couple of long-range efforts, ultimately scoring seven tries in a 45-24 win. Ex-UCD and Ulster lock Greg Jones and the hard-carrying Dan Goggin had big games. Conor Dean pulled the strings and Mick O’Gara was influential in midfield. Richie Bergin, Rob Gilsenan and Ruairi Shields all scored against their former club, as Mary’s took their haul to 19 points from a possible 20, with what Mark McHugh said was “a professional and clinical” performance. Ballynahinch moved up to second with the day’s standout result, a 25-12 win over Cork Con in Temple Hill. Conor Rankin converted early tries from Ulster winger Aaron Sexton and Chris Gibson. He also landed penalties either side of a Peter Hyland maul try, converted from the touchline by Darragh French, to leave Ballynahinch 20-7 ahead at the break. After Jack Kelleher’s try on the hour, Con had further chances but the visitors’ defence held firm before outhalf Paul Kerr scored from a five-metre scrum. Terenure moved up to third after a second consecutive bonus point win under Carlos Spencer, beating newly-promoted Nenagh Ormond in their first home game of the season, 40-12. Young winger Dan Griffin scored the first of his brace and had Kiwi scrumhalf Griffin Culver in support for the second, but Nenagh reduced the lead to 14-12 by the break. Replacement Joe Coffey finished off a maul before Munster prop Roman Salanoa, making his first start for Nenagh, offloaded for winger Conor McMahon to score. But Terenure pulled clear after hooker Max Russell’s maul try. Culver set up Leinster under-19 backrower Arthur Ashmore on his debut. Offloads by outhalf Aran Egan and Harrison Brewer created Griffin’s slick second before Connacht backrower Oisin McCormack completed the scoring from Will Reilly’s skip pass. Clontarf laid the foundations for their 34-12 bonus-point win at Old Belvedere through their power game, captain Dylan Donnellan scoring his fourth try in four games and 80th in four seasons. The speedy back three of Peter Maher and the O’Grady brothers, Dylan and Alex, combined for one of three unanswered second-half tries. Lansdowne captain Andy Marks was yet again the star in his side’s dramatic win at Young Munster with another brace, the back three of Tom Roche, Sean Galvin, and Leinster Academy youngster Todd Lawlor also scoring. The Cookies trailed 40-21 before tries by Orin Burke and replacement Arron Roulston had them pounding Lansdowne at the death. “Performances have been very good but we’re coming up short,” lamented coach Ger Slattery. Although winless, Munsters have accrued seven bonus points. Long-serving Ulster hooker John Andrew scored a hat-trick on his Instonians debut as they displaced Old Wesley atop the Division 1B table with a 36-14 win at Shaw’s Bridge. In Division 2B, Buccaneers ended a run of 30 consecutive AIL defeats – dating back to a 26-19 victory away to Blackrock in December 2023 – with a 29-21 win in Enniscorthy.

Title: How JPMorgan’s Bitcoin collateral plan could unlock $20 billion in liquidity

As Wall Street giant JPMorgan recognizably embraces crypto assets as loan collateral, industry observers predict a ripple effect among banking institutions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. After years of tension between crypto and traditional finance, a symbolic shift is taking shape inside the world’s largest bank. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is reportedly preparing to let institutional clients use Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral for cash loans. This means the bank’s borrowers can pledge the two top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, which would be held by approved third-party custodians like Coinbase. The initiative is expected to roll out by the end of 2025. This move is significantly ironic considering the financial giant’s CEO Jamie Dimon is a renowned crypto critic. Notably, he has previously described Bitcoin as a “fraud.” However, increased demands for the emerging industry has forced his hands to support these product launches by his firm. JPMorgan’s move could quietly rewrite the boundaries between digital assets and regulated credit markets. According to Galaxy Research data, open centralized-finance (CeFi) borrows totaled $17.78 billion as of June 30, up 15% quarter-over-quarter and 147% year-over-year. When decentralized loans are included, total outstanding collateralized crypto credit reached $53.09 billion in Q2 2025. This is the third-highest figure on record. These numbers point to a structural shift where borrowing activity rises as digital-asset prices increases. This results in improved credit spreads making loans more attractive for traders and treasuries. Moreover, corporate firms are also tapping crypto-backed lending to fund operations, replacing equity issuance with secured debt against digital assets. In that context, JPMorgan’s entry looks less like an experiment and more like a decisive institutional catch-up move in the emerging industry. Considering this, crypto researcher Shanaka Anslem Perera estimates the model could unlock $10 billion to $20 billion in immediate lending capacity for hedge funds, corporate treasuries, and large asset managers seeking dollar liquidity without selling their tokens. In practical terms, that means firms can now raise capital against digital assets the same way they would against US Treasuries or blue-chip equities. While crypto-collateralized lending is familiar inside DeFi protocols and smaller CeFi lenders, JPMorgan’s participation institutionalizes the concept. The bank’s entry signals that digital assets have matured enough to meet global finance’s compliance, custody, and risk-management standards. Matt Sheffield, the CIO of Ethereum-focused treasury firm SharpLink, believes the development could reshape balance sheet management across asset managers and funds. According to him: “Many traditional financial institutions who rely on trading with banks to date need to choose between holding spot ETH OR other positions. The largest investment bank in the world is here to change that. With the ability to borrow against positions held in third-party custodians, you can build a more productive portfolio, increasing the value of the collateral asset. “ Meanwhile, the decision also strengthens JPMorgan’s broader crypto posture. Over the past two years, the bank has built out Onyx, its blockchain-based settlement network, processed billions in tokenized payments, and explored digital-asset repo transactions. Accepting BTC and ETH as loan collateral completes the loop: issuance, settlement, and credit, all of which touch the blockchain rails. Considering this, Sheffield predicts the move will trigger a “competitive cascade” among large banks. He noted: “This starts a wave. Being first is what scares large institutions. The rest will follow with the decision de-risked, because no action would leave them uncompetitive.” Already, rivals like Citi and Goldman Sachs have expanded digital-asset custody and repo initiatives. BlackRock, meanwhile, has integrated tokenized treasuries (BUIDL) into its fund ecosystem, while Fidelity has doubled its institutional crypto desk headcount this year. Despite Wall Street’s growing embrace of digital assets, challenges remain. Banks entering this market must navigate the intrinsic volatility of cryptocurrencies, uncertain regulatory capital treatment, and persistent counterparty risk—all of which constrain how aggressively they can expand crypto-backed lending. US regulators have yet to issue clear capital-weighting guidelines for digital collateral, leaving institutions to rely on conservative internal models. Even with third-party custodians managing custody risk, supervisory oversight is expected to remain intense. Still, the trajectory is unmistakable because digital assets are gradually being woven into the fabric of global credit markets. Bitcoin analyst Joe Consoerti said these moves show that: “The global financial system is slowly recollateralizing itself around the highest quality asset known to man.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Anne Enright: ‘I’m in a lull. I’m trying to recalibrate after a long decade of elder care’

Time Published: 2025-10-26T05:31:00Z
Full Content:
“I’m in a bit of a lull,” Anne Enright says when I ask what she’s working on. “You wait for a catch, a snag to your interest. “The wonderful Annie Dillard has a story about an Inuit woman who has a baby to feed and no fish, so she slices tiny bits of her own thigh as bait. ‘This is what a writer does,’ she says. That’s Annie Dillard, though, not me.” But the New Yorker magazine recently published Enright’s short story The Bridge Stood Fast, and Jonathan Cape a brilliant career retrospective of her nonfiction, Attention, reflecting on her life, writers and art, and Ireland and the world, so she has been not idle but taking stock. “I’m in a lull because of the world, probably also because my parents are both gone – and the family home. I’m trying to recalibrate after a long decade of elder care for me and my siblings.” Enright’s mother, Cora, died in November 2023, her father, Donal, in June 2016, a few months before Donald Trump was first elected US president. “I lost a wonderful man from my life while the world gained a terrible one,” she wrote in an essay in No Authority, a collection from 2019 of her writings as the inaugural laureate of Irish fiction, in which she addressed, among other things, misogyny and male privilege. “I knew many good men and very few bad ones. Was this male goodness also illusory? What, I wondered, came between these individual, well-intentioned men and the wider enactment of equality?” She reprises the subject in fictional form in her New Yorker story. “Even though the story is set in the 1980s, you want to feel it is saying something relevant to now. The world is so different, you want to meet that change in some way. The story is very strongly based on me going down to Clare with my dad, picking blackberries and mushrooms. I wanted to capture that fantastic thing of having your dad all to yourself when you were 11. Any girl who is stuck on their da, I had access to that easily.” [ Anne Enright: ‘People that go around complaining they don’t win prizes … I always think of Trump and Georgia’Opens in new window ] In the story, the father suddenly has to leave, and a darker masculinity takes centre stage. It asks, if men are more or less good, how did we get saddled with such a damaged patriarchy? There is also an undercurrent of Ireland’s urban-rural divide. Enright once found the New Yorker’s fiction editors “almost anti-voice”, wanting to turn colourful sentences beige, but she has always admired its editing as “a lesson in clarity, foregrounding things the reader needs to know”, one she passes on to her students at University College Dublin, where she is professor of creative writing. “Don’t be hiding things under your jumper. There’s something you’re not telling.” I realised that the people who didn’t like you weren’t going to like you because you won the Booker: they were going to dislike you more Enright has enjoyed consistent critical success since her debut short-story collection, The Portable Virgin, from 1991, won the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature. Winning the Booker Prize, with The Gathering, from 2005, made her name internationally. “It was fantastic timing. It very much did its job for me.” She didn’t think she had written a Booker winner. “I was rearing small kids and locked away for a few hours a day in Bray. I was hauling it out of my guts and thought, No one is going to like this.” The late Irish Times literary critic Eileen Battersby was unimpressed. Enright says, “I realised that the people who didn’t like your work weren’t going to change their minds because you won the Booker: they were going to dislike your work more.” In my view she has reached another level with her three most recent novels, The Green Road, Actress and The Wren, The Wren. But despite being up for the Women’s Prize for Fiction five times, “you just know that’s not going to happen. The magic is moving elsewhere,” with “a shift to a cooler female voice”. “You outgrow ideas of fashionability. Writing the sort of book I write, which is interested in style and language, how the sentences fall, it used to be called literary, but things shift. Style in some mouths is a semi-insult. I’m not second-guessing the market. That is the enemy of good writing and a sure way to fail. “There are times late at night you think you’re no good at all, but you learn to live with the uncertainty. Usually for me it’s a structural flaw or unease. I’d break it up or smooth it out a bit. In The Green Road and The Gathering, there are tensions between the book falling apart and coming together. I sometimes wish I could write a book in one style and one voice the whole way through.” All this made winning the $175,000 Windham-Campbell Prize this year a huge and welcome surprise. “I thought those days were gone.” “You always finish a book too quickly,” she says, although she has never worked to a deadline since her debut novel, The Wig My Father Wore, from 1995, “which I missed by two years. I was very neurotic about it in the early days. I wrote with great difficulty. I wrote every day for 30 years. I need to. I’m slightly obsessive and addicted to it.” She usually has two or three nonfiction deadlines, however – work she takes on if she believes it will bring her fiction or thinking on. [ Anne Enright on Edna O’Brien: She never left Ireland, yet couldn’t live here eitherOpens in new window ] “Stylistically, Wig is not showing its age. Is that a very arrogant thing to say? I noticed my New Yorker story is doing what I do, moving from paragraph to paragraph faster than other writers. On one level it is naturalistic, but I can sense that old energy from the first story in The Portable Virgin is still there. “I thought I want to stop doing that now, but it still is the engine that keeps me going, that movement into surprise, the way that the paragraph ends in a way that you don’t expect from its beginning, so there is a bit of a dance going on. I’m not writing modernism like Tom McCarthy, but I’m not writing like William Trevor, either, so there is a conversation between the two.” Enright recognises that some of her novels are couples: The Gathering and The Green Road; Actress and The Wren, The Wren. “They are bookends. They talk to each other. You realise at the end [of writing a novel] that you haven’t done at all what you meant to – if I knew that’s what I was going to do, I would have started out differently – and so you do start out differently.” I wasn’t expecting to be asked about suicidal thoughts 40 years in my past, but I suppose I have always skirted around the difficult feelings of those years Both Actress and The Wren, The Wren “have mythological, supernormal parents. They have a glow, given them by fame, which is shorthand for how we feel about our parents anyway. In The Wren, The Wren I had the advantage of being able to make [Phil the poet] real by making his work real, and so it was a completely different engagement [than with Actress], more exciting. You could give him go, let him have his say. “I’m a great believer in that, which is one of the reasons why my books tend to not fragment but collate, because they have a democratic impulse behind them. You can demonise Phil – he is every kind of foolish bad man – but once you get him speaking you can also experience him. Maybe 20 per cent of my readers on a good day would be male, but I’ve had a good male response to the Phil chapters. My work is political but not ideological.” In other words, it is polyphonic, not just one point of view. [ Anne Enright: ‘I am a proud Dubliner, born and reared. I spurn these lyrical types yearning for the rural’Opens in new window ] Enright reminds me that during the first pandemic lockdown she surprised me by picking a collection of poetry translated from Irish as her summer read. “Poems like The Yellow Bittern and To a Blackbird were moving and also key to my writing The Wren, The Wren. Now the thickets of misogyny are being cleared from Irish letters, I’ve been going back to Irish poetry, a reclamation. “For decades there was almost a hum off Irish work that was not for or about you. I became tired of having to praise it, the lie that it contains, the women’s lives trapped by that sentimentality. But you can’t be too cross when you sit down to write something. You have to let the feeling settle and then go back to reaccess it.” I ask to see Enright’s writing desk, and she surprises me by sitting cross-legged on the sofa in a basement room, where she types on her laptop: “Slow slow, quick quick slow. It’s more of a rhythm, a rush and a stop. Writing by hand feels like a voiceover; this is more in the moment.” Dialogue, she says, shouldn’t all be the same length unless you’re Beckett or Pinter. There is always a power dynamic or a kind of dance going on. “I am very interested in the pattern of interruptions. Women interrupt to be helpful; men interrupt as a territorial thing.” She writes about Ireland but not for it, she says. “I’m very proud of the fact I had the 46A [bus] in every single book. Now it’s gone, I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I can put the E2 in.” To write precisely about the imprecise, often ambiguous nature of things is one of Enright’s gifts, so it is no surprise when I ask where she grew up to learn that it was on the borders of Perrystown, Terenure and Templeogue – “postally Dublin 12, religiously Crumlin, and Terenure for the estate agents” – where the Dublin bus stopped and fields began. [ Goodbye to the 46A: End of legendary Dublin bus route made famous in songOpens in new window ] As for class? “It’s an evolving space for me,” she says. “No one along the Dart line, which is so class-bound, believes this, but we were, as far as I knew, indifferent to class. Possibly because we were an academic family, a lot of investment went into that.” Her parents were both civil servants, but with five children to raise, their house was very modest. “My mother came from a falling class – middle class with no money, because her father died just before she was born. She had a Catholic spiritual sense that people were people and shouldn’t be judged for what they had. A lid would be put on notions. “The English novel of a certain decade is obsessed with class, and I’m not interested – those power relations are not my concern – but I am very interested in people’s notions of themselves, and notions in the Irish sense.” She always does a deep dive into her characters’ backgrounds. “I do know where people come from, how they place themselves socially, but then I lose all that and focus on something else about their lives.” Enright was a precocious child. She won a Kodak Instamatic camera for a national essay competition when she was 11. She preferred Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland to The Wind in the Willows, playful and ludic like her father, but disappointing her mother. “It was news to me that reading could be the wrong sort.” Had she been a boy she wouldn’t have been allowed to be a writer, she has said. “I did cause a lot of maternal anxiety. But my father said, ‘I don’t know what she has, but she has something.’” She passed her Leaving Cert at 16, then won a scholarship to a school in Canada, whose headmaster predicted that she would blow the world up with her writing – an unfortunate metaphor. He was not the last male critic to displease her. “I had absolutely no money, and there were lots of people with lots of money, who dressed with confidence, who had travelled.” She studied English at Trinity College Dublin. She tried her hand at writing monologues and acting with friends – Lynn Parker, Pauline McLynn, Declan Hughes – who would form Rough Magic Theatre Company, and Martin Murphy, whom she would marry. She graduated with a first. “When I was trying to place myself as a future writer, I wasn’t thinking of Irish writers at all, but once you go out in the world you are obliged to talk about nothing else. I read all the Frank O’Connors as a child, just reading for pleasure what was in the house, Robert Coover, Donald Barthelme, Marguerite Duras, the modernists. “I was in a state of contention with writers like John McGahern, a kind of argument which is also a very strong connection. I felt he became a little too like his father even while rejecting him, that he was quite paternalistic. For the most part he rose above his damage with considerable grace, but I have an issue sometimes with how his language is laid on the page.” Enright then started writing fragments, a form that the French literary theorist Roland Barthes writes about as having the constant pleasure of beginnings, without arc or resolution. “It works by juxtaposition. It’s a scrap. Wig narratively relied on collage, the feeling that things are either making new meanings or breaking down.” In 1986 she won a scholarship to the University of East Anglia, or UEA, in Norwich, “the back of beyond, middle-class to the max”, for a master’s degree in creative writing taught by Angela Carter and Malcolm Bradbury. Carter nourished the work but was a little condescending. “She asked why I wanted to go back to Ireland – clearly, for her, a very backward, provincial place. If you wanted to be a writer, go to London. I was a bit too Irish for them, unrepressed, a bit of an alien species. But when I fell apart they were very nice.” [ ‘It’s a phenomenon - we’re very privileged’: Contemporary Irish women writers celebrated at symposium in MexicoOpens in new window ] What went wrong? “Young people nowadays know staying up all night is not a good idea. I lived in an evil little room, never went for a walk. There was a lot of student depression. I worked from 8pm to 4am. I lost words. I had no idea what I was writing.” It sounds a bit like Jack Nicholson in The Shining, I say. She laughs. “There was a bit of Barton Fink going on. I was very isolated. I didn’t go down to London. I had no money – £3,000 to get through the year, totally scraping by. Someone offered me a lift to London, then, like a nice English person, turned round and asked me for petrol money, after leaving me in the wrong part of town. “I was increasingly unwell. There were other difficulties. I wasn’t particularly in touch with my family at the time. I do remember people thought you were funny and therefore couldn’t be sad. My counsellor just laughed and laughed. A lot of my 20s were rocky, one way or another.” Ten pages from the end of Making Babies, her memoir of early motherhood from 2006, she quietly drops the bombshell that on Easter Monday 1986 she attempted suicide. People had been living a false life. Denial makes people strange “The older I get the more political I am about depression, or less essentialist – it is not because of who you are, but where you are placed,” she writes. “Ireland broke apart in the eighties, and I sometimes think that the crack happened in my own head. The constitutional row about abortion was a moral civil war that was fought out in people’s homes – including my own – with unfathomable bitterness. The country was screaming at itself about contraception, abortion, and divorce. It was a hideously misogynistic time. Not the best environment for a young woman establishing a sexual identity.” “My mother was very conservative, Catholic,” Enright says; “I was very oppositional, very strong in my own opinions.” Her parents had had four compliant children and didn’t know what to do with her, an overachiever in the wrong way, clever but maverick. “My mother was, or became, hard to please. That relationship didn’t thrive for a number of years until, reluctantly, she came to an accommodation. “Ireland was changing underneath but not on the surface. I wasn’t the only person who had difficulty in that generation. The stories were legion. People had been living a false life. Denial makes people strange.” Suicide is a sensitive topic, and we leave it there, but the author follows up the next day with an email that clarifies things further. “I wasn’t expecting to be asked about suicidal thoughts 40 years in my past, but I suppose I have always skirted around the difficult feelings of those years. I moved in with Martin after college and my mother took very poorly to our ‘living in sin’, so by the time I left for UEA I wasn’t speaking to my family, and then, for reasons that must have made sense at the time, I broke up with Martin too. I had the feeling I was embarking on my writer’s life completely alone, and when the writing did not come good, everything seemed to fall apart for me. That is the scoop, right there.” I wonder how this trauma fed into her writing, the early work experimenting with fragmentation, that falling-apart impulse. Her debut novel features Stephen, an angel who has died by suicide. The Gathering’s eponymous family reunion is triggered by the suicide of a sibling, Liam. A death wish hangs over her short story Night Swim. Difficult mother-child relationships are a recurring feature in her best work. The fault line in families is often generational as much as gendered. It is no wonder her writing is so charged as she captures this. “It’s great to be asked after a million years of no one asking,” she says. “The Gathering has a suicide in it, and I had written about suicide a few years prior to that. Journalists were not reading the same book I had written. The [Booker] prize skewed their idea of what they wanted to talk about. Nobody asked: that’s the exercise of taboo right there. We will talk about everything else and not even notice it. It’s like Poe’s purloined letter: it’s right there in plain view.” That said, “if I was writing The Gathering as a book about suicide, I would have done it differently. Your questions are more personal and my answers are more social: I talk about the environmental, social factors in my life at the time, in a way because the personal is too personal and also, in a way, not fully true, or not enough. You can become unhinged for any number of reasons. [ Honing the craft of the Irish Writers Centre: ‘It’s a great story to tell, as we are a nation of storytellers’Opens in new window ] “The novel, as a form, is really interested in causation. Liam’s sister Veronica looks for a cause in The Gathering and doesn’t find one, except for the fact that Liam very clearly has been abused as a child. But suicide is absolute, death is so absolute, there is no cause big enough to explain it. “After the Booker, some of the journalistic antagonism was so extreme I woke up 20 years later thinking that [abuse] must have happened to them. Though the book is not about the brother’s abuse so much as Veronica’s problem of witnessing it. All that is one of the slowest burns in Irish life. It is only two years since the Blackrock [College sex abuse] scandal surfaced.” Stephen in The Wig “owes a lot to gay Catholic iconography, Latinx gay culture. It’s more a queer reading.” Again, she follows up the next day: “Two things though. The post-suicide angel in The Wig owes something to the feeling that I was in a ‘second’, somehow magical life now. “I am not sure if the writerly impulse towards fragmentation maps absolutely onto the psychological, though I see how you might want to make the connection. Working with fragments is not so limited as linear fiction when it comes to capturing experience – it mimics the way consciousness works, so is a lot more like life. Joyce used fragments. I am fed up saying I have a problem with authority, and that is why I do not write realism. Naturalistic fiction is a lie – and a dull one at that. This is me changing the narrative from your ‘broken’ to my ‘honest’ or even ‘smart’.” Miraculously, despite everything that had happened and not happened in Norwich, Enright came home that summer and spent six weeks at the Tyrone Guthrie Centre, the artists’ retreat at Annaghmakerrig, in Co Monaghan, during which she wrote three stories, which were published in a Faber anthology (alongside Hugo Hamilton). Her mother sent her a clipping of an RTÉ ad: “Producer-director wanted”. She got an amazing reference from Malcolm Bradbury, and next thing she was a trainee director at Montrose, alongside Jim Sherwin and Moya Doherty. At a time in Ireland when most young people didn’t even have a job, she was directing live TV shows such as Nighthawks, making great television with the likes of Kevin McAleer and Arthur Riordan, but it was 85 shows a year with no holidays. It was high cortisone, living on her nerves, anarchic. It ended in a breakdown, “which I would now call a burnout”. “How much time and young energy and talent did I throw into that effing organisation,” she wrote. She quit and became a writer full-time. What sort of creative-writing tutor is she? “I feel we are moving towards the American consumer model of education, the idea that you’re going to get doled-out information that will teach you how to write. I feel that is an illusion; it makes the student satisfied with the service but not good on the page. I’m interested in reversing the polarity. I read the students’ work. They will be read, not taught, and be given line edits, as well as a broader response and editorial guidance. There is nowhere else you can get all of that in one place. “I tell them the structure of a sentence is the structure of the writer’s mind. I show them what they are doing on the page and how to see what the work is requiring of them. Getting a conversation going between the page and the artist. Writing as an act of discovery. I love a fresh text: it makes me recognise the provisionality of everything you are doing on the page, because we are all in the same boat, writing badly and then making it better and, finally, good.” Attention: Writing on Life, Art and the World, by Anne Enright, is published by Jonathan Cape on October 30th You can contact Samaritans on freephone 116 123 or by email at jo@samaritans.ie © 2025 The Irish Times DAC
