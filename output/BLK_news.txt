Title: CFTC to introduce tokenized funds – How will it impact financial markets?

Here’s a look at how the adoption of tokenized collateral could impact financial markets. In a significant move aimed at enhancing portfolio diversification for investors and streamlining capital efficiency for fund managers, a subcommittee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has advanced its recommendations on the application of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in managing non-cash collateral. These guidelines, which focus on enabling registered firms to leverage DLT for holding and transferring tokenized assets, mark a critical step toward integrating blockchain solutions within traditional financial infrastructure. The recommendations have been passed to the full committee for further review. The initiative gained traction following reports by Bloomberg on the 2nd of October. This highlights the push to utilize tokenized shares of money-market funds from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton as collateral in trading activities. For those unfamiliar, the subcommittee pushing these advancements includes influential members like Citadel, Bank of New York Mellon, and Bloomberg LP, further underscoring the momentum behind tokenization in traditional financial sectors. That being said, if approved by the full committee later this year, the proposed recommendations could substantially drive the adoption of tokenized collateral within financial markets, offering companies enhanced capital efficiency in their operations. Notably, this development would benefit BlackRock’s BUIDL tokenized fund and Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX, two leading players in the tokenized U.S. treasuries space. For those unaware, BUIDL, according to data from rwa.xyz, dominates the market with over $518 million in tokenized assets, while FOBXX holds a significant share of $435 million. Together, these two funds represent nearly half of the $2.3 billion tokenized U.S. treasuries market. Therefore, if the recommendations gain full approval, the use of tokenized collateral is expected to expand, with more businesses seeking capital efficiencies through tokenization. Remarking on the same, McKinsey in a recent report released on the 20th of June, noted, “Based on our analysis, we expect that total tokenized market capitalization could reach around $2 trillion by 2030, driven by adoption in mutual funds, bonds and exchange-traded notes (ETN), loans and securitization, and alternative funds.” They further added, “In a bullish scenario, this value could double to around $4 trillion, but we are less optimistic than previously published estimates as we approach the middle of the decade.” As expected, some firms, such as crypto prime brokers Hidden Road and FalconX, are already leveraging BlackRock’s BUIDL token as collateral. This highlights the growing adoption of tokenized assets in the financial sector. Aave recently proposed the GHO Stability Module (GSM) on the 26th of August, aimed at utilizing BUIDL shares to maintain its stablecoin peg to the US dollar. Similarly, stablecoin issuer Ethena Labs revealed plans for a new stablecoin, UStb, fully backed by BUIDL.

Title: What office meltdown? Developers see a shortage of high-end space and are rushing to build it.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/office-construction-demand-upcoming-shortage-real-estate-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-03T11:00:02Z

Office vacancy is at a record high in Washington, DC, and the city is regarded as one of the nation's most challenged markets — in part because of its heavy reliance on federal tenants that have continued to slim down their spaces. Yet Hilary Goldfarb, a senior managing director at Rockefeller Group who leads the company's Washington operations, has little doubt about the sleek 400,000-square-foot office property her firm is raising at 600 Fifth St. When the building is completed in mid-2026, Goldfarb said, she is "confident it will be full." "This is not hope as a strategy," she added, adding that half the project was pre-leased to the law firm Crowell & Moring. "It's based on real data and real activity," she said. Across the country, major office markets from New York to San Francisco have been pummeled by the lasting popularity of remote and hybrid work. Newly built, high-end offices, however, are finding takers. That demand has persisted even as office construction has been stifled by higher interest rates and inflation, which have pushed up building costs. Worries over the health of the office market have also made lenders reluctant to finance new development. About 30 million square feet of new office space is expected to be completed this year in the US, roughly half of what was built in 2019, before the pandemic, CBRE, a real-estate services firm, said. It projected deliveries would fall even further in 2025, to 14 million square feet. While the overall office market is awash in hundreds of millions of square feet of empty space, CBRE predicted that vacancy in the market's upper segment would drop to pre-pandemic levels by 2027 — about the same time projects that are breaking ground now are set to be ready. A growing number of office developers have taken notice and see a budding shortage they are eager to cater to. Large-office tenants, who often plan their space decisions years in advance, have also begun to recognize that while space options may abound now, they're likely to vanish in the coming years — raising interest in new development. "The last six, seven months, there's not just people coming kicking the tires; there's people that are really looking to engage," Scott Rechler, the CEO of RXR, said. He was referring to what he said was growing tenant interest in 175 Park Ave., a 2.8-million-square-foot skyscraper designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill that the developers RXR and TF Cornerstone are planning next to Grand Central Terminal in midtown Manhattan. The group now aims to begin construction on the more than $4 billion 1,575-foot-tall tower midway through 2025 and with significantly less pre-leasing than originally planned because of its growing confidence in demand. Asking rents at the tower are set to be above $200 per square foot, among the highest ever sought in New York City. "There used to be a point where we thought we would need to pre-lease all of it," Rechler said. "Now, we think that at 500,000 feet, it's probably enough to get going." Rechler said that interest in elite new space had been stoked by other high-end offerings in the market, such as One Vanderbilt, a recently built nearby tower, JPMorgan's new headquarters at 270 Park Ave., and a planned skyscraper at 350 Park Ave., which will house the investment firm Citadel. "If your competitors have a building like that that they're identified with and you're trying to be on a parallel path, you're going to say I want to be in a space at the same level or better," Rechler said. The large development firm Related Cos., meanwhile, says that four office towers it has built with Oxford Properties as part of their Hudson Yards megaproject are 99% full. The team is readying to begin a new 45-story 1.1 million-square-foot office property called 70 Hudson Yards next year. "We think we're going to be one of the only new buildings in '27, '28 when there's going to be no new supply," Philippe Visser, Related's president of office development, said. Even as overall office vacancy is at 15.1% in Manhattan, according to CBRE, Visser sees little competition between the overwhelming majority of that empty space and Hudson Yards, where a number of major corporate names have migrated in recent years to take occupancy of newly built buildings. Tenants include Wells Fargo, KKR, BlackRock, Meta, and L'Oréal. "All these successful companies who are looking for really dynamic office space want new construction," Visser said. The 70 Hudson Yards building is set to have various state-of-the-art features, including a triple-paned glass facade, which greatly enhances the insulating properties of glass exteriors and will make the building more energy-efficient and appealing to sustainability-conscious office users. In lower Manhattan, Larry Silverstein hinted that he's close to moving ahead with plans to erect the final office skyscraper at the World Trade Center, a 2.8 million-square-foot tower designed by the architect Norman Foster. Rumors abound that Silverstein is close to signing a large lease with American Express that would allow the project to proceed. "Just stay tuned" was all Silverstein would say about the possibility of a deal at the tower, 2 World Trade Center. He said he was certain other tenants would fill up the remainder of the building's available space once construction was underway. "When you put everything this building has all together, it's superior," Silverstein said. "It never left my mind that someday we would succeed in accomplishing tower two — and that's where we are today." Manhattan is particularly conducive to new construction because it has both a large captive audience of corporate-office users and a deep inventory of old, outdated office properties that have fallen out of favor. But because there's so little office construction on the horizon nationally, builders have begun to lay similar plans in other markets with similar dynamics. Visser, for instance, said Related expected to break ground on a 40-story 925,000-square-foot office tower at 725 W. Randolph St. in Chicago by next year. While that city is also awash in available space, the building would be one of the only available newly built office properties in the Fulton Market neighborhood, a desirable subdistrict in the city's West Loop known for its retail and restaurants, he said. Related Ross, a spinoff development firm launched earlier this year by Related's founder, Stephen Ross, is about to begin construction on 15 City Place, a nearly 500,000-square-foot office building in West Palm Beach, Florida. The project is about 70% pre-leased to an undisclosed roster of tenants, according to Jordan Rathlev, a senior vice president of development at the company. Rathlev said he recently received a space inquiry from a financial-technology firm that's seeking at least 300,000 square feet — far more than 15 City Place can accommodate. The interest from that tenant and others has given a boost to the company's ambitions to begin building a neighboring office property called 10 City Place that would also be about 500,000 square feet. "The intent is that they're both going at the same time," Rathlev said, indicating Related's hope that it will sign enough anchor tenancy at 10 City Place to build it and 15 City Place simultaneously. There is a yawning gap between the health of top-tier office space and the wider market, according to data from CBRE. The firm labels new and heavily renovated spaces that meet a host of quality measures as "prime" — a segment that encompasses only 8% of overall office inventory nationally. A net total of 49.3 million square feet of prime space was absorbed between 2020 and the first quarter of 2024, according to CBRE. About 170.3 million square feet of net vacancy accrued in the rest of the office market during that same period. Overall office vacancy nationally was 19.1% in June, close to a record level. Prime vacancy was 15.5%, and CBRE forecast that figure would drop by almost half, to 8.2% by 2027, its pre-pandemic average. "We believe that this absorption estimate is conservative and the prime vacancy rate could return to its pre-pandemic level sooner given continued job growth," Jessica Morin, CBRE's director of US office research, said. These top-of-the-market spaces, which charged a 60% premium before the pandemic, are 84% more expensive than competing spaces. With little supply, that differential could grow. Morin said: "8.2% is a healthy prime market and we expect rent growth in this tranche." Driving the solid metrics is a lack of new supply. While a total of 44 million square feet of office space is under construction, only about 17.3 million square feet of it, 39% of the total, is considered prime, according to CBRE. Eight million square feet of that is pre-leased, meaning that there is only about 10 million square feet of upcoming available top-quality space. Even with the tailwinds, financing high-end office construction remains a challenge. Banks have grown wary of lending to office projects, even those that are likely to be a financial success, because of broader concerns around declining values, increased foreclosures, and the potential for financial losses in the sector. As a result, Rechler said, RXR is considering "alternative strategies" to arrange financing for 175 Park Ave. "The scale of this project is of a level — I'm not sure you'd be able to get enough traditional banks, as an example, to be a lender," Rechler said. Rechler added that RXR had explored other routes to arrange the billions of dollars of debt necessary to fund 175 Park Ave.'s construction, including the municipal-bond market, in part because the project includes $500 million of transit upgrades to Grand Central Terminal. "I feel good," Rechler said, "that we'll have the right combination of pre-leasing and financing to begin next year." Jump to

Title: LVMH Strikes Landmark 10-Year Global Partnership with Formula 1
URL: https://www.luxuo.com/motoring/f1/lvmh-strikes-landmark-10-year-global-partnership-with-formula-1.html
Time Published: 2024-10-03T10:12:07Z

The deal brings brands like Louis Vuitton, Moët Hennessy, and TAG Heuer into the global motorsport arena, marking a new chapter for LVMH and Formula 1. LVMH will be the official Global Partner of Formula 1 from 2025, in a landmark 10-year deal announced this week. The world’s largest luxury group has a number of relevant brands here, the group’s press release making special mention of Louis Vuitton, Moët Hennessy and TAG Heuer. This news is almost not newsworthy at all anymore because it has been gristle-clogging up the rumor meat processor for some months now. However, this remains one of the biggest news items in the world of luxury, if for nothing other than its sheer scale. The consensus on the value of the deal (undisclosed by LVMH or F1) is estimated at between USD 100 to USD 150 million a year, which only counts as small potatoes if you are BlackRock. Read More: LVMH’s L’Epée Acquisition Hints at Broader Strategy in Luxury Horology For some context, the LVMH group clocked revenues of EU86.15 billion in FY23, with a net income of EUR 15.17 billion. If the F1 deal had been in place then, net income would have been lower to the tune of 0.15 billion. To put it another way, any cost that is visible from this kind of cursory top-down look will make shareholders groan and reach for their Moët; we recommend the Dom Perignon 2003 vintage, in the David Lynch limited edition, if possible. So, what does LVMH gain from this? Details are about as scant as what is known of the activities of the Arnault family office but here is what the big guns said in the presser: “The people, the quest for excellence and the passion for innovation are at the heart of the activity of our Maisons and Formula 1,” said Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO, of LVMH Group. “In motorsport as in fashion, watchmaking or wines and spirits, every detail counts on the path to success. Both in our workshops and on circuits around the world, it is this incessant search to break boundaries that inspires our vision, and this is the meaning that we want to bring to this great and unique partnership between Formula 1 and our Group.” Read More: New Frontiers: What to Expect from Julien Tornare at Hublot “In recent years, Formula 1 has truly become one of the most desirable sports in the world,” said Frédéric Arnault, CEO, of LVMH Watches. “It’s a vibrant discipline that echoes a number of values that are very important to us, such as innovation, team spirit and performance. For many years, several of our Maisons have also chosen to invest in Formula 1, whether to create unique experiences or for moments of celebration. With our Maisons and the expertise of our Group, we want to further grow this experiential dimension that Formula 1 provides all over the world. We are only at the very beginning of this partnership, but the seasons that await us promise to be extraordinary.” Read More: Frédéric Arnault’s Appointment Alerts Growing Importance of LVMH Watches The prominence of the younger Arnault in the reporting on this story across the board seems to indicate the degree of his involvement. In fact, he has been vocal in the past of the importance of Formula 1 to TAG Heuer in particular (when he was CEO of that brand) and was very public in his ambition to return the brand to pole position in the sport; TAG Heuer is currently partnering with the Red Bull Formula 1 team, which has been pretty good for the brand. Our retail friends in Singapore tell us that TAG Heuer typically sees a sales boost from racing season, and we have no reason to doubt this. Read More: TAG Heuer’s “Extreme” Ways On the other hand, a deal as massive as a global partnership is probably too big for TAG Heuer to swallow, without a bit of Moët to wash it down and Louis Vuitton to sew it all up; Morgan Stanley estimates TAG Heuer’s revenue at under USD 800 million in the last FY. Again, it is worth bearing in mind that this is not LVMH’s first rodeo. Most famously, Moët & Chandon was the champagne of record for the podium celebrations for years, and it was once synonymous with Formula 1. We have heard from industry insiders that champagne’s biggest name withdrew from the races because, well, they just used too much inventory. Read More: Could LVMH’s CEO Reshuffle Be The Key to Higher Long-Term Revenues? And then there is the matter of what role Louis Vuitton will play, as it surely must do. While it is fun to imagine all the drivers kitted out in Louis Vuitton flame-retardant suits, this is extremely unlikely. The story is still developing so we will return with more updates once they are confirmed. For more on the latest in luxury and motoring click here.

Title: Bitcoin Down To $60,000: Did Q4 2024 Lows Just Print?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-down-to-60000-did-q4-2024-lows-just-print/

Bitcoin is down at writing, slipping roughly 8% from September highs. After two days of losses, BTC is starting Q4 2024 on the wrong footing, with the real risk of prices sliding below $60,000 and back to September and August lows. One analyst on X is optimistic about the world’s most valuable coin, which is flat and hanging by a thread. In a post, the analyst said the recent setback should be seen positively. Moreover, the trader continued, Bitcoin, even with the pain holders faced in early October 2024, is likely printing Q4 2024. According to the analyst’s preview, Bitcoin tends to establish swing highs or lows early in the trading period, in this case, for Q4 2024. Although the escalations in the Middle East are disruptive, Bitcoin won’t be significantly impacted–a net positive for price. The trader expects liquidity to ramp up in the coming months, boosting prices. Bitcoin is down after an impressive September that saw prices climb higher, reaching $66,000. Historically, September is bearish for Bitcoin. However, by the end of September, it was up 7%, rejecting early losses and closing above a strong liquidation level at around $65,000 and $66,000. Optimism is high because Bitcoin is printing at the same price as in early August and September. Bitcoin prices had plunged to as low as $49,000 by the first week of August before recovering steadily in the next three weeks. In early September, prices again fell, dropping to as low as $52,000 before resuming the uptrend set in motion in August. It remains to be seen whether the events of early August and September will be replicated. However, optimism is high, and most BTC holders, according to CoinMarketCap sentiment analysis, are bullish. Over 60% of all voters expect BTC to edge higher, while 38% are bearish, expecting sellers to dominate. Possible tailwinds for bulls include the inflow of capital to spot Bitcoin ETFs. Soso Value data shows that when BTC prices fell on October 1, BlackRock bought over $40 million worth of coins. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Global management consulting firm Bain & Company recently released a report on the artificial intelligence industry, highlighting that AI was driving an unprecedented wave of technological change, with the market for AI products and services projected to reach between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Per the research done by Bain, major cloud services providers were at the forefront of AI research and development, pushing the boundaries of larger models, advanced infrastructure, and energy efficiency. These hyperscalers were focusing on the development of larger, more complex models that demanded significant computational power and resources, leading to the need for data centers with energy capacities up to gigawatts, potentially straining energy grids and supply chains. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed. Bain underlined that while the big players dominated the high end of the market with expansive models and enormous data centers, innovation was also thriving in smaller models. These smaller, domain-specific models were being deployed at the edge, where they were more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and capable of addressing real-time processing needs, particularly in applications like autonomous driving. The proliferation of models like Llama, Claude, and Gemini illustrated how AI was evolving rapidly beyond just a few proprietary models, with many options now open-source or specialized for particular tasks. The research further detailed that the rapid growth in AI workloads, particularly with data-heavy applications, was also reshaping the technology landscape. The need for increased storage, computing power, and memory was driving innovations in data center design, networking, and storage technologies. Per Bain, chip companies and particularly GPU makers were expanding beyond their core graphics processing units to include integrated solutions that improved the efficiency of AI models, with their products now combining compute, memory, and networking capabilities. The competition was also spurring the development of vertically integrated AI solutions, where tech companies designed everything from hardware to software to optimize AI performance. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Anthropic, the generative artificial intelligence company that is backed by Amazon, recently announced that it would be launching a version of Claude geared towards large businesses. Claude is an array of large language models developed by Anthropic. The move comes after OpenAI, a rival of Anthropic, launched ChatGPT for Enterprise in August. Both companies offer monthly subscriptions to their AI tools. TechCrunch reports that the subscription for Claude would cost more than $30 per month. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has already pledged more than $4 billion towards the AI startup. Citi recently reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a $245 price target. Analysts at the advisory issued an investor note following a third party seller event named Amazon Accelerate. The note detailed that the advisory was incrementally confident that Amazon's core retail segment would continue to gain greater wallet share as fulfillment efficiencies lowered overall cost to serve. With faster shipping speeds, the rise in essentials, and improving conversion rates, Amazon's core retail business would deliver continued share gains and expanding margins as Web Services demand accelerated, the note underlined. Overall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The company recently announced the availability of a new solid-state drive that offers two times faster performance than the previous model. The new drive would give gamers, students and creatives a boost in speed when they boot and use data-intensive applications, per the company. The new solid-state drive has capacities up to 2 terabytes and read and write speeds of 7,100 and 6,000 megabytes per second respectively. The new offering expands the portfolio of Micron Technology to address PCs, laptops and PlayStation 5. Baird recently lowered the price target on Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock to $150 from $172 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The advisory said Micron expected its HBM share to hit parity with its overall DRAM market share in C2025, which was the crux of Baird's investment thesis on the stock given their views HBM could generate low-60%s gross margin while representing a 60% CAGR. Baird said the chipmaker remained one of their top ideas and valuation was attractive and the HBM opportunity was not fully priced in. Overall MU ranks 11th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Hours after media reports that Intel was entertaining a takeover offer from rival QUALCOMM, Wells Fargo released an update on the developments for investors, noting that such a deal had relatively low probability as such a combination would have a tough time passing regulatory scrutiny - especially in China. On the other hand, the advisory highlighted that an equity-like investment from Apollo could be a very possible outcome, which would be a positive sign of confidence. However, the extent of existing shareholder dilution would be a key consideration, Wells added. Investment advisory Bernstein has a Market Perform rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock and recently lowered the price target to $25 from $35. In an investor note, the advisory noted that the Q2 results of the firm were challenged and Q3 outlook was awful as the company saw the second half of 2024 recovery more muted than prior expectations amid weaker macro and some client inventory channel adjustments.

Title: Cognitive bias can prevent us from knowing when to quit
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/10/03/cognitive-bias-can-prevent-us-from-knowing-when-to-quit/
Time Published: 2024-10-03T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
US president Joe Biden’s reluctance to step aside from the US presidential race on the basis of his belief that he was the only candidate who could defeat Donald Trump is a classic case of someone trapped by a cognitive bias. It’s a common problem. Consider Muhammad Ali’s decision to stay in the ring well best his prime and the disastrous consequences it had for his mental and physical health, or Tiger Woods, who now puts in underwhelming performances in golf tournaments after enduring career-threatening injuries. Not knowing when to quit is just one example of the traps or cognitive biases that trip people up, especially those in positions in power. It’s an interesting subject ranged over by Irish-born author and former senior executive in global investment banking Nuala Walsh in her well-crafted book Tune In: How to Make Smarter Decisions in a Noisy World. According to Walsh, the most underestimated risk facing modern society is not economic, political, technological or even climate-related. Instead, it’s human-decision risk, triggered by our tendency to tune out what really matters. [ Bridging the gap between academic learning and workplace skillsOpens in new window ] A substantial body of research attributes disasters to human error, she notes. It accounts for 94 per cent of road accidents, 88 per cent of cyberattacks and 80 per cent of aviation accidents, while medical misdiagnosis is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Human error, she adds underpins cult followings, scams, scandals, miscarriages of justice and more. Walsh packs a lot of scientific research into her book and has identified at least 75 biases. To make her core ideas more digestible, she uses the mnemonic PERIMETERS to describe 10. Power involves your elevation of idols, authorities and experts; Ego is about your commitment to your ideas above others; Risk concerns your appetite for thrills and intolerance of doubt; Identity is your craving to curate image and impress while Memory is your ability to accurately recall data. Then there’s Ethics, your ability to resist temptation and wrongdoing; Time, your tendency to live in the past, present or future; Emotion, your aptitude to regulate impulses and excess; Relationship, your predisposition to follow the crowd and finally Story, your readiness to accepted stated narratives as fact. “When you label something, it makes it easier to interpret and analyse. If people can understand their sources of misjudgment themselves, they could avoid a lot of predictable error. “Once you understand human behaviour you have an unrivalled insight into people, why they make decisions and why they get it right and why they get it wrong. You are also able to explain yesterday’s worst mistakes in order to prevent tomorrow’s,” she tells The Irish Times. While all of us are subject to bias, the decisions made by those in positions of power have much more far-reaching consequences. “Who pays the price of your success or failure, you or other people? The more power you have, the more other people pay the price for your misjudgment.” Walsh completed a masters in business at UCD, following a degree in Trinity and, after an assignment with the World Bank, embarked on a 30-year career in financial services. Recognised among the 100 Most Influential Women in Finance, her 30-year global investments career spanned BlackRock, Merrill Lynch and Standard Life Aberdeen, where she served as chief marketing officer. She stepped off the corporate ladder a few years ago for a portfolio career as a behavioural scientist, lecturer, business consultant, non-executive board member and speaker, undertaking a fresh masters along the way. Among her interesting roles, she serves on the board of the British and Irish Lions and is on the inclusion advisory board of the English Football Association. [ Skill, experience and expectations - navigating workplace realitiesOpens in new window ] Her corporate career gave her some strong personal insights that have informed her work. The rules of the game change when you reach the C-suite, was a valuable piece of advice a chief executive officer gave her along the way, something that was borne out through her own experience. “You see the machinations, the Machiavellism and the narcissism. People have more to lose and nobody wants to give it up. They will go to extreme levels to hang on to power. And don’t expect fairness when you are reaching for a title or a promotion. We are hopeful creatures and no employee wants to think they are a number, and that the company doesn’t have their best interest at heart, but there’s a lot of wishful thinking in that.” She has seen many of the biases she describes in the book played when it comes to mergers and acquisitions in the corporate world. These include deal fever, belief bias, confirmation bias and groupthink, as well as chief executives under pressure to get a result and inadequate due diligence. “People tune out common sense in mergers. They tune in to ego, familiarity, convenience and tune out the voice of dissenters. Anyone who is different is explained away. Who’s going to go against that over-excited CEO? He’s just sold the deal to the board. Failure is often attributable to the human factor rather than the earnings factor. Companies don’t plan for human risk, they plan for financial risk. They don’t judge human compatibility to be as important as market or product complementarity. Under pressure, people often make wrong judgment calls.” [ Getting a handle on workplace cultureOpens in new window ] While much has been written about the macho culture that may have driven poor decisions, especially in the 2008 financial crisis, the need to exert power is not gender-specific, she says. “We are all subject to misjudgment and there are as many women as men who are power-hungry and desperate to get to the top for many reasons.” Decoding bias, Walsh says, isn’t a question of intelligence and personality but it does require becoming intentional. In our hyper-fast, distraction-filled world, we need to slow down, organise our attention, consider alternative arguments and take time out to reflect on important decisions. Important questions that should be asked are: what biases might hinder interpretation?; what did I hear that sounded odd or wrong?; what aspects should I probe further; and what did I not hear that I should have?

Title: Najib Just A Crook – Lawyer Admits His Client Stole Money But Tried To Hoodwink The Judge That Najib’s Robin Hood

Time Published: 2024-10-03T04:05:00Z
Full Content:
How do you hoodwink a judge that you were not corrupt even though you had stolen money, never mind whether the amount was RM2.27 billion or just 1% of it, which translates to RM22,000,000? Former Prime Minister Najib Razak’s hotshot attorney might have found the answer – convince the court that his client was actually the Robin Hood, who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. But there is one huge problem. He isn’t the legendary heroic outlaw called Robin Hood, but the despicable corrupt prime minister called Najib Razak. Neither is Najib a highly skilled archer and swordsman, even though he is indeed a highly skilled crook and liar. And he stole from the poor taxpayers and gave to his gang of rich politicians so that the ill-gotten money could be used to buy votes. Hilariously, during Najib’s trial over the misappropriation of RM2.27 billion of 1Malaysia Development Berhad’s (1MDB) funds, lead defence lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah argued that because 99% of the stolen money was not for Najib’s personal use, his client cannot be considered a corrupt man. He claimed the money was spent for the benefit of the public. Even if Najib had spent 99% of the RM2.27 billion for corporate social responsibility, social welfare and political purposes as claimed, which he didn’t and could not fully prove he did, the personal spending of 1% of RM2.27 billion (or RM22 million as admitted by Shafee) is still a mega corruption by any standard. In comparison, a couple was sentenced to 28 days in prison and fined RM3,000 for stealing 19 packets of Milo. Going by Najib’s hotshot lawyer’s logic, if his client can walk free for spending like Robin Hood, the married couple (Mohamad Nor Azam Bakar and Noor Azura Rosslan) too should not go to jail for spending like a prophet – stealing to obtain money to cover dialysis treatment costs for Nor Azam’s mother, as well as for their 5 children, two of whom are disabled. If the poor married couple had to spend 28 days in prison for stealing eight packets of 2kg Milo worth RM358.96 from a supermarket, then Najib must be fairly sentenced to a jail term equivalent to 61,288 times heavier. That would be 1,716,064 days (or 4,700 years) in prison. Exactly why Najib can be allowed to steal RM22 million, but the Malay couple must be jailed for stealing Milo worth RM358.96? “If I were a robber, I would have used the money for personal purposes,” – Shafee told the criminal court during the RM2.27 billion 1MDB scandal, where his client is facing 25 counts of abuse of power and money laundering charges. Again, using his silly logic, does that mean a bank account can be used for drug trafficking as long as 1% of the dirty money used for personal purposes? Just because Najib did not use up 100% of the money, which his genius attorney already admitted was stolen from 1MDB, it does not mean the spending behaviour is against the pathology of corruption. Likewise, just because Najib could not perform “spoon” on Rosmah Mansor, and could only do the traditional missionary position, it does not mean the couple did not engage in sex. Shafee also argued that Najib’s return of US$620 million of the US$681 million deposited into his bank accounts showed that he did not have any bad faith. Like a broken record, Najib’s highly paid lawyers have argued that the ex-premier believed the money he had received in his bank accounts were donations from Saudi Arabia’s royalty. Shafee even had the cheek to show four fabricated letters from a dubious Saudi prince. Najib Razak, the disgraced former Malaysian prime minister sent to 12 years in prison for corruption, is a known serial liar. There are tonnes of lies he had spewed over the years. When he was still in power, he lied that he did not know his partner-in-crime Jho Low, not to mention repetitively said he did not steal any money – even after US$681 million (RM2.6 billion) was found in his bank accounts. When he was first linked to the 1MDB scandal, he kept denying that he knew Jho Low or had siphoned money from the US$6.5 billion in bonds that Goldman Sachs helped to raise between 2009 and 2014. When that failed, he diverted the attention to Saudi, knowing very well the gullible Malay Muslims will believe anything he said whenever the “Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques” card is flashed. There were basically three phases of “lies” that Najib had mastered over the years in his political career. First – “deny” all the allegations. Second, when you cannot deny anymore, “divert” the attention elsewhere. Third, “blame” everyone except himself and his families. Repeat the process again until people get confused and sick and tired of his lies. He has many favourite lies in his pockets. One of them was that the money which he had stolen was donations from Arab royal family. Another favourite lie was that he had returned US$620 million to the senders. But all those lies have been debunked, one after another, as the trials progress, including the trial involving RM42 million stolen from SRC International Sdn Bhd(a subsidiary of 1MDB), which he had lost and sent to prison. The real explosive 1MDB scandal saw its first trial involving ex-Goldman banker Roger Ng Chong Hwa in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York, in 2022. The trial of Mr Ng, a Malaysian, had opened a can of worms which was absolutely damaging to the former Malaysian premier at a critical time when he embarks on a journey to make a comeback as prime minister again. For example, the despicable man can no longer claim that the US$681 million was donations from Saudi royal family. In the trial against Ng, the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) testified in the court that not only Jho Low had stolen US$1.42 billion (RM6 billion), Najib Razak similarly stole US$756 million (RM3.2 billion) while his stepson, Riza Aziz, pocketed US$238 million (RM1 billion). Not only the testimony from FBI forensic accountant Eric Van Dorn was the first time the U.S. authorities have detailed how those involved in the 1MDB deals were paid and how much they received, it has confirmed for the third time – after previous confirmation from the U.S. DOJ and U.S. Securities Commission – that there was no Saudi donations whatsoever, as claimed by Najib. In 2022, for the first time since Najib hoodwinked 4-million gullible Malays in the 2018 General Election, the American jury finally got a look at “hard proof” of the treasure bought with the so-called US$620 million that Najib claimed to have had returned. Part of the stolen money was used to buy a 22-carat pink diamond necklace worth a staggering US$23 million (RM97 million) for Najib’s wife – Rosmah Mansor. But how could that happen when Najib had returned the donation money? Here’s where Najib should be given a Grammy Award for his lies. It was only half-truth when he said US$620 million had been returned. What he didn’t tell his stupid supporters was that he did not return the money to the Saudi royal family (because there was none to begin with), but had transferred it to Tanore Finance Corp. account in Singapore. Tanore Finance had been just a staging account set up by Jho Low and Najib Razak to be diverted again to fund their lavish lifestyle. The account had nothing to do with Saudi government or the kingdom’s royal family. In fact, a month after the US$620 million was returned to the Tanore, the money was used to purchase a 22-K pink diamond necklace for Rosmah (refer to chart). According to U.S.-DOJ investigations as early as 2017, Jho Low had arranged for jewellery designer Lorraine Schwartz (also known as “Jewish Queen of Oscar Bling”) for the pink diamond – with a heart-shaped gem – on June 2, 2013. In August the same year, Najib conveniently returned US$620 million to Tanore Finance, after receiving US$681 million from the same account in March 2013. Apparently, Rosmah wanted an 18-carat diamond, but Schwartz said she only had a 22-carat pink diamond. Schwartz subsequently travelled to Monaco on July 5, 2013 and met Jho Low aboard the Topaz, one of the largest private yachts in the world built at a cost of €400 million. Jho Low had chartered the 147-meter yacht for 7 days at a cost of €3.5 million. Aboard the Topaz, Schwartz showed the pink diamond to a group of people – Jho Low, Rosmah, and one of her friends. The group happily discussed the design of the necklace to hold the 22-carat pink diamond. On Sept 28, 2013, Schwartz met again with Jho Low and Rosmah in a hotel suite in the Mandarin Time Warner in New York in order to show them the layout of the necklace design. The 22-carat pink diamond, described as “22.17-carat Natural Fancy Intense Pink VS2 clarity (GIA#2115637296) Cut-Cornered Square Modified Brilliant Cut diamond,” was invoiced on 3 July, 2013 for a jaw-dropping US$23,000,000. The second invoice, dated July 31, 2013, was for US$4,300,000 for the accompanying necklace. Hence, the total cost was US$27,300,000. Schwartz was asked to invoice Blackrock Commodities (Global) Limited (“Blackrock”). On Sept 9, 2013, just days after Najib proudly told all and sundry that he had returned US$620 million to its original donor (Tanore Finance), US$58,849,050 was wired from the same Tanore Account to another account at Falcon Bank in Singapore held in the name of Midhurst Trading Limited (“Midhurst Trading Account”). The following day (Sept 10, 2013), Midhurst transferred US$32,760,000 to an account at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore held by Blackrock (referred to as “Blackrock Account” by DOJ). On the same day, Blackrock made two separate wire transfers to a bank account at Bank of America in New York held by Lorraine Schwartz Inc. in payment for the 22-carat pink diamond necklace. Investigations done by US-DOJ also revealed that “Blackrock Account” was used to do nothing but to pay for jewellery purchases for Jho Low and their associates, including Auntie Rosie. In fact, between April 2013 and September 2014, the account was used to purchase a total of approximately US$200 million (RM840 million) in jewellery, again, using funds traceable to the 2013 bonds and the 2014 Deutsche Bank loans. Besides the 22-carat pink diamond necklace, Rosmah had also purchased 27 other jewelleries from the same “Jewish Queen of Oscar Bling”. The 27 pieces of jewelleries, all 18K – white gold, yellow gold, rose gold, black gold – of bangles or necklaces, were priced from US$40,172 to US$240,000 a pop and were purchased during dinner between Rosmah and Schwartz at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. Known as a “PONZI” scheme, the details of how the pink diamond necklace was purchased with money stolen from 1MDB had already been exposed in 2017, when the U.S. Justice Department released its investigation papers – documents as thick as 251-page – that linked then-PM Najib Razak as the “MALAYSIAN OFFICIAL 1” and Rosmah as the “wife of MALAYSIAN OFFICIAL 1”. Najib didn’t return the US$620 million to his self-proclaimed Saudi royal family because the money was unused (as he famously claims). He returned it because he needed to siphon it elsewhere, as instructed by Jho Low whenever Rosmah wanted to buy more “bling-bling”. The money was siphoned from the three bond sales for 1MDB (code-named Project Magnolia, Maximus and Catalyze). Under “Project Maximus”, the second bonds issued by 1MDB in 2012, known as Aabar BVI phase, Najib received US$30 million. But the juiciest kickbacks came from the “Project Catalyze” (Tanore phase) in 2013 when the disgraced Malaysian leader received a further US$681 million misappropriated from 1MDB. Now, the jigsaw puzzle is almost solved. The U.S. authorities (DOJ, SEC and FBI) have been very consistent in their investigation since then-U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced that the Justice Department filed lawsuits to seize assets on July 20, 2016. But the same cannot be said about Najib and Rosmah, who have displayed inconsistency and contradiction in their half-baked fairy tales. From insisting that the RM2.7 billion in his bank accounts was a donation from the Saudi royal family, to saying he was “assuming” the money was donations, and to blaming Jho Low for scamming him, Najib is as guilty as hell. Rosmah even cried that it was a UAE price (Sheikh Mansour Zayed) who had wanted to give a pink diamond necklace to her. Do they dare to sue the Government of the United States? Every government on the planet Earth knows that Najib is guilty. Roger Ng had already been convicted and given 10 years in prison. In August 2024, the Swiss Federal Criminal Court convicted Patrick Mahony and Swiss-Saudi Tarek Obaid for embezzling more than US$1.8 billion. For Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah to free Najib will be a huge embarrassment to not only the Anwar government, but also the Malaysian Judiciary.

Title: Tokenized funds get preliminary approval to be used as collateral in the US

Funds such as BUIDL and FOBXX could be approved as collateral in 2024 in the US traditional finance market. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. A subcommittee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) Global Markets Advisory Committee voted to approve guidelines for using tokenized shares of money-market funds as collateral for traditional financial operations. As reported by Bloomberg on Oct. 2 citing an anonymous source, the recommendations aim to integrate blockchain technology in managing non-cash collateral consistent with margin requirements set by US regulators and derivatives clearing organizations. If approved by the full committee later this year, the recommendations could significantly increase the adoption of tokenized collateral on financial markets. Moreover, it would improve the capital efficiency of companies looking to use tokenized collateral. This movement benefits BlackRock’s tokenized fund BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX. BUIDL currently leads the tokenized US treasuries market, with over $518 million in market size, as per rwa.xyz data. Meanwhile, FOBXX holds $435 million in market share. Notably, BUIDL and FOBXX are the two largest tokenized money-market funds, holding nearly half of the $2.3 billion tokenized US treasuries sector. Additionally, besides BlackRock, the subcommittee includes members such as Citadel, Bank of New York Mellon, and Bloomberg LP. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications are already looking for the benefits created by merging traditional finance products and blockchain features. Leading money market Aave proposed a new GHO Stability Module (GSM) on Aug. 26, which would use BUIDL shares to keep its stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. The proposal consisted of using USD Coin (USDC) provided by users as collateral to get GHO to buy BUIDL shares and lock them in a smart contract. The benefits, according to the proposal content, are two-fold: GHO’s backing gets diversified with real-world assets, while BUIDL yields create value accrual for stablecoin holders. Moreover, stablecoin issuer Ethena Labs announced a new stablecoin completely backed by BUIDL, the UStb. Using a real-world money-market fund deployed on-chain, Ethena wants to provide a more stable alternative to its funding rate-backed stablecoin USDe.

Title: Microsoft to Invest $4.8 Billion in Italy for AI Infrastructure

Microsoft announced Wednesday (Oct. 2) plans for a €4.3 billion ($4.8 billion) investment in Italy, its biggest investment in the country so far. The initiative is set to roll out over the next two years, allowing the Big Tech company to expand its cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) data center infrastructure while providing digital skills training to more than 1 million Italians by the end of next year, Microsoft said in a news release. “Microsoft’s data center expansion in Northern Italy coupled with its commitment to provide extensive AI skills training supports the rising demand for AI compute and cloud services across Italy as organizations look to boost productivity and uncover new breakthroughs with AI,” the company said. “This landmark investment underscores our long-standing commitment to Italy’s digital transformation,” said Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft. “By expanding access to our AI technology and expertise, we are equipping the Italian government, businesses, and the broader workforce with the tools to build an AI-driven economy that creates jobs and drives prosperity.” The multibillion-dollar infusion will make Italy North one of Microsoft’s largest data center regions on the continent and will play a critical part in meeting European data boundary requirements, the release said. The new data center will also serve as a data hub for the Mediterranean and North Africa. Microsoft also said it plans to roll out new training programs for more than 1 million people in Italy by 2025, focused on AI fluency, technical AI skills, AI business transformation and the promotion of safe and responsible AI development. This comes shortly after news that a new coalition of tech and finance giants are working together to build a network of data centers that can meet growing global demand for AI. As PYMNTS reported on Sept. 18, the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership is putting $100 billion into building new infrastructure, with the aim of reducing strain on existing data centers and power sources. The new coalition is being spearheaded by Microsoft, BlackRock and other companies. “We are committed to ensuring AI helps advance innovation and drives growth across every sector of the economy,” Satya Nadella, the chairman and CEO of Microsoft, said in a news release at the time. “The Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership will help us deliver on this vision, as we bring together financial and industry leaders to build the infrastructure of the future and power it in a sustainable way.” The initiative plans to raise up to $30 billion in private equity financing and invest up to $100 billion. While the investments will be primarily focused within the U.S., the partnership said it may also pursue opportunities in other countries. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

SEC slaps GQG: The US Securities and Exchange Commission levied a $500,000 fine against GQG Partners and Rajiv Jain for violations of whistleblower protection laws and issued a cease-and-desist order against the illegal practices. At base, GQG required (some?) new hires and one former employee to sign agreements which would make it difficult for them to disclose wrongdoing on GQG’s part. “Whether through agreements or otherwise, firms cannot impose barriers to persons providing evidence about possible securities law violations to the SEC, as GQG did,” said Corey Schuster, Co-Chief of the Division of Enforcement’s Asset Management Unit. As of 27 September 2024, GQG’s website did not reflect any discussion of the action. Reports in other media note that GQG “acknowledged the SEC’s jurisdiction in the case …without admitting or denying the findings.” The settlement stops the matter from going to more formal proceedings, the outcome of which might have been more visible and more embarrassing. For a $150 billion firm, the fine is trivial except for the public relations bruise it represents. SEC pats Oaktree: Oaktree Capital, similarly, was found to have violated securities law by failing to report that they owned more than 5% of the stock of several portfolio companies. There is a purely mechanical rule (13d, if you care) that says if you own more than 5% of the shares outstanding of any company, you need to report that fact because your stake is large enough to cause conflicts. Oaktree did not. Because of strong remedial action and cooperation of the Commission’s staff, the sanctions on Oaktree came to a $375,000 fine and a promise never to do it again. abrdn Focused U.S. Small Cap Equity and abrdn Emerging Markets Dividend Funds are being converted into ETFs. The investment adviser for the Funds believes shareholders in the funds could benefit from lower overall net expenses, additional trading flexibility, increased portfolio holdings transparency, and enhanced tax efficiency. Each new ETF will be managed in a substantially similar manner as the corresponding mutual fund, with identical investment objectives, investment strategies, and fundamental investment policies. If approved by the Board, it is anticipated that the conversions will occur in the first quarter of 2025. First Eagle Global Equity ETF and First Eagle Overseas Equity ETF are in registration. Both ETFs will be actively managed by Matthew McLennan and Kimball Brooker, Jr., who will be the co-heads of both ETFs and assisted by members of the First Eagle Global Value Team. Vanguard today announced that it will reduce the minimum asset requirement from $3,000 to $1001 for its robo-advisor service, Digital Advisor, significantly increasing accessibility for investors interested in utilizing a digital advice service to manage short- and long-term financial goals. Vanguard Digital Advisor launched in 2020 and provides an all-digital financial planning and investment advisory service that delivers highly personalized, convenient, low-cost advice. The digital advice platform helps clients identify their retirement and non-retirement goals, and then crafts and manages customized, diversified, and tax-efficient investment portfolios to achieve them. Enrollments in Vanguard Digital Advisor require at least $100 in each Vanguard Brokerage Account. For each taxable account or traditional, Roth, rollover, or inherited IRA you wish to enroll, the entire balance must be in certain investment types (based on eligibility screening by Digital Advisor at the time of enrollment) and/or the brokerage account’s settlement fund. Green flight in the oddest corners of the market: the Wahed Dow Jones Islamic World ETF (UMMA) “will no longer consider applying environmental, social, and governance criteria when selecting the Fund’s investments.” Similarly, effective December 10, 2024, the American Century Sustainable Equity Fund and its corresponding ETF will both be renamed Large Cap Equity and will abandon concerns for … you know, the end of the world. Wasatch International Value Fund is in registration. The Fund invests primarily in the equity securities of foreign companies of any size though they expect a significant portion of the Fund’s assets to be invested in companies with market capitalizations of over $5 billion at the time of purchase. David Powers will be the portfolio manager. Expenses have not been stated. Effective October 7, 2024, FullerThaler Behavioral Small-Mid Core Equity Fund will begin sales of C Shares (TICKER: FTWCX) and R6 Shares (TICKER: FTSFX). I’ve never understood why on earth anyone would buy “C” shares (which typically carry an astronomical expense ratio) but “R6” means the fund will be available to some retirement investors, so that’s nice. On September 25, 2024, the Board of Trustees approved a change to the dividend payment frequency of the Osterweis Strategic Income Fund from a quarterly basis to a monthly basis. Generally, it focuses on high-grade, short-term high-yield securities. Its downside capture over the past decade is 10% while its upside capture is 70%, for an astonishing capture ratio of 700. It’s a good, conservative fund with experienced management. Shareholders of Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF and the Unusual Whales Subversive Republican Trading ETF have been invited to a proxy vote which would allow each fund to lower its expense ratio. That seems nice. The adviser is very clear about the function of the funds: it is to highlight the trading behavior of members of Congress in order to catalyze reform, rather than maximizing shareholder returns. That said, since inception trades by Democratic members of Congress have vastly outperformed those by Republican members. And, in case you’re wondering, Republican members of Congress aren’t buying Trump. Or, at the very least, they’re not willing to buy Trump Media stock. The Republican fund once owned a big 36 shares of DJT but seems to have dumped them in spring, 2024. BlackRock High Yield Municipal Fund will be reorganized into the iShares High Yield Muni Active ETF. The reorganization is anticipated to close as of the close of trading on February 7, 2025. The Essential 40 Stock Fund will be converted into an exchange-traded fund, the Essential 40 Stock ETF on October 17, 2024. The portfolio is composed of “forty stocks believed to represent the companies that are believed to be essential to the American way of life.” The fund has landed at or below the 50th percentile for six of its past seven years. Effective November 26, 2024, the passive ETF known as MUSQ Global Music Industry ETF will become the passive ETF known as MUSQ Global Music Industry Index ETF. The fund has only $22 million in assets and has lost 4.5% since inception, so we hope that the impending tweaks to the underlying index does some good. And if that doesn’t work, perhaps they might adopt the strategy used by the (deceased) Artist Formerly Known as Prince. TCW MetWest Corporate Bond Fund is being reorganized into the TCW Corporate Bond ETF, Class M shares will be reorganized into Class I shares prior to the reorganization on or about November 4. The AMG TimesSquare Global Small Cap and AMG TimesSquare Emerging Markets Small Cap Funds will be liquidated on or about December 11, 2024. AXS Alternative Value Fund will be liquidated on or about September 27. BCM Focus Small/Micro-Cap Focus Fund will be liquidated on or about October 11, 2024. Hmmm … “micro-cap” and “focus” go together like “bran flakes” and “ketchup,” for what that’s worth. The portfolio holds 20 microcap growth stocks, of which eight have declined by 25-80% in the past years. The result is illustrated by Morningstar’s performance graph where the blue line is below 99% of its peers for the past … well, most periods. Innovator Hedged TSLA Strategy ETF will be liquidated effective as of the close of business on October 4, 2024. John Hancock Government Income Fund is being reorganized into the John Hancock Investment Grade Bond Fund. If shareholders approve the reorganization during the January 2025 meeting, then the reorganization will occur on or about February 14, 2025. Per CityWire (9/30/2024), Morgan Stanley Investment Management is closing down its listed real estate and infrastructure business, liquidating all the funds it offers that invest in this asset class. The move will impact funds offered in the US, as well as in Asia and Europe.” That affects over $700 million in assets. The case for exiting real estate is rather clearer to us than the case for existing infrastructure. Natixis Loomis Sayles Short Duration Income ETF will be liquidated on or about September 30. Nuveen Social Choice Low Carbon Equity Fund will be reorganized into the Nuveen Large Cap Responsible Equity Fund. The reorganization is not subject to approval by the shareholders of the Target fund or the Acquiring fund. It is anticipated that the reorganization will be consummated in late 2024. Rondure New World Fund will be liquidated on or about October 18. The trigger for the liquidation of the fund, and subsequent closure of the firm, understandably, was not spelled out in the SEC filing. We discuss it, and wish Ms Geritz godspeed, in this month’s Publisher’s Letter. SmartETFs Advertising & Marketing Technology ETF will be canceled on or about October 30. TCW Enhanced Commodity Strategy Fund, TCW MetWest AlphaTrak 500 Fund (M class), and TCW Short Term Bond Fund (I class) will all be liquidated on or about October 31, TCW MetWest Corporate Bond Fund will merge with and into TCW Corporate Bond ETF on or about October 11, 2024. As of Halloween, the strategy for the USCF Aluminum Strategy Fund will be “to cease operations, liquidate its assets, and distribute proceeds to shareholders.” VanEck Dynamic High Income ETF will be liquidated, wound down, and terminated on or about Tuesday, October 15, 2024. The Western Asset Total Return ETF will be merged with Western Asset Bond ETF sometime in the first quarter of 2025. While Western’s CIO has “gone on leave” because of an SEC investigation about 17,000 suspicious trades, that scandal seems to have no bearing here. This is just a bad fund going away.

Title: Playing Politics In The Boardroom Harms Financial Returns

ESG icon concept For advocates of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing, a September 25th Bloomberg article appears to demonstrate that social investing is working. The story notes that Institutional investors holding a combined $9.5 trillion of assets say they’ve slashed portfolio emissions at a rate that aligns them with the goal of limiting global warming to the critical threshold of 1.5C. Such proclamations, even if they are accurate, are incomplete without knowing the impact that these investments had on the funds’ returns. Unless investors have specifically allocated their money toward funds dedicated toward slashing emissions, ignoring crucial financial performance metrics violates the fiduciary responsibility of institutional investors. After all, it is the beneficiaries of the funds that ultimately suffer the consequences. In the case of public pension funds like CalPERS, those fiduciary responsibilities also extend to taxpayers since they will be responsible, either in part or in whole, for covering any return deficiencies. Potential return deficiencies arise because ESG, by definition, blinds investors to potential investment opportunities. Consequently, investments based on ESG criteria introduce new risks, create obstacles to improved investment diversification, and adversely impact returns over the long-term. These concerns are now influencing behavior. Blackrock, State Street, and JP Morgan have either ended or reduced their participation in a climate coalition because, as State Street noted, the coalition’s “requirements for signatories are not consistent with our independent approach to proxy voting and portfolio company engagement.” The theory promulgating ESG investments does not acknowledge these opportunity costs, however. According to the ESG investment thesis, the responsibility of businesses goes beyond maximizing companies’ profits and includes managing companies for the benefit of all stakeholders. Such a management approach is allegedly necessary because business’ operations also impact employees, suppliers, and the broader community where they operate. ESG advocates will further argue that investors and customers – particularly Millennials –expect companies to operate in a manner that complies with a stakeholder perspective. Therefore, pursuing ESG initiatives will enhance companies’ profits. As a result, fund managers can promote better financial returns and improve social outcomes by prioritizing ESG considerations – the quintessential win-win. A recent analysis I performed raises concerns regarding ESG’s investment performance. The study examined the investment performance of CalPERS’ – a strong advocate of ESG investing –relative to other public pension funds, broad market indices, and alternative passive investment strategies. The results demonstrate that CalPERS’ returns have been sub-par. CalPERS’ 10-year average annual returns through June 30, 2023 was 7.1 percent (CalPERS’ 10-year average annual return through June 30, 2024 was an even lower 6.2 percent). A diversified portfolio that allocated 80 percent of investments toward stocks, 10 percent in U.S. Treasury Bonds, and 10 percent in Baa rated corporate bonds (a standard risk diversification portfolio) would have returned 9.8 percent annually over the same period. Even a portfolio that invested 60 percent of its assets in the S&P 500, 20 percent in U.S. Treasury Bonds, and 20 percent in Baa rated corporate bonds (a lower risk/lower return investment portfolio) would have earned 7.9 percent, still beating CalPERS’ returns. In light of CalPERS’ uncompetitive returns, the ESG claim that investment performance can be enhanced by prioritizing considerations beyond profitability looks dubious. These sub-par returns are unsurprising because ESG programs are not without costs. For instance, consistent with CalPERS’ adherence to ESG, the public pension fund promotes underweighting investments in fossil fuel holdings and supports shareholder resolutions that seek to promote political goals regardless of their impact on financial performance. As I noted in my analysis, eschewing fossil fuel stocks such as ExxonMobil sometimes makes sense, but at other times risks losing large potential returns. Excluding dividends (an important consideration for an investor in ExxonMobil), an investment in ExxonMobil returned around 62% over a five-year investment horizon through the summer of 2024. These returns underperformed investments in the QQQ Invesco QQQ Trust (166%) and S&P 500 (91%) during the same period. However, over a three-year horizon through the summer of 2024, ExxonMobil was up around 104%, which outperformed these investment alternatives – up 31% and 23%, respectively. Therefore, precluding the option to overweight ExxonMobil in a portfolio proved costly to potential returns over a three-year investment horizon. Even greater returns were possible for investors who timed the rise in ExxonMobil’s stock better. Correctly timing the market is undoubtedly difficult, and active investing is hard. Knowing a priori which stocks will outperform the market is also much more difficult than reviewing the trends that occurred in the past. Yet, CalPERS’ purpose is to actively manage the resources it invests on behalf of its beneficiaries and discover such opportunities. Successfully achieving this goal requires openness to alternative investment theses. Pension funds and institutional investors perform an essential function – they help workers and families meet their financial goals and secure their retirement. Fulfilling this role is hard enough without distractions from ancillary political and social issues. Heeding such distractions undermines investment managers essential social responsibility to the detriment of retirees and broader prosperity.

Title: BlackRock Digital Assets Head Says Firm’s Ethereum ETF ‘Underwhelming’ Compared to Bitcoin Product: Report

The head of digital assets at BlackRock, Robert Mitchnick, is reportedly saying that the spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched earlier this year by the global investment giant has attracted a lower volume of inflows relative to a similar Bitcoin (BTC) product. The business publication Fortune cites Mitchnick saying that inflows into BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) ETF are “underwhelming” relative to inflows into the monolith asset manager’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF. According to the crypto assets tracking platform SosoValue, the cumulative net inflows into IBIT is $21.5 billion as of September 30th. As of the same period, the cumulative net inflows into ETHA is $1.15 billion. Mitchnick, however, reportedly says that compared to the ETFs of traditional assets, the spot Ethereum ETF has proved to be relatively successful. “It’s very rare that you see an ETF get to a billion Assets Under Management (AUM) in seven weeks, as ETHA did. In most cases, it takes multiple years to never for a new ETF to get to a billion.” The report cites BlackRock’s head of digital assets further saying, “With ETH, I think the investment story and narrative is a bit less easy for a lot of investors to digest, so that’s a big part of why we’re so committed to the education journey that we’re on with a lot of our clients. And so, you don’t expect them to ever be quite as large in terms of flows and AUM as their Bitcoin counterparts are. But it’s still a pretty good start.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Franklin Templeton launches its tokenized money fund on Aptos

Franklin Templeton has expanded its OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) to the layer-1 blockchain Aptos. The $1.6 trillion asset manager, which also offers the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) and Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET), announced the launch of FOBXX on Aptos on Wednesday, October 2, 2024. It’s another milestone for the company after its recent expansion of the tokenized money fund to Avalanche. FOBXX launched in 2021 and is a US Treasury-backed fund that brings the benefits of tokenized real-world assets to investors. With its expansion to Aptos, the fund has expanded to a non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and adds to institutional investor access through Franklin Templeton’s platform Benji Investments. FOBXX will be represented by Franklin’s BENJI token on the Aptos network, helping to merge traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralised finance (DeFi). Franklin brought its money market fund to Polygon and Stellar blockchain networks in April 2024. The firm then expanded it to Arbitrum in August 2024. According to data from RWA.xyz, FOBXX is currently the second largest tokenized fund with over $435 million in assets. The top US Treasury-backed asset is the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which launched on Ethereum and currently has over $518 million in assets under management. Investors have increasingly looked to tap into opportunities in the RWA market. This has seen treasury-related products such as the Ondo U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY), Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin (USYC) and OpenEden TBILL Vault (TBILL) attract a growing number of holders. USDY, USYC and TBILL have market caps of $420 million, $280 million and $116 million respectively. Ondo launched its USDY fund on Sui in March. Meanwhile, the total value of tokenized US treasuries, cash-equivalents and bonds, per RWA.xyz, has grown to over $2.27 billion. That’s up from around $769 million on January 1, 2024, when FOBXX incidentally accounted for over $325 million of the total market value. BlackRock’s BUIDL launched in March 2024 and hit $500 million market cap in July.

Microsoft is investing €4.3 billion (around $4.75 billion) in Italy to enhance AI infrastructure and build more data centers. The company will establish the ItalyNorth cloud region, which is set to become one of Microsoft's largest data centers in Europe. The facility will not only serve Italy and Europe but also act as a vital data hub for the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The move is part of Microsoft's broader strategy to enhance its global cloud infrastructure, as demand for AI and cloud services continues to soar across various industries. On Wednesday, Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith met with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome to discuss this investment. Smith's visit coincided with Meloni's earlier meeting on Monday with Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc. BlackRock and Microsoft also have a $30 billion fund aimed at investing in AI-focused data centers and supply chains. However, this fund is to target the U.S. market first before expanding to partner countries like Italy. AI applications often require extensive computational resources to process massive datasets and perform complex calculations. This requires specialized data centers equipped with hardware capable of handling such workloads. Microsoft is also expanding its presence in regions like Iowa, Virginia, and Washington by building new data centers. Other companies such as Google and AWS are also expanding their data centers globally to be ready for the same. Microsoft's expansion of its data centers is also built on its commitment to using 100% carbon-free energy by 2025. The Redmond company recently made headlines by acquiring the Three Mile Island nuclear facility in Pennsylvania to meet its energy demands for data centers in the U.S. by partnering up with Constellation. The deal will allow Microsoft to source up to 35% of its energy from nuclear power. Nvidia has also shown interest in nuclear power as part of its broader energy requirements. CEO Jensen Huang recently said that nuclear energy is a wonderful option for powering its data centers, along with other sources of energy. via Reuters | Photo via DepositPhotos.com

Title: Why Bitcoin Is Becoming A Part Of Traditional Finance

The launch of U.S. Bitcoin Bitcoin exchange-traded funds was crypto’s most celebrated event in 2024. But for some, the term “Bitcoin ETF” is an oxymoron. Take it from Gary Gensler – the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman who begrudgingly approved such products for public trading. “Satoshi Nakamoto said this was gonna be a decentralized system… but now you can buy it through this thing called an exchange-traded product as well, which is centralized,” he argued in January. He has a point. Over 1,000,000 BTC and counting are now controlled by Bitcoin ETF providers across the world. Some of the largest providers include giants of traditional finance like BlackRock and Fidelity – exactly the sort of centralized firms that crypto wants to disintermediate. Does this mean that Bitcoin has lost its way? Has the project been captured by the big banks? Far from it. In fact, BlackRock’s embrace of Bitcoin is how the company adapts to and survives crypto’s continuous march toward global adoption. Bitcoin provides investors with an invaluable service that traditional banking will never replicate. As BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a CNBC interview, Bitcoin is like “digital gold” that you buy “when you believe that countries are debasing their currencies by excess deficits,” or to “invest in something that is outside your country’s control.” The closest BlackRock could come to matching that service was to launch a Bitcoin ETF. As of now, Bitcoin ETFs fill a niche for regular people and institutions seeking price exposure to Bitcoin who face hurdles to acquiring the real thing. That niche market alone made the iShares Bitcoin Trust the most successful ETF launch of all time. Yet these ‘hurdles’ to buying real BTC in your own crypto wallet – be they technical or regulatory – are all falling away fast. The user experience of sending, receiving, and holding Bitcoin in a personal wallet is dramatically improving. Meanwhile, Congress is passing legislation to provide regulatory clarity for firms trying to launch crypto products, and build decentralized financial services. In due time, managing financial affairs on the blockchain will be more efficient, secure, and useful than doing it through the bank – and all of traditional finance is scrambling to prepare. In March, BlackRock launched its first “tokenized fund” giving investors access to US dollar yields through a token issued on the Ethereum Ethereum blockchain. Earlier this month, Franklin Templeton expanded its blockchain-based money market fund, FOBXX, to Arbitrum Arbitrum – a network that processes Ethereum transactions for pennies at sub-second speeds. Even the big banks and payment providers are diving into crypto. PayPal has already launched its own stablecoin, PYUSD PayPal USD , which is a custom crypto token whose value is backed by U.S. dollars. Mastercard is experimenting with JP Morgan, Citibank, and other TradFi giants on tokenized asset settlement to make cross-border transfers run more smoothly. Finally, let’s not forget the chorus of central banks worldwide who are either researching, developing, or piloting their own central bank digital currencies. Like stablecoins, CBDCs are blockchain-based government currencies that provide many of the same efficiencies that blockchains do. Contrary to Bitcoin, however, they are utterly controlled and monitored by the central bank. Between central banks and the private sector, TradFi’s rapid adoption of crypto-technology is its effort to keep its heads above Bitcoin’s rising tide. To the degree that they succeed, it will be because they worked with Bitcoin or stayed out of its crosshairs – not the other way around. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: 3 Things to Know as Private Credit Heads Toward a $2 Trillion Industry

The private credit market is booming — and has the potential to reshape lending, and risk, too, in financial services. Generally and conceptually speaking, the private lending market, estimated by the International Monetary Fund to top $2 trillion at present, offers a capital “lifeline” of sorts to a variety of borrowers, especially smaller firms that may have been, or still are, underserved as they seek capital from traditional channels. Private lending may also be extended to firms that are backed by private equity vehicles. The American Investment Council, as noted here, has estimated that as recently as 2022, the median size of a firm receiving private credit — $500 billion of which went to U.S. firms — has been an enterprise with 150 employees. Several headlines through the past few days have shone a spotlight on bank/asset manager tie-ups — with marquee names in both segments of finance — that are putting tens of billions of dollars to work in private credit. As reported by Bloomberg, JPMorgan Chase has struck a partnership with Cliffwater, FS Investments and Shenkman Capital Management Inc. As part of those joint efforts, JPMorgan will reportedly originate loans and invest in them “alongside the direct lenders,” per the report. Separately, and also this month, Citigroup has linked up with Apollo Global Management to form what the firms termed a “landmark $25 billion private credit, direct lending program initially in North America, with the potential to expand to additional geographies.” And last week, BlackRock and Santander announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) by which funds and accounts managed by BlackRock will invest as much as $1 billion per year in “select project finance, energy finance, and infrastructure debt investment opportunities with Santander through structured transaction formats.” The conventional wisdom may be that private credit exists to fill the gaps that might be created when banks tighten their underwriting or deny loans outright to smaller firms deemed to be higher risk. And indeed, as estimated by the Bank for International Settlements, private credit grew by leaps and bounds in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, from $300 million back then to the current, aforementioned $2 trillion tally. The fact that the banks are getting into the act more fully reflects at least some of the pressures from competitors — FinTechs and other nonbank entities. In the ongoing jousting over regulatory changes, and capital requirements, the potential to grow a client base while lending, indirectly, holds appeal. But the burgeoning private credit market may also reshape risk in the industry — and regulators are watching. In a speech this past May, titled a “current assessment of financial stability,” Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook stated that “history teaches us that rapidly growing lending often involves weak underwriting or excessive risk appetite … as a result, I will be monitoring the contribution of private credit to the overall leverage of the business sector and the evolving interconnectedness between private credit and the rest of the financial system.” And in a year-end 2023 report by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, there’s the observation that: “unexpected rate of default [by private-credit borrowers] may have a cascading effect across broader financial markets, the impact of which may be more or less pronounced depending on the nexus private credit funds share with other market participants, such as fund investors, other investment funds managed by shared investment advisers, and various counterparties, as well as market participants that may be invested in other levels of a particular company’s capital structure … Private credit is a relatively opaque segment of the broader financial market that warrants continued monitoring.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo/File Photo MILAN : Microsoft plans to invest 4.3 billion euros ($4.8 billion) over the next two years to strengthen its artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud infrastructure in northern Italy, it said on Wednesday. Microsoft said in a statement the investment would be the U.S. company's largest in Italy to date. It will make the cloud region ItalyNorth one of the biggest Microsoft data centres in Europe, working as a data hub also for the Mediterranean and north Africa. Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith met Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Wednesday, the PM's office said in a note, adding the government welcomed an investment that would strengthen Italy's digital role in the Mediterranean. On Monday, Meloni met U.S. fund BlackRock Inc chief Larry Fink, who travelled to Rome to discuss possible investments in data centres and to support energy infrastructure. BlackRock and Microsoft announced last month a fund worth more than $30 billion to invest in AI-focused data centres, AI supply chains and energy sourcing, saying the vehicle would first look at the U.S. market and then at U.S. partner countries. Demand for AI and cloud services is growing fast with firms in sectors as varied as gaming and e-commerce differentiating offerings through the integration of custom AI models - programs that employ pattern recognition to make decisions.

Title: Spot XRP ETF By Bitwise: Experts Explain The Odds For Approval

Bitwise Asset Management has officially filed for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) with Delaware’s Division of Corporations on September 30. The filing encompasses the registration for establishing a Delaware statutory trust, a business-oriented trust recognized under Delaware state law. This strategic move aligns with precedents set by prominent financial entities such as BlackRock and Fidelity, which initially registered trust entities for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) before pursuing ETF listings and trading based on these cryptocurrencies. The recent filing has sparked discussions within the XRP community, especially in light of past rumors regarding a supposed spot ETF by BlackRock which turned out to be fake. However, Bitwise has officially confirmed the authenticity of their latest initiative. “We can confirm this is a registration by us,” stated Matthew Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise. He further noted, “It is a registration of a trust entity in Delaware. We can share more details and comments tomorrow.” Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, provided a detailed analysis of Bitwise’s approach and the broader implications of their move via X. Geraci emphasizes the credibility and strategic planning behind Bitwise’s actions. “Bitwise positioning to file for XRP ETF is highly noteworthy IMO… In short-term, this is likely a call option on the November election. But Bitwise is a highly credible crypto-native fund firm that doesn’t just throw stuff at the wall. That’s simply not in their DNA. This is strategic.” He further speculates on the political and regulatory landscape that could affect the approval of the ETF. “Point being that XRP ETF probably coming at some point… Bitwise just early. Politics clearly matter here in the short-term, but I think this is all inevitable over time. IMO, Bitwise longer-term roadmap is to offer this in an ETF wrapper. The next step will be full tokenization.” The political implications were highlighted by Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, and Alex Thorn, Head of Firmwide Research at Galaxy Digital. They both tie the prospects for a spot XRP ETF to the upcoming US presidential elections, suggesting a significant dependency on political outcomes. Balchunas articulates his view using a financial metaphor tied to potential election results. “You’ve heard of the Fed Put. This is like the Trump Call.. filings for XRP or Solana or any other altcoins are basically like a cheap call option on a Trump win as Genz will be gone and anything’s possible. Harris wins no way these get approved, and the ‘call’ expires worthless.” Thorn addresses the potential for an appeal in the Ripple Labs vs. SEC case and its impact on the odds for a spot ETF. “SEC has until next week (Oct. 7) to appeal Judge Torres’ July 2023 ruling (which held that secondary sales of XRP through exchanges were not securities). The likelihood of this ETF filing succeeding drops to near zero if they do appeal (I’ll be very surprised if they don’t appeal).” Notably, asset manager VanEck is currently trying a similar move with a spot Solana ETF in the US. VanEck filed for a spot SOL ETF on June 27 this year. Industry analysts have noted that the chances for approval of these ETFs hinge sharply on a Trump victory. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5991.

Title: Why is crypto down today? $500M liquidated amid geopolitical tensions

As geopolitical tensions escalate, let’s see how it affected the crypto market as a whole. The cryptocurrency market traded in the red on the 2nd of October as the total market capitalization fell by more than 5% to $2.25 trillion at press time. Bitcoin [BTC] succumbed to the bearish pressure and plunged to a seven-day low below $61,000. Most altcoins also wiped their recent gains, as Ethereum [ETH] dropped by 6.5% to trade at $2,473 at press time. Binance Coin [BNB] and Solana [SOL] were also down by 4.9% and 5.7%, respectively, while Ripple [XRP] fell below $0.60 after a 3.6% dip. Dogecoin [DOGE] recorded the most losses among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization after dropping by 9% to trade at $0.108 at press time. Similar drops were also seen across traditional financial markets, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 index falling by 2.5% according to Google Finance. Escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East after Iran fired hundreds of missiles toward Israel fueled these widespread losses. The event saw traders grow anxious about the performance of risk assets. During times of uncertainty, investors tend to flee from risk assets such as crypto and flock to safe-haven assets. For instance, as crypto prices plunged, gold saw minimal losses of less than 1%. Source: Coinglass Data from Coinglass shows that in the last 24 hours, more than $500 million was liquidated from the market, with $450 million of these being long positions. These liquidations impacted more than 155,000 traders. Bitcoin and Ethereum saw the highest liquidations of $140 million and $110 million, respectively. Per Coinglass, the largest single liquidation occurred on Binance, where one trader was liquidated for more than $12 million. Data from SoSoValue shows that on the 2nd of October, U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $242 million in outflows, the highest level since early September. Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETFs saw the biggest outflow of $144 million. All other Bitcoin ETF products saw zero to negative flows apart from BlackRock. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF continued its positive streak, with $40M in inflows. Ethereum ETFs also came in negative with $48M in outflows, the highest level in more than a week. The negative data comes as the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index plunged to 42, its lowest score in more than two weeks, as fear gripped the market.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs & Major Cryptos Hit Hard After Iran’s Missile Attack on Israel

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Investors concerned over rising tensions in the Middle East quickly pulled their capital out of $BTC ETFs and leading cryptocurrencies. When conflict arises, investors often seek more stable investments (like gold or bonds). Yesterday was the second time Iran launched hundreds of missiles at Israel (after an initial strike in April). Shortly after, 11 spot $BTC ETFs witnessed outflows amounting to a hefty $242.6M. Many digital assets have taken a turn for the worst, showing the crypto market’s sensitivity to geopolitical events. Iran fired missiles at Israel in retaliation to the deaths of leading Iranian figures (including Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoshan). On the same day (October 1), US spot $BTC ETFs witnessed their third-largest outflows in five months, backtracking an eight-day streak of inflows clocking $494M on September 27. It marks the most significant run of outflows since September 3, when nearly $288M left the exchange-traded funds. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Funds ($FBTC) was hit the hardest, losing $144.7M. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ($ARKB) followed, succumbing to outflows worth $84.3M. But despite the geopolitical turmoil (hence, unfavorable market conditions), BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ($IBIT) continues to hold its head high. It recorded $40.8M inflows yesterday and an outflow-free day for the 15th day running. $IBIT currently remains the largest BTC ETF with a $22.55B market cap, followed by $GBTC ($13.65B) and $FBTC ($10.97B). $BTC ETFs weren’t the only digital assets impacted by the escalating war conflict. Bitcoin’s price hit its lowest value in two weeks, dropping by ~7% (from a ~$64K high to a ~$60K low). Since then, its price has spiked by ~4% (to ~$61K). However, $BTC was ~8% greater than its value at the end of last month (~$66K). This reflects a mediocre start to ‘Uptober’ (a historically positive month for ‘risk assets’ like crypto (and stocks), representing a 22.9% uptick over the last nine years). And as usual, when $BTC falls, others follow. Many top cryptos have been caught in the Middle East’s upheaval over the last 24 hours, including: To show the weight geopolitical events have on the crypto market, the negative outcome due to the Israel-Iran war is in stark contrast to the Fed’s decision to cut US interest rates by 50 basis points on September 18. Two days before the Fed slashed interest rates in half, Bitcoin’s price rose 5%, and $BTC ETFs attracted $250M in investments. Additionally, $BTC jumped by ~12% after the favorable decision was made, and $SOL, $ETH, and $BNB appreciated by 9%, 5%, and 3%, respectively. As evidenced by the US interest rate cut and Iran’s missile attack, global events sway crypto investors, both positively and negatively.

Title: Crypto markets reel as Middle East conflict sparks global uncertainty

Share this article On the macro level, crypto markets have been thrown into turmoil as geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran escalate, challenging the notion of “Uptober” and raising questions about digital assets’ role in times of global crisis. As the conflict unfolds, its ripple effects are being felt across financial markets, with various cryptocurrencies and ETFs experiencing significant volatility and substantial liquidations. The immediate aftermath of Iran’s missile attack on Israel saw Bitcoin plummet to $60,200, marking a sharp 6% decline from recent highs around $64,000. This downturn wasn’t isolated to Bitcoin, as Ethereum and other major altcoins also suffered losses, with Ethereum dropping over 4% and Solana falling more than 5%. The market turmoil led to massive liquidations, with Coinglass reporting $523.37 million wiped out in just 24 hours. Long positions bore the brunt of the impact, with $451 million liquidated, compared to $71 million in short positions. This volatility resulted in the liquidation of 154,011 traders, highlighting the widespread impact of the geopolitical crisis on crypto markets. The rapid market decline has significantly altered investor sentiment. The crypto fear and greed index, a key metric for gauging market sentiment, plummeted from a “greed” level of 61 to a “fear” level of 42 in just two days. This dramatic shift underscores the market’s sensitivity to external geopolitical events and their profound influence on investor behavior. Moreover, US spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced substantial outflows, with aggregate withdrawals of $242.53 million on October 1 alone. This marked the largest outflow in nearly a month and the third-largest in five months, indicating a broader retreat from crypto assets amid heightened global uncertainty. The current crisis challenges the narrative of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a safe haven during global turmoil. While some proponents have long argued that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it an ideal hedge against geopolitical risks, its recent performance alongside traditional risk assets suggests otherwise. However, not all analysts view this downturn as a long-term setback. André Dragosch, European head of research at Bitwise, suggests that Bitcoin has historically shown resilience in recovering from geopolitical shocks. “Geopolitical news should generally be faded,” Dragosch noted, implying that the current market reaction might be overblown. Supporting this perspective, a recent BlackRock report posits that Bitcoin’s decentralized and non-sovereign characteristics could actually protect it from the economic uncertainties that often plague traditional assets during global crises. This viewpoint suggests that while short-term volatility is inevitable, Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition remains intact. The crypto market’s decline mirrors movements in traditional financial markets, with major stock indices also experiencing losses. This correlation raises questions about cryptocurrency’s ability to act as a diversifier in investment portfolios during times of global instability. Investors’ shift from cryptocurrencies to gold amid the conflict reflects a broader risk-off sentiment pervading financial markets. This movement challenges the notion of Bitcoin as “digital gold” and highlights the ongoing debate about its role in a diversified investment strategy. As geopolitical tensions escalate in the Middle East, the crypto market faces a complex landscape of challenges and opportunities. Regulatory scrutiny is likely to intensify, with authorities potentially focusing on crypto’s role in sanctions evasion and illicit transactions. This heightened oversight could coincide with shifting institutional perceptions of digital assets as a viable investment class, potentially impacting long-term adoption trends. Simultaneously, the crisis may accelerate technological innovations in blockchain, driving the development of solutions aimed at enhancing financial sovereignty and resilience against global shocks. The current turmoil serves as a critical test of the crypto market’s maturity, potentially catalyzing more sophisticated risk management strategies and market structures. While cryptocurrencies currently show high correlation with traditional assets, future crises may reveal a growing decoupling as digital assets’ fundamental value propositions gain broader recognition. How the market navigates these challenges could significantly influence its trajectory, potentially solidifying crypto’s role in the global financial ecosystem or exposing vulnerabilities that could hinder wider adoption. As the situation unfolds, market participants will be closely watching for signs of the crypto market’s resilience and adaptability in the face of geopolitical uncertainty. The coming weeks and months could be crucial in shaping perceptions of digital assets’ role in a diversified investment strategy and their ability to weather global storms.

Title: Fidelity now 22,000 BTC away from top 10 Bitcoin holders replacing US Government

Institutional Bitcoin adoption highlighted as Fidelity nears major milestone. Fidelity is on the verge of joining the top 10 Bitcoin holders, needing just 22,000 BTC to surpass the US government’s holdings, according to data from TimechainIndex. Currently holding 182,757 BTC or 0.9248% of the total supply, Fidelity stands at the 11th position. In contrast, the US government holds 204,302 BTC, accounting for 1.0338% of the supply. As of press time, Fidelity’s holdings amount to around $11.1 billion; an additional inflow of approximately $1.3 billion would take it to the top 10. On Sept. 27, it saw $227 million in inflows in a single day. However, it has mostly seen flat flows over the past month, with just 22 days of net outflows since its launch in January. This shift highlights the increasing involvement of traditional financial institutions in the crypto market. Fidelity’s potential move into the top 10 illustrates a broader trend of institutional adoption of Bitcoin. The company’s holdings are primarily through its US ETF and custody services. The top Bitcoin holders include entities like Coinbase and Binance, with unspent Coinbase rewards from 2009 leading the list at over 1 million BTC. MicroStrategy is also a significant holder, though it has been surpassed by BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, which holds 365,310 BTC.

Title: Bitwise Investments Prepares for Potential US-Listed XRP ETF, Filing in Delaware Sparks Speculation
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/10/bitwise-investments-prepares-for-potential-us-listed-xrp-etf-filing-in-delaware-sparks-speculation/

Bitwise Investments has taken its first steps toward a potential XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), with a filing on 30 September 2024 in Delaware. Listed under the State of Delaware’s Division of Corporations, the filing was confirmed by a Bitwise spokesperson to Cointelegraph. However, this move appears to be part of preliminary preparations, and it could be months before a formal application is submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), if at all. According to a report by Ana Paula Pereira for Cointelegraph, this development aligns with previous comments from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who predicted in May during an interview at the Consensus 2024 conference that an XRP ETF was only a matter of time, especially after the successful introduction of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the United States. If approved, an XRP ETF would provide institutional investors with a secure, regulated avenue to invest in the cryptocurrency, potentially increasing trading volume and adoption. The Cointelegraph report pointed out that although the Delaware filing is a significant early step, it doesn’t indicate an imminent SEC application. According to the report, the process could still be in the preparatory stages, and a formal filing could take months if it happens at all. This news also stirs memories of the fake filing in November 2023 when an application for a “BlackRock iShares XRP Trust” briefly fueled XRP price gains of 12% before being debunked. Delaware authorities are still investigating that incident. Meanwhile, Ripple continues to grapple with its legal battle against the SEC. Though the July 2023 ruling deemed XRP not a security in public exchanges, a recent September 2024 appeal has put the final decision on hold, delaying the ultimate outcome of the case. Update on 2 October 2024 at 1:30 p.m. UTC Earlier today, Bitwise issued a press release to confirm that it has indeed filed an initial registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. SEC for a spot XRP ETP. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley had this to say: “At Bitwise, we believe blockchains will usher in new, apolitical monetary assets and permissionless applications for the 21st century. It’s why for the past seven years we’ve helped investors access the opportunities in the space, and we’re excited to continue that work with our filing for a Bitwise XRP ETP.“ The press release went on to say: “XRP is the digital asset that powers the XRP Ledger (“XRPL”) public blockchain. XRPL is best known for its role in facilitating cross-border payments and remittances, as well as newer capabilities that enable institutional participation in Decentralized Finance (“DeFi”), real-world asset tokenization, and EVM interoperability. XRPL typically processes transactions in seconds with fees under $0.01. It also has more than five million active wallets and a decade-long track record of reliability.“ Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, explained on social media platform X why he found this move by Bitwise noteworthy: Point being that XRP ETF prob coming at some point…Bitwise just early.Politics clearly matter here in short-term, but I think this is all inevitable over time.IMO, Bitwise longer-term roadmap is to offer this in an ETF wrapper.Next step will be full tokenization. pic.twitter.com/xQUD1wfiAm Featured Image via Pixabay The views and opinions expressed by the author, or any people mentioned in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.

Title: Malaysia bags another cloud deal from U.S. Big Tech with $6.5 billion pledge from Oracle
URL: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/10/02/oracle-invests-malaysia-cloud-computing-big-tech-ai/

The Southeast Asian country of Malaysia is getting another multibillion-dollar investment from U.S. Big Tech, the latest in the region’s drive to capitalize on the AI boom. On Wednesday, Oracle announced it would invest at least $6.5 billion toward a public cloud region in Malaysia. A cloud region is the real-world location where cloud facilities are located. Oracle said the new facilities would enable its customers in Malaysia to leverage AI services, and help Malaysian organizations modernize their digital applications. “Malaysia offers unique growth opportunities for organizations looking to accelerate their expansion with the latest digital technologies,” said Garrett Ilg, Oracle’s executive vice president and general manager for Japan and Asia Pacific, in a statement. Malaysia’s minister of investment, trade, and industry said Oracle’s investment will support the country’s ambitious plan to create 3,000 smart factories by 2030. Oracle’s cloud investment follows a similarly sized pledge from Amazon. In late August, the U.S. company’s cloud computing division promised $6.2 billion in investment for Malaysia. Microsoft and Google have also announced multibillion-dollar investments in Malaysian cloud infrastructure. Malaysia is working to position itself as a tech hub in Southeast Asia. In addition to data centers, Malaysia is courting semiconductor investments in a bid to move up the chip supply chain. The country is working on a national cloud office and AI strategy, Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Tuesday at the groundbreaking ceremony for Google’s new $2 billion data center complex. The U.S. company claims the investment will create 26,500 jobs and generate $3.2 billion in economic activity by 2030. Other Southeast Asian economies are attracting cloud-related investments. In May, Amazon pledged to invest $9 billion into its existing cloud infrastructure in Singapore by 2028. The Southeast Asian city-state has been a regional data hub for the U.S. company since 2010. On Monday, Google said it will invest $1 billion in Thailand to build a new data center and expand the country’s cloud infrastructure. Microsoft also says it has a “significant commitment” to build new cloud and AI infrastructure in Thailand, according to CEO Satya Nadella in May. Microsoft is promising $1.7 billion in cloud- and AI-related investment in Indonesia, as well. The investment in Southeast Asia’s data centers is part of a global push to invest in computing capacity to fuel new AI services. Last month, a consortium of companies including Microsoft and BlackRock pledged to mobilize $100 billion in capital to invest in new data centers. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bitcoin Falls 3.5% Amid Rising Middle East Tensions After Israeli PM Promises Iran Will ‘Pay’ for Its ‘Big Mistake’

As tensions rise in the Middle East, commodities like gold and crude oil are seeing notable price increases, while Bitcoin has taken a downturn. This divergence has reignited debates over Bitcoin’s role as a safe-haven asset. According to a report by Martin Young for Cointelegraph, on Tuesday, gold surged by 1.4%, reaching $2,665 per ounce, close to its all-time high. Meanwhile, crude oil prices spiked by 7% to $72 per barrel. These gains came after airstrikes across Israel, with Israeli air defenses intercepting most of the 180 missiles launched. Bonds and the U.S. dollar also saw gains, further signaling investor anxiety. “Investors are seeking refuge in gold amidst the uncertainty in the Middle East,” commented Li Xing, Financial Markets Strategist at Exness. Contrary to its usual label as a “safe haven,” Bitcoin dropped more than 3% over the same 24 hours, falling from an intraday high of $64,000 to a low of $60,315 before slightly recovering to $61,800. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $61,693, down 3.5% in the past 24-hour period. Coinglass data reported that around 154,770 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations amounting to $521 million. According to Reuters, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that Iran’s missile attack on Israel was unsuccessful and promised a response. He remarked that Iran had made a significant miscalculation and would face consequences. Netanyahu emphasized that the Iranian regime underestimated Israel’s resolve to defend itself and retaliate against its adversaries. This isn’t the first time Bitcoin has reacted negatively to geopolitical conflict. A similar drop occurred in April following a drone attack by Iran on Israel. Some analysts, like Jeroen Blokland of Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, believe that investors are selling Bitcoin to buy gold. Meanwhile, Adam Cochran and Jesse Colombo have questioned Bitcoin’s reliability as a safe haven, although the former’s comments may have been partly made in jest. Precious metals, by contrast, tend to perform better during such crises. Colombo argued that Bitcoin behaves more like a risk asset similar to tech stocks, which also fell. The best analyses are based on one day of data Now, juxtapose Bitcoin's intraday chart with gold:https://t.co/VmrayqxDNn However, it is worth noting that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested in July 2023 that Bitcoin could still serve as an alternative hedge against inflation. Larry Fink today said he hopes SEC “looks at their ETF filing as a way to democratize crypto and make it cheaper.” Also says bitcoin is international asset, new gold. Seems all-in, wants to work w regulators to get approval. altho unsure of timetable.

Title: BlackRock's CEO says China is the biggest supporter of Russia's economy amidst the Ukraine war

China is Russia's biggest war backer, BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink said on Tuesday. Fink spoke at a panel at the Berlin Global Dialogue conference when he said that Western businesses need to re-evaluate their relationship with China. "Russia's biggest supporter and fundamental supporter of the Russian economy is China. And that has to be at least discussed," Fink said. "Each country, each company, has to reassess what that means, and I'm not here to make any judgments, but I don't believe there's been enough assessment." Earlier in the panel, Fink expressed surprise that there hasn't been a "larger questioning or demanding" of China's support for Russia amid the latter's war with Ukraine. "You're supporting our enemy, we're putting billions and billions of dollars into supporting the survival of Ukraine, and there should be a cost to that," Fink said of China. Fink told dialogue attendees that China's continual backing of the Russian economy also means BlackRock may need to review its operations in the Chinese market. "We have businesses in China, I'm sure everybody here has some businesses in China," Fink said. "We all have to re-evaluate that, like we have to re-evaluate a risk in liquidity traps, a risk in everything," he added. Representatives for Fink at BlackRock did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours. China has been a critical lifeline for Russia as it continues to struggle under the West's crippling economic sanctions since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. In 2023, Russia and China's bilateral trade hit a record $240 billion, per Chinese customs data. "Russia's economy is suffering long-term setbacks, and the country is sealing its fate as China's economic vassal," CIA director William J. Burns wrote in an opinion article for Foreign Affairs in January. To be sure, China has been trying to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine. China has claimed to be neutral when it comes to the war in Ukraine. In February 2023, China unveiled a 12-point peace plan, but that was rejected by Russia. In July, Finland's President Alexander Stubb told Bloomberg in an interview that Russia's reliance on China means the Asian giant could end the Ukraine war if it wanted to. "I argue that Russia is so dependent on China right now that one phone call from President Xi Jinping would solve this crisis," Stubb told the outlet. "If he were to say, 'Time to start negotiating peace.' Russia would be forced to do that. They would have no other choice," he continued. Jump to

Simonsen also helped guide Stella McCartney through its shareholder transition, when McCartney exercised her option to buy back Kering’s 50 percent stake in her brand in 2018, then sold a minority stake to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton a year later. SMCP is in the process of restructuring its operations and global network balance. It is looking to grow its business in new territories including India, Indonesia and the Philippines after retreating from China following several quarters of declining sales there. The SMCP group operates about 1,600 stores in 46 countries. Business in the U.S., Canada and Mexico has been stronger, with sales up nearly 9 percent in first-quarter results reported earlier this year. It is expanding its footprint in the region, including opening a new Sandro store in Montreal later this month. SMCP itself is undergoing a shareholder change. Holding company Glas, which is serving as the trustee for creditors including funds BlackRock, Carlyle, Anchorage, Boussard and Gavaudan, was just given the green light to sell its shares by the London High Court. The anticipated Glas sale would position SMCP as ripe for a potential takeover bid.
