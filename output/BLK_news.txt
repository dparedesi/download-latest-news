A superb win and a great performance underscored by eight tries, there was plenty to celebrate for Scott Bemand’s team as they bounced back from their opening day defeat to France with an impressive victory in Parma. Ireland’s Aoife Dalton was a deserved player of the match, not only a try scorer, but also consistently excellent on both sides of the ball, making 15 tackles and nine carries. Although Ireland’s right wing Anna McGann might feel it’s not often that a hat-trick of tries is overlooked in handing out the laurels. There were others too that stood out. Stacey Flood added value every time she touched the ball, Eve Higgins had an eye for a gap, and outhalf Dannah O’Brien’s kicked brilliantly out of hand and off the tee, from which she landed seven from eight conversions. Up front the pack were excellent to a player, Aoife Wafer, Erin King and Linda Djougang especially prominent. Italy got off to the worst possible start as they lost their secondrow Valeria Fedrighi to a yellow card for a shoulder to the head of Ireland captain Edel McMahon after less than a minute. The subsequent bunker review adjudicated it should remain a yellow, but by the time she returned the home side had conceded 14 points. O’Brien kicked the penalty to touch. Ireland mauled the ball and after a couple of carries from the pack, pursued a wider option. Despite the fact that Higgins had her pass deflected, Dalton scooped up the ball and demonstrated speed and strength to force her way over. O’Brien’s conversion was unerring. It got even better for Ireland on seven minutes when Higgins deceived the defence with a dummy and accelerated through a gap. Both the timing and accuracy of her pass enabled Anna McGann to cross for her first try in Test rugby. The work of the Irish backrow at the breakdown was first class in the opening quarter, Wafer and King especially prominent, so too hooker Neve Jones. The Italians had served notice with some enterprising back play before scrumhalf Sofia Stefan profited from soft Irish defence to scamper over for a try. Ireland’s determination to drift without closing the space inside was costly. The visitors then dodged one or two more defensive lapses without conceding further points before Higgins, once again, cut the Italian defence asunder. Amee-Leigh Costigan still had work to do but accomplished it with a lovely in-and-out swerve to cross for Ireland’s third try. The fourth and bonus-point try was a brilliant team effort. Wafer and Djougang were direct and powerful to guarantee front foot possession, before fullback Stacey Flood glided on to the ball, straightened, and gave McGann the space to squeeze over in the corner for her second try. O’Brien kicked a superb touchline conversion, her fourth from as many attempts. A gutsy goal-line stand in the final moments of the half enabled Ireland to take a 28-5 interval lead. Wafer had a try disallowed soon after the restart Niamh O’Dowd pinged for blocking. Britanny Hogan and Dorothy Wall made an immediate impression off the bench, their energy and power conspicuous in the build-up to a deserved try for the hard-working Djougang. Unfortunately for the Irish tighthead prop her next involvement resulted in a yellow card, which stayed at that level of censure on review. It meant that Christy Haney had to come on for flanker McMahon. Hogan and Wall collaborated for Ireland’s sixth try on 64-minutes, the latter powering over from close range. O’Brien failed to convert for the first time. Italian centre Beatrice Rigoni was awarded a try after a TMO review, a strange decision on the basis that she didn’t get to her feet before playing the ball for a second time. Her right knee remained on the ground/back of the Irish player. She maximised her good fortune by adding the conversion, but it was merely window dressing in scoreboard terms. Given a glut of changes on both sides the contest lost a little of its shape as the teams struggled to maintain cohesion. Replacement scrumhalf Emily Lane might have added to Ireland’s tally, but lost control of the ball just shy of the Italian line following a sharp break. The visitors did get that seventh try, Hogan barging past a couple of lacklustre tackles, which O’Brien improved upon and with the last play of the match McGann grabbed her hat-trick, outflanking and outpacing the Italian defence. O’Brien’s conversion a fitting epitaph for a stellar placekicking display.

Title: How Performative Activism Enabled Mass Persecution

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/30/2025 9:23:17 AM PDT by MtnClimber Reality engineering requires three components: institutional power to create the narrative, social pressure to enforce it, and the deliberate persecution of anyone who challenges either. The Covid era provided the perfect case study in how this machinery operates—and revealed how performative activism serves as its most potent enforcement mechanism. Every major element of the official Covid narrative has been proven false: The origins of the virus, the validity of PCR tests, the suppression of early treatments, the denial of natural immunity, the so-called “safety and effectiveness” of vaccines, and the utility of masks, lockdowns, and vaccine passports. Yet those who questioned any part of it faced unprecedented ostracism and persecution. The manufactured panic ignored fundamental reality: Covid posed minimal risk to healthy people under 70, but was significantly more dangerous to the elderly and immunocompromised. Rather than focusing resources on protecting vulnerable populations, we destroyed economies, stole childhoods, and enforced measures that made no epidemiological sense. This wasn’t just about control—it was an engineered economic coup, the largest financial consolidation of power in modern history. While small businesses were forcibly closed, Amazon’s profits soared. As working-class neighborhoods struggled, Wall Street celebrated record gains. The laptop class posted about ‘we’re all in this together’ from their home offices while essential workers were forced into what was portrayed as dangerous conditions to deliver their groceries. The same corporations trumpeting their commitment to “equity” through DEI initiatives were destroying economic mobility for the very communities they claimed to champion. Just months before Covid, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. An examination of the event reveals that the priority of the exercise centered not on treatment protocols or protecting the vulnerable but rather on how information control could be used to manufacture mass compliance. When the real crisis arrived, this strategy found willing accomplices in a culture already primed for performative virtue. The height of this hypocrisy revealed itself during the pandemic, exposing not just empty virtue signaling, but active participation in one of the most egregious civil rights violations in recent American history. As millions changed their profile pictures and posted solidarity symbols for social justice, these same voices fell silent—or worse, actively participated in the persecution of two distinct groups: the unvaccinated and the vaccine-injured. The Profitable Performance of PowerThe economic devastation fell hardest on those least able to bear it. While professionals attended Zoom meetings in their pajamas, service workers faced an impossible choice: show up to what was marketed as a deadly environment or lose their livelihoods. The data tells the story: - Black-owned businesses declined by 41% during the first few months of lockdowns - Latino unemployment reached 18.9%, the highest of any demographic - Women left the workforce in unprecedented numbers, erasing decades of gains - Small businesses, the primary path to middle-class stability in minority communities, closed at triple the rate of their corporate competitors The financial beneficiaries were clear: - Amazon’s market value increased by $570 billion - Zoom’s stock rose 396% - Moderna executives became billionaires overnight - Pfizer reported record profits of $100 billion - BlackRock acquired 34% of single-family homes in major markets During the lockdown, ostensibly put in place to “protect the vulnerable”, vulnerable small businesses lost $4.6 trillion in value, with minority-owned enterprises accounting for 41% of closures despite representing only 20% of total businesses.

An examination of the event reveals that the priority of the exercise centered not on treatment protocols or protecting the vulnerable but rather on how information control could be used to manufacture mass compliance. When the real crisis arrived, this strategy found willing accomplices in a culture already primed for performative virtue. The height of this hypocrisy revealed itself during the pandemic, exposing not just empty virtue signaling, but active participation in one of the most egregious civil rights violations in recent American history. As millions changed their profile pictures and posted solidarity symbols for social justice, these same voices fell silent—or worse, actively participated in the persecution of two distinct groups: the unvaccinated and the vaccine-injured.

Karen Heffernan wouldn’t know the father of her child if he passed her on the street. What she does know is what he looked like as a baby, his height, that he is Danish, and has a clean bill of health. That’s because when Heffernan, a 37-year-old hairdresser from Blackrock in Co Dublin was in her early 30s, she began to explore the idea of intrauterine insemination (IUI), using donor sperm. “I always knew I wanted a child, but my last long-term relationship ended when I was 25. I told myself, if I didn’t meet anyone I would be happy to have a child by myself, and then I hit 30 and gave myself two years to look into the option of using a donor properly. But then Covid hit,” she recalls. “That put a stop to socialising and going on dates. When restrictions were lifted I was around 34 and all my friends were having kids at the same time and I was like ‘what am I waiting for?‘” Before she went for the first consultation at a fertility clinic to discuss her options, Heffernan sat her parents Paula and Alan down to explain her plans. “I knew that taking this on as a single mother would require support. From the outset, they were 100 per cent behind my decision and my mum came with me for my first consultation,” she says. At a new Thérapie Fertility Clinic in Carrickmines, Heffernan was told of her options. Learning about women’s fertility and how rapidly it starts to decrease in their 30s, she knew she would be taking a chance on the donor route. She purchased three “straws” – three IUI rounds with the donor’s sperm, at a total cost of around €5,000. Under the Children, Family and Relationships Act (CFRA) 2015, which commenced in Ireland in May 2020, all imported donations – sperm or eggs – must be from a non-anonymous, or traceable, donor. Donors must agree to open contact with a donor-conceived child once that child reaches 18 years of age. “The donor was listed under the European Sperm Bank. In Ireland, there’s a lot of rules and regulations, so only three women in Ireland can use the same donor, and we can only use what is termed ‘open donors’, who can be contacted at a later stage by the child,” Heffernan explains. “I was only looking for a healthy, happy baby so that meant a donor [with] no health issues. It didn’t matter if they had brown or blonde hair, or [were] a boy or a girl.” [ The meaning of motherhood in a world that devalues, judges and polices itOpens in new window ] When her first attempt with IUI failed, Heffernan decided to go for a second round, but this time she kept what she was doing under wraps. In October 2022, she found out she was pregnant. “I live alone so I was sitting in my house in shock and happy-crying. I couldn’t believe it had happened for me so quickly. I hadn’t told my parents that I had gone for the second round It was my mum’s birthday on the day I was getting the blood tests to confirm my pregnancy, so I wrote on the card ‘Love from baby H’,” she adds. “When I told people I was pregnant, some would ask if I was going to say how it happened. My reaction was always, of course I will, because getting pregnant from a donor is nothing to be ashamed of.” In June 2023, her daughter was born. Heffernan sees her own family in the looks and traits of her child, now 21 months old, but has noticed some characteristics that are probably from the donor. “She’s quite a tall baby. Her skin is more sallow than mine too, but she looks like my family and she’s quite active in the way I was at her age.” Aimee Crinion wasn’t thinking about having children when she married her partner Dave in 2009. Then aged 32, and with both of them working full-time – she as a professional dog walker and he in IT – there was plenty of time to start a family, but first they would travel, enjoy plenty of nights out and long lie-ins. When the couple from Glasnevin in Dublin 9 decided to have children, they expected it to happen naturally. Except it didn’t. At 36, Crinion shared her concerns with her doctor and the couple subsequently opted for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) to try to help them to conceive. Crinion knew there were no guarantees. I knew I didn’t have it in me to go through IVF in my 40s. We had looked into adoption but we realised we were also too old for that “We went for one round at the Merrion Fertility Clinic in Dublin 2, and in our minds we were thinking, we’ll do it once. We were baffled why I couldn’t get pregnant. We were both healthy and neither of us had fertility problems – I simply wasn’t getting pregnant naturally, even with an egg reserve that wasn’t bad for my age,” she explains. “We did our first round of IVF against a background of people telling us that it never works the first time, which I thought was really pointless advice. But they were right, it didn’t work and I was desperately upset because all of my friends were married and had children or were pregnant and it consumed me – all I could see were babies everywhere. And that was all I wanted, to bring a child into the world.” Crinion credits the strength of her marriage as the reason for getting through the first failed round. Dave was a constant support and they had each other at the end of it all. [ ‘When our last embryo failed, the clinic told us there was nothing more they could do for us’Opens in new window ] Crinion’s father Michael became very ill during the same period, and died in October 2013. It was an incredibly stressful time. “I found it so hard to lose him and not have been able to let him meet my kids because I always believed he would,” she says. In 2014, the couple decided to go for one last round of IVF. “I knew I didn’t have it in me to go through IVF in my 40s. We had looked into adoption but we realised we were also too old for that. I remember that day in May in the Merrion Clinic and one of the nurses there turned to me and said ‘this is going to work, you’ve done everything you can and I’m telling you, this is going to work’. She mentioned my dad, just a passing comment, and something felt different, almost like he was watching over me.” Having never done a pregnancy test herself for the fear of disappointment, one morning just after a blood test at the clinic while out walking her dogs, she took their call. “I was on Killiney Hill with six dogs running around me and all the clinic said at the other end of the phone was ‘yes’. I started screaming, ‘Finally, finally’. Me and all these dogs [were] running towards the car park to get to my van. It was magical,” she says. Her son Hugo was born in February 2015. Content with her life, Crinion still had the option to pursue IVF, but didn’t know if she could go through the process again. Two years after her son was born, she went to the doctor with a urinary tract infection (UTI). “I gave the doctor a sample for the UTI test and she said, ‘Do you know you’re pregnant?’ I couldn’t process that. I remember saying something like ‘Okay ... but can you give me something for the UTI’ and then very quickly adding that I couldn’t be pregnant because I couldn’t have children naturally.” Arabella was born in November 2017, and there was no question of IVF again. “I do consider myself lucky. I’m 50 now with two beautiful children, a husband, a dog, and a lot of grey hair. As difficult as that path was to get here, I am very grateful for it all. I do believe my father has watched over every step.” Having raised three birth children of her own, Mags Murphy from Enniscorthy in Co Wexford is now a foster mother. Since 2018, she and her husband Danny, who also have three grandchildren, have taken in 10 foster children over short and long-term periods, with ongoing check-ins with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and support from Foster Care Ireland (FCI), an organisation that places children with foster parents. There were 5,595 children in the care of the State last year, according to Tusla, with 91 per cent of those children in foster homes. For Murphy, these figures are heartbreaking. “All of these children deserve a parent, or a caring adult that can make a difference. They have done nothing wrong, and yet many carry this feeling of guilt that it was something they did,” says the 57-year-old. “Even when they come into care, the children try so hard to please. They ask, ‘am I being good?’ and you’re thinking, ‘you are a child of four or five, you shouldn’t be worrying about having to be good or trying to figure out what is expected of you from adults.’ It’s very, very hard on them.” Murphy says her house has always been a lively, loud, and busy home. Her children – now 31, 35, and 37 – often had friends over. For 30 years, she ran her own childcare business for preschoolers, and over a 10-year period had 12 children from Belarus stay at Christmas or during the summer months under the Chernobyl Children’s Project International, founded by Adi Roche. When they call you mam it’s lovely but also sort of bittersweet, because you feel a sense of loss for them A self-confessed nurturer, it was after her children left home that she and Danny began to discuss fostering. Following assessments, vetting and training, they were accepted, and in April 2018 got their first placement under the “respite fostering” programme, where a child already with foster parents would come for a weekend or a week to give them and their foster parents a break. “At first it was like I was a doting granny because I would take this little child in on a Friday and they would return to a foster parent on the Monday, and you could really have fun with them and take them places. You didn’t have to deal with homework or the stress of school and all that goes with full foster care,” says Murphy. [ Fostering: ‘The children’s situation is so precarious – while we may not have everything to offer, we offer everything we have’Opens in new window ] “You would also see their behaviours and ask yourself if you could deal with that on a daily basis. But then we got our first boy and he was with us for four years. He was really lucky because he was reunited with his mum. It was a happy story. That often doesn’t happen for children in foster care.” It has been a challenging experience at times, too, but FCI’s link workers have offered a lot of support to the Murphys over the years. Murphy has maintained contact with many of the children who stayed with her, and has framed photographs of them all on the wall in her home. Some of the children have referred to her and Danny as “Mam and Dad” when speaking about their new family in school or with friends. “When they call you Mam it’s lovely but also sort of bittersweet, because you feel a sense of loss for them,” Murphy says. “You also want them to become comfortable and confident enough to just be children.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Coyotes Are Smuggling Migrants Out of the United States

Time Published: 2025-03-29T21:17:18Z

A growing number of illegal migrants are smuggling themselves out of the United States to avoid the legal penalties of government deportations, according to multiple witnesses. “I’ve been a journalist for more than 25 years, but I never thought I would see this — ‘paquetes de retorno'” said Alfredo Corchado, an American journalist in Texas and Mexico and an executive editor at the Puente News Collaborative. On March 26 he told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations: [Coyotes] are now offering packages where [migrant] people can go back home …. [If] you want to go home, or you want to go back to Honduras, or maybe you don’t want to go back to Honduras because it’s too dangerous. [Or] you don’t want to go to Guatemala, but maybe you want to go to Costa Rica, and so they’re offering these [smuggling] packages where you can just go back home. Not all of them are taking it, I mean, many [are]. If migrants are deported by the United States government, they are separated from their families and detained in crowded jails, sometimes for many weeks. Once legally deported, migrants cannot visit for 10 years or longer, even when their relatives remain in the United States. They also lose possessions and easy access to their bank accounts. Haitians “are self-deporting right now because they don’t want the worst thing … because [the government] does send them back to Haiti immediately,” Jeff Lamour, an American businessman in Albertville, Alabama, told Breitbart News on Friday. Many Haitians have moved to Albertville for jobs once held by Americans in the chicken slaughterhouses. They got work permits from Biden’s deputies but are now losing them to Trump’s pro-American policies. Lamour added: This [self-deporting] industry with the coyotes, it has become a multi-million dollar industry over here now. You got those guys that are going from Indiana, from Alabama, in those vans where they’re smuggling people to New Mexico, to border states. They’re making a ton of money. If they go deposit money at the bank, it’s going to raise a red flag. You know, I had a gentleman a couple days ago trying to buy a car with cash, straight cash. He just don’t know what to do with it because he has a lot of cash from the shuttle industry. Smugglers “charge them $10,000 per head because a lot of people that are working are saving their money,” Lamour told told 1819News.com. “A lot of people are going back to Chile,” where they were living before Biden opened the border. Other Haitians are going into hiding, for example, by selling their cars to minimize the chance of any interaction with local police, he said: I sell cars for a living. I have my mechanic sitting next to me right there. He can tell you, as my witness — did we not have a guy come over here, return his car, because he’s scared to be deported? I had guys selling their car for $500 just so they won’t be deported. We see that every day. One local migrant “crossed from Brazil all the way to the United States,” Lamour told Breitbart News, adding: His wife and kids died in the [Darien Gap], and he had to leave them behind because he had to survive and save himself. Once he arrived in Mexico, he had to literally stay at the gay bathhouse [to avoid robbers, before he] made it over here through a Catholic charity. So far, the exit numbers are small compared to the resident population of roughly 18 million illegal migrants, of whom roughly 9 million were invited by President Joe Biden’s deputies. The New York Times acknowledged the trend: Since arriving in Denver in 2023, Cristian, 29, has delivered meals and worked on construction sites. (Like other migrants I interviewed, he worried that immigration agents would find him and spoke on the condition that I identify him only by his given name.) He sends money to his wife and children in Venezuela. Cristian does not have any tattoos, a customary gang indicator, he said. He possesses a work permit and an active asylum application, which theoretically protects him from imminent deportation. But the enforcement climate since Trump took office has changed Cristian’s calculus “360 degrees,” he told me. With the help of an American friend who escorted him to several immigration offices, he made an appointment to appear before a judge today so he could request a voluntary departure from the United States. (Immigrants who receive formal permission to leave have an easier time returning later.) … A family in Chicago recently left for Mexico, according to their lawyer. People have abandoned Springfield, Ohio — the town where Trump claimed Haitians were eating their pets — employers there told me. Others are contemplating leaving from elsewhere, like Houston. South of the border, northbound migrants are also turning back homewards. “It is true that people are going different directions,” Caleb Vitello, a senior official in Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, told the Council on Foreign Relations. For example, the northward foot and boat traffic in the dangerous Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama has dropped “because people aren’t risking that walk or that dangerous journey through there,” he said. The migrants’ exit is bad news for business groups who want more imported customers, workers, and renters to increase their profits and stock values. “The only way that we continue to grow economically is actually by increasing our levels of immigration,” said Andrea Flores, the vice-president for lobbying at FWD.us, a lobby group for West Coast investors in the consumer economy. Flores told the CFR event: I think some of the inquiries I get most around the country are not from the border [area] and not from major urban areas. It’s from places like Nebraska [where] I routinely will get outreach from, saying, “How do we push for getting us elder care workers, childcare workers? How do we get some restaurant workers to revitalize some of our small towns? … So I’m very pro [asking] “Why don’t we offer, you know, English language courses? Why does the federal government provide that? How do you help facilitate a new immigrant’s arrival so they don’t create the type of social challenges [for] any country facing increased immigration?” But the promise of cheap labor is “a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told an audience of investors in mid-March. “Real innovation makes us more productive, but it also, I think, dignifies our workers. It boosts our standard of living. It strengthens our workforce and the relative value of its labor.” “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. Fink continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” Fink said.

Title: Musk’s xAI startup swallows up X social network in surprise deal

Elon Musk said his xAI artificial intelligence startup has acquired the X platform, which he also controls, at a valuation of $33 billion, marking a surprise twist for the social network formerly known as Twitter.“The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion,” the billionaire wrote Friday in a post on X. The value of X is $45 billion when including $12 billion of debt, he said, describing the purchase as an all-stock transaction.The deal gives the new combined entity, called XAI Holdings, a value of more than $100 billion, not including the debt, according to a person familiar with the arrangement, who asked not to be identified because the terms weren’t public. Morgan Stanley was the sole banker on the deal, representing both sides, other people said.For Musk, the deal streamlines his businesses and solidifies the relationship between the former Twitter and xAI, which has used information from the social network to hone its chatbot. The deal also offers a resolution to X’s other backers following months of uncertainty over the state of their investment as Musk’s changes led to an exodus of users and advertisers.“XAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk posted. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach.”Musk, the world’s richest person, acquired Twitter for $44 billion in late 2022, a transaction that included debt. After taking control of the platform, he quickly moved to cut costs by slashing thousands of jobs, closing offices and renegotiating contracts. He also tried to make Twitter more aligned with what he calls “free speech absolutism” by eliminating certain content restrictions and allowing some banned accounts to return.But Musk also eroded a significant portion of the network’s advertising business in the process. Marketers fled the site for fear that their promoted posts would appear alongside unsavory content from users. Even with an expected boost in sales for 2025, X’s advertising business is still projected to be roughly half of what it was when Musk acquired the company.Over the past year, Musk has used the service to promote Grok, a chatbot developed by xAI that was trained, in part, with posts from X users. The startup is competing with AI firms such as OpenAI, which Musk co-founded before an acrimonious split with that company. “This helps integrate the system quite nicely,” said Shweta Khajuria, a Wolfe Research analyst who views the deal as a positive for both of Musk’s businesses. “This gives Grok a unique advantage” by providing access to vast amounts of training data while also allowing xAI to control — or even cut off — that data flow to other companies.Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management and an investor in both companies, wrote on X that the deal “makes a lot of sense” by giving xAI an in-house proprietary data set that other companies don’t have access to. “Grok brings the brains. X brings the distribution,” he posted. “OpenAI has the brains and brand distribution (e.g., Apple), but lacks X’s proprietary data. Long-term edge: xAI.”A spokesperson for X declined to comment, pointing Bloomberg to a post from X CEO Linda Yaccarino. “The future could not be brighter,” she wrote. It’s unclear whether this merger will affect her role as X’s CEO.Musk has a long history of blending his various operations by sharing investors, technology and employees. His AI business, in addition to training on X user data, has also shared office space with X in the San Francisco Bay area. X also amassed a $6 billion stake in xAI as of January, which further intertwined the businesses.Investors in xAI have included Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity Investments and BlackRock Inc. Some of the AI startup’s investors were also backers of X, including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia.Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh wrote Friday that xAI’s acquisition of X could set a framework for deals involving other social networking companies.The deal “might be a sign that rivals including OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity and Mistral will pursue deals to enhance their consumer reach and distribution,” Singh wrote. “We believe smaller social-media players will actively seek alliances with providers of large language models, given the premium valuation for xAI at $80 billion, which is more than the combined market values of Snap, Pinterest and Reddit.”For most of Musk’s tenure as X’s owner, the social networking company was believed to be valued well below the $44 billion that Musk paid in late 2022. Fidelity, for example, had marked down its equity stake in the company by more than 70% as recently as November.But X has seen a slight business resurgence since Musk became a top adviser to President Donald Trump, a relationship that has brought some advertisers back in an effort to curry favor with the two men. X raised close to $1 billion in new equity from investors, Bloomberg reported this month, in a deal that gave the company a valuation in line with when Musk took it private in 2022.Banks that had also been holding onto debt from Musk’s Twitter purchase were also finally able to offload it earlier this year without taking a loss. At one point in 2022, that debt was marked at 60 cents on the dollar by some firms.X is on pace for its first year of advertising revenue growth since the Musk takeover, though some of those marketers are believed to be returning out of fear that Musk may sue them. The company is projected to generate $1.31 billion in US advertising sales in 2025, an increase of 17.5%, according to research firm Emarketer. Globally, X’s ad sales are estimated to be $2.26 billion this year, up 16.5%. “The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion,” the billionaire wrote Friday in a post on X. The value of X is $45 billion when including $12 billion of debt, he said, describing the purchase as an all-stock transaction.

The social media account linked to state broadcaster CCTV said China had significant national interests in the transaction and the sale was “tantamount to handing a knife to an opponent.” As a Hong Kong company, CK Hutchison should be careful about how it handled deals that could harm China’s national interest, said the post from the account Yuyuantantian on social media platform Weibo. However minutes after going live, the post had vanished.

Title: Meet The Other Billionaire Behind The Winning Bid For The Boston Celtics

ByGiacomo Tognini ByGiacomo Tognini Forbes Staff. Bruce Beal Jr. When the owners of the NBA’s Boston Celtics announced on March 20 that they were selling the team for $6.1 billion to a group of investors led by private equity executive William “Bill” Chisholm, the news shocked the sports world. Few even knew who Bill Chisholm was, though they quickly learned he went to his first Celtics game on his seventh birthday and had been a “rabid fan ever since” who “bleeds green.” But Chisholm isn’t the only die-hard billionaire fan buying into the Celtics for the first time. Boston native Bruce Beal Jr., a partner at real estate giant Related Companies, joined Chisholm and telecom billionaire Robert Hale in the deal. “I grew up in Boston, loving the Celtics," Beal said in a statement. Recalling the day he saw the Celtics win the 1984 NBA finals, he said “it was the best day ever. Fast forward to today, it’s come full circle.” At least one well-known person in sports was not surprised. NFL great Tom Brady congratulated Beal on his Instagram story shortly after the deal was announced. “The Boston boy is an owner of his Boston team,” he wrote, adding three fire emojis. “Congratulations Bruce Beal Jr.!!!” (Celtic punk rock band Dropkick Murphys' “I'm Shipping Up To Boston” provided the soundtrack for the post.) The Celtics investment, if it’s approved, won’t be Beal’s first foray into pro sports. The 55-year-old already owns a minority stake in the NFL’s Miami Dolphins, where he serves as vice chairman and was brought in after Related’s founder Stephen Ross bought a 95% stake in the team in 2009 at a $1.1 billion valuation. The Dolphins were valued at $8.1 billion (along with the Hard Rock Stadium, Formula 1’s Miami Grand Prix and the Miami Open tennis tournament) when Ross sold a 13% stake last December. Forbes estimates Beal’s minority stake in the Dolphins is worth more than $100 million. Outside of his NFL bet, Beal owes most of his fortune to Related, the New York-based real estate developer founded by Ross in 1972. Beal joined the firm in 1995 and rose to become president in 2012. Forbes estimates Beal is worth more than $1 billion. A representative for Related Companies declined to comment on the net worth estimate or to make Beal available for an interview. Bruce Beal Jr. (left) and his father Bruce Beal Sr. (right) at the preview celebration for The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards in New York in 2019. Beal grew up in Boston in a real estate dynasty. His father, Bruce Sr., was the fourth generation of the family to run Boston-based property developer the Beal Companies, which was first established in 1878 by Beal Jr.’s great-great-grandfather Abraham Beal. As a child, Beal had different plans, telling Crain's New York in 2009 that he originally wanted to become the next Jacques Cousteau, going to marine biology camps and working at a fish market in Nantucket and a dolphin lab in Hawaii. He was also a rabid Celtics fan. “When I was 16, the Celtics were going public and I proudly used the money I made from summer landscaping to buy about 20 shares,” he said in a statement. “It was the first stock purchase I ever made.” After going public in 1986, the team delisted from the stock exchange in 2003 when it was purchased for $360 million by a group of investors led by Irving Grousbeck, whose family will retain a stake in the franchise until the second part of the $6.1 billion sale closes in 2028. Beal graduated from high school in 1988 at Concord Academy, a tony prep school in an affluent Boston suburb, and then went to Harvard, where he got a bachelor's of arts and was on the lightweight crew team. Two years after graduating from Harvard in 1993, he started working at Related. In 2003, he led Related’s joint venture with his father’s company to develop the Clarendon and One Back Bay, two apartment buildings with a combined 281 units in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. The apartments were completed in 2009, and four years later Beal Companies merged with Related to form Related Beal, which is now Related’s division in Boston. (Bruce Beal Sr. serves as Related Beal's chairman.) In 2007, Ross sold a 7.5% stake in Related to Goldman Sachs and Michael Dell’s MSD Capital. (MSD Capital later merged with Byron Trott’s merchant bank to form BDT & MSD Partners, run by Trott and Greg Lemkau, a former teammate of Bill Chisholm’s on Dartmouth’s varsity soccer team and also a Goldman Sachs alum. That firm was an advisor on the Celtics sale.) A year later, Ross bought 50% of the Miami Dolphins—plus the stadium and surrounding land—from billionaire Wayne Huizenga (d. 2018) for $550 million, buying another 45% stake in 2009 at a $1.1 billion valuation. By 2016, Beal had become a minority investor, and CBS Sports reported that the NFL had approved a succession plan with Ross granting Beal the right of first option to buy the Dolphins if Ross died or decided to sell his majority stake. In 2022, Ross reportedly changed his mind, giving that right to his daughter Jennifer instead. Bruce Beal Jr. (left), Jeff Blau (center) and Stephen Ross (right) in Hudson Yards in 2019, with the 150-foot tall Vessel behind them. Together with Ross and Related’s current CEO, Jeff Blau, Beal helped build Related Companies into a behemoth that’s developed or acquired $70 billion worth of residential, retail, office, hospitality and data center properties across the U.S., London and Abu Dhabi. “The company started in affordable housing, then we did market-rate rentals, and we built offices for companies like Nestlé and MasterCard,” Beal told Forbes in 2023, pointing to its diversification across different types of real estate. “We're very customer-driven, so we're constantly thinking about what our customers want.” But Beal didn’t just ride Ross’ coattails. Ross handed off day-to-day operations to Beal and Blau in 2012, appointing them as president and CEO, respectively. Ross used to tell the pair “‘I'm going to give you a really long leash, just don't hang yourself,'" Beal told Forbes in 2019. The trio worked together on many of Related’s largest projects, including Hudson Yards, a neighborhood on Manhattan's west side with 12 million square feet of offices, apartments and retail that cost $25 billion to build and opened in 2019. Despite a downturn in New York’s office market during the Covid-19 pandemic, Hudson Yards has been a success, with its office buildings now 98% occupied by tenants including BlackRock, Facebook parent Meta, Wells Fargo and L’Oréal. “From a developer standpoint, you have to execute every day. We not only have to get the buildings built, we have to run them,” Beal told Forbes in 2023. “So we're constantly thinking about what we can do better and evolve as the markets change.” Then in July 2024, Ross stepped down as executive chairman and left to form a separate company, Related Ross, in Palm Beach, Florida; he still holds a stake in the company and remains the firm’s non-executive chairman. Beal and Blau are now pushing ahead with new developments, including a proposed $12 billion makeover of the unfinished railyards west of Hudson Yards, called Hudson Yards West, that would include a Wynn Resorts casino if it wins one of the New York state gaming licenses up for grabs in December. The project will also have office space, residential buildings, a public school and a 5.6 acre park. Unlike his partner Ross—who’s decamped to Florida—Beal is bullish on New York. “People still want to be in New York. It'll cycle through and it always comes back,” Beal told Forbes in 2023. “We felt like if we did our job and put our heads down and executed, people would not only want to be in New York, but be in Hudson Yards." Still, the longtime New York resident maintains ties to Boston. He owns at least two homes in Related developments in the city and one of his children goes to school there. Now Beal will have an extra reason to find the time to go home to watch the Celtics. “[Boston] still feels like home,” Beal said in a statement. “I love the Celtics and I am honored to be a part of this incredible organization that means so much to Boston and fans like me, who grew up loving this team.”

Elon Musk has announced that his artificial intelligence startup, xAI, has acquired social media platform X (formerly Twitter) in a deal worth $45 billion. This acquisition, which includes $ 12 billion in debt, slightly surpasses the $44 billion Musk paid for Twitter in 2022 before rebranding it as X. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO shared the news of the acquisition on his X account, stating, “xAI and X's futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, computing, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach.” What is Musk's xAI startup? Elon Musk founded xAI in 2023 with the vision of developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence models capable of competing with industry giants such as OpenAI, Google and Microsoft. Shortly after its launch, xAI introduced Grok, an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide real-time responses and engage with users in a conversational manner. Over time, Grok became an integral part of X, with users frequently using it to participate in discussions, seek information and generate insights, according to a report in NBC News. To improve its AI models, xAI has used data from social media interactions on X, refining Grok's ability to respond contextually and intelligently. This integration between xAI's technology and X's vast user-generated content has positioned Grok as a prominent and widely used feature on the platform. Amid the growing demand for AI-driven technologies, xAI has attracted significant interest from investors. Major Wall Street firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley and Sequoia Capital, along with leading semiconductor giants Nvidia and AMD, invested in xAI in December 2024, pushing its valuation to $45 billion, the NBC News report said. More recently, the company secured an additional $10 billion in funding, further driving its valuation to an impressive $75 billion, according to a report in The Guardian. With expansion and growing investor confidence, xAI is solidifying its position as a major player in the AI landscape. Its acquisition of X could mark a big step in that direction. What is the future of xAI and X? While Elon Musk has not yet announced any immediate changes to X following its acquisition by xAI, he has hinted at a deeper integration of artificial intelligence into the platform. The deal, structured as an all-stock transaction, values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, accounting for $12 billion in debt. Musk described xAI as one of the world's fastest-growing AI labs, highlighting its rapid advancements in developing AI models and building data centres at an unprecedented scale. At the same time, the Tesla CEO emphasised X's transformation into a highly efficient company, now serving as the “digital town square” for over 600 million active users. He believes this acquisition positions the platform for scalable growth, using xAI's AI capabilities to improve user experiences and interactions. He reiterated xAI's core mission of “seeking truth and advancing knowledge.” Musk expressed gratitude to the teams at xAI and X for their dedication, calling this acquisition “just the beginning.” He also acknowledged the continued support of partners and investors.

Title: China's top market regulator says it will review CK Hutchison's Panama Canal ports deal according to law

Global Times By Global Times Published: Mar 28, 2025 09:38 PM China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it will review CK Hutchison's Panama Canal ports deal in accordance with laws to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests, according to a Q&A release conducted by Hong Kong Ta Kung Wen Wei (HKTKWW) Media with the market regulator published on its official website. The question raised by Hong Kong Ta Kung Wen Wei said that it is reported that Hutchison Ports, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings, is expected to sign a transaction agreement with BlackRock on April 2 regarding the sale and whether the proposed transaction would require regulatory approval in China. A spokesperson from the second antitrust enforcement division of the State Administration for Market Regulation said that "We have noted this deal and will conduct a review in accordance with the law to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests." According to information on the official website of the SAMR, the second antitrust enforcement division of the SAMR is responsible for antitrust review of businesses' concentration of undertakings. It is also responsible for investigating and addressing illegal concentrations of undertakings, as well as those concentrations that, despite not meeting the notification thresholds, may eliminate or restrict competition. The division also provides guidance to Chinese enterprises on antitrust compliance in overseas markets. The potential sale of Hutchison Ports' Panama assets is attracting attention due to the strategic significance of port infrastructure and the involvement of a major US investment firm, according to the HKTKWW report. CK Hutchison said earlier this month that it agreed to sell most of the global $22.8 billion ports business, including assets it holds along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock. In total, the consortium will control 43 ports in 23 countries, according to Reuters. When asked about CK Hutchison's sale of its overseas ports business, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Thursday that China firmly opposes moves that infringe on and undermine other countries' legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying.

Title: Italy v Ireland: Injury-free Aoibheann Reilly to start as Irish side look for rare win on the road

Resilience is an important character trait for any sportsperson, one that Ireland scrumhalf Aoibheann Reilly has displayed in battling back from not one but two ACL surgeries, one on each knee. The 24-year-old from Ballinasloe made her return to Test rugby off the bench in Ireland’s defeat to France last weekend. On Sunday in Parma she’ll start, forming a halfback partnership with Dannah O’Brien. Reilly tore the ACL in her right knee three years ago. The second time was while playing Sevens for Ireland in Madrid in the build-up to the Olympics, shattering a dream. While the injuries were the same the rehabilitation process differed from a mindset perspective. She explained: “First time around I was 21 and hadn’t played a whole lot for Ireland. So, I don’t know if I had that pressure on me to go back. “My rehab process was a bit longer, but this is a World Cup year, and I knew I needed to get back and get game time under my belt, especially after spending so long in Sevens. I was very focused, worked with some great physios to get me back fit and ready to perform. “It was a very emotional moment standing there for the anthems [last week in Belfast]. When I tore my ACL for the second time, before the Olympics last summer, I was just focusing on getting back for that France game. I knew that everything had to go right in my rehab journey to get back on the pitch, so it was a big moment for me and my family just wearing the green again.” She returned to the match arena in a little over eight months, the second time, playing a couple of games for the Clovers in the Celtic Challenge, which facilitated her return to the Irish team. During that absence she did come co-comms for television, European Challenge Cup games, and also was given a backroom role with Andy Farrell’s men’s squad. She said: “I was very lucky to have been asked to join the men’s team for the November internationals as a support analyst. It was a great way for me to develop my knowledge off-pitch, see how they run things and then also keep learning and growing my rugby IQ while I couldn’t be on-field. That was such a valuable experience and I’m very grateful to the IRFU and to the men’s squad for that. “While I was rehabbing here in HPC I would tailor my days with my physio so I could be there for their big pitch sessions and then I headed over to Portugal for a few days for their pre-camp, which was great. I also shadowed a bit on matchday which was a great insight.” Did she pick up any tips? “Just the way they operate, similar to us, they’re obviously professionals but it was interesting to see how they do things on matchday that are different but also similar to us. Just the level of experience they have in their squad and how they use that, seeing that was very valuable.” Reilly is one of three changes to the team that lost 27-15 to France last week. Ireland head coach Scott Bemand promotes Fiona Tuite, Edel McMahon – she takes over the captaincy – and Reilly from the bench with Dorothy Wall, Brittany Hogan and Emily Lane heading in the opposite direction. Italian head coach Fabio Roselli has made six changes to the side that was beaten 38-5 by England on the opening weekend of the tournament. Hooker Vittoria Vecchini, Gaia Maris, Sara Tounesi and Emma Stevanin swap the bench for a starting role, while number eight Elisa Giordano and centre Michela Sillari are the other alterations to the run-on team. There are a couple of positional switches with Alyssa D’Inca moving from centre to wing, Francesca Granzotto from wing to fullback and Francesca Sgorbini from number eight to flanker. Italy are looking for a hat-trick of wins over Ireland in the Six Nations, having won just one of the previous 16 matches between the sides. Ireland have lost 10 of their last 11 away games, including the previous seven, a streak they’d dearly love to break. There were aspects of the Irish performance last week that were promising but what can’t continue is the number of basic errors. Getting players on the ball like Aoife Wafer, Amee-Leigh Costigan, Stacey Flood, Linda Djougang, Aoife Dalton, Erin King who can break a game open is important but so too is a progression in quality in terms of the collective output. Do that and anything is possible.

Title: Panama Ports Deal on the Verge of Falling Apart Because of Chinese Government Opposition

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/28/2025 9:42:57 PM PDT by SeekAndFind The Chinese government has intervened to stop the planned April 2 sale of two Panama Canal ports owned by the Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchinson to the US-based conglomerate Black Rock. CK Hutchinson operates two of the five ports adjacent to the Panama Canal. Panama first awarded the company the concession to run the ports in 1998 and extended it for another 25 years in 2021. The Canal is a major maritime chokepoint and manages about 3% of the global maritime trade. The issue of Chinese ownership of critical ports serving the Panama Canal predates President Trump's second term; see Does China Run the Canal? – RedState. The administration launched a full-court diplomatic press that got Panama to withdraw from China's Belt and Road Initiative; see UPDATED: Trump Admin. Lays Down the Law Over Panama Canal, Sets Up Major Confrontation; Panama Folds – RedState and Panama Capitulates - Will Not Renew 2017 Deal With China. What's Next? – RedState. That led to an agreement by CK Hutchinson to sell its Panama facilities to Black Rock. This seemed like an early diplomatic win for President Trump; see China's Out: American Company Taking Control of Panama Canal Ports – RedState.Selling the Canal ports did not prove as popular in Beijing as in Washington. Over the past two weeks, pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao has published a series of commentaries criticising the deal for harming China's national interests and depicting it as a betrayal of China and is a "perfect cooperation" with the U.S. strategy to contain China.China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted some of the commentaries on its website, which fueled speculation Beijing could take steps to try to scupper the sale.China's President Xi Jinping is reportedly angry about the deal. He saw Chinese ownership of the ports as a poke in the eye of American power and a bargaining chip in possible tariff negotiations.Now, Chinese antitrust regulators (yes, I did lol writing that) have been unleashed on the deal, which is much larger than two Panamanian ports.The sale of CK Hutchison’s two ports at each end of the Panama Canal was part of a US$23 billion dollar deal to sell 45 ports spread over 23 countries to a consortium led by United States investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison will pocket US$19 billion.“We have noticed this transaction, and will review it in accordance with the law to ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest,” a spokesman from the anti-monopoly department under the market regulator said in a written reply.The watchdog did not reveal when the investigation would be launched.The department is responsible for conducting antitrust reviews and providing guidance to companies over their response to mitigate risk and ensure compliance overseas.The deal may go through, but Black Rock may not end up with the ports. Though some sources say that talks are still underway between Black Rock and CK Hutchinson, nothing indicates this is anything more than wishcasting. Xi dislikes the deal; the sale has been denounced as a betrayal of China by the state press, and selling the ports to an American company is a blow to Chinese prestige, particularly in the context of Panama being offered a "deal it couldn't refuse" to leave the Belt and Road Initiative. CK Hitchinson is reportedly in talks with the Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world’s biggest container shipping operator that runs dozens of terminals globally. This would remove the point of friction of Chinese ownership without allowing Trump to claim victory.

Panama first awarded the company the concession to run the ports in 1998 and extended it for another 25 years in 2021. The Canal is a major maritime chokepoint and manages about 3% of the global maritime trade. The issue of Chinese ownership of critical ports serving the Panama Canal predates President Trump's second term; see Does China Run the Canal? – RedState. The administration launched a full-court diplomatic press that got Panama to withdraw from China's Belt and Road Initiative; see UPDATED: Trump Admin. Lays Down the Law Over Panama Canal, Sets Up Major Confrontation; Panama Folds – RedState and Panama Capitulates - Will Not Renew 2017 Deal With China. What's Next? – RedState. That led to an agreement by CK Hutchinson to sell its Panama facilities to Black Rock. This seemed like an early diplomatic win for President Trump; see China's Out: American Company Taking Control of Panama Canal Ports – RedState.Selling the Canal ports did not prove as popular in Beijing as in Washington. Over the past two weeks, pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao has published a series of commentaries criticising the deal for harming China's national interests and depicting it as a betrayal of China and is a "perfect cooperation" with the U.S. strategy to contain China.China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted some of the commentaries on its website, which fueled speculation Beijing could take steps to try to scupper the sale.China's President Xi Jinping is reportedly angry about the deal. He saw Chinese ownership of the ports as a poke in the eye of American power and a bargaining chip in possible tariff negotiations.Now, Chinese antitrust regulators (yes, I did lol writing that) have been unleashed on the deal, which is much larger than two Panamanian ports.The sale of CK Hutchison’s two ports at each end of the Panama Canal was part of a US$23 billion dollar deal to sell 45 ports spread over 23 countries to a consortium led by United States investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison will pocket US$19 billion.“We have noticed this transaction, and will review it in accordance with the law to ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest,” a spokesman from the anti-monopoly department under the market regulator said in a written reply.The watchdog did not reveal when the investigation would be launched.The department is responsible for conducting antitrust reviews and providing guidance to companies over their response to mitigate risk and ensure compliance overseas.The deal may go through, but Black Rock may not end up with the ports. Though some sources say that talks are still underway between Black Rock and CK Hutchinson, nothing indicates this is anything more than wishcasting. Xi dislikes the deal; the sale has been denounced as a betrayal of China by the state press, and selling the ports to an American company is a blow to Chinese prestige, particularly in the context of Panama being offered a "deal it couldn't refuse" to leave the Belt and Road Initiative. CK Hitchinson is reportedly in talks with the Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world’s biggest container shipping operator that runs dozens of terminals globally. This would remove the point of friction of Chinese ownership without allowing Trump to claim victory.

CK Hutchison will pocket US$19 billion.“We have noticed this transaction, and will review it in accordance with the law to ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest,” a spokesman from the anti-monopoly department under the market regulator said in a written reply.The watchdog did not reveal when the investigation would be launched.The department is responsible for conducting antitrust reviews and providing guidance to companies over their response to mitigate risk and ensure compliance overseas.The deal may go through, but Black Rock may not end up with the ports. Though some sources say that talks are still underway between Black Rock and CK Hutchinson, nothing indicates this is anything more than wishcasting. Xi dislikes the deal; the sale has been denounced as a betrayal of China by the state press, and selling the ports to an American company is a blow to Chinese prestige, particularly in the context of Panama being offered a "deal it couldn't refuse" to leave the Belt and Road Initiative. CK Hitchinson is reportedly in talks with the Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world’s biggest container shipping operator that runs dozens of terminals globally. This would remove the point of friction of Chinese ownership without allowing Trump to claim victory.

Title: BlackRock’s bold bet lifts Solana sentiment to record levels – Could SOL surge next?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/blackrocks-bold-bet-lifts-solana-sentiment-to-record-levels-could-sol-surge-next/

SOL’s social sentiment is soaring on BlackRock and GameStop news, but price action signals caution. What’s next for Solana? Solana [SOL] has become the center of attention in the crypto market, riding a fresh wave of optimism fueled by institutional interest. With BlackRock launching yield-bearing tokenized treasury funds on the network and GameStop integrating Bitcoin through Solana’s [SOL] infrastructure, sentiment around SOL has surged to unprecedented levels. But will this social momentum translate into a price breakout? Data from Santiment reveals a sharp spike in Solana’s Positive/Negative Sentiment Ratio, climbing to 32.87 – far outpacing sentiment levels around Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Ripple[XRP]. This sharp divergence underscores a unique bullish tilt for SOL on social platforms, suggesting growing investor confidence. Source: Santiment The spike coincides with BlackRock’s strategic use of Solana’s infrastructure and GameStop’s broader crypto pivot, both of which have been heavily amplified by influencers and community support. This fusion of technological utility and mainstream integration has created the perfect storm for a sentiment-driven rally. Despite the sentiment frenzy, Solana’s price action is flashing caution. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $132.49, registering a 4.27% intraday dip. The 50-day Moving Average (MA) at $133.74 has acted as a key resistance level, while the 200-day MA at $183.04 loomed far above, highlighting how much ground SOL needs to reclaim for a true trend reversal. Source: TradingView At press time, the Bollinger Bands were tightening, reflecting contracting volatility. Meanwhile, the Average True Range (ATR) sat at 6.18, suggesting that SOL remains in a low-volatility regime – a potential prelude to an explosive move in either direction. SOL’s price pattern indicates consolidation rather than a breakout despite the overly bullish sentiment among traders. This disparity suggests a potential disconnect between emotional optimism and technical resistance levels. Historically, such euphoria can be risky, especially when unsupported by volume and price action. However, Solana’s robust developer ecosystem and real-world applications in tokenized finance, like BlackRock’s recent initiative, offer solid fundamentals. If SOL surpasses the $140 mark and turns its short-term resistance into support, a rapid upward movement could follow, fueled by persistent social sentiment.

Title: Fidelity says Bitcoin could potentially overtake gold, echoing Saylor’s absorption theory

Fidelity's cautious view contrasts with Saylor's optimism as both eye Bitcoin's trajectory amid growing institutional support. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Fidelity Investments director of global macro Jurrien Timmer believes that Bitcoin (BTC) has a “possible” path to surpassing gold in market value — but “not any time soon.” In a detailed social media post, Timmer explained his view using a chart comparing the projected growth of gold and Bitcoin over time. He noted that if gold continues to grow at its historical compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% — a trend seen since 1970 — and Bitcoin follows either a power law adoption curve or the internet’s S-curve growth model, the two could converge within the next 10 to 20 years. Timmer wrote: “If Bitcoin grows at the rate suggested by these two models, then hard money is likely winning the race, which suggests that gold will be appreciating faster than 8% per year. So, my guess is that gold will always be Bitcoin’s quieter older sibling.” The prediction is much more cautious than forecasts shared by other industry leaders like Galaxy and Strategy founder Michael Saylor. Timmer’s comments come amid significant volatility in crypto markets. Bitcoin fell below $84,000 again on March 28, equating to a roughly 33% decline against gold since its December peak. The price struggles come as inflation concerns and trade tensions continue to weigh on risk assets amid the subdued market sentiment. Meanwhile, gold continues to reach new all-time highs, reinforcing its long-standing role as a safe haven. Despite Bitcoin’s price decline, major institutions continue to show confidence in the asset. On March 27, Fidelity and BlackRock drove a combined $89 million into Bitcoin ETFs, led by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which saw $97.1 million in inflows. The continued capital injection signals growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects — even as near-term price action paints a more bearish picture. While Timmer offered a measured take, Strategy founder Michael Saylor recently presented a far more aggressive forecast. Speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit on March 28, Saylor predicted Bitcoin’s market cap could soar to $500 trillion as it absorbs value from traditional assets like gold, real estate, and even sovereign wealth. Saylor argued that Bitcoin is replacing “20th-century assets” with a digital, decentralized, inflation-resistant alternative. He compared the shift to historic changes in monetary systems — like European colonizers introducing coinage to societies that used beads or shells. Saylor added that the US has the “opportunity to grab” 25% to 30% of global Bitcoin value once the “dust settles” from this asset reorganization. Still, the debate is clearly shifting. As more institutional money flows in and long-term models project exponential adoption, the conversation is no longer whether Bitcoin belongs in the same conversation as gold — but when and under what conditions it might catch up. For now, Fidelity’s Timmer urged caution and said the flippening is “possible,” but gold — steady, quiet, and time-tested — still holds the upper hand.

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Contributing Author | Mar 28, 2025 | Health | 0 comments This article was originally published by Tyler Durden at ZeroHedge. Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong – a transplant surgeon-turned-biotech billionaire renowned for inventing the cancer drug Abraxane – has issued a startling warning in a new in-depth interview with Tucker Carlson. Soon-Shiong, founder of ImmunityBio ($IBRX) and owner of the Los Angeles Times, claims that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the very vaccines developed to fight it, may be contributing to a global surge in “terrifyingly aggressive” cancers. In the nearly two-hour conversation, the Los Angeles Times owner leveraged his decades of clinical and scientific experience to outline why he suspects an unprecedented cancer epidemic is unfolding. This report examines Dr. Soon-Shiong’s background and assertions, the scientific responses for and against his claims, new data on post-COVID health trends, and the far-reaching implications if his alarming hypothesis proves true. Soon-Shiong is a veteran surgeon and immunologist who has spent a career studying the human immune system’s fight against cancer. He pioneered novel immunotherapies and even worked on a T-cell based COVID vaccine booster during the pandemic. In the interview, he draws on this background to voice deep concern over rising cancer cases, especially among younger people – something he describes as a “non-infectious pandemic” of cancer. He tells Carlson that in 50 years of medical practice, it was extraordinarily rare to see cancers like pancreatic tumors in children or young adults, yet recently such cases are appearing. For instance, Soon-Shiong was alarmed by seeing a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer, a scenario virtually unheard of in his prior experience. “I never saw pancreatic cancer in children… the greatest surprise to me was a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer,” Soon-Shiong told Carlson, adding that he’s seen examples of very young patients (even children under 11 with colon cancer) and unusual surges in aggressive diseases like ovarian cancer in women in their 30s. These personal observations of more frequent, aggressive cancers in youth led him to probe what might have changed in recent years. “We’re clearly seeing an increase in certain types of cancer, like pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer… colon cancer… in younger people.” — Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong According Soon-Shiong, the COVID era is the obvious change – and suggests that both the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and the widespread vaccination campaigns could be key drivers behind this cancer spike. He emphasizes the massive scale of human exposure to the virus and its spike protein (via infection or vaccination). “I don’t know how to say that without saying it. It scares the pants off me because I think what we may be, I don’ think it’s virus versus man now, this is existential. I think when I talk about the largest non-infectious pandemic that we’re afraid of, this is it.” “Billions of people – literally billions – had the COVID virus. Over a billion got the spike protein vaccine,” said Carlson, adding “So that’s like, we’re talking like a huge percentage of the Earth’s population, unless I’m missing something.” “Now you understand what keeps you awake at night and kept me awake at night for two years, two and a half years,” Soon-Shiong replied, suggesting that exposure to both is silently undermining the immune system’s natural defenses against cancer on a global scale. Soon-Shiong frames COVID-era cancers as potentially virally triggered or exacerbated. In the interview, he described cases of “virally induced cancers” in clinics during the pandemic – patients whose cancers may have been kicked into overdrive by the cascade of inflammation and immune stress associated with COVID-19 (Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong: You’re Being Lied to About Cancer, How It’s Caused, and How to Stop It). COVID infection causes a massive inflammatory response, and some cancers are known to exploit inflammation to grow. TUCKER: “a lot people have pointed to both COVID, the virus, and to the mRNA COVID vaccines as potential causes. Do you think that they’re related?“ SOON-SHIONG: “The best way for me to answer that is to look at history. What we know about virally-induced cancers is well-established. We know that if you get hepatitis, you get liver cancer. Hepatitis is a virus infection. We know if you got human papillomavirus, HPV, you get cervical cancer.” We know that certain viruses directly cause cancer (e.g. HPV, Epstein-Barr), so it’s not unprecedented for a virus to play a role in oncogenesis. While SARS-CoV-2 is not a known oncovirus, Soon-Shiong worries its indirect effects – chronic inflammation, immune exhaustion, or “suppressor cells” that emerge in the wake of infection/vaccination – could be accelerating tumor development. “The answer is to stop the inflammation…clear the virus from the body,” he argues, positing that until we eradicate the lingering virus and restore immune balance, we may see mounting cancer cases. * * * Fight inflammation with IQ Biologix (super potent) Ultra Turmeric In sum, Dr. Soon-Shiong’s claim is that the pandemic has set the stage for an explosion of aggressive cancers: the COVID virus itself (especially if it persists in survivors) might suppress immune surveillance, and the mRNA vaccines “that didn’t stop it” might inadvertently contribute to an immunosuppressive environment. These effects, in his theory, could be unleashing cancers that the immune system would ordinarily have kept in check. Watch: A number of clinicians and researchers have reported similar worrying observations, though these remain largely anecdotal at this stage. One prominent voice echoing Soon-Shiong’s concern is Dr. Angus Dalgleish, a veteran oncologist and professor at St. George’s, University of London. In late 2022, Dalgleish wrote to the BMJ’s editor after noticing that some cancer patients who had been stable for years experienced “rapid progression of their disease after a COVID-19 booster.” He cited cases of individuals who were doing well until shortly after vaccination – new leukemias, sudden appearance of Stage IV lymphomas, and explosive metastases in patients who had post-vaccine bouts of feeling unwell. “I am experienced enough to know that these are not coincidental,” Dalgleish wrote, noting that colleagues in Germany, Australia, and the U.S. were independently seeing the same pattern. This frontline testimony aligns with Soon-Shiong’s fear: something about the immune system post-vaccination might be removing restraints on latent cancers. Dalgleish specifically pointed to short-term innate immune suppression after mRNA vaccination (lasting for several weeks) as a plausible mechanism. Many of the cancers he saw were ones normally held in check by immune surveillance (melanomas and B-cell cancers), so a temporary post-vaccine drop in immune vigilance could allow a tumor growth spurt. He also alluded to “suppressor gene suppression by mRNA in laboratory experiments” – a reference to preliminary studies that found the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein might interfere with key DNA repair or tumor-suppressor proteins in cells. These lab findings (while not yet confirmed in living organisms) lend some biological plausibility to the idea that spike exposure could affect cancer-related pathways. Beyond individual doctors, some research is probing links between COVID and cancer behavior. For example, a 2022 study in Frontiers in Oncology explored how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with cancer cells. It found that the virus’s membrane (M) protein can “induce the mobility, proliferation and in vivo metastasis” of triple-negative breast cancer cells in the lab (Frontiers | SARS-CoV-2 M Protein Facilitates Malignant Transformation of Breast Cancer Cells). In co-culture experiments, breast cancer cells exposed to the viral protein essentially became more aggressive and invasive. The researchers concluded that COVID-19 infection “might promote…aggressive [cancer] phenotypes” and warned that cancer patients who get COVID could face worse outcomes. While this is one specific context (breast cancer cells and one viral protein), it underpins Soon-Shiong’s general concern: the virus can directly alter the tumor microenvironment to the cancer’s advantage. Another line of evidence involves latent viruses and inflammation. Doctors have documented unusual reactivations of viruses like Epstein-Barr (which is linked to lymphomas and other malignancies) during both COVID-19 and post-vaccine immune reactions. Such reactivations hint at a period of immune dysregulation that might also let nascent cancer cells slip past defenses. Or course,fact-checkers and medical authorities argue that there is no credible evidence of vaccines causing meaningful immune suppression. “There isn’t evidence to date that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer or lead to worsening cancer,” one infectious disease expert told FactCheck.org, though they do acknowledge rare side effects like myocarditis or blood clots were found, but not cancer. While the scientific community debates mechanistic links between COVID and cancer, independent analysts have been parsing population-level data for unusual patterns. One notable effort is by Phinance Technologies, a research firm co-founded by former BlackRock portfolio manager Edward Dowd. Phinance has been analyzing excess mortality and disability data since the pandemic, looking for signals of broad health impacts in the aftermath of COVID and mass vaccination. Their findings reveal concerning trends, especially among younger, working-age populations, that lend some weight to Dr. Soon-Shiong’s general warning of a post-COVID health crisis (though not specific to cancer alone). Phinance’s “Vaccine Damage Project” examined the U.S. population aged 16–64 (essentially the workforce) and stratified outcomes into four groups: no effect, mild injuries, severe injuries (disabilities), and death. Using official government databases (the CDC, Bureau of Labor Statistics, etc.), they estimated how each category changed starting in 2021 – when vaccines rolled out and COVID became widespread. The results are sobering. According to Phinance’s analysis, by the end of 2022 the U.S. had experienced approximately 310,000 excess deaths among adults aged 25-64 (a ~23% increase in mortality in that group over normal expectations). Notably, they argue that after mid-2021, with vaccines available and the virus itself becoming less deadly (due to immunity and milder variants), COVID-19 should not have been causing such high excess death rates. Therefore, those 310k “unexplained” deaths in 2021–2022 could represent an upper bound on vaccine-related fatalities or other pandemic collateral damage. Even more striking is the data on new disabilities. Phinance found that from early 2021 through late 2022, about 1.36 million additional Americans (age 16–64) became disabled – a 24.6% rise in disability in that cohort, far above historical trend. This jump in disabilities among the workforce correlates in time with the vaccine rollout (and was disproportionately higher in the labor force than among those not working). The analysts note that the healthiest segment of the population (employed working-age adults) saw a greater relative increase in disabilities after Q1 2021 than the older or non-working groups. This is unusual, since typically health shocks hit the elderly hardest – but here something was impacting younger, healthy people to a significant degree. Phinance investigated further and found a tight relationship between the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered and the rise in disabilities in 2021-22. In fact, for the 16–64 population, they computed a ratio of about 4 new disabilities per excess death in that period, suggesting many survivors were left with lingering health issues even if they didn’t die.

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Wait — Elon Musk just sold X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, to himself? Well, kind of. Musk, in a post on X Friday, said that his artificial-intelligence company, xAI, has acquired X in an all-stock transaction that values X at $33 billion ($45 billion minus $12 billion in debt). The deal gives xAI a valuation of $80 billion, Musk claimed. Musk acquired Twitter in October 2022 for $44 billion and took the company private. What’s going on here? With the sale of X to xAI, Musk is merging the investor base of the social network with that of his AI company (some of which the two companies have in common). Musk had previously said that investors in X Corp. will own 25% of xAI.

Musk, in his post, said that X has more than 600 million active users. “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent,” he wrote. Musk claimed that the combination “will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach. The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge. This will allow us to build a platform that doesn’t just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress.” In addition to his business activities, which include serving as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Musk is the head of President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency.

Rarely if ever have six teams still been in the hunt for play-off places entering the penultimate round of the Energia All-Ireland League Division 1A, but seldom has there been such an unpredictable and competitive top flight. Nowhere are the stakes higher than at Ballymacarn Park where the champions Cork Con go into the last two rounds in third place on 52 points but sit only six points ahead of Ballynahinch in sixth. The home side have Ireland club internationals Conor Rankin, George Pringle, Mark Best and captain Bradley Luney all available, while Conor McKee has been released by Ulster, with Luney moving from 8 to lock. After three successive defeats and a spate of departures, injuries and Leinster absentees, Terenure, in fifth on 48 points and also in must-win mode, host a dangerous Young Munster side at Lakelands Park. After losing outhalf Conor McKeon to a broken leg in last week’s defeat on the Aviva back pitch, Aran Egan shifts to 10 and Adam La Grue to 15, and Terenure do welcome back tow familiar faces in centre Peter Sylvester and winger Caolan Dooley for their first appearances of the season. Sylvester has been living in Miami this season, while Dooley, man of the match when ‘Nure won the final two seasons ago, also went to the US last season and has recovered from a neck injury which required an operation. Lansdowne, the form team in 1A since winning the Bateman Cup in early January, sit fourth on 51 points ahead of their trek to relegation threatened UCD, who are in the relegation play-off spot and trail City of Armagh by two points. Lansdowne are unchanged, while UCD are far from loaded with their Leinster academy players, albeit they do welcome back centre Ben Brownlee, are fighting for their 1A lives and have been something of a bogey side for Lansdowne over the years. Clontarf and St Mary’s, in first and second place on 60 and 58 points, are sitting comparatively pretty. After a highly effective rebuilding job over the last two seasons, a settled and established way of playing which revolves around their power game, Clontarf are guaranteed a semi-final spot, and any kind of win at doomed Garryowen will ensure a home semi-final. True, they are still missing the Soroka brothers, who are with Leinster in South Africa, and Garryowen did end their 14-match losing streak away to City of Armagh last weekend and also welcome back Brian Gleeson. But Connor Fahy is in midfield after his Under-20 Six Nations campaign and it will be a major surprise if Clontarf don’t do enough to earn an advantageous and covetous semi-final at Castle Avenue. In their return to the 1A after a seven-year absence St Mary’s need only a point to ensure their place in the play-offs, and a win against City of Armagh in Templeville Road will also ensure them of a home semi-final. In 1B, Old Wesley and UCC are battling for the last promotion play-off place, while their opponents, Shannon and Highfield, are in a relegation dogfight with Trinity, away to the new champions Old Belvedere.

Title: TRUMP VS GATES: THE VACCINE EMPIRE STRIKEDOWN. U.S. Cuts All Funding to GAVI — The Globalist Health Grid Begins to Collapse

Ready to uncover the truth? Sick of the lies? Join our Telegram Channel now. It’s time for the real story! My gratitude to all my readers! President Trump just cut all U.S. funding to Bill Gates’ vaccine empire, shutting down GAVI — the globalist-controlled alliance tied to the WHO and WEF. Billions in taxpayer dollars are gone. The medical cartel is cracking. This isn’t policy. This is war. What just happened is not a policy change. It’s a decisive blow — one that tears through the polished veneer of globalist power and strikes at the financial heart of a medical empire built on fear, control, and unaccountable influence. President Donald J. Trump has officially halted all U.S. funding to GAVI, the so-called “vaccine alliance” founded, financed, and politically sustained by Bill Gates and his network of unelected elites. For decades, billions in taxpayer dollars have been funneled into this entity under the justification of public health, global cooperation, and humanitarian aid. But in reality, GAVI has operated as a front for pharmaceutical dominance, a gateway for policy manipulation, and a cash pipeline from sovereign governments to supranational interests. By cutting off this flow, Trump has done what no leader before him dared to do: interrupt the cartel’s revenue stream and expose the true nature of its influence. This isn’t just about funding. It’s about declaring open war on the machinery of control that has held the world hostage under the pretense of saving it. RELATED: BOOM: THE BLACKROCK CARTEL — AMERICA’S MEAT, MEDICINE, AND MONEY UNDER MONOPOLY CONTROL! RFK JR. EXPOSES THE TRUTH — IT’S TIME TO BREAK THEM UP GAVI was never merely an organization focused on vaccines. It became a parallel power structure — one that leveraged Bill Gates’ wealth and ideological reach to influence global health policy at a level previously reserved for sovereign states. Operating under the radar, shielded by its “nonprofit” branding and strategic partnerships with institutions like the World Health Organization, World Bank, and World Economic Forum, GAVI was able to dictate medical priorities on a global scale without facing democratic oversight or public accountability. Through GAVI, Gates positioned himself at the center of a technocratic medical web, funding vaccine development, influencing procurement policies, and using global crises — most notably the COVID-19 pandemic — as a launchpad for consolidating power. In this model, governments became financial donors, not decision-makers. National health agendas were quietly replaced by transnational directives, and public dissent was dismissed as ignorance, conspiracy, or outright danger. Now, with Trump’s funding cut, the illusion of consensus has been shattered. For the first time in decades, America is no longer underwriting its own submission to globalist health doctrine. SEE ALSO: Natural Health: Kill Cancer Cells! Dandelion Root Is Able To Kill 98% Of Cancer Cells Within 48 Hours (video) The American public was led to believe their money was saving lives abroad. In truth, it was being used to entrench a system of soft tyranny — one where medical compliance became currency, and dissenting nations or populations were excluded from aid, access, or participation. Over $2.2 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds have flowed into GAVI, supporting not just vaccine distribution, but also the infrastructure of global surveillance, digital health tracking, and corporate-driven medical enforcement. Under the banner of “health equity,” GAVI helped direct pandemic responses that benefited a handful of pharmaceutical giants, all of which maintained financial ties to Gates’ foundations and investment firms. These companies, shielded from liability, were handed blank checks while public health authorities silenced doctors, crushed early treatment alternatives, and replaced scientific debate with manufactured consensus. In short, GAVI became the financial engine of a global health cartel, and the American taxpayer — unknowingly and unwillingly — was footing the bill. That era is now over. Shocking Secret EXPOSED: Ex-Big Pharma Employee Discovers Breakthrough Formula: EAT THIS ONCE A DAY TO LOWER BLOOD SUGAR BELOW 100 ALL DAY Trump’s move to defund GAVI is not an isolated act of rebellion. It’s part of a broader, calculated offensive against the entire transnational framework that seeks to override national sovereignty through backdoor alliances, private governance, and unelected influence. By targeting GAVI, he has chosen to attack the architecture, not just the propaganda. The decision sends a clear message: America will no longer fund institutions that operate outside of its democratic reach, manipulate its internal policies, or push ideological agendas under humanitarian disguise. GAVI, like the WHO and WEF, is only powerful as long as it controls resources and narratives. Trump’s move destabilizes both. The money stops flowing. The illusion of Western unity breaks. And globalist architects are left scrambling for alternative funding and justification. It’s a strategic unraveling — not through confrontation, but through financial starvation. And in a system built entirely on money and perception, that’s more lethal than any speech or sanction. Few figures symbolize technocratic arrogance and unchecked influence like Bill Gates. With no medical degree, no electoral mandate, and no legal obligation to anyone but his own foundation, he managed to transform himself into the world’s de facto vaccine czar. His influence was never earned — it was bought, protected, and platformed by institutions eager to trade independence for funding. Trump’s move punctures that mythology. It reveals just how fragile their empire really is. Gates’ power depends on access to state funding, access to media amplification, and a global stage that treats money as authority. Now, all three are in jeopardy. In the aftermath of the funding cut, GAVI and its network are rushing to downplay the loss, spin the headlines, and reinforce their image — but the wound is open. The credibility of their entire operation is in question, and without America’s blank check, their influence starts to wither. Trump didn’t just defund a global program. He broke the psychological spell that kept millions convinced they had no choice. He exposed the fragile scaffolding behind Gates’ empire, the WHO’s overreach, and the WEF’s fantasy of medical governance through elite consensus. This is not a one-time victory. It’s a strategic model for how to dismantle every cartel pretending to serve the public while feeding on its resources. Whether it’s food, pharma, or finance — the solution is the same:Cut the money. Expose the control. Reclaim the sovereignty. America no longer answers to Geneva.We do not negotiate with billionaires in lab coats.We do not pay to be ruled. Trump just drew the line. And this time, the people are behind it. A newly declassified CIA document reveals that the Ark of the Covenant was discovered in 1988 through a secret psychic intel program called Project Sun Streak. Described exactly as in the Bible—gold, wood, six-winged angel—the artifact was buried in the Middle East and guarded by lethal supernatural forces. The CIA confirmed its existence, classified it, and buried the truth for over 30 years. This isn’t myth. It’s the most powerful religious and political cover-up of our time. The truth was never lost — it was classified. BOOM!

Title: CoinDesk Weekly Recap: Stablecoins, Stablecoins, Stablecoins

It was a bad week for crypto prices, with BTC and ETH both falling and the CoinDesk 20, which covers 80% of the market, losing 7% since Monday. But less speculative assets showed plenty of volume. Stablecoins, in particular, were the name of the game this week. The U.S. House introduced a stablecoin bill, following up on the Senate version that was approved by committee last week. Jesse Hamilton reported. Wyoming (aka “The Blockchain State”) wants its own stablecoin and it’s testing the idea on Avalanche, Solana and Ethereum, Kris Sandor reported. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the financial protocol backed by Donald Trump and his family, confirmed the launch of its stablecoin (USD1) this week. And Don Trump Jr. trumpeted the news at the DC Blockchain Summit. Meanwhile, Fidelity Investment, an early TradFi innovator in crypto, is in the advanced stages of launching its own stablecoin. The venture is part of a strategy to enter the tokenized bond market, Jamie Crawley reported. Meanwhile, Circle, the issuer of the second biggest stablecoin (USDC), has finally secured a license to operate in Japan in partnership with local heavyweight SBI Holdings, Sam Reynolds reported. In news from our Europe team, Ian Allison had a scoop about Sam Altman's World Network holding talks with Visa on linking on-chain card features to a self-custody crypto wallet. Will Canny heard from a source that Sam Hill, Zodia Custody's COO had left and was returning to a role in TradFi. He was able to persuade the Standard Chartered-backed company to confirm the move and we beat the competition with the story. Canny followed up the next day with a story, unreported elsewhere, on the wave of senior staff losses at crypto prime broker FalconX. (BlackRock, by contrast, was adding talent to its digital assets team in the U.S.) We continued to report on Strategy (MicroStrategy), pioneer of the corporate bitcoin treasury. Christine Lee had a two-hour interview with executive chairman Michael Saylor, where he mused about bitcoin as a $200 trillion asset and promised to burn bitcoin in the name of immortality. Strategy has invested about $33 billion in bitcoin so far through various stock offerings, both common and preferred. And James Van Straten explained the differences between the company's fund-raising instruments for bitcoin purchases. Tom Carreras followed up later with a nice piece showing how MSTR stockholders might be at risk from Saylor’s buy-every-bitcoin strategy. Meanwhile, the SEC continued to drop enforcement actions against crypto companies (Immutable was the latest, as Cheyenne Ligon reported). But, strangely, one involving Unicoin stayed open, much to the CEO’s chagrin. It almost felt like a normal sort of week — more incremental than monumental. But then the president’s own media company announced that it was launching its own ETFs and ETPs with Crypto.com. Thankfully, crypto still has the power to surprise. Benjamin Schiller is CoinDesk's managing editor for features and opinion. Previously, he was editor-in-chief at BREAKER Magazine and a staff writer at Fast Company. He holds some ETH, BTC and LINK. Sheldon Reback is CoinDesk editorial's Regional Head of Europe. Before joining the company, he spent 26 years as an editor at Bloomberg News, where he worked on beats as diverse as stock markets and the retail industry as well as covering the dot-com bubble of 2000-2002. He managed the Bloomberg Terminal's main news page and also worked on a global project to produce short, chart-based stories across the newsroom. He previously worked as a journalist for a number of technology magazines in Hong Kong. Sheldon has a degree in industrial chemistry and an MBA. He owns ether and bitcoin below CoinDesk's notifiable limit. About Contact

The 19b-4 form for Grayscale's AVAX ETF follows its registration as a Delaware Trust entity more than two weeks ago. If approved, the AVAX ETF would use Coinbase Custody as its custodian, the 19b-4 shows. The issuer must still file an S-1 registration statement describing the product, however. AVAX, the utility token of Layer-1 blockchain Avalanche, was recently trading at $20.17, down 8% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. The altcoin is the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to the data provider. This latest sign that Grayscale could soon file for a spot AVAX ETF comes less than three weeks after investment firm VanEck also registered for an Avalanche (AVAX) ETF in Delaware. Several asset managers already offer Avalanche ETPs, which provide direct access to the AVAX through regulated exchanges. The application forms part of a broader trend of fund issuers jockeying to introduce altcoin ETFs as federal regulators take a softer stance on crypto-based investment products under newly elected President Donal Trump. The spate of applications also comes after the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year, and as crypto-based exchange-traded products pulled in $44 billion worth of assets in 2024. Grayscale already offers spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to its clients. It has also applied to launch funds based on less traded cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, Solana and Dogecoin. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a conversion from an existing trust, manages nearly $17 billion in assets, the third most among Bitcoin funds behind similar products from BlackRock and Fidelity. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust controls about $2.5 billion in assets. Decrypt reached out to Grayscale for comment on the latest filing.

Title: The Scoop: ChatGPT’s Ghibli-esque images highlight IP risks

Also: Influencer showcase gives creators platform to engage CMOs; return of ‘OG’ Facebook could have major impact on brands. The release of OpenAI’s updated image generation tool has sparked controversy, particularly regarding its ability to replicate the iconic animation style of Studio Ghibli. Shortly after the ChatGPT update on Tuesday, social media users began sharing generated images, ranging from personal photos to violent representations of 9/11, generated in a Ghibli-esque style. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman changed his profile picture on X to a Ghiblified image of himself. While some view the images as a fun social media trend, others have voiced concerns about the ethical implications of AI creating such works. Critics highlighted the issue of intellectual property and the potential for AI to undermine human artists by mimicking distinctive styles. Studio co-founder Hayao Miyazaki has previously expressed disdain for AI, calling it “an insult to life itself” in a documentary, according to The New York Times. This adds to a growing number of creatives – writers, musicians and visual artists – and corporate content creators who’ve condemned AI’s use of unlicensed works to train models. The Times article doesn’t indicate if ChatGPT licensed the artwork to train its LLMs model. In response, OpenAI said their goal was to give users as much creative freedom as possible. “We continue to prevent generations in the style of individual living artists, but we do permit broader studio styles — which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations,” Taya Christianson, a spokesperson for OpenAI, told the Times. Why it matters: The Miyazaki case highlights the critical need for brands to protect their IP – whether it’s photos, videos or written material. Today, AI models, like LLMs, can scoop up almost any content and then turn it into something for others to use unknowingly. While public backlash against this practice is growing, it won’t be enough to shift the balance in favor of creators in a court of law. Brands must take a proactive stance to defend their intellectual property, much like news outlets that have recently taken legal action against AI companies for using their content to train LLMs. For instance, a judge recently allowed The New York Times’ copyright case against OpenAI to proceed. OpenAI argues that replicating content falls under fair use rules, but this legal battle underscores the importance of protecting original work. To safeguard their content, brands should ensure they copyright or trademark their work. This creates a strong legal foundation if someone uses their content without permission. Tracking where and how they create content also helps establish ownership. They should also consider installing access limitations and using encryption to protect content. By adopting proactive strategies, brands can stay ahead of these challenges and be ready if the need for more intense legal recourse arises. As the saying goes: The best defense often starts with a strong offense. Editor’s Top Reads Casey Weldon is a reporter for PR Daily. Follow him on LinkedIn.

Title: A Public Company Boasting Trump's Sons on Advisory Board Is Buying BlackRock Bitcoin ETFs
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/03/28/a-public-company-boasting-trump-s-sons-on-advisory-board-is-buying-blackrock-bitcoin-etfs

Full Content:
An investment firm with ties to U.S. President Donald Trump’s sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., is putting some of its excess cash into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) — an unusual twist on the increasingly popular strategy of holding bitcoin as a corporate reserve. Dominari Holdings (DOMH), located in the Trump Tower in New York City, made headlines last month after the Trump brothers joined its 58-year-old board of advisors and became investors. In an earnings report on Friday, it announced that it would adopt a bitcoin reserve strategy and invest a portion of its cash reserves into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot bitcoin ETF on the market. According to the report, Dominari has committed $2 million to buy shares of IBIT as of now. The stock has a market cap of about $70 million and has fallen more than 9% on Friday's trading. Most companies that adopt a bitcoin reserve strategy buy the cryptocurrency outright and self-custody it or use a custodian. Dominari is instead gaining exposure through a regulated exchange-traded fund, a move that may appeal to firms looking for easier compliance and cleaner accounting. The move isn’t surprising, given Donald Trump Jr.’s interest in crypto. The president’s son is involved in many crypto projects and has become an unofficial spokesperson for his father’s enthusiasm. Just earlier this week, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the financial protocol backed by President Donald Trump and his family, pitched its own stablecoin at a crypto event in Washington.
