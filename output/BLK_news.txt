Bitcoin continues to solidify its status as a strategic reserve asset, with growing institutional adoption fueling its long-term bullish narrative. The latest major endorsement comes from one of the world’s most prestigious universities — Harvard. In a recent SEC filing, it was revealed that Harvard University’s investment portfolio acquired $117 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF by the end of the second quarter of 2025. This move places Harvard among a growing list of influential institutions integrating Bitcoin into their long-term treasury strategies. The BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF, now managing $84 billion in assets under management, has quickly become a dominant vehicle for institutional exposure to BTC. Harvard’s decision highlights a broader shift in capital allocation strategies, where Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and a high-conviction growth asset. Institutional participation at this scale not only boosts market credibility but also reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a core asset in diversified portfolios. According to Harvard University’s recent Form 13F filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), its $117 million position in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF ranks as the institution’s fifth-largest investment. This allocation places Bitcoin just ahead of the university’s holdings in major technology giants such as Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and NVIDIA. At the end of the reporting period, Harvard held nearly $114 million worth of Alphabet stock, underscoring the significance of its Bitcoin exposure within its broader portfolio. The decision to prioritize Bitcoin over some of the most established names in global technology signals a notable shift in institutional thinking. For decades, elite endowments like Harvard’s have been known for their conservative, long-term investment approach, focusing on assets with proven resilience and growth potential. Including Bitcoin at this level shows that the university views the digital asset as not only a speculative opportunity but also as a strategic reserve holding with long-term value. Harvard’s move reflects a growing consensus among leading institutions that BTC is emerging as a core asset for diversification, inflation protection, and asymmetric upside potential. The fact that Bitcoin now sits alongside — and in some cases above — blue-chip equities in major portfolios highlights its evolution from a niche investment to a mainstream financial instrument. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $116,526, consolidating just below the key resistance zone at $122,077. The 3-day chart shows a sustained bullish structure, with price holding well above the 50-day ($101,725) and 100-day ($96,494) moving averages — both trending upward, signaling strong medium-term momentum. After reclaiming the $115,724 support level, BTC has maintained a steady upward bias, suggesting that bulls are still in control despite recent volatility. The consolidation phase just under resistance indicates market indecision, with buyers accumulating strength for a potential breakout. A decisive close above $122,077 could open the path toward retesting the all-time highs and potentially extending into price discovery. Volume remains relatively stable, but a noticeable uptick on breakout attempts would strengthen the bullish case. On the downside, failure to hold $115,724 could trigger a pullback toward the $110K–$112K range, where additional support and the 50-day moving average converge.

Title: BlackRock rules out XRP and SOL ETFs despite Ripple-SEC case closure

Time Published: 2025-08-09T05:19:29Z

Share this article With Ripple closing its long-running legal battle with the SEC, industry analysts anticipate that the resolution will make major fund managers more comfortable offering investment products tied to XRP, Ripple’s native crypto asset. Pro-XRP users, in particular, have been eyeing BlackRock, the asset management giant. But it appears BlackRock has no immediate plans to get on board. A BlackRock spokesperson recently told The Block that spot XRP and Solana (SOL) ETFs are not on the firm’s roadmap for now. The confirmation came shortly after ETF Store President Nate Geraci suggested that BlackRock would eventually enter the XRP ETF market as Ripple and the SEC wrap up their appeals. He said it’s hard to justify ignoring crypto assets apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum, but if BlackRock really stays away from other crypto ETFs, they’re essentially stating that only BTC and ETH are worth investing in. Yes, I think BlackRock was waiting to see this before filing for iShares XRP ETF… I’ll own it if I’m wrong. IMO, makes *zero* sense for them to ignore crypto assets beyond btc & eth. Otherwise, they’re basically saying btc & eth are only ones that will ever have value. Bold. pic.twitter.com/FtBqMRFpOl — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 8, 2025 However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas thinks BlackRock is content with its two existing ETFs, those tied to the two largest crypto assets, and sees diminishing returns in expanding further. I just think they are happy w the two. Law of diminish returns from here on out. But again I’ve nothing to go on but my own spidey sense here. — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 8, 2025 The analyst is also doubtful that BlackRock will file for an index-based crypto ETF, which potentially includes major assets like XRP, later this year. Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, revealed at the Bitcoin 2024 convention that there was ‘very little’ client demand for crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Samara Cohen, BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments, said in an interview with Bloomberg that the firm would not launch a Solana ETF in the near term. “We really look at the investor’s ability to see what meets the criteria, what meets the bar to be delivered in an ETF,” Cohen said. “For us right now, both between [investing] ability considerations and also what we hear from our clients… Bitcoin and Ether definitely meet that bar. I think it will be a while before we see anything else.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Title: A beginner’s guide to orange wine – is it the new rosé?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/drink/2025/08/09/a-beginners-guide-to-orange-wine-is-it-the-new-rose/
Time Published: 2025-08-09T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
Orange wine has been fashionable in wine bars for years and now seems to be taking off elsewhere too. If you are still wondering what it is, think “white wine made like red wine”, as one producer explained it to me. White grapes are crushed and left in contact with the skins, and sometimes pips and stalks too, for a period ranging from hours to days to months. Sometimes called skin contact or amber wine, it was the traditional way to make white wine in many areas before modern technology arrived. It has been made in Georgia and neighbouring Armenia for thousands of years and still is today. More recently it has been revived by winemakers in Slovenia, Friuli and now elsewhere too. In Georgia orange wine is usually macerated, fermented and/or aged in clay amphorae or qvevri, although producers in other countries sometimes use stainless steel or wood. It runs from pale gold to deep brown in colour. Some are a little cloudy, too. Producers are now playing with different hues to create light, fruity summer wines, sometimes called sunset wines because of their pinkish, reddish orange colour. The term can also include rosé and light pale red wines that are served cool. As the juice has been in contact with the skins, orange wines can be lightly tannic, which makes them good with food. They should be served cool or at room temperature rather than chilled as this will highlight the drying tannins in the wine. Provided your fellow wine drinkers like orange wine, it is a great all-purpose party wine that will happily match with all kinds of food, from spicy Indian to grilled red and white meat to salads, pickles and dips. They make nice aperitifs, too: a little bit fruity with a touch of astringency. Fresh and floral with citrus peel, white fruits and a dry, lightly grippy finish. A great introduction to orange wine.

Title: Gold, Frankincense, and Silicon

By John Gruber WorkOS simplifies MCP authorization with a single API built on five OAuth standards. A list of various related news items and clips from this, and recent, weeks: Apple Newsroom, on Wednesday — “Apple Increases U.S. Commitment To $600 Billion, Announces American Manufacturing Program”: Apple today announced a new $100 billion commitment to America, a significant acceleration of its U.S. investment that now totals $600 billion over the next four years. Today’s announcement includes the ambitious new American Manufacturing Program (AMP), dedicated to bringing even more of Apple’s supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S. Through AMP, Apple will increase its investment across America and incentivize global companies to manufacture even more critical components in the United States. Separately, also from Apple Newsroom Wednesday — “Apple and Corning Partner to Manufacture 100 Percent of iPhone and Apple Watch Cover Glass in Kentucky”: Apple and Corning today announced a major expansion of their long-standing partnership to make precision glass for Apple products. Apple is making a new $2.5 billion commitment to produce all of the cover glass for iPhone and Apple Watch in Corning’s Harrodsburg, Kentucky, manufacturing facility. This means that 100 percent of the cover glass on iPhone and Apple Watch units sold worldwide will be made in the U.S. for the first time. Corning is creating the world’s largest and most advanced smartphone glass production line at the Harrodsburg facility. Corning will now dedicate this entire facility to manufacturing for Apple, which will help increase Corning’s manufacturing and engineering workforce in Kentucky by 50 percent. From inside the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon, a 3.5-minute video of Trump’s introductory remarks, then Tim Cook giving Trump a trophy of sorts, with an Apple-logo top made from glass produced at the Corning facility in Kentucky, and a base made from 24-karat gold (perhaps left over from Apple’s decade ago foray into $20,000 “Edition” Apple Watches?). This video is one of the most pathetic things I’ve ever witnessed, for everyone involved. (Note Cook’s awkward laughter when Trump, after claiming that “about $17 trillion is coming into the United States” thanks to the brilliance of his economic statecraft, quips “That’s even a lot of money for you”, looking at Cook.) From the same press event in the Oval Office, a 5-minute video of Cook’s benign but obsequious prepared remarks. Apple’s stock, as I type this after the close of markets on Friday, is up 11.6 percent for the week, and jumped over 5 percent immediately after Wednesday’s announcements. Tripp Mickle, reporting for The New York Times back on May 26, under the headline “Tech’s Trump Whisperer, Tim Cook, Goes Quiet as His Influence Fades”: In the run-up to President Trump’s recent trip to the Middle East, the White House encouraged chief executives and representatives of many U.S. companies to join him. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, declined, said two people familiar with the decision. The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump. As he hopscotched from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Trump took a number of shots at Mr. Cook. During his speech in Riyadh, Mr. Trump paused to praise Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, for traveling to the Middle East along with the White House delegation. Then he knocked Mr. Cook. “I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Huang at an event attended by chief executives like Larry Fink of the asset manager BlackRock, Sam Altman of OpenAI, Jane Fraser of Citigroup and Lisa Su of the semiconductor company AMD. Later in Qatar, Mr. Trump said he “had a little problem with Tim Cook.” The president praised Apple’s investment in the United States, then said he had told Mr. Cook, “But now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.” On Friday morning, Mr. Trump caught much of his own administration and Apple’s leadership off guard with a social media post threatening tariffs of 25 percent on iPhones made anywhere except the United States. The post thrust Apple back into the administration’s cross hairs a little over a month after Mr. Cook had lobbied and won an exemption from a 145 percent tariff on iPhones assembled in China and sold in the United States. April 2018: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Tim Cook in Cupertino, including a tour of Apple Park. From a Kif Leswing report for Business Insider regarding the tour: The young prince, often referred to as MBS, was on a charm offensive, according to The New York Times. His goal was to change the Western perspective of Saudi Arabia as a conservative country dependent on oil money where women are treated as second-class people. Instead, Prince Mohammed wants Americans to see Saudi Arabia as a modern country with extensive investments in growth markets like technology. October 2018: Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and public critic of the Saudi regime, was brutally assassinated — literally chopped to pieces — inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Within weeks, the CIA concluded that Mohammed bin Salman had ordered the assassination. Tim Cook has not met with MBS since. President Trump, at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in May — one stop among several on the Middle East tour, which, per point #6 above, Tim Cook declined to attend — was effusive in his praise and admiration for bin Salman. Per ABC News: President Donald Trump spent the bulk of what was billed as a “major foreign policy address” to outline his vision for the Middle East instead touting his domestic policies and heaping praise on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman while speaking at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum on Tuesday. Four years after the U.S. intelligence community report was released that concluded that the crown prince approved the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump lauded the crown prince for his leadership and friendship. “He’s your greatest representative, greatest representative. And if I didn’t like him, I’d get out of here so fast. You know that, don’t you? He knows me well. I do — I like him a lot. I like him too much. That’s why we give so much, you know? Too much. I like you too much,” Trump said while speaking in Saudi Arabia. Trump, this week, at the White House event with Tim Cook, per CNBC: “We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon. “But the good news for companies like Apple is if you’re building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge. So in other words, we’ll be putting a tariff on of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.” [...] But specifics about the plan, such as how much U.S. manufacturing a company needs to do in order to qualify for the tariff exemption, were not immediately clear. There is, of course, no need to wait for “specifics about the plan”, which almost certainly won’t ever be put in writing. We all know how to qualify for an exemption — it’s up to the whims of Trump. Thumbs up, you’re exempt. Thumbs down, you pay. So, what to make of Cook’s obsequious praise for Trump and gifting of an Apple-branded gold trophy? Your take may well be that Cook is simply now a Trump supporter. Or, your take may be that eating a big shit sandwich like this, right in the Oval Office, is simply what Cook “has to do”. My take remains somewhere in the middle, but closer to the latter than the former. Did Cook have to do this? No. Could the announcement that Apple was accelerating its investment plans for US manufacturing from $500 billion to $600 billion simply have been made via a press release on Apple Newsroom, rather than a made-for-TV press event in the Oval Office? Yes.1 But Cook, and Apple, need to pick their battles. To me, what’s obvious is the power dynamic. We’re not used to considering Apple, a $3 trillion company, as subservient in any relationship. But the US federal government dwarfs even the biggest of companies, and Trump is wielding the powers of the executive branch and the bully pulpit of the presidency in unprecedented ways. Flagrantly illegal and unethical ways, but nonetheless, he’s wielding those powers. No company, no matter how big, can stand as a check or balance to that power. It’s not even a case of “kiss the ring and receive preferential treatment”. It’s more a case of “kiss his ass or else you’ll face punishment”. Trump, like a perverted Santa Claus, keeps only two lists: naughty and nice. Cook and Apple got a taste of that after Cook declined to participate in Trump’s Middle East tour, leading Trump to reflexively declare new tariffs on iPhones assembled in India. Trump offered another taste when he announced this week, with Tim Cook in the room, the supposed 100 percent tariffs on computer chips for companies who aren’t playing ball. (I say supposed because the TACO hypothesis, thus far, has panned out.) Faulting Cook for playing ball and kissing Trump’s ring (among other things) is like faulting a local business for paying into a protection racket — one in which the cops are complicit, and the whole scam exists at the behest of a crooked mayor. Moral rectitude can feel good, but not so much when the cops are burning your store to the ground. There is no authority to appeal to for help when the highest office in the country is running the protection racket. I don’t know what would happen to Apple if they simply refused to play ball with any of this at all. Targeted spiteful tariffs, bogus investigations by the Justice Department, personal vilification in MAGA media. Could Apple weather such a storm, financially, with its head held high? Probably. But to what effect? It wouldn’t change the game. The game is currently shamelessly corrupted. Did Cook’s Oval Office display of fealty and his grotesque golden gift make you feel something? Did it engender an emotional response? Grossed out, perhaps? A little sick? Angry? Offended? Me too. But did you feel good — reassured? proud? — when Cook skipped that Middle East Trump tour in May? You know, the one that ranged from Trump singing the praises of the murderous Mohammed bin Salman (“I like you too much”) to accepting as a gift (that he claims will wind up in the possession of his post-presidential “library”) a 747 luxury jet from Qatar. If you choose to believe that Tim Cook is weak, unethical, greedy, or even — despite his long-professed heroes — secretly a MAGA supporter, there’s likely nothing I can say to disabuse you of the notion. You can’t prove a negative. But I would argue that that line of cynicism is the easy way out. That you’re taking comfort in directing your ire at Cook, and the notion that if Cook had more backbone he’d refuse to play this game. It’s comforting to believe it’s him and his ilk, greedy selfish billionaires, not us as a collective whole. It is disturbing to think that the leader of a beloved, trusted, and widely believed-to-be-ethical company like Apple has succumbed to avarice. That Tim Cook feels no qualms about — or perhaps even delights in — participating in a quid-pro-quo-driven corrupt administration in which flattery, fealty, gifts, and barely-concealed bribes are rewarded. That the United States devolving into kleptocracy suits Tim Cook just fine, because Apple’s pockets are deep enough to pay the vig. But the alternative is more disturbing. What if Tim Cook is, in fact, strong, proud, and driven by a keen sense of moral and ethical clarity? Perhaps Cook declined Trump’s invitation to join his Middle East entourage in May only because he was otherwise busy. But I believe there are bridges he will not cross — and that trip, especially its implicit and explicit praise and sanctification of the Saudi regime in general, and MBS in particular, was one of them. The whole trip was grotesque, and made a mockery of traditional American values. US manufacturing, on the other hand, is a point of genuine alignment between Trump’s desires and Apple’s interests and ethics. Emphasizing that alignment in an Oval Office event, solid gold trophy in hand, is gross, yes, but not at all a corruption of anything Cook believes to be in the genuine interests of Apple or the nation. Consider the possibility that, far from being comfortable with his gift and obsequious ring-kissing this week, Cook was as discomfited by it as anyone. That he is keenly aware that trust and reputation are only accrued slowly, but are always at risk of being squandered quickly, and that this applies both to how he is perceived personally and how Apple is perceived as an institution — a pillar of American ingenuity and industry. His life’s work. And that despite all of that, Cook concluded that debasing himself, selling some shares of his own dignity, was the best course of action — for Apple, for Apple’s customers (and, yes, shareholders), and perhaps even for the country. That ruthless practicality is necessary merely to stay afloat in a sea of abject graft, extortion, and cronyism. That’s dark. That requires considering that the problem isn’t the greed of a few billionaires and executives who ought to resist burgeoning corruption, but that Trump and his sycophants in the Republican Party have already succeeded in corrupting the system. That the corruption isn’t happening, but happened. The United States isn’t heading for existential trouble. We’re in it — and a pathway out is not yet clear. That’s not to say all is forever lost, but that we are, in our current political moment, beyond the point where the game can be played successfully on the level. You can choose to play a crooked game straight, but you can’t win. Business is competition. A loser who played above reproach is still a loser. You need to choose your battles. US manufacturing is Cook’s choice. The White House has long been called the People’s House. The embarrassment of this week’s Oval Office bending of the knee isn’t Cook’s or Apple’s alone. It’s an embarrassment for our entire nation. It’s not him. It’s not them. It’s us. Also worth noting: Apple’s investment plan for US manufacturing is largely in line with their $430 billion plan four years ago at the outset of the Biden administration, and is likely what they’d be committing under a hypothetical Harris administration or second Biden term. Apple’s strategy hasn’t wavered on this front; only the fanfare has. ↩︎ Display Preferences Copyright © 2002–2025 The Daring Fireball Company LLC.

The Harvard Management Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the university, has a $116 million position in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, a 13F form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows. Not one to be left out, Brown University—which first bought exposure to Bitcoin in May—upped its position in BlackRock's ETF and now holds $13 million worth of shares, a similar filing shows. Neither Brown nor Harvard immediately responded to Decrypt's request for comment. The filings are the latest examples of traditional institutions seeking exposure to the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Crypto ETFs like BlackRock's Bitcoin Trust—which trades as IBIT—allow investors to buy exposure to the leading cryptocurrency without having to own and store the digital coin directly. BlackRock’s IBIT is the most successful crypto ETF: The fund has received more cash than any other crypto ETF and currently has $86.3 billion in assets under management. Other major institutions have bought exposure to Bitcoin, once an arcane and obscure asset, since the January 2024 approval of the ETFs. A flood of capital has entered the crypto space since the funds started trading, with investors previously too intimidated by things like storing digital coins in crypto wallets now able to easily buy a position. Pension funds and U.S. states have all bought exposure to Bitcoin via the ETFs over the past year, along with more traditional investments like tech stocks and other U.S. equities.

August 08, 2025 16:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Aug. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future” or the “Company”) today announced that it plans to hold a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the “EGM”) on September 19, to seek approval for proposals aimed at supporting the Company’s strategic initiatives and long-term growth. The Company urges all stockholders to vote FOR all proposals. Proposal Highlights： 1. Share Authorization ProposalApproval of an amendment to the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Charter”) to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock by 65,225,672, from 167,245,313 to 232,470,985, representing a 39% increase, and increase the number of authorized shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock, by 5,031,000 shares, from 12,900,000 to 17,931,000, so that the total number of authorized shares, including Common Stock and Preferred Stock, will increase from 180,145,313 shares to 250,401,985 shares. The proposal does not affect the current number of outstanding shares but reflects the Company’s continued adherence to a prudent, disciplined, and relatively low-percentage new share issuance strategy. Having additional authorized shares of Class A Common Stock will help the Company meet its existing obligations including the recent $105 Million financing commitment and be well-positioned to pursue future opportunities, including capital raises, acquisitions, stock dividends or splits, stock issuances under employee benefit plans, and other proper corporate purposes. This increased share capacity is also critical to funding the Company’s ongoing operations and executing its business strategy and facilitate the rapid execution of the Second Chapter of the Bridge Strategy, in alignment with its long-term vision of becoming a leader in the AI-driven EV era and demonstrating the Company’s dedication to putting stockholders first. 2. Private Placement ProposalApproval of the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock to holders of certain convertible notes and warrants in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d). This measure ensures compliance with regulatory requirements while enabling the Company to honor its obligations to holders of certain of the Company’s convertible notes and common warrants, which is crucial for the Company to obtain funds to support the production of vehicles in the future. 3. Name Change ProposalApproval of an amendment to the Company’s Charter to change the Company’s name from “Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc.” to “Faraday Future AI Electric Vehicle Inc.” The new name aligns with the Company’s vision to lead the intelligent electric vehicle (EV) industry and highlights its commitment to innovation in AI-driven solutions and smart transportation ecosystems. Additionally, the new name aligns with the Company’s new ticker symbol, FFAI, reinforcing a unified brand identity. 4. Amended 2021 Plan ProposalApproval of an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of Class A Common Stock available for issuance under the 2021 Plan by an additional 9,500,000 shares. The proposed amendment is intended to ensure the Company can continue offering long-term equity incentives as a competitive alternative to cash compensation. This change is critical to attracting, motivating, and retaining top talent, which is essential for executing our business strategy and driving long-term stockholder value. 5. Adjournment Proposal Approval of one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting by the Company from time to time to permit further solicitation of proxies, if necessary or appropriate, if sufficient votes are not represented at the Special Meeting to approve one or more Proposals at the time of such adjournment or if otherwise determined by the chairperson of the Special Meeting to be necessary or appropriate. Recent Key Business Progress with Continued Stockholder Support Powered by ongoing stockholders' backing, our Bridge Strategy has driven comprehensive progress, strengthening both operational and capital fundamentals: "Our Bridge Strategy continues to attract global users, investors, and partners. FF's dual improvements in operational and capital fundamentals are directly attributable to stockholders' long-standing support," YT Jia, Founder and Co-CEO of FF, said. "We're now in the final phase before the year-end rollout of the first FX Super One vehicle in the U.S. market, while simultaneously implementing a major upgrade to our Bridge Strategy that positions FF for accelerated growth. At this critical moment, we've submitted key proposals to advance our business. We urge stockholders to vote FOR all proposals – your decision will determine the company's future!"

Title: AI neo-colonialism: How Big Tech is strip-mining the Global South for data

By Dr. Mathew Maavak, who researches systems science, global risks, geopolitics, strategic foresight, governance and Artificial Intelligence By Dr. Mathew Maavak, who researches systems science, global risks, geopolitics, strategic foresight, governance and Artificial Intelligence The new colonial frontier isn’t restricted to mineral-rich Congo or oil-drenched Venezuela. It’s digital, invisible, and everywhere. From the shantytowns of Nairobi to the barrios of Manila, smartphones hum with the raw material of the 21st century: data, all sorts of data. And just like spices and slaves once sailed westward in imperial galleons, metadata now travels quietly to the cloud servers of Palo Alto and Shenzhen. This isn’t development, it is digital extraction. Welcome to the age of AI colonialism. Big Tech firms from the US, and to a lesser extent China, have turned the Global South into a massive open-pit mine for behavioral data. Under the pretense of “AI for Development,” they build infrastructure, donate connectivity, and sponsor pilot programs but the returns flow in only one direction. Voice samples collected in Ghana become training fodder for Western voice assistants. Facial data gathered in Nigerian policing trials end up fine-tuning surveillance software in San Francisco, where western models have had protracted problems in identifying and tracking darker-skinned individuals. Agricultural data scraped from Filipino farmers help power predictive analytics for agribusiness conglomerates that will hardly benefit the Philippines. This is not a partnership. This is colonial pillage dressed in TED Talk lingo. AI is marketed as a miracle equalizer that will help developing nations leapfrog into the future. We were told AI would bring precision agriculture, predictive healthcare, and smart urbanism, among numerous other utopian transformations, to even the most under-resourced regions. These Davos fantasies were regurgitated for nearly two decades. But where is the proof, the showcase project or evidence that even a fraction of those promises was delivered? The only real revolution happening is the outflow of data that were supposed to power these breakthroughs. Big Tech servers abroad now function like the colonial warehouses and banks of yore. Nor are intellectual properties of individuals and SMEs in the Developing World safe from this new brand of predation. Models, patents, ideas, and profits quietly migrate north while the Global South is left with nothing but pilot programs and PowerPoint decks. Worse still, these tools are increasingly used against the very populations providing the raw material, or should I say, raw data. In Kenya, facial recognition technology was introduced as a policing tool under the guise of modernization. In practice, it has disproportionately targeted political activists who, in turn, are also resorting to AI to level the political battlefield. Who ultimately benefits from this internecine clash? Isn’t this the latest incarnation of the old imperial “divide and conquer” dictum? In India, AI-driven fraud detection systems have misclassified thousands of rural poor, unjustly cutting them off from vital government benefits. Imported algorithmic governance – often designed without regard for local context or cultural nuance – compounds the problem. Ironically, while these systems penalize the most vulnerable, India has emerged as a global hub for sophisticated online scams. It is a digital paradox where the poor are relentlessly surveilled, while the real fraudsters flourish with impunity. Nothing exemplifies AI colonialism better than the biometric boom. Tech firms, often in partnership with NGOs or global financial institutions, are racing to digitize identities across the Global South. Fingerprint scans, iris recognition, voiceprint registration have all been justified as ways to “include the unbanked” or “streamline public services.” But these efforts rarely include meaningful consent or data protection frameworks. In many cases, biometric systems have been imposed without community consultation or independent oversight. One of the most egregious examples is Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project that offered small payments in exchange for biometric iris scans. Its largest user base? Young people in low-income African nations like Kenya who served as a convenient population to experiment on, far from the regulatory spotlights of Brussels or Washington. (Note; Worldcoin was co-founded by Sam Altman, who is also the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, which owns ChatGPT). Once collected, this data becomes part of opaque and often proprietary AI systems whose inner workings are unknowable to the very people they affect. Local regulators are usually outgunned, underfunded or more likely, politically compromised. As a result, entire populations are subjected to surveillance and scoring regimes that they neither understand nor control. The worst culprits in this saga are not Big Tech but local politicians and “technocrats” who sell out their nations at bargain basement prices, couched under the double-speak of “best practices” and UN institutional recommendations. Silicon Valley is the global epicenter of thenew East India Companies. These entities are vested with quasi-sovereign power and backed by vast capital reserves, lobbying muscle, and a veneer of corporate benevolence. Where the original East India Company extracted tea and textiles, today’s digital extractors siphon up location metadata, online behavior, biometric identifiers, and social graph mappings. Consider Meta’s “Free Basics” initiative, which offered zero-rated internet access in dozens of developing countries. What seemed like a humanitarian gesture was, in reality, an attempt to create a captive ecosystem – one where Facebook was the internet. It was banned in India in 2016 but continues in other countries, quietly conditioning the digital habits of hundreds of millions of users. An expanded Meta Connectivity is now used by an estimated 300 million people across many countries, including Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. Critics warn that these platforms could be exploited for surveillance, IP harvesting, and geopolitical intelligence – often without the knowledge or consent of local populations. No one really knows what is happening. Besides, these services are not entirely free either. Pakistani users of Meta’s tech philanthropy were allegedly charged $1.9 million per month. India, once hailed as a rising digital superpower, now serves as a showpiece for AI neo-colonialism. Its vast IT industry, once brimming with promise, is today little more than an outsourced arm of Western conglomerates. Here is a reality check: how many individuals outside India have even one Indian-made app on their phones? There was a brief window when Indian tech seemed poised to lead. In the late ’90s, a major US tech firm allegedly commissioned two parallel teams – one in Silicon Valley, the other in an Indian city – to build a next-generation operating system to challenge Microsoft. The Indian team delivered. The US team could not. Around the same time, Indian innovators like Sabeer Bhatia gave us Hotmail, which arguably accelerated the decline of the traditional postal system. For a brief moment, the digital future seemed multipolar. That was until Big Capital arrived. Rather than reward innovation, Big Tech consolidated. Rival platforms that didn’t serve the globalist surveillance machine were quietly buried. Competition was replaced with shareholder-sanctioned “coordination,” led by the likes of BlackRock and its predecessors. From that point on, Indian IT firms would be reduced from potential innovators to mere subcontractors. And who better to manage this global digital plantation than a new class of compliant Indian C-Suite executives? These are not the disruptors. They are the taskmasters of digital “kanganis,” running the same extractive labor models once perfected by the East India Company. The dream of an “Asian Century” powered by Indian software and Chinese hardware has curdled into a reality of Chinese software, Chinese hardware, and Chinese AI. Indian tech talent has been reduced to glorified middleware, at best. For all the online chest-thumping about Indian-origin CEOs in the US, where is India’s own Jensen Huang? Where is the Indian-founded equivalent of NVIDIA, OpenAI, or even Palantir? There isn’t one. India produces engineers by the millions but owns almost none of the gilt-edged platforms. It trains the talent, but not the trillion-dollar tech. The colony codes and the empire profits. A similar theme is being played out in the US Ivy League system. But is the tide turning? Nigeria has applied brakes on foreign-backed digital ID programs. Kenya has suspended iris-scanning initiatives after massive backlash. A growing chorus of activists, lawyers, and technologists are calling for data sovereignty: the idea that countries should have the same rights over their data that they claim over oil, water, and land. A few pioneering efforts have emerged. In Brazil, the General Data Protection Law has begun to shape public discourse. In South Africa, local AI research groups are working on open, transparent models rooted in African languages and cultural norms. The African Union has even begun early-stage deliberations on a continental data governance framework. But it is an uphill fight. Western governments, in tandem with corporate lobbyists, continue to push for “data liberalization” which is nothing but a euphemism for open access-mediated exploitation. Aid packages, development grants, and tech investments are increasingly tied to these demands. It echoes the structural adjustment programs of the 1980s, where loans came with strings that hollowed out national control. Only now, the strings are coded in algorithms. The Global South needs a coordinated pushback against Silicon Valley’s digital hegemony. This would involve not just resisting predatory data practices but investment in alternative infrastructures such as sovereign cloud storage, ethical AI standards, community-owned data cooperatives, and open-source platforms. This is how a new digital non-alignment paradigm can be achieved. The Global South has been colonized before. But data, unlike oil or sugar, is invisible, infinitely replicable, and easily stolen.

Title: Trump Signs Executive Order to Allow Crypto into 401(k)

US President Donald Trump has signed a new executive order into effect that will allow American 401(ks) to invest in digital assets and related financial instruments. This could be a massive move for the entire digital currency market, as 401(k)s, also known as retirement funds, collectively hold a massive $6.12 trillion in assets and could invest significantly in them. However, the new presidential proclamation isn’t crypto-specific but a massive overhaul of retirement plan options available to American residents. It includes private equity, real estate, and other alternative investments as well. The move has opened the way for asset managers to tap into trillions of dollars worth of potential investments. According to the wording of the executive order: “My Administration will relieve the regulatory burdens and litigation risk that impede American workers’ retirement accounts from achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement”. The document then tasks the Labor Secretary and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement this directive and make it easier for Americans to invest in these disruptive assets. It also asked federal agencies to ensure clarity in the current rules to facilitate the ownership of these assets, but stopped short of asking for specific actions in this regard. Executive orders are one of the primary tools at the disposal of the President’s office in the USA. However, they can be challenged in courts, and the latter have a long precedent of delaying and even striking down orders that don’t line up with the constitution or established precedents. The US pensions market is set to reach a whopping $10 trillion by 2030 with an annual CGR of 9%. The Trump executive order is a major deal for crypto investors in the USA, as previously, federal agencies and executive authority had heavily discouraged crypto in retirement accounts. The move was particularly welcomed by elite asset managers like BlackRock, which was reportedly behind the lobbying of this particular use of presidential power by President Trump. Users on X (formerly Twitter) also chipped in immediately, with one analyst commenting: According to Blackrock’s senior retirement asset manager, Jaime Magyera: “Expanding access to investments long out of reach will help ensure millions of Americans build stronger, more diversified portfolios designed to increase savings and address the practical considerations of DC plan fiduciaries,” The move follows years of lobbying by crypto users and asset managers to improve the process of including crypto in 401(ks). It remains to be seen just how much of a major impact it will have on Bitcoin’s price index, which is currently trading around the $117,000 valuation.

With Ethereum surpassing $4,000, prediction platforms see a bullish sentiment, forecasting potential price targets up to $60,000. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum (ETH) surged past the $4,000 mark on Aug. 8, hitting its highest level this year after a sustained market rally that saw it gain nearly 50% in the past month. Data from CryptoSlate shows the asset peaked at $4,047 during US trading hours. Notably, the last time ETH traded above $4,000 was in December 2024, when optimism around Donald Trump’s election victory fueled a wave of pro-crypto sentiment in the US. Meanwhile, CoinGlass data reveals the latest rally caught bearish traders off guard. Short positions against ETH suffered losses totaling $134 million in the past 24 hours as prices defied expectations. Ethereum’s breakout comes amid a surge in institutional interest in the digital asset for their treasury reserves. Over the past month, major firms such as SharpLink and BitMine have accumulated significant ETH holdings and announced multi-billion-dollar purchase plans. According to Strategic ETH Reserve data, these entities collectively hold over 3 million ETH—about 2.5% of the total supply—valued at more than $12 billion. BitMine leads with 833,100 ETH, worth approximately $5.2 billion. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has expressed a cautious optimism regarding the increasing corporate interest in ETH. While he welcomed the adoption, Buterin cautioned firms against overleveraging their ETH holdings. According to Buterin: “If you woke me up 3 years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH… my guess would be that they turned into an overleveraged game.” In addition to these firms, the Ethereum network has also seen a surge in adoption via exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with a record $5 billion in inflows recorded in July. According to SoSo Value data, the trend has continued into the new month, with the nine funds registering just two days of outflows in August compared to four days of outflows experienced by their Bitcoin counterparts. Additionally, traditional financial powerhouses like BlackRock and Robinhood have expanded their activities around Ethereum, focusing on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Looking ahead, market optimism continues to rise along with expectations of Ethereum’s continued price growth. Crypto bettors on Polymarket, the leading decentralized prediction platform, believe there is a 60% chance that ETH will exceed $5,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, 36% of traders believe it could reach $6,000, and 24% predict a rise to $7,000. Notably, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is more bullish about Ethereum’s price hitting $10,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, BitMine’s projections suggest a much higher potential, estimating ETH’s implied price at $60,000. At the time of press 8:22 pm UTC on Aug. 8, 2025, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is up 5.63% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum has a market capitalization of $488.37 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of $46.05 billion.

Title: Meta’s $29 Billion Deal Marks Pivotal Moment for Private Credit

(Bloomberg) -- The heavy hitters of private credit have been waiting for this moment for years. Major lenders, which often cater to companies with dented credit, talk endlessly about the opportunities in investment-grade debt and in financing the breakneck growth of artificial intelligence. They’ve done smaller deals, but this week they caught the biggest fish yet: a $29 billion financing package for Meta Platforms Inc.’s massive data center in Louisiana. That transaction, led by Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc., hits all the high notes: It’s a top-notch business in a hot sector. It disrupts the usual route that companies like Meta travel to get money from investors through banks. And, it’s huge. “Private credit has been itching to get into this space,” said John Medina, senior vice president on the global project and infrastructure finance team at Moody’s Ratings. “This deal is one of the first of its kind for private credit and if it is successful, we would expect to see more.” The biggest technology companies are in an AI arms race now, and they need cash to win. Elon Musk’s xAI Corp. recently told investors it plans to spend $18 billion on data centers, and is looking at raising debt backed by projects rather than at the corporate level. Others including Amazon.com Inc. and OpenAI Inc. are pursuing their own sites across the US. Morgan Stanley estimates that capital expenditures on AI could exceed $3 trillion in the next three years. For Meta, Pimco is planning to arrange $26 billion in debt and Blue Owl is providing $3 billion in equity. The debt portion is likely to be issued in the form of investment-grade bonds backed by the data center’s assets, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the final structure is still in flux. The bidding war for the financing lasted months. It was competitive because private credit firms have been all-but-begging for access to the investment-grade debt world that banks dominate. Other private credit firms that grappled for the top spot include Apollo Global Management Inc. and KKR & Co., which made it to the final round, as well as Brookfield Asset Management Ltd., Blackstone Inc. and Ares Management Corp., said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Morgan Stanley advised Meta on the deal but isn’t leading the financing. It is the largest funding package related to a specific AI data center by a mile, with others involving xAI Corp. or Coreweave Inc. well below $10 billion. Microsoft Inc., BlackRock Inc. and the United Arab Emirates’ MGX investment vehicle are teaming up to raise $30 billion of private equity that can be leveraged to $100 billion, with Nvidia Corp. and xAI also joining in, but that money is for a series of data warehouses and energy infrastructure rather than an individual project. The most recent debt deal of any kind that’s even near the size of Meta’s was a $26 billion bond sale to support Mars Inc.’s purchase of rival food-maker Kellanova in March. A group of banks put together the financing, which was funneled through to their typical investors in the syndicated market. Dry Powder Private credit firms have about $450 billion of dry powder to invest, according to Preqin data, and are clamoring for this kind of business. The corporate acquisitions that often fuel private credit deals are practically at a standstill. And these firms aspire to more fully become rivals to traditional Wall Street banks — handling everything from advising companies to structuring their debt to providing some of it themselves. Expanding further into investment-grade deals could help make private credit a $40 trillion market, according to an estimate from Apollo. “This ecosystem of private investment-grade is a massive market with a huge tailwind,” Michael Zawadzki, the global chief investment officer at Blackstone’s credit and insurance unit, said last year. Representatives for Apollo, Meta, Pimco, Blue Owl, Brookfield, Blackstone, Ares and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Those for KKR and xAI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. KKR and Energy Capital Partners last year agreed to a $50 billion partnership to accelerate the development of infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Blue Owl CEO Marc Lipschultz has compared the AI craze to the Gold Rush: though lenders aren’t out there digging for treasure, they can provide the “picks and shovels” that technology firms need. “In this case, it takes the modern version, the data centers,” he said during a conference call on July 31. “And we are the best placed firm to help develop and to help fund those data centers.” --With assistance from Laura Benitez and Kurt Wagner.

Title: Ken Paxton Took Victory Lap Suing Woke ‘Cartel’ He Quietly Invests Fortune In

Time Published: 2025-08-08T16:37:26Z

Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is taking a victory lap for spearheading a multi-state lawsuit taking on the world’s largest asset managers, but is quietly sitting upon thousands of shares of mutual funds managed by one of the targets of his complaint, according to recent financial disclosures. Paxton cheered a Texas judge’s ruling on Aug. 1 denying a petition from the investment juggernauts — BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard — to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the attorney general and ten other Republican states. Though Paxton had then cast Vanguard as part of an “investment cartel” who works to “squeeze more money out of everyday Americans,” his holdings in five Vanguard mutual funds have largely flown under the radar. (RELATED: Trump Admin Backs Red States’ Antitrust Suit Against Financial Titans To ‘Protect Coal’) “I just secured a major win against Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street,” Paxton wrote in an Aug. 1 post to the social media platform X — after a judge green-lit his antitrust lawsuit, arguing the money managers illegally conspired to slash coal production under the guise of a left-wing climate agenda. “These financial corporations created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets, and today’s victory represents an important step in holding them accountable.” Paxton is running to unseat Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn in a primary contest that is shaping up to be one of the most brutal races of the midterms. Though Paxton has taken an early lead in polling, Cornyn — with the backing of Senate Republicans’ campaign arm and several outside spending groups — is mounting a concerted effort to close the gap. President Donald Trump, who said in April that he likes both candidates, has not yet issued an endorsement. The attorney general submitted a personal financial disclosure for his Senate run on June 16 — reporting thousands of shares in six Vanguard mutual funds valued between $1.6 million and $6.25 million. The amounts on financial disclosure forms are reported in ranges making Paxton’s net worth derived from the Vanguard shares difficult to pin down. Cornyn’s backers are criticizing Paxton’s investment holdings in Vanguard funds, noting the attorney general has repeatedly slammed the investment firm for allegedly bleeding Texans’ pocketbooks dry by illegally conspiring to drive up energy prices. “The fact that Paxton profits off the very practices he condemns shows he’s more interested in personal gain over principled leadership,” pro-Cornyn super PAC Texans for a Conservative Majority executive director Aaron Whitehead told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “If he truly believes this firm is hurting Texans why is he investing his personal money with them?” WASHINGTON, DC – AUGUST 01: Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) (L) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) speak in the hallway between votes at the U.S. Capitol on August 01, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) “You can always count on Crooked Ken Paxton to act unethically, dishonestly and selfishly, as he has done here. Texans can’t trust Ken Paxton, something he proves on a daily basis,” Cornyn campaign senior adviser Matt Mackowiak told the DCNF. Paxton’s investments in Vanguard, a pioneer of ultra-low cost investing, are a mixed bag of passively managed index funds and actively managed portfolios. He reported holding between 3,100 and 12,495 shares spread across five Vanguard mutual funds, according to a financial statement filed with the Texas Ethics Commission in June for the 2024 calendar year. Paxton has invested between $1 million and $5 million in Vanguard’s Institutional Index Fund (VIIIX), representing the largest investment holding on his Senate financial disclosure form. The low-cost index fund is passively managed by the firm and tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index, which seeks to mirror the performance of the nation’s largest stocks. The attorney general has also invested between $100,000 and $250,000 in Vanguard’s Primecap Fund (VPMCX), an actively managed “large-growth” fund offered by the firm, which touts outperforming the S&P 500 by an average of 2% annually. An additional Vanguard fund listed on Paxton’s disclosure is held by his wife, Texas State Senator Angela Paxton. She has invested between $50,000 and $100,000 in a Vanguard index fund that matches the performance of the overall stock market, according to Paxton’s Senate financial disclosure forms. Angela Paxton filed for divorce in July after 38 years of marriage, citing “biblical grounds.” Spokespersons for Paxton did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment. “I will continue fighting to protect Texas and defend America’s energy independence from this unlawful conspiracy,” Paxton said regarding his lawsuit against Vanguard and other asset managers on Aug 1.

Title: XRP gains legal clarity in US after Ripple settles SEC case

Time Published: 2025-08-08T16:18:58Z

Ripple’s multi-year legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission reached a decisive conclusion this week, triggering a sharp rally in XRP’s price and trading volume. The settlement confirmed that Ripple’s past programmatic and institutional sales of XRP were lawful, removing a major source of uncertainty that had weighed on the token since the lawsuit began. Within hours of the news, XRP surged 5.21% to $3.22, while trading volume climbed 164.43%, signalling renewed confidence from both retail and institutional traders. Analysts say the ruling could reshape market perceptions of XRP and potentially pave the way for future institutional products tied to the asset. Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan announced that the legal dispute over Ripple’s previous programmatic and institutional XRP sales has been resolved with the SEC. The clarification confirms that these sales were compliant under US law, establishing that XRP itself is not a security. This development follows years of litigation that placed XRP under intense regulatory scrutiny, with Ripple and its community consistently challenging the SEC’s stance. The resolution has been widely interpreted as a significant turning point for the asset, particularly in the United States market. Analysts note that the combination of legal clarity and increased liquidity could drive more institutional participation in the months ahead. The latest ruling has bolstered expectations that large financial institutions may reconsider their stance on XRP. Some market commentators have even suggested that asset management giant BlackRock could explore an XRP exchange-traded fund, a move that would broaden access to the token for mainstream investors. While no official ETF filing has been made, industry experts believe XRP’s regulatory clarity gives it a competitive advantage over other digital assets still facing classification uncertainty. This could help position XRP as a viable option for both cross-border payment solutions and investment products. The settlement has reignited debates between the XRP and Bitcoin communities. Bitcoin-only advocates have continued to brand altcoins as securities, with MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor repeatedly asserting that only Bitcoin qualifies as a commodity. Morgan pushed back against these claims, highlighting XRP’s performance since its launch, which he calculated as exceeding 50,000% growth. He also responded to recent criticism from Bitcoin maximalists such as Adam Livingston, who alleged that Ripple could use banks to offload XRP onto retail investors. Traders are now monitoring whether XRP can sustain its upward momentum. The recent surge, combined with the removal of legal uncertainty, has given the asset a stronger market position. However, the cryptocurrency landscape remains highly competitive, and community sentiment continues to influence market moves. If institutional interest materialises, analysts expect XRP could see further demand growth, especially if new investment products are introduced. The ruling may also spark fresh regulatory conversations around the status of other digital assets, potentially influencing the broader crypto market.

Title: On Independence Day, Foreign Agribusiness Will Be Told Get Out, “Quit India!”

Editor Solutions Colin Todhunter, OffGuardian On 15 August, India will celebrate its Independence Day. There will be the usual celebratory flag-waving and flypasts in Delhi along with sound bites about ‘the world’s biggest democracy’. But what has ‘independence’ come to mean? Placing an X on a ballot paper every now and then does not constitute democracy. If people are misinformed, misled and manipulated to think and act in a certain way, while backroom deals are carried out without their knowledge, then what value ‘democracy’? Then there is no freedom, no self-determination. Someone else is determining the agenda. The Quit India Movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress on 8 August 1942, demanding the immediate end of British rule in India. It inspired a mass civil disobedience campaign featuring strikes, demonstrations and sabotage, despite the British arresting Gandhi and many Congress leaders immediately after the movement’s start. The movement saw remarkable nationwide participation—including women, students, workers and peasants. Although it was violently suppressed by the colonial authorities, it galvanised the struggle for independence. The Quit India Movement significantly weakened British authority, promoted unity among diverse groups and set the stage for India’s eventual independence. Now, in 2025, the spirit of the Quit India Movement is being explicitly invoked by today’s farmer protests to inspire unity, resilience and a nationwide call to action. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM)—a coalition of 40-plus farmers’ unions across India—is at the forefront of a continuing struggle against government policies that are eroding rural livelihoods, national sovereignty and federal governance. Their concerns centre on an emerging authoritarian central government controlled by corporate interests and international finance capital, which threatens to subordinate the role of India’s states and dismantle vital protections for farmers and rural communities. SKM, alongside allied organisations such as the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), argues that the Union Government’s push for agricultural reforms under slogans like ‘One Nation, One Market’ jeopardises the constitutional federal structure. These reforms—including the draft National Policy Framework on Agriculture Marketing (NPFAM)—seek to unify India’s disparate agricultural marketing systems into a centralised, corporatised national market. According to the SKM, this transformation will severely diminishe the decision-making power of state governments over agriculture, land, industry and markets—domains constitutionally assigned to them. The NPFAM draft envisions a rescaling of agricultural marketing, replacing state-regulated wholesale markets (mandis) and rural haats with private, corporate-controlled entities integrated via Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and blockchain technologies. Under this model, powerful private corporations, including conglomerates like Adani, Ambani, Tata, Cargill, Pepsi, Walmart, Bayer and Amazon, would engage directly with farmers, bypassing traditional state-regulated market structures. The consolidation of storage facilities and marketing channels under corporate control raises fears of price manipulation and diminishes farmers’ negotiating power. This change will essentially fundamentally restructure India’s agri-food sector and is aimed at integrating it deeply into global supply chains controlled by agribusiness and international finance capital. This is little more than a neocolonial strategy that would hand over India’s food security and agricultural governance to transnational corporations. In 2025, farmers are still protesting. The roots of the protests can be traced back to the three farm laws introduced and subsequently repealed in late 2021 following widespread protests. The SKM and the AIKS warn that the NPFAM is effectively a rebranded return of those laws, seeking to achieve their objectives through new policy frameworks. Key elements of the NPFAM echo the earlier laws’ intent to deregulate markets, permit private agribusiness entry and promote contract farming under conditions favourable to corporate interests. The absence of legislative guarantees for a legal Minimum Support Price (MSP) for agricultural produce and minimum wages for agricultural workers remains a still-unaddressed primary concern, as is the lack of accountability mechanisms to regulate corporate practices. Farmers face the prospect of becoming mere producers of raw materials for corporate supply chains, with prices dictated by powerful processing industries and exporters. The AIKS stresses that central government proposals, including deepening financialisation via futures and options markets, will enable global corporations and financial firms to assert dominance over the food industry, intensifying farmers’ economic vulnerabilities. The critique extends to dismantling of India’s longstanding food security frameworks: Facilitating corporate interests, the government seeks the withdrawal of state involvement in these key institutions, exposing India to volatile international markets controlled by global agribusiness, thereby undermining food sovereignty and rural welfare. In response to this proposed neoliberal shock therapy, the SKM has launched a series of coordinated protests to press their demands and safeguard farmers’ rights. On ‘Quit India” Day on 13 August, symbolically invoking the historic Quit India Movement, farmers nationwide will conduct vehicle and tractor parades, public demonstrations and the burning of effigies representing Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This protest specifically targets proposed Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) — particularly with the US — fearing they will exacerbate corporate dominance and market flooding with (GMO) cheap imports. The date, 13 August, comes two days before Independence Day celebrations. Something that may appear increasingly hollow as time marches on and we see the recolonisation of India’s economy by foreign interests. From 15 August, the campaign will include public hearings, grassroots mobilisation and awareness drives culminating in a large-scale worker-farmer protest action in Delhi and various state capitals on 26 November, marking five years since the historic farmers’ protests at Delhi’s borders. The movement’s core demands include a constitutionally or legally enforced MSP aligned with recommendations from the Swaminathan Commission, ensuring farmers receive at least 50% above the cost of production, loan waivers and financial relief tailored for farmers. Farmers also want the withdrawal of bans on using 10-year-old tractors in the National Capital Region (NCR), the restoration of fertiliser subsidies, regulation of spurious agricultural inputs. Stronger state infrastructure to maintain food security is called for along with support for small-scale producers and meaningful dialogue involving farmer organisations and state governments. Many of the key demands are long standing, but official responses to the protests and farmers’ demands have sometimes involved tear gas, water cannons and other harsh measures, reflecting attempts to suppress dissent and reassure international investors of a stable climate for foreign direct investment. In late 2021, SKM leader Rakesh Tikait noted that around 750 protesters had died in the prolonged struggle. Various officials have been recorded endorsing harsh crackdowns on demonstrators, further fuelling resentment and mistrust. This marks a broader trend of state suppression intended to clear the path for a corporate-financial takeover of the agricultural domain. The SKM and the AIKS protests and demands are well-founded. In India, as elsewhere, we are seeing the erosion of traditional diets and farming practices, resulting in an increasing reliance on ultra-processed foods and global corporate supply chains. Moreover, underinvestment in rural infrastructure and agriculture over decades has been deliberate, portraying Indian farming as backward and ripe for ‘modernisation’ that privileges corporate profit over food sovereignty. The commodification and financialisation of food and agricultural land will serve to further embed corporate influence at all levels, from seed to store (or, increasingly, e-commerce platform), paralleling a global pattern of food insecurity and corporate dominance. This corporate hijack is not unique to India. In late 2024, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, and expressed enthusiasm for partnering with the global investment firm. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, in a letter, warmly welcomed this collaboration, stating that Labour looks forward to working with BlackRock to “change the face of our UK”. But what kind of “change” is being envisioned? It appears to involve making life increasingly difficult for farmers, especially through inheritance tax policies designed to push them off their land. This would pave the way for BlackRock to acquire farmland that is treated simply as an ‘asset class’, leading to industrial-scale agriculture and subsidy-driven green investments that could see vast expanses of countryside covered by solar panels. Given BlackRock’s global ambitions, Larry Fink is likely eager to replicate this strategy in India, especially as the country’s government advances development of a land market catering to international finance interests. India stands at a crossroads. The 2025 protest campaign reflects deeper battles over food sovereignty, federalism, rural livelihoods and the democratic rights of citizens. The struggle is not merely against specific trade deals or policies but against an overarching neoliberal agenda that threatens to fully disempower farmers and reshape India’s agricultural landscape to suit global capital at the expense of millions.

Bitcoin and crypto have rocketed higher this week, climbing as the market bounces back to $4 trillion from a sell-off that sparked fears of a crash. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin last month, with traders betting the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock could be about to blow up up the market. Now, as legendary billionaire Ray Dalio issues a shock crypto recommendation, analysts with JPMorgan have flipped to predict the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September—setting up a situation “eerily similar” to bitcoin’s 2024 second half price surge. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run "For [Fed chair Jerome] Powell, the risk management considerations at the next meeting may go beyond balancing employment and inflation risks," JPMorgan analyst Michael Feroli wrote in a note to clients seen by Reuters. JPMorgan predicts the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting, pointing to labour market growth stalling and U.S. president Donald Trump’s nomination of the dovish chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, to a temporary seat on the Fed board, replacing outgoing governor Adriana Kugler. Powell has come under massive pressure from Trump this year, whose attacks over interest rates have raised the possibility that the era of Fed independence could be coming to an end. "In the off chance Miran is governor by the time of the next meeting, that could imply three dissents. That’s a lot of dissents," Feroli said, adding that if the jobs market continues to weaken it could justify a larger cut of 50 basis points. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious CME’s Fed Watch tool is now showing the market is pricing in an around 90% chance of an interest rate cut in September, creating a situation that mirrors the 2024 September rate cut that took market off-guard and spurred the bitcoin price to a record-breaking rally. "Last year’s August growth scare spurred the Fed into a ‘catch-up rate cut rush’ from September to December 2024, doubling bitcoin’s price in the process," Presto Research’s Peter Chung and Min Jung wrote in a note this week. “The current setup feels eerily similar.”

Title: XRP ETF odds surge to 80% after SEC-Ripple legal settlement

Analysts are split on whether BlackRock will file for spot XRP ETF. Analysts are split on whether BlackRock will file for a spot XRP ETF. But the latest regulatory update could be a positive catalyst for it to make the move, per Nate Geraci. BlackRock may apply for a spot Ripple[XRP] ETF after the U.S SEC and Ripple Labs ended their appeals. This was a bold projection by Nate Geraci of ETF Institute, adding that, “Yes, I think BlackRock was waiting to see this before filing for iShares XRP ETF…” He said that it would make ‘zero sense’ for the firm not to explore beyond Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH]. If it sticks to only BTC and ETH, then it would mean that only the two assets have value, Geraci wrote. As of press time, the asset manager had not applied for both XRP and Solana [SOL] ETFs. This made it the only potential issuer with BTC and ETH ETF offerings that was yet to make that move. Last year, Samara Cohen, CIO at BlackRock, noted that institutional investors were only focused on BTC and ETH. Hence, at that time, she added that they may not apply for other crypto ETFs in the near term. However, Geraci believes that BlackRock could file for SOL and XRP ETFs before the October approval deadline. For his part, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas opined that the firm may just stick to the two top crypto assets, citing ‘diminished returns’ beyond ETH. Source: X Meanwhile, the approval odds for spot XRP ETF surged to nearly 80% after the SEC and Ripple Labs opted to end their appeals. Source: Polymarket Interestingly, the chances had dropped to 66% on the 7th of August. This followed revelations of alleged blockage of crypto ETFs by Democrat SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. But Balchunas noted that the commissioner was ‘outnumbered’ and could not prevent the products from going live, maintaining 95% of approval. “She’s outnumbered = we haven’t changed our odds, still at 95%.” On the market front, over $6 billion XRP has been offloaded in the past few days, flipping whale demand to negative. While this was a threat to the $3 support, the latest update on the dismissal of the SEC and Ripple Labs appeals triggered an 11% upswing to $3.3. However, Options traders were still heavily hedging against further downside risks despite the relief rally. Per Laevitas’ data, there was a premium for short-dated put options (bearish bets). Also, the 25 Delta Skew turned negative and dropped across the 1-day, 1-week, and 3-month tenors, illustrating weakening sentiment. Source: Laevitas Notably, traders bought over 1.8 billion XRP at each of the $2.70–$2.80 and $2.40–$2.50 zones, reinforcing these levels as key support areas. These zones now serve as potential floors in the event of a short-term pullback.

Mike Novogratz, chief executive of Galaxy Digital, told CNBC that a new executive order from US President Donald Trump could make it easier for retirement plans to include cryptocurrencies. According to reports, the order asks the Labor Department to review ERISA rules so alternatives such as crypto, private equity, and real estate can be offered inside 401(k) plans. That’s a policy signal that could matter to many savers, but it will not instantly change how plans operate. Based on reports, Americans hold about $8.7 trillion in 401(k) assets, so even small allocations would add up. Novogratz said that if companies like Fidelity, BlackRock or T. Rowe Price package crypto in retirement-friendly vehicles, mainstream access would increase. That could let ordinary savers get exposure through tax-advantaged accounts they already use. Plan sponsors and record-keepers remain subject to ERISA responsibilities and questions of duty of care. Those responsibilities mandate fiduciaries to act in a prudent way for participants, and introducing volatile assets creates genuine legal and compliance concerns. Thus, though the executive order reflects a change, regulators and plan providers must sort through operational realities before numerous retirement accounts hold significant crypto positions. Plan administrators will need custody solutions, audit trails, and low-cost product structures to make crypto fit with defined contribution plans. Many crypto vehicles carry lockups or higher fees, and that clashes with how 401(k) menus are usually set up. Litigation risk also remains: a sharp drop in value could lead to scrutiny from participants or courts. Regulators will likely balance investor protection against widening access, and asset managers will balance demand with legal caution. Market moves show the headline effect in action. Based on reports, Bitcoin traded at $116,500, up 3.0% in the past day, while Ethereum traded at $3,810, a 6% rise in the same timeframe. Novogratz has pointed to institutional products such as BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust as evidence of growing demand. Those products help create familiar entry points for big money and retail investors alike. Don’t expect an instant tidal wave. Product teams at major managers will likely pilot custody and compliance setups before offering broad access. Plan sponsors may start with small, optional allocations or specialized windows rather than adding crypto to default funds. Small percentages across many accounts could still add up to large dollar flows if given time. In short, based on reports and Novogratz’s remarks, the executive order is a major political signal that could encourage more retirement capital toward crypto over time after Trump gives the EO its final seal of approval.

Title: Ripple and SEC settle, sparking XRP’s 10% rally and BlackRock ETF speculation

The legal certainty from Ripple's SEC settlement sparks speculation of a potential BlackRock XRP ETF project. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have agreed to formally end their appeals in the high-profile lawsuit that has dragged on for nearly four years. In a joint filing on Aug. 7, both parties confirmed they will withdraw their appeals following a Commission vote. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the agreement marks the close of a dispute that began in December 2020. Under the settlement terms, XRP will not be classified as a security, and each side will cover its own legal costs. This outcome is seen as a major win for Ripple, placing it alongside other crypto firms like Coinbase that have resolved conflicts with the SEC. Following the news, the XRP token price jumped by more than 10% to $3.33 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate’s data. The settlement has fueled speculation about a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. The firm already issues leading ETF products tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth, suggested BlackRock may have been waiting for legal clarity before considering an XRP product under its iShares brand. He argued that ignoring assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum could imply that no other cryptocurrencies have long-term value. However, he stressed that his views are speculative, saying: “I’ll own it if I’m wrong.” Meanwhile, not everyone shares Geraci’s optimistic outlook about a potential BlackRock XRP ETF. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas expressed skepticism, saying he believes BlackRock is content with its two existing crypto ETFs. He cited the “law of diminishing returns” for adding more products, though he admitted his opinion was based more on intuition than concrete evidence. Despite his doubts about BlackRock pursuing an XRP ETF, Balchunas remains optimistic about the broader regulatory environment. He estimated a 95% chance of an XRP ETF receiving approval before the end of the year. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: ‘Disaster in the Making’: Trump to Open 401(k)s to Crypto, Private Equity Vultures

Yves here. Private equity has been trying for many years to get their products sold to retail investors. Trump has greatly lowered the bar with his executive order. However (and I do not want to sound like a Pollyanna) but if the private equity part was as easy as a Presidential stroke of a pen, it would have happened already. Selling a financial product to retail investors requires considerably more financial reporting and compliance. That involves another layer of fees and costs when private equity is already pulling out so much in fees and costs as to make private equity less attractive on a risk-return basis than stocks. That is not to say that the new SEC chair won’t try to bend the rules. See our May post: New SEC Chief on Board with Letting Retail Chumps Invest in Private Equity Even as Pros Like Kuwait Sovereign Wealth Fund Sound Red Alert But see some of our many posts on private equity’s overstated performance, and the fact that many investors are finally waking up: Private Equity Pummeled by Higher Interest Rates as Portfolio Companies and Credit Funds Struggle; Use of PIK Loans Now Recalls Late 1980s LBO Crisis Billionaire Blasts Private Equity’s Continued Grifting as Performance Falls Further Private Equity Becomes Roach Motel as Public Pension Funds and Other Investors Borrow As Funds Remain Tied Up Private Equity Seeks to Foist Companies It Can’t Sell on Employees As CalPERS Doubles Down on Private Equity, New Analysis Finds CalPERS’ Private Equity Returns “Based on a Mirage;” Another Study Reaffirms that Private Equity Drags Down Performance And that’s before getting to how private equity rentierism is destructive to the public. There is plenty where this came from: Private Equity on Campus: Why College Students Are Sleeping in Cars Buy and Bust: Collapse of Private Equity-Backed Rural Hospitals Mired Employees in Medical Bills Fed Hawkishness, Crypto Implosion, and Private Equity Subscription Lines of Credit Imperil Silicon Valley Bank and Freak Out Bank Stock Investors Plunder: Private Equity’s Plan to Pillage America But it seems inevitable that retail retirement assets will become the last chumps for both PE and crypto. The only question is to what degree. By Jake Johnson, staff writer for Common Dreams. Originally published at Common Dreams U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that would allow private equity and cryptocurrencies into Americans’ 401(k)s, appeasing corporate interests that lobbied for the change and disregarding warnings about the risks it poses to retirement accounts. Citing an unnamed senior White House official, CNN reported that “the order calls for the Labor Department and Securities and Exchange Commission to issue guidance to employers about providing access to those alternative investments in their retirement accounts.” The private equity industry has been working for years to gain access to a portion of the roughly $12 trillion that Americans have saved in workplace retirement plans. “This is the holy grail for private equity,” Axios reported Thursday, noting that federal rules currently bar most defined-contribution plans from investing in private equity and crypto. Both industries spent big on the 2024 election; the investment management behemoth BlackRock, whose CEO has advocated opening 401(k)s to private equity, donated to Trump’s inaugural committee. James Baratta and Whitney Curry Wimbish noted in The American Prospect earlier this year that “there was added desperation from the industry” for access to 401(k)s “because of their dire need for cash amid weakening performance and fewer deals.” “Some firms have begun mortgaging their own funds for money to pay out limited partners,” they added. “Retail investors represented trillions in untapped potential.” Helaine Olen, managing editor at the American Economic Liberties Project and a longtime personal finance columnist, said in a statement Thursday that “stuffing private equity, crypto, and other ‘alternative assets’ into 401(k)s is about propping up scams and bailing out an industry that’s run out of buyers—and it’s being done at the expense of Americans’ retirements everywhere.” “There’s a reason most employers didn’t bite when Trump tried this the first time and why the private investments industry has put on such a thick lobbying campaign,” said Olen. “These funds are high-fee, risky, and opaque. Private equity consistently underperforms the S&P 500. This is a windfall for billionaire fund managers and a disaster in the making for regular Americans trying to save for retirement.” Last week, the Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund and American Federation of Teachers released a report warning that if private equity is given a foothold in 401(k)s, “millions of workers saving for retirement would be exposed to higher risks and steep fees in products that lack basic investor protections and transparency requirements.” The report found that private equity profitability “has been in a year-over-year decline” for the past two decades and that “fee structures—paid directly by investors or indirectly through portfolio companies—are prone to extensive manipulation.” Lisa Donner, co-executive director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, said that “private equity executives have enriched themselves by the billions, taking high fees and other charges from working people’s hard-earned retirement savings in pension funds.” “Now they want fees from the trillions of dollars in individual retirement accounts,” Donner added, “putting millions of more people at risk.” Perhaps the US economy is replicating what happens to snakes under stress? I think it is inevitable, but how to protect ourselves, other than the old fashioned hard work of reading the prospectus and calling the 1-800 line to harangue the advisors? My biggest nightmare is that this crap ends up in target date funds. The sheep will be sheared. What if the 800 line is staffed overseas or even worse, supplemented with a Q&A guided response built on the best AI offerings? Hey dear consumer, please invest your life savings and hold it with “diamond hands!”. \sarc Employers just found a use case for hiring young whippersnapper lawyers fresh from law school. Write some safe harbor language that puts a wide legal moat as possible, and include in all our detailed retirement planning disclosures. Employers all shifted away from defined benefit pensions and that was no accident, unfortunately for mine, ours and future generations. It will be … I had to move my entire IRA holdings, save a few shekels out of Vanguard, for this very reason. The phone customer service deteriorated to the point where it took hours to get through to an overseas call center, none of whom had any authority to do much other than tell me balance info. Welcome to the Motel Crypto Hell … you can check in anytime you want … “It’s a lovely place…” We’re considering this for our IRAs (401(k)s with Fidelity for me, 457(b) 2ith WA PERS for the LHG). Where did you move your funds to? Of course this is all a test run for the real White House objective – privatizing Social Security to Wall Street so that it can be pillaged by them. That is the ultimate aim. Where is a blue dress when you need one? Ask Jeffrey Epstein’s friend. The bubble for crypto is being inflated to incredible levels. Bitcoin is now at $130,000, there are Bitcoin credit cards and now Bitcoin is going to be in 401k funds. I don’t know where this will stop. But in the short term, it’s a rational investment as it’s certain to go up wildly in the next few months at least. I wonder if Bitcoin will reach 1,000,000 before it crashes. Unlike tulips, it has a committed, international, user base. It certainly has more uses then tulips. What’s trending now is using Bitcoin as collateral and never selling it. Obv it will go down at some point but as long as you don’t get liquidated by having a low LTV you’d be fine $4.01k update: This is what everybody was hoping for-legitimacy of packaged air cleverly disguised as cryptos, Bitcoin in particular. Now to come up with appropriate nicknames… Green(screen)backs ” Everybody” ? Which “everybodies”? How many “everybodies”? I understand the regret in missing out on not having a one-figure investment in Bitcoin, some skin in the game. Its never too late and they’re still making 1’s & 0’s~ Which one will they run out of first? I invested in cans of canned fish in cans. I am slowly eating them down. If crypto crashes back to truth-value zero before I have eaten all my cans of canned fish, the fish inside the cans of canned fish that I will still have at that time will still be safely inside of their cans. So whoever might be regretting not having bought Bitco at the start, it isn’t me. I have been true to my pledge, the No Crypto pledge. I pledge, on my honor, that I will neither use crypto nor invest in crypto. And I will not tolerate those who do. The linked AFT/AFREF/AAUP report From Public Pensions to Private Fortunes on how Private Equity morphed from its 1980’s leveraged looting model into a fee-driven billionaire factory is well worth downloading and reading. My only criticism of the report is that it fails to emphasize how campaign cash and outright graft have destroyed the democratic process that should have caused regulators, legislators, and fiduciary boards to rein-in this devastating looting of the commons. Trump’s proposal is nakedly transactional, like everything he does. In case the link is too deeply buried I’ll repeat it here: https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/resources/publicpensionsprivatefortunes/ The link got truncated and there have been bugs in how Comments can be edited using Safari.

Wait till AI hacks into the invulnerable, immutable, and unhackable crypto system. It seems, in this day and age, the latest and greatest digital invention 10 years ago, becomes obsolete with the passage of time. Devil’s Own Advocate: What if Bitcoin et al was the stalking horse that Wall*Street pinned the tale on, when things come a cropper? When things come a cropper, the canned fish inside my cans of canned fish in cans will still be inside my cans of canned fish in cans. Those who can invest in Reality and Survival should do so rather than investing in munny or sekyooriteez or stokz or bahndz or such, to the extent that they are able. Those who are only a little bit able can still invest a little bit in a little bit of Reality and Survival. Sardines perhaps? But would they be eating sardines or trading sardines? https://novelinvestor.com/happy-hour-trading-sardines/ Sardines are wonderful. They are low on the food chain so they accumulate least-feasible contanimants. They last for several years inside the cans so you can eat them at leisure. And the cans themselves can be saved for arts-and-crafts purposes around the home. I must confess, I had never heard of the concept of trading sardines till now. It makes a fine apocryphal tale. If you are speculating on trading sardines, why would you ever bother to worry about what is in the can? Till you are hungry and have to liquidate your speculative investment one can at a time. ( If some of my sardines become unfit to eat due to being held for too long before eating, they will still be fit to feed to the garden). Your email address will not be published.

Title: BlackRock Rumored to Dump $664M in Bitcoin and Ethereum—What Happens if Trust Breaks?
URL: https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/blackrock-rumored-to-dump-664m-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum-what-happens-if-trust-breaks/
Time Published: 2025-08-08T06:44:00Z
Full Content:
New reports suggest that BlackRock may be preparing to offload over $664 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum, as ETF-linked wallet data shows potential movement across key custody addresses. According to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, four wallets tied to BlackRock’s IBIT and ETHA ETFs appear to have shifted large reserves in recent days – raising alarms among market watchers about whether a major liquidation event is on the horizon. The total holdings in question—11,400 BTC and 26,000 ETH—represent one of the largest aggregated positions by a single asset manager. While no official confirmation has come from BlackRock, analysts are warning that even the rumor of such a dump could be enough to destabilize market sentiment in the short term. And if investor confidence is shaken, it could lead to capital fleeing toward more nimble, high-growth crypto plays—especially emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer early-stage upside and no institutional overhang. Why a BlackRock sell-off could shift the narrative The speculation has ignited concerns about centralized influence over crypto markets. If BlackRock, seen as a trusted bridge between Wall Street and blockchain, begins unloading assets, it could signal broader doubt in current valuations – or even pre-positioning for a deeper macro pullback. Either way, such a move risks breaking trust among retail and institutional investors alike, particularly those who bought into ETFs expecting long-term holding strategies. Historically, market shocks like this have led to surges in interest for smaller, decentralized, community-backed tokens. And with sentiment this fragile, even a partial dump could redirect billions in retail flow toward early-stage opportunities tokens not yet tied to institutional risk or old-cycle baggage. $5,000 could deliver $550,000 once MAGACOIN FINANCE hits major exchanges That’s precisely why MAGACOIN FINANCE is now emerging as a top pick among early-mover investors. Still in its early phase, this politically charged coin has already outperformed expectations in terms of engagement, wallet sign-ups, and on-chain activity. But it’s the projected upside that’s turning heads: analysts now believe that a $5,000 investment at today’s rate could grow into $550,000 once MAGACOIN FINANCE gets listed on major exchanges and becomes globally accessible. What sets it apart? MAGACOIN FINANCE is blending virality with calculated rollout mechanics and a built-in ideological movement – attracting both hype traders and long-term ecosystem builders. Its rounds are closing fast, and the token has already surpassed early momentum levels seen in SHIBA INU and DOGE’s initial phases. Unlike assets weighed down by ETF custody issues or legacy reputation, MAGACOIN is clean, nimble, and built for exponential scaling. And in a post-BlackRock trust shake-up, MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer the kind of fresh start and narrative clarity the market desperately needs. As institutions wobble, early-stage plays surge While large asset managers like BlackRock have brought credibility to the crypto space, they’ve also introduced traditional finance behaviors – like strategic selling, liquidity protection, and risk management – that don’t always align with crypto’s ethos. If retail begins to feel burned by centralized exits, expect a mass migration to new, decentralized alternatives, particularly those not yet influenced by ETF politics or institutional pacing. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which have no legacy exposure and are just entering their growth phase, stand to capture the fallout from any broken trust in the top-tier token space. Conclusion: Institutions may sell – early movers will seek the next frontier Whether or not BlackRock executes a full sell-off, the market is clearly watching. And in moments like these, capital tends to flow fast toward uncorrelated opportunities. With MAGACOIN FINANCE offering projected 110x upside and gaining global traction ahead of its major listings, it’s no surprise that analysts are calling it the top altcoin bet in a post-ETF correction world.

Title: XRP price jumps 11% as SEC and Ripple formally dismiss appeals

About us Copy link After nearly five years of courtroom combat, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs are putting away their swords. The two sides jointly agreed to dismiss their respective appeals in the XRP securities case, officially ending one of crypto’s largest legal battles and sending the token up 11% on Thursday. “Following the Commission’s vote today, the SEC and Ripple formally filed directly with the Second Circuit to dismiss their appeals,” Ripple chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty wrote on X, “The end, and now back to business.” According to the SEC, the joint stipulation covers Ripple Labs, CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and co-founder Christian Larsen. The dismissal resolves the agency’s civil enforcement action, leaving in place a final judgment imposing a $125,035,150 penalty on Ripple and a permanent injunction against violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. Ripple had sought to cut that figure to $50 million as part of a conditional settlement, but Judge Analisa Torres rejected the proposal in June, ruling that neither side had “come close” to justifying a change to her final judgment. ETFStore president Nate Geraci said the truce “clears the way” for spot XRP exchange-traded funds, with Bloomberg analysts putting approval odds at 95% ahead of an October deadline. “I think BlackRock was waiting to see this before filing for iShares XRP ETF,” Geraci added, arguing it makes “zero sense” for issuers to ignore crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP is currently trading for $3.31. Kyle Baird is DL News’ Weekend Editor. Got a tip? Email at kbaird@dlnews.com.

Title: Transport authority approves settlement of Swords BusConnects corridor legal action
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/dublin/2025/08/08/transport-authority-approves-settlement-of-swords-busconnects-corridor-legal-action/
Time Published: 2025-08-08T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
The board of the National Transport Authority (NTA) has approved a proposed settlement to halt legal action taken against its planned BusConnects corridor from Swords to Dublin city centre. The NTA would not disclose the terms of the settlement, but the board’s approval raises hopes judicial review proceedings will be dropped to allow construction of the 12km route granted planning permission more than a year ago. The Swords corridor is one of 12 segregated bus routes to be built as part of the €4 billion scheme to transform the capital’s bus services. The planned route runs from the south side of Swords town in north Dublin, past Dublin Airport and through Santry along the Swords Road, then along the Drumcondra Road and Dorset Street to the top of O’Connell Street and Parnell Square. The NTA secured permission from An Bord Pleanála for the route in June of last year, but judicial review proceedings against the board’s decision were initiated in August by two separate parties: owners of a business park near the airport and a veterinary practice south of Swords. The cases have not yet been heard in the High Court but in their submissions to An Bord Pleanála both Brendan Collins, of Collinstown Business Park, and Conor O’Scanaill, of O’Scanaill Veterinary Surgeons, raised concerns about the effect the bus corridor would have on their properties. Minutes of a recent NTA board meeting show details of a “settlement proposal” were presented to the board by interim NTA chief executive Hugh Creegan. “Following the overview provided, the board approved the terms of the proposed agreement to settle the particular judicial reviews proceedings being taken in relation to the Swords to City Centre Core Bus Corridor scheme,” the minutes state. This is the first settlement approved by the board in an effort to bring an end to legal action taken against one of the bus corridor schemes. Of the 12 corridors, judicial review proceedings have been taken in relation to seven, the corridors from Swords, Clongriffin, Belfield/Blackrock, Blanchardstown, Templeogue/Rathfarnham, Bray and Kimmage. The other five now have “full” planning permission as the time frame by which they could be challenged in the courts has expired. These are the routes from Ballymun/Finglas, Liffey Valley, Ringsend, Tallaght/Clondalkin and Lucan. [ BusConnects route will come in ‘on time, on budget’, says Darragh O’BrienOpens in new window ] Green Party transport spokesman Feljin Jose said the delays caused by the judicial reviews were extremely concerning. “The NTA has to build three of these at the same time over the next four to five years to get this done this side of 2035. Seven out of the 12 approved corridors in judicial review is not a good return rate and will add at least a year, maybe up to two years, delay.” The settlement of the Swords cases would be a win for Dubliners, he said. “Without knowing the details of the settlement I can only say it’s good news if the cases are dropped and the quicker we can get this done and have bus priority and improved cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.” The plaintiffs and their legal representatives declined to comment on the settlement agreement. A spokeswoman for the NTA said it could not comment on the details of the proposed agreement “other than to acknowledge that the board approved the terms of the agreement at the June board” meeting. Construction of the first core bus corridor from Liffey Valley to the city centre is due to begin next month.

Title: Ireland women’s rugby coach defends capping two ex-England players in World Cup prep
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/08/08/ireland-womens-rugby-coach-defends-capping-two-ex-england-players-in-world-cup-prep/
Time Published: 2025-08-08T05:00:01Z

Ireland head coach Scott Bemand has defended the inclusion of two new players in Ireland’s World Cup preparation. It comes after former England international Ellena Perry was named to make her debut off the bench in Saturday’s warm-up match against Canada in Belfast. Perry, who earned the last of her 11 England caps in 2020 and therefore satisfies World Rugby’s stand down rules for switching nations, qualifies through an Irish grandparent. She was brought into the set-up a few weeks ago but, with tighthead prop Christy Haney struggling to make the World Cup squad due to a hamstring injury, Bemand has decided to play Perry as loosehead cover on the bench. Perry is the second new player from outside the Irish system given a debut in as many weeks. Last weekend, Exeter centre Nancy McGillivray, who has been named in England squads without ever being capped, debuted after qualifying through her Irish-born father. She has been on Ireland’s radar for some time, but only became available after her England contract expired in June. Both Perry and McGillivray are expected to be named in the final World Cup squad, to be announced on Monday. Perry is likely to come in for the injured Haney, while McGillivray is not expected to oust any of Eve Higgins, Aoife Dalton or Enya Breen, Ireland’s centres from the Six Nations. Instead, an outside back is likely to make way. Ahead of Saturday’s game in Belfast, Bemand was asked if introducing players from outside the system so close to the competition risked upsetting the squad dynamic. “If done incorrectly [yes],” he said. “But with Christy [Haney] picking up the hamstring niggle we needed to bring in and supplement front row. So actually, everything has been done well, in my opinion. [ Former England prop Ellena Perry in line to make Ireland debut against CanadaOpens in new window ] “Elle [Perry] is a good player, and she’s a really good person, having worked with her before. She’s known to a good few of the girls [Perry is teammates of Neve Jones and Sam Monaghan at Gloucester] and they would endorse that.” While the new caps can be explained by injury and waiting for contracts to expire, that Ireland looked externally may send a message that the current development pathways don’t have World Cup-ready players. Uncapped Ulster and Railway prop Sophie Barrett was one name overlooked by the inclusion of Perry. Yet, other inclusions, such as the potential World Cup place for Under-20 forward Beth Buttimer, would push back against that narrative, one which Bemand is keen to dispel. “If you look at the number of players now coming through from the women’s national talent squad, in girls that are getting touch points through Sevens, through Celtic Challenge, through the Under-20s, our depth is night and day to how it looked two years ago. “Sophie’s [Barrett] nearly ready and if we had to call Sophie up, we’d be confident in what Sophie’s capabilities are. She also hasn’t played Test match rugby yet. “Ivana Kiripati, Ailish Quinn, Jemima Adams Verde ... we’ve got three players that have had touch points with the 20s in the near recent past. Ailish came on and got a first cap last week against Scotland. “So girls coming through the pathway, through the Under-20s is significant. It’s brilliant. I’m excited for the future.” IRELAND (v Canada, World cup-warm-up, Affidea Stadium, Belfast, Saturday, 12pm): Stacey Flood (Railway Union/Leinster); Béibhinn Parsons (Blackrock College/Connacht), Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Enya Breen (Blackrock College/Munster), Anna McGann (Railway Union); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Aoibheann Reilly (Blackrock College/Connacht); Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Neve Jones (Gloucester Hartpury), Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere/Leinster); Ruth Campbell (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere/Ulster); Grace Moore (Trailfinders/IQ Rugby), Ivana Kiripati (Creggs/Connacht), Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster).

Title: Rugby’s next generation: Meet the rising stars of Leinster, Ulster, Connacht and Munster

Connacht academy manager Eric Elwood knows the value of a good young ‘un having led the Ireland Under-20s to a Grand Slam in 2007. So it’s no surprise that the province’s first-year intake for next season includes three players – flanker Bobby Power, hooker Mikey Yarr and secondrow David Walsh – from Neil Doak’s national age-grade squad. Another, number eight Aaron O’Brien, would have played but for injury. Connacht welcome eight players into the academy – five from Leinster in Yarr, Walsh, Dan Ryan, an Ireland Under-19 international wing educated at St Michael’s College, and outhalf Conor O’Shaughnessy, who played All-Ireland League for Blackrock College last season having made the short journey to Stradbrook from the school. O’Brien was a standout schools player at St Mary’s College and also in underage representative rugby with Leinster and Ireland. They join Power, fellow Galway man Seán Walsh, a centre who has represented Ireland at Under-19 international level, and backrow Diarmuid O’Connell from Carrick-on-Shannon. Elwood’s decision to recruit outside the province is sensible and underlines that he is looking to attract the best young players into the pathway. Newbridge-born prop Billy Bohan is in his second year, while wing James Nicholson (Wicklow) and hooker Matthew Victory (Dublin) are in their final year. Connacht are not alone in this respect as Ulster and Munster also have players born in Leinster in their respective academies, hardly a surprise given the numbers game, not least population size. Ulster have persuaded Balbriggan-born wing Aitzol Arenzana-King, a former Irish 20s Grand Slam winner, to make the journey to Belfast where he will join Dubliners Sam Berman and Tom Brigg, along with South African-born centre Wilhelm de Klerk, who came to Dublin as a 10-year-old and played rugby in St Michael’s. Richie Murphy’s Grand Slam and World Cup exploits with the Irish 20s was a facilitator in attracting some top young players to Ulster from outside the province. Hooker Connor Magee, prop Flynn Longstaff, promising outhalf Daniel Green and wing Josh Gibson join Arenzana-King as the five new faces in the academy. Props George Hadden, from Gorey, and Ronan Foxe from Rahugh near Tullamore are in their final year in the Munster academy. The first-year intake of five players includes two, Oisín Minogue and Tom Wood, fought their way into starting positions with the Irish 20s despite being a year young for the grade. Openside flanker Minogue got better with every opportunity through the Six Nations and then the World Championship in Italy, while Wood also demonstrated impressive composure and a tidy skill set to eventually claim the number 10 jersey in the maelstrom of a difficult season for the squad. They are joined by secondrow Conor Kennelly, prop Emmet Calvey and centre Eoghan Smyth. Five of Leinster’s nine strong first-year intake played for the Irish 20s last season – centres Connor Fahy and Ciarán Mangan, wing Páidí Farrell, prop Alex Mullan and secondrow Mahon Ronan. Todd Lawlor would have but for injury. Six of the newbies are backs. There are 71 academy players in total across the four provinces, broken down to Leinster (20), Munster (18), Ulster (17) and Connacht (16), of which 27 are first years next season. Leinster and Ulster contracted more backs than forwards, while the reverse was the case for Munster and Connacht. Leinster promoted eight academy players to senior contracts next season, Munster five, Ulster three and Connacht one in Finn Treacy. Tadhg Brophy (scrumhalf) The Kildare native played rugby at club and school in Newbridge, GAA for Kilcullen and the talented scrumhalf has been capped at age-grade level by Leinster and Ireland, as well as with the Irish Under-20s and the senior Irish Sevens.

The 6ft 2in centre is a brilliant prospect and has been capped at age-grade level by Leinster and by Ireland. Connor Fahy (centre) Winner of a McMullen Cup with Good Counsel College, New Ross, he started rugby with Wexford Wanderers, before representing Enniscorthy RFC in the All-Ireland League while studying for his Leaving Cert.

He represented Leinster and Ireland at Under-18s and Under-19s, while his father Phil is a former Leinster and Ireland number eight. Ciarán Mangan (centre/wing) Younger brother of Leinster’s Diarmuid, he is another who took the pathway from Naas RFC to Newbridge College. A talented underage GAA player, he lined out with the Sallins club in Kildare. An Irish 20s stalwart he played in the recent Six Nations and World Championships. Lee Fitzpatrick (hooker) Started his rugby in Portarlington RFC, and went to school in Roscrea, before moving to Newbridge College. Having already represented Leinster and Ireland at Under-18s level, he played for the latter against South Africa and Georgia last summer. Alex Mullan (tighthead prop) He played minis in Blackrock before heading down the road from Stradbrook to the school. He lists IRFU underage scrum guru Séamus Toomey as having a huge influence. His uncle played representative rugby for Spain. Has represented Leinster and Ireland at age-grade level and played for the Under-20s for two years. Mahon Ronan (secondrow) Played GAA growing up with St Fechin’s in Louth, but it was in Boyne RFC where he nurtured his love of rugby. A cousin of former Leinster, Munster and Ireland flanker Niall, Mahon was a member of the Irish Under-20s this season and has played for Leinster A.

Noted for his dominant ball carrying and tackling. Daniel Green (outhalf) Identified through the IQ Rugby programme, where he previously played with Sale Sharks and England at underage level. Studying at and playing with Queen’s Green was a standout player for the Irish 20s even when playing out of position at fullback. Josh Gibson (winger/fullback) A former Ulster Schools Senior Cup winner with RBAI, he made the step up to senior rugby with Banbridge this season. An elusive back-three player with a strong kicking game, he played for the Ireland Under-19s, where he scored tries in both games against France last April. Aitzol Arenzana-King (winger) Joining from the Leinster academy, he was part of the Richie Murphy-coached Ireland Under-20 Grand Slam-winning team in 2022, where he played alongside Scott Wilson, Lorcan McLoughlin and Jude Postlethwaite.

Bobby Power (flanker) The openside flanker was a regular starter in Neil Doak’s Ireland Under-20 side during both the Six Nations and World Cup campaigns. The former Coláiste Iognáid pupil plays his rugby with Galwegians in the AIL. Dan Ryan (fullback/wing/centre) He can play both wings, fullback and centre, and the former St Michael’s College pupil travelled to La Roche Sur Yon in April where he lined out for Ireland at Under-19 level, scoring two tries in an international against France last April. David Walsh (secondrow/backrow) Another ex-St Michael’s player and a Triunity student, the 6ft 6in secondrow played for the Ireland Under-20s this season in the Six Nations championship and the World Championship in Italy.

Title: Trump opens the door for crypto and private equity in your 401(k) plan

Watch CBS News August 7, 2025 / 7:48 PM EDT / CBS/AP President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that could allow millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts to invest in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency assets. The executive order doesn't immediately change how people will invest for retirement through their employer-sponsored accounts, as federal agencies would need to rewrite regulations to allow expanded investment choices. That's a process that experts say could take months, or longer, to complete. But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate. The move comes as the 401(k) has become the primary vehicle for American workers to save for retirement, with most employers offering a menu of investment choices among major asset classes, such as stock-based mutual funds. The $5 trillion private equity industry, which makes investments into private businesses rather than publicly traded stocks, has for decades wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans. At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump's 2024 campaign, has aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. "It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)'s," said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. "As fiduciaries realize bitcoin's risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we'll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes." The EO could give private equity and crypto firms long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. Investment companies applauded Mr. Trump's executive order, with TIAA, which manages the retirement assets of teachers, professors and other academics, and investing giant BlackRock saying they support the measure for providing a broader number of investment strategies to workers. "We believe end investors can benefit from the advantages that private investments can offer when embedded within professionally managed vehicles like target date funds or through guaranteed annuity products," TIAA said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch. The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules. Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA. Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street. Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold. Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for the major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are not likely to revise their retirement plan options quickly as well, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments are mainstream in an individual's retirement plan. The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected. Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with "extreme care" because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump's campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump's military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security. Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago. Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a "dream" of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, had agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Title: JUST IN – Trump Executive Order To Expand 401(k) Investment Options, Including Crypto

US President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order this Thursday that could shake up how Americans invest for retirement. The move would allow 401(k) plans to include a wider range of assets — like private equity, real estate, and yes, even cryptocurrency. The order, as reported by Bloomberg News, tells the Labor Department to take another look at the current rules under ERISA — that’s the Employee Retirement Income Security Act — and figure out how to give retirement plan administrators more room to include less traditional, higher-risk investments. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer has been tasked with working alongside the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other federal agencies to make this happen. The main goal? Give plan sponsors a clearer roadmap to offer more diverse investment options, without falling foul of the law. Donald Trump will sign an executive order that aims to allow private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency and other alternative assets in 401(k)s https://t.co/IXetIBnTzL — Bloomberg (@business) August 7, 2025 Right now, most of the $12 trillion sitting in 401(k)s is invested in good old-fashioned stocks and bonds. But with this new push, savers might soon get the option to invest in assets that were once out of reach. That said, it’s not as simple as just adding a few new buttons on a retirement dashboard. Offering private equity or crypto means plan administrators will have to show that they’ve done their homework — that the managers are qualified, the fees are fair, and that everything lines up with fiduciary standards. Supporters of the move argue that expanding into private markets could lead to better long-term returns, especially in times when public markets are lagging. Critics, however, worry about the downsides — like high fees, limited access to funds, and the risks that come with less liquid investments. Big players like Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR could benefit big-time from the change. In fact, BlackRock is already planning to roll out a new 401(k) fund with private investments in 2026. Empower Retirement is expected to launch similar offerings later this year. What really stands out in this executive order is its nod to crypto. It’s the latest in a series of moves that show Trump warming up to digital assets. Just this past summer, the White House hosted “Crypto Week,” discussed new rules for stablecoins, and even floated the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve. The new order reportedly asks the SEC to loosen restrictions that have kept crypto out of most retirement plans. If successful, this could open the door for Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other digital assets to become part of Americans’ retirement portfolios.

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/07/2025 3:19:37 PM PDT by JSM_Liberty U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that aims to allow private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency, and other alternative assets in 401(k) retirement accounts. The order smoothes the way for private equity and other fund managers to tap into trillions of dollars of Americans' retirement savings. It could open up a vast new funding source to managers of alternative assets outside of stocks, bonds, and cash, though critics say it also could bring too much risk into retirement investments. "The Securities and Exchange Commission must consider ways to facilitate access to alternative asset investments by participants in defined-contribution retirement plans," ... the White House said. It directs the Labor Secretary to consult with her counterparts at the Treasury Department, the SEC, and other federal regulators, and to "re-examine" previous guidance. Such a move could be a boon for big alternative asset managers such as Blackstone , KKR , and Apollo Global Management , by opening the $12-trillion market for retirement funds, known as defined contribution plans, to their investments. Some of those firms have already struck partnerships with asset managers who run those plans. The world's largest asset manager, BlackRock (BK.N) , plans to launch its own retirement fund that includes private equity and private credit assets next year. Proponents argue that younger savers can benefit from potentially higher returns on riskier investments in funds that get more conservative as they approach retirement. "On the asset manager side, it's a $12-trillion retirement market that they have previously not had access to. For them, there's certainly a lot of opportunity," said Morningstar analyst Jason Kephart.

Title: Trump opens 401(k)s to private equity. Here's how much to invest.

In the past, the private equity world has been largely populated by ultra-rich investors, endowments and pension funds. That is about to change. Retirement savers with 401(k) accounts are gaining access to the private investment market, which mostly pivots on privately held companies, rather than public ones. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, announced in June that it will offer a 401(k) target-date retirement fund that includes private investments, with a launch date in 2026. Another retirement giant, Empower, said in May that it will offer private investments in some workplace accounts later this year. Other retirement plan providers have made similar moves. And President Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 7 that calls for federal guidance on adding private investments and other "alternative assets" to 401(k) plans, effectively opening the door to those investments for retirement savers. "Alternative assets, such as private equity, real estate, and digital assets, offer competitive returns and diversification benefits," a new federal fact sheet states. "President Trump is expanding access to these assets to ensure a dignified and comfortable retirement for all Americans." Firms that invest in private assets are pushing to gain access to 401(k)s and other “defined-contribution” workplace retirement plans, a $12 trillion market. Private equity firms raise money to buy, manage and sell companies for profit. Investors are typically very wealthy individuals or institutions. The private credit marketplace loans money to companies or individuals outside the banking and fixed-income industries. Regular retirement savers haven’t had much access to private investments in the past. The minimum investment in a private equity fund might be in the millions, or at least the hundreds of thousands, according to Investopedia. Your money might be tied up for years. But there’s a reason wealthy investors and endowment managers like private equity funds. In recent decades, “They actually have done better than the stock market by 1 to 2 percentage points,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior adviser at The Motley Fool. Private equity yielded average annual returns of 10.5% from 2000 through 2020, Investopedia reports. Other estimates range higher. Private equity is considered a high-risk, high-return alternative to the stock market, which, of course, carries its own risks. “Why do wealthy people like it? Because it has the highest upside,” said Keith Singer, a certified financial planner in Boca Raton, Florida. Along with the upside comes a steep downside. Private companies face fewer regulations and reporting requirements than public ones. It can be hard to divine how much money a private company earns. “These are private companies, and with that comes less transparency,” Brokamp said. “That’s part of the reason people stay private: They don’t want to do all the regulatory filings that come with going public.” The number of public companies has dropped “by about half” since the mid-1990s, Brokamp said. Private companies tend to stay private longer and do public stock offerings later. Stocks carry risk, but a retirement saver who puts money in an S&P 500 index fund is “investing in some pretty well-established companies,” Brokamp said. Private equity, by contrast, often involves companies in distress. Bankruptcies run higher. “Private equity is riskier than public equity,” said Caleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia. “It’s more speculative in nature because you are investing in companies that, in some cases, have no proven track record.” Given the risk, Silver suggests an everyday retirement saver should not invest “more than 10% of your portfolio” in private investments: “It’s simply too risky.” Some of the emerging 401(k) offerings seem tailored to manage that risk. BlackRock, for example, plans to offer private investments within a broader target-date retirement fund. Target-date funds generally offer a mix of stocks, bonds and other investments, with the mix growing more conservative as you approach retirement. The new BlackRock fund would allocate only 5% to 20% of its holdings to private investments, with the quotient dropping as you age. Private equity tends to be illiquid: Investors generally see their money tied up for months or years. In a 401(k), by contrast, you can typically buy or sell investments daily. That should be less of a concern, though, when private equity sits in a target-date fund, which includes publicly traded investments that can be sold if an investor wants out. In 2020, the Trump Administration issued an “Information Letter” instructing that 401(k)-type retirement plans could invest in private equity without violating federal regulations. The law requires 401(k) managers to act in the best interest of investors, protecting them from large losses and excessive fees. The new executive order instructs federal agencies to make any regulatory changes necessary to allow for private investments and other alternative investments, including cryptocurrency. Some observers fear, however, that the risks of private investment may be too steep for everyday retirement savers. In June, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) penned a letter to the CEO of Empower about its plan to offer private investments in 401(k) accounts. “Given the sector’s weak investor protections, its lack of transparency, expensive management fees, and unsubstantiated claims of high returns, we are seeking information on how your company will ensure the safety of the billions of dollars of retirement savings it safeguards as it implements this program,” Warren wrote. Empower responded, in essence, that retirement savers deserve a crack at the lucrative private investment market, after decades of exclusion. “Empower believes in the democratization of private investing,” wrote Edmund F. Murphy III, the Empower CEO. Even so, leaders of the 401(k) industry will “feel more comfortable” about private investments if Congress approves legislation that explicitly allows it, said Thomas Gahan, managing director of Procyon Partners, a financial advisory firm in Shelton, Connecticut. Gahan spoke to USA TODAY before Trump signed the executive order. Gahan predicts more 401(k) providers will offer private investments as an option in the target-date funds, as BlackRock plans to do. “I think it’s a stepping stone,” he said. The 401k industry may eventually allow any retirement saver to invest in funds made up entirely of private investments, Gahan predicted earlier this year, but probably not without legislation that explicitly permits the investments – or an executive order from Trump.

The race is already on for the latest addition to the Irish athletics medal rush, Precious Akpe-Moses putting herself into contention by making the 100 metres final on day one of the European Under-20 Championships. Akpe-Moses stormed through her heat and semi-final during Thursday’s opening sessions in Tampere, Finland improving her lifetime best to 11.62 seconds when nailing her automatic final spot by finishing second in her semi-final. The younger sister of Gina Apke-Moses, who won this 100m title at the European Under-20 100m title back in 2017, her semi-final time improved her previous best of 11.64 and she’ll go into Friday’s final ranked fourth fastest overall. Racing in the third of three semi-finals, Apke-Moses needed to make the top two to ensure qualification, and did exactly that – the athlete from Blackrock AC, in Louth, finishing second to Uliana Stepaniuk from Ukraine, who is still only 17, and who improved her best to 11.50 when winning. Conor Kelly went into his 400m heat the top ranked under-20 in Europe, his 45.85 clocked at the Morton Games last month the only sub-46 second entry. The Finn Valley AC athlete, who turned 18 last month, qualified with ease, winning his heat in 46.94 seconds, clearly keeping plenty in reserve. Sean Doggett, from Athenry AC, also finished second in his heat in 47.59 to secure automatic qualification for Friday’s semi-finals. Cormac Dixon is also the top-ranked athlete in the 3,000m, running 7:56.59 indoors in the US earlier this season, and the Tallaght AC athlete also cruised through, finishing fourth in his heat in 8:19.80 – that final set for Saturday’s evening session. Cian Crampton, from Edenderry AC, made it safely through to Saturday’s final of the discus, ranked fourth overall with his best throws of 57.94m to finish second in Group A. A big performance from Theo Hanlon (Suncroft AC) in the men’s shot put qualifiers also landed him in the final, with a best of 18.00m. There were a couple of near misses, Gemma Galvin, from Ennis Track AC, flailing just short of making the 1,500m final after running 4:25.06 to finish seventh in her heat. She ended up ranked 13th overall, with the top 12 progressing. Oisin Lynch, from Killarney Valley AC, also missed out on a place in the 800m final, running 1:50.88 to finish fifth in his heat, while Ethan Dewhirst (Tir Chonaill AC) was disqualified for a false start in his 400m hurdles heat. In the 50 years since John Treacy claimed Ireland’s first medal in these championships, winning bronze in the 5,000m in Athens in 1975, plenty of other successful names have followed in his footsteps, including Mark Carroll, Ciara Mageean, Sarah Lavin, Sarah Healy, Kate O’Connor and Rhasidat Adeleke. In the last month alone, Irish athletes have won 11 international medals, Kate O’Connor winning gold in the heptathlon at the World University Games, before Nicola Tuthill added silver in the hammer. Tuthill also won the silver medal at the European Under-23 Championships in Bergen, Norway, one of four Irish athletes to win medals there, along with Anika Thompson (gold in the 10,000m and bronze in the 5,000), Nick Griggs (silver in the 5,000m) and Eimear Maher (bronze in the 1,500m). At the European Youth Olympics in Skopje, North Macedonia last month, another four Irish athletes won medals: Erin Friel and Ben Sykes won bronze in the 400m and 100m respectively, before Ellis McHugh and Joe Burke also won bronze in the 400m hurdles and 200m respectively. Elsewhere, Sarah Lavin was back in action days after winning her 10th Irish title in the 100m hurdles, and took another impressive win at the Serbia Athletics Meeting in Belgrade, which is part of World Athletics Continental Tour Bronze series, clocking 12.90 seconds.

Title: Trump clears way for alternate assets like private equity, crypto in 401(k)s

President Trump signed an executive order Thursday allowing alternative assets like private equity, cryptocurrency and real estate in 401(k)s. The order directs the Labor Department to review guidance around private market investments in retirement plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Trump’s directive smoothes the way for private equity and other fund managers to tap into trillions of dollars of Americans’ retirement savings. It could open up a vast new funding source to managers of alternative assets outside of stocks, bonds, and cash, though critics say it also could bring too much risk into retirement investments. “The order directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to facilitate access to alternative assets for participant-directed defined-contribution retirement savings plans by revising applicable regulations and guidance,” the White House official said on condition of anonymity. Such a move could be a boon for big alternative asset managers such as Blackstone, KKR and Apollo Global Management by opening the $12-trillion market for retirement funds, known as defined contribution plans, to their investments. Some of those firms have already struck partnerships with asset managers who run those plans. The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, plans to launch its own retirement fund that includes private equity and private credit assets next year. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update.

Empower, the second-largest retirement plan provider in the US, said it’s joining asset managers like Apollo to start allowing private assets in some accounts later this year. Bitcoin, the world’s top cryptocurrency, was aboout more than 2% to $116,819.60 shortly after Trump signed the order at around 3:50 p.m. ET. Trump ordered Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer to work with federal regulatory agencies like the Treasury Department and Securities and Exchange Department – the latter of which was asked to facilitate access to alternative assets. During Trump’s first term, the Labor Department issued fresh guidance allowing private market exposure in 401(k) plans. Since his return to the White House, officials have been weighing whether to ease some of the legal concerns that have long kept alternative assets out of retirement plans, which consist mostly of stocks and bonds. Allowing private assets in 401(k)s gives savers more investment options and could result in greater returns, proponents have argued. Critics contend these assets are risky and could leave retirement plan administrators vulnerable to lawsuits. The order follows Trump’s campaign pledge to make the US “the crypto capital” of the world. He recently signed into law the first piece of legislation regulating stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, and in March issued an executive order calling for the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Trump’s White House includes venture capitalist David Sacks of San Francisco-based firm Craft Ventures, who serves as the first-ever AI and crypto czar. His administration has taken a friendlier approach to regulating the industry, dismissing and putting on pause lawsuits and probes that target crypto giants like Coinbase and Robinhood. The Trump family is involved in several crypto ventures of its own, including a sizable stake in crypto firm World Liberty Financial, investments in a bitcoin-mining company and Trump- and Melania-branded memecoins.

Quality journalism. Progressive values. Direct to your inbox. U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on July 31, 2025. "Stuffing private equity, crypto, and other 'alternative assets' into 401(k)s is about propping up scams and bailing out an industry that's run out of buyers," said one critic. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that would allow private equity and cryptocurrencies into Americans' 401(k)s, appeasing corporate interests that lobbied for the change and disregarding warnings about the risks it poses to retirement accounts. Citing an unnamed senior White House official, CNN reported that "the order calls for the Labor Department and Securities and Exchange Commission to issue guidance to employers about providing access to those alternative investments in their retirement accounts." The private equity industry has been working for years to gain access to a portion of the roughly $12 trillion that Americans have saved in workplace retirement plans. "This is the holy grail for private equity," Axios reported Thursday, noting that federal rules currently bar most defined-contribution plans from investing in private equity and crypto. Both industries spent big on the 2024 election; the investment management behemoth BlackRock, whose CEO has advocated opening 401(k)s to private equity, donated to Trump's inaugural committee. James Baratta and Whitney Curry Wimbish noted in The American Prospect earlier this year that "there was added desperation from the industry" for access to 401(k)s "because of their dire need for cash amid weakening performance and fewer deals." "Some firms have begun mortgaging their own funds for money to pay out limited partners," they added. "Retail investors represented trillions in untapped potential." "Private equity executives have enriched themselves by the billions, taking high fees and other charges from working people's hard-earned retirement savings in pension funds." Helaine Olen, managing editor at the American Economic Liberties Project and a longtime personal finance columnist, said in a statement Thursday that "stuffing private equity, crypto, and other 'alternative assets' into 401(k)s is about propping up scams and bailing out an industry that's run out of buyers—and it's being done at the expense of Americans' retirements everywhere." "There's a reason most employers didn't bite when Trump tried this the first time and why the private investments industry has put on such a thick lobbying campaign," said Olen. "These funds are high-fee, risky, and opaque. Private equity consistently underperforms the S&P 500. This is a windfall for billionaire fund managers and a disaster in the making for regular Americans trying to save for retirement." Last week, the Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund and American Federation of Teachers released a report warning that if private equity is given a foothold in 401(k)s, "millions of workers saving for retirement would be exposed to higher risks and steep fees in products that lack basic investor protections and transparency requirements." The report found that private equity profitability "has been in a year-over-year decline" for the past two decades and that "fee structures—paid directly by investors or indirectly through portfolio companies—are prone to extensive manipulation." Lisa Donner, co-executive director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, said that "private equity executives have enriched themselves by the billions, taking high fees and other charges from working people's hard-earned retirement savings in pension funds." "Now they want fees from the trillions of dollars in individual retirement accounts," Donner added, "putting millions of more people at risk."

The largest active shareholder in Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ), Two Seas Capital, will vote no on its pending acquisition by AI neocloud provider CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV), according to a press release from investment manager Two Seas Capital. The firm said that the acquisition terms—an un-collared, all-stock exchange—leaves Core Scientific investors exposed to CoreWeave share-price volatility without price protection. Enjoying the read? Get our newsletter directly to your inbox on all things Bitcoin-equities by clicking here. Two Seas said the consideration “materially undervalues” Core Scientific and “unnecessarily” shifts economic risk to its existing shareholders. It cited the roughly 30% decline in Core Scientific’s share price in the days after the July announcement as evidence of broader investor concern. Two Seas Capital claims to own 6.3% of Core Scientific’s outstanding stock. While Vanguard and Blackrock are the largest shareholders in Core Scientific with 9.14% and 7.8% stakes, respectively, these institutions are considered passive investors since they hold CORZ shares for certain indices. Conversely, Two Seas is considered an active investor because it is actively trading shares of CORZ and intends to vote with these shares. As of the end of Q1-2025, Two Seas reported roughly 2.7% ownership of Core Scientific; if the company does own 6.3% now as it claims, it must file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) within 10 days of increasing its holdings to conform with the SEC’s 5% beneficial ownership reporting threshold. Notably, Two Seas Capital also owns CoreWeave shares, and while its supports the strategic decision to combine the two datacenter operators, it said the current terms favor CoreWeave “decidedly and unfairly.” “Core Scientific – with its significant scale, ready access to low-cost power, and data center talent – is uniquely positioned to meet this growing demand and has a clear runway to compound growth for many years,” the firm said in a statement. Two Seas Capital intends to solicit other Core Scientific shareholders to reject the transaction and will lodge a definitive proxy statement with the SEC ahead of the company’s special meeting. The investment manager will distribute proxy materials once filed. As of 6 August 2025, Two Seas Capital and affiliated funds also owned 77,038 CoreWeave class A shares and held an indirect economic interest in 395,124 additional CoreWeave shares through a private investment vehicle. The group disclosed long call options on 5,722,300 Core Scientific shares and short call options on 1,700,000 shares, along with cash-settled swaps referencing 500,000 shares. If the current agreement is not amended to address valuation and structural issues, Two Seas said it is prepared to vote its stake against the deal and encourage other investors to do the same. The firm added that it would accept bids from CoreWeave or other parties, provided the consideration reflects Core Scientific’s strategic value.

Title: Oligarch’s Heirs Reveal US Fund Bets in Family Office Revamp

Time Published: 2025-08-07T17:02:30Z
Full Content:
Badri Patarkatsishvili’s family set up a firm to manage his multibillion-dollar fortune after the mustachioed Georgian tycoon died suddenly at his English mansion in 2008. As his heirs fended off opportunists seeking a slice of the billionaire’s assets, the money manager kept a low profile, offering few details of how it handled the wealth he amassed alongside fellow oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich following the collapse of the Soviet Union. That’s starting to change. The Patarkatsishvilis’ family office, Bili Capital, has revealed more than two dozen bets on funds from some of the biggest names in global finance, including BlackRock Inc. and Ares Management Corp., on a recently launched website. Patarkatsishvili’s 70-year-old widow, Inna, the de facto head of the family after his death, also ceded her stake in the firm within the past year, registry filings show. That move coincides with the resolution of a long-running legal battle over the fortune of Georgia’s one-time richest man, and has separately led to Inna’s son-in-law, Yevhen Hunyak, 51, becoming Bili Capital’s only shareholder. As a result, a second-generation member is now in sole control of one of London’s biggest — and historically most discreet — family offices for the first time. A representative for the Patarkatsishvili dynasty, who describe Bili Capital as a multi-generational family office overseeing more than $1 billion in assets, didn’t respond to requests for comment. The disclosures give rare insight into one of the biggest fortunes to emerge from Russia’s so-called “wild ‘90s” as the country transitioned from communism to a market-based economy. They also make the once-secretive Bili Capital more transparent than many other family offices, whose public profiles often comprise a single-page website with little information. At least one-fifth of individuals among the world’s 500 biggest fortunes now have a family office that help to oversee wealth totaling more than $4 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bili Capital’s “transparency on what they’re doing makes them much more accessible, and relatable, to the outside world,” said David Hawkins, founder of Cliveden Advisory, a strategic consulting and reputation-management firm for ultra-wealthy individuals. “They likely want to do more deals.” Bili Capital’s other fund allocations include Silicon Valley venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, index-fund pioneer Vanguard and Mubadala-backed Fortress Investment Group. It also oversees direct stakes in a Georgia theme park, a mineral-water company and a real estate developer serving Miami’s Fisher Island enclave for the ultra-wealthy. ‘The Muscle’ Patarkatsishvili began to build his fortune in the early 1990s when he teamed up with Berezovsky, one of the most influential oligarchs of that decade, to run car dealership LogoVaz. The pair later partnered with Abramovich to help establish Russian oil giant Sibneft out of state-owned assets, with Berezovsky leveraging his Kremlin connections and Patarkatsishvili keeping business relations running smoothly behind the scenes. “Berezovsky was the public face of their alliance, while Badri was the muscle,” said David Lingelbach, who headed Bank of America Corp.’s Russian operations during the 1990s and is now a professor of entrepreneurship at the University of Baltimore. “He’s such an interesting oligarch as everything about him was so opaque. He was one of the most powerful — if not the most powerful – person in Georgia.” In 2001, Abramovich acquired the Sibneft stakes owned by Patarkatsishvili and Berezovsky for more than $1 billion after their relationship with the Kremlin soured. Berezovsky later tried unsuccessfully to sue Abramovich over that deal in one of London’s most high-profile legal battles, before he was found dead at his own English mansion in 2013. Abramovich is worth $7.8 billion today, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. Bili Capital’s revamp comes after years of battles over the patriarch’s assets have receded, freeing his heirs to focus on what’s left of the fortune. Since his death, the family has been entangled in several cases, including a $3 billion claim in 2008 by Berezovsky, who alleged that a portion of his former business partner’s holdings — often stashed in secretive tax havens — rightfully belonged to him. Berezovsky withdrew his claim four years later, while the family also successfully fended off a distant relative positioning themselves as Patarkatsishvili’s heir. Another case dating to 2016 wrapped up this year at the UK’s highest court. By some estimates, the family has recovered at least $2 billion of Patarkatsishvili’s assets, though that’s just a fraction of what his overall wealth was believed to be at the time of his death. Branding Strategy Founded in December 2008, Bili Capital is led by Chief Executive Officer Sergey Ershikov and Chief Financial Officer Ilia Demidov, who both previously worked at Russian lender Alfa-Bank. Like other family offices, the closely held firm isn’t regulated as it doesn’t manage money for external investors, limiting transparency requirements. Allocating to funds instead of striking deals under its own name also allows it to keep a low profile, while its longtime holding entity is in Jersey, a low-tax territory neighboring the UK that offers exemptions from publicly disclosing consolidated accounts. A 2022 job posting for Bili Capital cited further assets including a yacht, a fleet of vehicles and several European homes, underscoring how the firm caters to both the financial affairs and jet-setting lifestyle of its owners. The online post also described the firm developing a “branding” strategy, signaling how it has been considering its public image for years. “Reputational capital is important,” said Hawkins, who also advises family offices. “It’s a necessary form of insurance.” In a section entitled “Meet our family,” Bili Capital’s website features a black-and-white image of Inna accompanied in a countryside setting by her two daughters: Liana, 45, the founder of an arts production company, and Iya, 42, a human rights activist. Iya’s husband Hunyak, the co-founder of a private children’s dental group and Bili Capital’s sole shareholder since September, stands to the right of the three women with a small gap between them. The group are all smiling, with no trace of their past traumas. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Title: Questioning the Corporation

Yves here. It’s frustrating to see a piece that presents itself as well researched get information important to its argument wrong. I still recommend the article below by John Ruehl because it provides a detailed discussion of the growth and development of the corporate form, going back to precursors in the Roman Republic. However, when he gets to the modern era, he makes some glaring error which ironically undermine his effort to depict modern large corporations as dangerously unaccountable to the public’s interest. First, Ruehl perpetuates the canard that corporations exist to serve shareholders, citing a too-often invoked Michigan ruling. In fact, shareholders are residual claimants. All others from the supplier to employees to the landlord to the taxman come ahead. We’ve debunked this idea long form many times. Hoisting from a 2014 post: One of my pet peeves is the degree to which the notion that corporations exist only to serve the interests of shareholders is accepted as dogma and recited uncritically by the business press. I’m old enough to remember when that was idea would have been considered extreme and reckless. Corporations are a legal structure and are subject to a number of government and contractual obligations and financial claims. Equity holders are the lowest level of financial claim. It’s one thing to make sure they are not cheated, misled, or abused, but quite another to take the position that the last should be first. As we wrote last year: If you review any of the numerous guides prepared for directors of corporations prepared by law firms and other experts, you won’t find a stipulation for them to maximize shareholder value on the list of things they are supposed to do. It’s not a legal requirement. And there is a good reason for that. Directors and officers, broadly speaking, have a duty of care and duty of loyalty to the corporation. From that flow more specific obligations under Federal and state law. But notice: those responsibilities are to the corporation, not to shareholders in particular…Shareholders are at the very back of the line. They get their piece only after everyone else is satisfied. If you read between the lines of the duties of directors and officers, the implicit “don’t go bankrupt” duty clearly trumps concerns about shareholders… So how did this “the last shall come first” thinking become established? You can blame it all on economists, specifically Harvard Business School’s Michael Jensen. In other words, this idea did not come out of legal analysis, changes in regulation, or court decisions. It was simply an academic theory that went mainstream. And to add insult to injury, the version of the Jensen formula that became popular was its worst possible embodiment. One good source for the fact that economists, rather than legal decisions, were the basis for the acceptance of this idea, is a 2005 article by Frank Dobbin and Dirk Zorn, “Corporate Malfeasance and the Myth of Shareholder Value.” This paper looked back to the 1970s, the era of diversified and often underperforming firms (remember the conglomerate discount?). Deregulation, high inflation, and a lax attitude towards anti-trust enforcment stoked a hostile takeover boom. Economists celebrated this development as disciplining chief executives and moving assets into the hands of managers who could operate them more productively. In reality, the success of these early deals depended mainly on asset sales, both of non-core operations and of hidden sources of value, like corporate real estate, as well as leverage and slashing bloated head office staffs (the across-the-company headcount efforts became more prominent in the 1990s). Later in that post, we describe the seminal role of an internally inconsistent New York Times op-ed in 1970 in starting this ideological ball rolling. Another serious sour note is when Ruehl depicts the like of BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard as wielding enormous influence with corporations. Earth to base, they don’t. These huge shareholders are indexers. Their business in index replication at the lowest cost. They don’t sell shares because they don’t like how a company is run. They might lighten up because its price falls and so it represents a smaller amount of the index. On top of that, all of these giant fund managers compete for the lucrative 401 (k) business of public companies. Think they are going to sabotage getting those mandates by pressuring the C-Suite? Even for active manager, this idea of investor influence was eviscerated in Amar Bhide’s classic Harvard Business Review article, Efficient Markets, Deficient Governance. Aside from a small cohort of activist fund managers (aka greenmmail artists), even a big fund manager will not hold a large enough position of a public company to make it worth the bother to get them to shape up. It’s easier to sell a stock whose management is doing things you don’t like. One proof of the impotence of big shareholders: In 2009, investors got wind of Goldman’s intent to pay staff big bonuses. They were opposed, seeing it as a slap in the face to taxpayers who’d bailed them out. A group visited CEO LLoyd Blankfein to tell him they strongly opposed the plan. Blankfein went ahead anyhow. So the real scandal here is not investor influence. It’s an agency problem, that top executives control corporate assets and influence the fate of employees and communities, yet for the most part are accountable only to themselves. By John P. Ruehl, an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022. Produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute Home to almost 70 percent of Fortune 500 companies, Delaware’s reputation as America’s “corporate capital” has faced challenges in recent years. Tesla’s and SpaceX’s high-profile exits to Texas in 2024highlighted other cracks in Delaware’s seamless relationship with large corporations, compounded by other states jockeying to attract businesses. Delaware’s government has launched a legislative charm offensive in response, passing several amendments in March 2025, which have eased restrictions on insider deals and reinforced the state’s commitments to low taxes and a business-friendly legal framework. Corporations can be created in minutes almost anywhere, yet all share a core identity as legal entities with rights and responsibilities. Over time, they have replaced religious institutions and political parties as the most powerful actors in society, largely shaping what we consume, how we work, and influencing behavior and social norms. Their modern form traces back to 17th-century charters, with roots in Roman law. Though often tools of the state, global corporations have proven capable of operating across borders and legal systems, developing unprecedented sovereignty and power. The benefits of corporations, including lower prices from scale, capital-driven innovation and efficiency, and global reach, have been undermined by the relentless accumulation of financial assets, particularly in the West. Short-term gains often supersede long-term value and sustainability, and despite stronger regulation on paper, modern corporations operate with greater independence from the state and increasingly avoid public accountability. The basic model behind them remains intact, with core legal principles like limited liability and separate legal personality, stemming from early corporate charters from the 1600s and fully developed by the 1800s, still forming the corporate foundation despite enormous growth in their scale and influence. Over the years, calls for democratic renewal and institutional imagination have been mounting, pointing to a long-overdue rethinking of corporate power. Building up to and Defining the Corporation Before modern corporations, societies around the world developed institutions to pool capital and dilute risk for trade, construction, and investment. In the Roman Republic, societas publicanorum had transferable shares (partes), professional managers, and central offices, and bid on state contracts for tax collection and infrastructure. However, Roman law allowed any partner to dissolve the business at will, limiting their longevity, and these types of partnerships faded under the empire’s centralized bureaucracy. After 313 CE, following the Edict of Milan, which legalized Christianity, the Catholic Church gained legal standing that helped it become one of Europe’s first enduring corporate-like entities. By the eighth century, European monarchs began issuing charters that bestowed privileges to monasteries, universities, towns, and tax collection, while guilds of merchants and artisans also emerged in the 11th century. This century also saw the emergence of the commenda in Italy, which allowed passive investors to fund merchant voyages for a share of the profits, an early form of limited liability that spread across Europe. Family banking dynasties from Florence emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, building pan-European financial networks and eventually expanding to other industries like mining and manufacturing. Similar models developed globally. The commenda is believed to be inspired by Islamic qiradpartnerships that began in the sixth century, where one party provided the capital and the other conducted trade. Beginning in the 1600s, large family firms in China thrived with imperial support. Maritime guilds thrived in Southeast Asian port cities like Majapahit and Srivijaya. Still, it was in Europe, where Roman and Canon Law fused, that legal innovation evolved most dramatically and took on the modern corporate form by the 17th century. Before the rise of modern corporations, most businesses were family-run shops, temporary partnerships, or informal arrangements that lacked legal separation from their owners. What earlier institutions lacked was the five features defining the modern corporation; representation allowing designated agents to act on behalf of the firm without binding investors; entity-shielding protecting corporate assets from the debts of investors; capital lock-in preventing investors from pulling funds or forcing liquidation; transferable shares letting investors exit without disrupting operations; and limited liability ensuring investors aren’t personally responsible for corporate debts. The most foundational corporate characteristic is a legal personality, the ability to exist separately from its owners, with its own rights and responsibilities. From the Latin corpus (“body”), this concept lends context to former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s controversial 2011 remark that “corporations are people.” These features enable corporations to attract capital, own property, sign contracts, and avoid dissolution with membership changes. They vary widely from public to private, with tradable or restricted shares, and can be state-owned, profit-driven, or mission-based. But nearly all corporations share these core traits, which have been used by some to build the most flexible, powerful, and enduring institutions ever created. The Dutch and British East India Trading Companies The Dutch East India Company (VOC), founded in 1602, is widely considered the first modern multinational corporation. Though joint-stock ventures had existed earlier (mostly as short-term partnerships for single voyages), the VOC stood apart by introducing permanent capital, tradable shares, and a form of limited liability, attracting strong investment. As maritime trade and colonialism expanded over the previous century, long-term capital was increasingly required for risky, lucrative ventures in spices, textiles, and tea. The VOC met this demand by locking in investment, limiting shareholder exposure, and providing an orderly way to exit. Backed by the Dutch state, it merged competing firms into a single entity with centralized management, enabling it to scale up with unprecedented freedom. Dutch political institutions also played a role in the VOC’s power. As a new republic, the Netherlands offered investors protection from royal interference. Unlike other European countries where royal families funded and closely monitored colonial expeditions, the VOC operated with more autonomy. It received a perpetual charter and became the first company listed on a stock exchange, and was empowered to sign treaties, raise armies, and wage war, all while shielding shareholders from personal accountability. Despite collapsing in 1799 due to debt and corruption, it pioneered a corporate form unlike anything before. Two years before the VOC’s founding, its counterpart, the English East India Company (EIC), was formed in 1600. The EIC didn’t obtain permanent capital until 1657 and was slower to adopt liquidity. But the English Civil War curbed royal power after 1657, allowing it to evolve in ways that mirrored the VOC. The Bank of England, founded as a corporation in 1694, helped stabilize credit lines and made it easier for the EIC and other corporations to raise capital. The EIC eventually came to colonize and rule large parts of India, establishing a civil service and even clashing militarily with the VOC. Yet its power drew intense scrutiny. Following the Bengal Famine of 1770, the English parliament passed the Regulating Act of 1773 and Pitt’s India Act of 1784, curbing the EIC’s powers. The company was finally dissolved in 1874. “In 1857, the Indians rose in revolt against high-handed and oppressive Company rule… The Company lost all its administrative powers following the Government of India Act of 1858, and its Indian possessions and armed forces were taken over by the Crown. … The East India Company itself was formally dissolved by Act of Parliament in 1874,” according to the UK Parliament website. Though the VOC’s model was emulated by the EIC and influenced commercial ventures elsewhere in Europe, such corporations remained a form of special incorporation granted by state charter, not open to anyone. This exclusivity began to loosen over time, but the South Sea Bubble crash of 1720, seen as the first major financial crash, triggered fears of economic instability and unchecked corporate power. In response, governments reimposed strict controls, requiring corporations to obtain specific approval and follow stringent guidelines. Corporations proved essential during Britain’s industrial revolution, which began in the late 1700s. To support economic growth, parliament introduced reforms: the Joint Stock Companies Regulation and Registration Act of 1844 allowed businesses to register without special legislation, while the Limited Liability Act of 1855 extended legal protections to shareholders. These reforms, combined with Britain’s access to capital markets and imperial power, kick-started rapid corporate expansion in Europe. Arriving late to maritime trade, the Dutch and English drove corporate innovation to keep up with other European powers. Politicians supported corporate growth, benefiting from lucrative shares in the monopolies they helped create. But the VOC and EIC demonstrated the promise and peril of corporations. They could generate wealth and wield power beyond what states alone could achieve, but they also bred corruption and posed political threats. European leaders, therefore, aimed to harness the benefits of corporations while limiting their power by closely tying them to government control. The United States and the Modern Corporate Form Early British joint-stock companies like the Virginia Company planted the first corporate seeds in North America in the early 17th century. But while European models like the VOC and EIC inspired early colonial enterprises, the corporate form developed more slowly in the U.S. after independence, in both scale and structure. Shaped by a deep-rooted “distrust” of monopolies and state-chartered privilege, and wary of corporations as instruments of elite power and financial instability, many Americans didn’t trust companies that had special deals with the government. Instead, they preferred smaller, more personal business models like family-run shops, partnerships between a few people, or joint-stock ventures where people pooled money but didn’t have the legal structure of modern corporations that offered them protections. The early U.S. enterprises also lacked strong, centralized authority and consistent legal protections, especially for property and contracts, and many investors in states like Florida, Texas, and California avoided corporate structures until they were included in the U.S. Constitution. Yet this decentralized system ultimately gave corporations room to grow. Without strong federal control, states competed to attract businesses by loosening incorporation requirements. New York led with the first general incorporation law for manufacturers in 1811, with other states soon following and expanding the scope of the law. The vast, unexploited North American landmass and push for industrialization made the corporate structure increasingly attractive, further aided by America’s quicker and widespread adoption of limited liability and lighter state oversight compared to Europe. While state legislatures tried to regulate corporations with rules on capitalization, voting rights, and director terms, these measures proved mostly ineffective. Corporations amassed enormous influence, with “company towns” illustrating their growing control over local economies and governance. Corporate imperialism returned under an American banner, with the United Fruit Company, which controlled enormous banana plantations in Central America and used its political influence to overthrow governments. These towns still exist in some shape or form today. “The original coal and textile towns in America are now largely ghostly, but places like Hershey and Corning, New York, which were invigorated by the Corning glass company, are still going strong. Plus, as the LA Times writes, businesses such as Google and Facebook today are providing housing, amenities, and transportation for their workers—meaning that while we think of company towns in sepia tones, they’re also in digital blue,” statesSmithsonian magazine. In The Visible Hand, Alfred D. Chandler Jr. suggests that the dominance of American corporations by the 20th century was due to their managerial hierarchies rather than entrepreneurs, which provided them with stability, coordination, and centralized planning. This is partly supported in The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea, which argues that robber barons were replaced by “the faceless manager” and the multidivisional firm. By the 1930s, legal scholar Adolf A. Berle and economist Gardiner C. Means, whose work shaped modern corporate governance theory, warned that dispersed shareholders had lost control to entrenched managers and called for reforms in corporate oversight. The 1919 Dodge v. Ford case had already enshrined shareholder primacy in U.S. law, declaring that directors must prioritize shareholder profits. But rather than democratizing ownership, the rise of institutional investors, like pension and mutual funds, and other financial giants, further concentrated power among select shareholders. By the end of the 20th century, globalization offered American corporations, as well as others, a platform to dominate beyond natural borders. The American corporate model became the ruling template in a worldwide ecosystem, largely controlled by shareholder interests and executive compensation tied to quarterly earnings pressures. The Growing Power of Corporations Over time, corporations have become the dominant business entities. Despite only representing 18 percent of U.S. businesses, corporations generate nearly 82 percent of all revenues. Around 20,000 large corporations employ as many people as the 31.7 million small businesses, according to the 2024 data provided by payment processor company Clearly Payments. Many of them now function as monopolies or organized cartels. In the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case, the Supreme Court affirmed that corporations have First Amendment rights, including the right to “use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech.” Borderless by design, major corporations drive a race to the bottom for cheap international labor and pass sustainability costs onto consumers. Countries often lack the strength to rein them in, and where they can, corporations simply exploit tax havens and flexible jurisdictions. As economist Lynn A. Stout observed, outdated yet profitable business practices like shareholder primacy are hard to shake. Accountability and sustainability appear largely ignored, with corporations long prioritizing profit over public safety. Asbestos manufacturers suppressed evidence of its deadly health effects to keep selling their products. Tobacco firms knowingly misled the public about cancer risks for decades.Purdue Pharma, owned by the Sackler family, used its LLC status and shell corporations to dodge accountability for the opioid crisis. According to an Associated Press investigation, “the Sacklers’ wealth is shielded in a web of companies and trusts, some registered in offshore tax havens far from Purdue’s Connecticut headquarters,” states a 2019 article by CBS News. Calls for corporate responsibility have grown as the power of corporations has increased. The corporate social responsibility movement began with philanthropy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and resurged in the 1970s. Beginning in the mid-2000s, ESG and stakeholder activism sought to revive this initiative, but became politicized and have waned, even as corporate influence continues to grow. As “universal owners” of the economy, institutional investors like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street control vast shares and command corporate influence. While it was hoped their broad holdings would make them stewards of the economy, short-term thinking and weak oversight continue to limit meaningful action like prioritizing long-term sustainability, fair labor practices, and avoiding hoarding wealth. Corporations are wielding new tools of dominance through AI and digital technologies. “Companies such as Walmart, Tyson Foods, Koch Industries, Maersk, Siemens, and Unilever are using AI tools to swiftly find and engage with alternative suppliers during unexpected disruptions. They are also employing AI tools to pre-qualify suppliers ahead of time. These AI tools provide buyers with enhanced information that allows them to beat their competitors in securing alternate sources of supplies,” points out a Harvard Business Review 2023 article. They can also deflect accountability through PR campaigns, obscure controversies through complex supply chains and legal structures, and offload responsibility to subsidiaries, contractors, or consumers. Combined with the growing use of private military and security contractors, some modern corporations operating in unstable or contested regions are regaining a degree of coercive power reminiscent of the colonial-era trading giants. The core problem is that while we retain some voice in the political system, that influence doesn’t extend to massive corporate structures. “Voting with our wallets” offers little power when essential services are dominated by a handful of interconnected firms. Reform While the corporate model dominates, alternatives continue to evolve. In early 20th-century China, corporate law was weakly enforced, and corporations were uncommon. Today, China exerts control over both state-owned and private corporations, embedding Chinese Communist Party officials into corporate governance. This hybrid model places corporate activity under tighter oversight, supported in part by nationwide social credit scores for all companies. President Teddy Roosevelt promoted trust-busting as the solution to corporate abuse by big business, but as economist Lawrence Mitchell notes, the prior era of fierce competition among smaller companies was also disastrous. He identified the real problem of states competing for corporate charters in a “race to the bottom,” a danger that Justice Louis Brandeis also noted in 1933. Roosevelt even acknowledged in 1902 that only the federal government could properly regulate interstate corporations, which Mitchell supports. So, how should governments regulate monopolies? Some countries have taken a more open approach to consolidation. The German government, for example, legalized collusion and cartel formation to control prices and output in ways that serve national interests, actively encouraging the attempted merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank since 2019. Cooperatives offer another path. The first successful cooperative, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, was founded in 1844 in the UK, championing democratic control, open membership, and profit-sharing. In Spain, the Mondragon Corporation, a federation of worker-owned cooperatives founded in 1956, has become the “leading business project in the Basque Country and one of the largest corporations in Spain.” Rather than lay off workers, Mondragon often reallocates them across its network. New reformist approaches are also emerging in Europe. France’s 2019 PACTE Act allows companies to define a social purpose beyond profit, embedding missions into corporate charters and expanding employee influence in mergers and executive oversight. Economist Mariana Mazzucato has promoted this mission-driven model as part of her vision for innovation-led governance. In the U.S., Delaware’s recent legislative push is part of a broader effort challenging shareholder primacy, notably since the 2019 Business Roundtable, where top CEOs pledged to serve all stakeholders. Delaware and other American states already allow businesses to register as benefit corporations (B-corps), balancing profits with goals like environmental protection or community development. Existing corporations can convert by amending their founding documents. CHS Inc., a major agricultural cooperative ranked 115th on the Forbes 500 list in 2025, meanwhile, demonstrates how cooperative principles still have traction in the country. It has emerged as one of the “largest farmer-owned cooperatives in the world.” Digital finance is also leading to experimentation in how businesses are owned and operated. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), for example, are blockchain-based communities with decentralized governance that make decisions by vote. Aiming for transparency and shared control, they face clear hurdles. Unclear legal status has slowed adoption, while security flaws, including a major 2016 breach, have seen millions stolen due to a code exploit. Governance challengesinclude low participation, power centralization, and slow decision-making. “In some high-profile DAOs, the majority of governance tokens are often held by the founders and early investors, which can skew decision outcomes in favor of their interests rather than the broader community,” states a blog by Colony, a platform providing a framework for DAOs. Not all innovation prioritizes the public good. The “Network State” concept, coined by tech entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan, envisions venture-backed private cities, colonies, and zones across the U.S., Latin America, Africa, and beyond. These digital-first enclaves aim for diplomatic recognition and eventual sovereignty through special economic zones, framing private microstates as expressions of libertarian freedom. Efforts to reduce shareholder power can also backfire by merely concentrating power in the hands of corporate managers rather than all stakeholders. Elon Musk is a clear example; by retaining large ownership stakes, employing dual-class shares, and keeping firms like X, Tesla, and SpaceX private or under holding structures, he has shielded himself from shareholder influence while consolidating control. The planned incorporation of Starbase, Texas, a township effectively governed by SpaceX, demonstrates how this management style can dovetail with Network State ambitions. Born in the Dutch Republic, matured in England, and transformed by the United States, the march of the modern corporation has proven remarkably resilient over the centuries. Hudson’s Bay Company, founded in 1670 as an English trading giant like the EIC, once controlled vast swaths of North America and now exists as a retail chain. Corporate power in general, however, continues to expand. After early overreach by the VOC and EIC prompted containment efforts, corporations have resurged through globalization, financialization, and advances in technology. Short-term profit maximization is seen as natural, with structures geared away from wider stakeholder responsibility. Many firms resist direct governance to escape the negative optics of being seen as too powerful, which would bring more scrutiny and accountability. Yet some corporations have grown so large that they have become pillars of modern society and carry significant responsibility, even if they do not openly acknowledge it. Without altering their growing influence, the future will be shaped less by democratic will through established channels and more by concentrated, private authority. ‘So, how should governments regulate monopolies?’ I’m sure that the Chinese have a few good ideas. If any of their billionaires get out of line and start muscling in on the government (cough*Jack Ma*cough), they tend to go missing. Sometimes they turn back up again. Sometimes they don’t. In reading this article, I was struck how he insisted that corporations must aim for ‘longevity’. But in one of John Michael Greer’s novels – “Retrotopia” – he mentioned that it was not always so. That for example a corporation might be set up to build a road, it would raise the funds needed, it would then use those funds to have the road built, set aside money for maintenance, and would then dissolve itself after having completed the purpose that it was set up for. That sounded so strange the first time I read that. Some of it may depend on the type of corporation. A couple of examples from the entertainment and real estate areas. in the entertainment industry it is not uncommon for there to be a production company formed strictly for the production of one movie or television show. Because of the way it is financed or distributed it is hard to tell when you look at the credits. (As they are involved in distribution it does allow for some leeway in getting satisfaction if there is a problem.) The real estate part I know of is that it is not unheard of for the bigger company to form a LLC (Limited Liability Corporation) to actually construct a building. After the building is built the LLC “sells” the building but it is always done that they continue to hold all responsibilities for the construction, but that is just for show as it ceases to exist. “Blankfein went ahead anyhow.” Sounds like Llyod could serve in any number of ‘representative’ elected offices. Interesting reading the background to the idea corporations have to but shareholders first. It always bugged me for two reasons. I mean General Electric couldn’t decide ro day that they were going to start importing and selling heroin as they thought it would give a better return to shareholders. Clearly they still have to follow the laws of the land of face the consequences. And secondly, even if it was the case that it was a legal requirement, so what? It’s nit a law of nature or of physics. It could only ever be a law of man and those can be changed. As I recall, some conservatives advocate that corporations should violate laws if the profits ensuing from violating the laws are larger than the associated penalty. Maybe this is a calculation done by citizens as well, so corporations would be following Citizens United into people hood. A country could enforce laws and set the penalties for law violation high enough to discourage societal harmful behaviors. But the USA seems to have harsh justice for little people with a policy of “friends don’t let friends do time” for the rich and connected. I never go over the Ford pardon of Nixon as the pardon was justified as healing to the nation and Nixon had “suffered enough”. . In an it will never happen desire, I desperately want there to be minimum fines attached to overcharging or embezzling the government. I recognize that the system has been gamed enough that they don’t even have to pay back the government (see the special master throwing out the DOJ case against United Health for overcharging Medicare by 2 billion dollars), but in my world not only would it be incumbent on United Health for proving that the various supposed treatments occurred and that the charges were accurate for those treatments. And if they weren’t they would be required to pay back the full amount plus an additional 50% of that amount just to keep their C suite executives out of jail. There should be no return on investment for deceiving customers and employees. AND bankruptcy law should be rewritten to have owner corporation continue to be on the stick for any lawsuits or liabilities from fraud or malfeasance of fully owned subsidiaries rather than allowing that to die with the bankruptcy of said subsidiary. Whenever I hear of a corporation skating in some manner, I remember that beacon of Republican responsibility prosecuting minor crimes in NY left and right (homeless people washing windshields, minor drug offenses, etc) because that was going to increase overall adherence to the law. I always compared it to the trickle down theory as in all profits go to the top and all penalties go to the bottom. It’s not really talked about much outside of law journals but all of the British colonies in America were set up as corporate entities, not just the Virginia Company. If you read the charters of each of them, it’s truly not far off from corporate organization documents of today. The legacy of this structure remains and it seems very anachronistic but I guess it’s all we got. +1 on the reform path of Cooperatives. Just change the bylaws of a corporation to one member = one share/vote, you bring in democracy and accountability of the management to the workers. And I know this may sound crazy, but if, in the same spirit and reasoning chattel slavery was made illegal, we could do the same to human rental (i.e. wage system), all corporations with employees would effectively have to become Worker-Cooperatives. Instead of Capital renting humans, Humans would rent capital, which makes much more sense. It’s a great path towards democracy….. The venerable Hudson’s Bay Company shuttered its last retail store just a few months ago. The end of an era. Fond memories of their iconic point blankets and clothing. I bought one of the point blankets a couple of years ago as a sort of nostalgic, ironic hat tip to the early days of Canadian colonization, well aware as I am of the horrors that came with it. They were not made in Canada — Yorkshire, I think. I have no love for the Weston family but they just bought the original HBC charter and are donating it to a museum. https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/the-mix/not-meant-to-be-manitoba-museum-reflects-as-bay-charter-heads-elsewhere-11049467 HBC was Canada’s East India Company, another example of colonialism at its worst. Very fine intro, Yves. A corporate charter was at one time simply a grant by the sovereign of limited liability to protect investors from being dragged underwater by a failing business concern. An investor might lose their share value in a business failure but their other assets were protected. This promoted investment in enterprises which benefitted the polity as a whole by building necessary infrastructure and providing employment. Under today’s system of Inverted Totalitarianism the corporations control the sovereign state through massive infusions of campaign cash while looting infrastructure and destroying employment in order to enrich corporate executives and officers encouraged by stock “incentive” compensation to game short-term performance through looting. Self-dealing executives and officers becoming major shareholders created an enormous conflict of interest. The “Last have become the First” negating the entire social justification for a sovereign grant of corporate status. All of which was proceeded by an ideology cut from/cobbled together and funded by Capital from bastardized theology aka TINA/Powell memo thingy … Thank you, Yves, for this article and the fine commentary. It’s indeed frustrating to see the zombie shareholder primacy myth making rounds, raising again from the dead to eat our brains. That’s specially true when the author even cites Lynn Stout, arguably the most important scholar to debunk this myth. But there’s one point I wanted to ask you for further thoughts, if you’d be kind enough to bear with me. I always thought that it was part of the plan for the ETF managers of the world (particularly BlackRock) to wield greater influence over big corporations. They certainly make loads of money with ETF on their own right, but when you index something like S&P500, you’re making sure you have the right stocks, i.e. of the corporations that actually matter right now. Ditto for oil, tech, whatever. It makes it much easier to coordinate a strategy among them. The common assumption is that Blackrock, Vanguard etc. are sitting on their hands with that much power on their hands. Although you’re right that they won’t sell the shares as a form of pressure, they can still vote as shareholders. Not selling their shares makes their threat more worrisome in this case. BlackRock became more notorious because it tried to do the old Whig/Democrat/liberal/”woke” thing of pretending to care about ESG etc. and, after this is accepted and normalized, legitimately exert its own illegitimate control for its own purposes. As the article noticed, the worst kind of push-back materialized (the Tory/Republican/”conservative” one); instead of pretending to care, we won’t even pretend anymore and outright burn anyone suggesting that we care about the environment, society, workers, consumers… Unfortunately, most of the evidence I have is my tin foil hat and the eternal lust for power of these groups. But you really think that the voting rights they get from significant proportions of shares in big companies is siting idle? I also don’t think I understood the 401(k) argument. Is it that corporations choose these institutional investors for managing the pension funds? Thanks for bearing with me! No, they will always vote with management (save extremely bad governance abuses) because they want the 401(k) business, which has vastly higher margins than running index funds. Tons of fees and grifting via how they handle trades by plan participants in and out of funds. Also the margins on index funds are too thin to support any kind of corporate lobbying. You actually have to have a reasoned position on important proxy issues. That takes staff. Indexers compete on the tightness of their index replication and having the lowest fees possible. Any extra expenses undermine competitiveness. A finer epitaph I know not … In full agreement as an owner of index mutual funds and ETFs. As an owner of Vanguard funds, my understanding of the corporate model is each fund exists as a entity with the fund share holders acting as beneficial owners, though I generally don’t vote or give a proxy for the annual meetings. The funds as a group own the actual “Vanguard” that provides all the services to the funds. As an investor, I mostly take an interest in managed funds when they want to pass resolutions changing the fundamental investing rules (what they can buy and hold). I have seen in the past efforts to allow funds to hold what I consider riskier holdings in order to goose short term returns. The link to the 1919 Dodge v. Ford case was interesting. Yves, great intro! The pep talks we got from upper management about “shareholder values” always made more sense when one substituted “my bonus”. And once all my co-workers saw how they were implementing these “shareholder values”, we realized that had morphed into “bone us”. Your email address will not be published.
