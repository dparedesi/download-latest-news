BlackRock, America’s largest asset manager which handles over $11 trillion in assets, has agreed to purchase two ports on either end of the Panama Canal. BlackRock is buying the ports from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison in a deal worth about $22.8 billion. The announcement of the deal comes as President Donald Trump has made threats against Panama over China’s involvement in the canal. The president has said the U.S. never should’ve handed over control of the canal in the 1970s after building the canal in the early 20th century. And Trump has even suggested the canal would be taken by force in necessary. Trump boasted in an address to Congress on Tuesday night that the U.S. was “reclaiming the Panama Canal,” without giving details about who was actually buying the ports there. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals,” Trump said. The part he left out? BlackRock is doing the buying, a company that’s not too popular with Trump’s base. The far-right often casts BlackRock as part of a “globalist” cabal controlling the world, commentary that often surfaces anti-semitic memes about Trump’s business connections. “It was given away by the Carter administration for one dollar, but that agreement has been violated very severely,” Trump said, referring to the 1970s hand-off. “We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.” As CNN notes, the BlackRock deal also includes interests in 199 other berths in 23 countries, though none of those ports have the same geopolitical tensions as the Panama Canal right now. The co-managing director of CK Hutchinson, Frank Sixt, said in a statement posted online that the deal was the result of a “rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” Sixt went on to describe the deal as “compelling” but insisted it had nothing to do with the current geopolitical tensions between the U.S., China, and Panama. “I would like to stress that the Transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt insisted. “It must be noted that, however, the Transaction does remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, settlement of definitive documentations, and normal and usual completion procedures, adjustments and conditions as well as compliance by HPH with the rights of minority shareholders under existing shareholders agreements relating to the Sold HPH Interests.” Blackrock CEO Larry Fink said in a press release posted online by CK Hutchison that he was “thrilled” about the investment. “This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIPâs combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients,” Fink said. “These world-class ports facilitate global growth. Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.â Will BlackRock’s purchase of two ports at the Panama Canal be enough to please Trump and stop him from threatening the country with military invasion? That part isn’t clear yet. But even if it is, Trump still has plenty of other allies he wants to invade, including Greenland, Mexico, and Canada.

Title: Panama President: Trump Is 'Lying Again'

Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused President Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was "reclaiming" the Panama Canal. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the US investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal. In a message posted to X on Wednesday, Mulino denied the deal came about because of US pressure. "I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation," he wrote. He accused Trump of "lying again." Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group's operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, so the sale to a US-based company would not represent any US "reclaiming" of the canal. "The Panama Canal is not in the process of being reclaimed," Mulino said, per Reuters. "The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!"

Panama President José Raúl Mulino has accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when Trump said in his address to Congress the night before that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal PANAMA CITY -- Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal. Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group's operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal. Panama's government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction. Mulino in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. “I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation,” he wrote. He accused Trump of “lying again.” Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in early February and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations. “Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest,” Mulino wrote. “It doesn't have anything to do with 'reclaiming the canal' nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty." In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Panama President Mulino: Trump's Canal Remarks Are an 'Affront to the Truth and Our Dignity as a Nation'

President of Panama José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday morning accused President Donald Trump of “lying again” after Trump reiterated his call to take back control of the Panama Canal in a speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. “Once again, President Trump is lying. The Panama Canal is not in the process of recovery and much less is the task that in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or any other has even been discussed,” Mulino said on social media. “On behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, I reject this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation.” “Cooperation between our governments is based on clear understandings on issues of mutual interest, as we have been doing. Nothing has to do either with the ‘recovery of the Canal’ or with sullying our national sovereignty,” he continued. “The Canal is Panamanian and will remain Panamanian!” Trump, during his speech to Congress, said that to enhance national security, the United States will reclaim the Panama Canal and declared “we’ve already started doing it.” He referred to a deal announced hours before the speech between Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings Limited and asset manager BlackRock for the purchase of a majority stake of Panama Ports Company, a Hutchison subsidiary that, since 1997, has administered two ports located at opposite ends of the Panama Canal. “Just today a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple other canals,” President Trump said. “The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.” In December, Trump started a debate over the Panama Canal, an interoceanic trade route built by the United States in 1914 and whose control was handed over to Panama in 1999. The canal left American possession under an agreement signed by both nations during the administration of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Trump has repeatedly expressed that the United States should take back control of the Canal due to the “exorbitant” transit fees imposed on U.S. ships. Increasing U.S. stakes in the canal’s operations could forestall China’s growing influence over the important trade route. “It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back,” President Trump said on Tuesday. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian refuted President Trump’s statements in remarks during his regular briefing on Wednesday. “On the Panama Canal issue, China supports Panama’s sovereignty over the Canal, and stays committed to maintaining the status of the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway,” Lin said. “China has never engaged in the management and operation of the Canal. Never ever have we interfered. The so-called China’s control over the Canal is nothing but a lie.” The Chinese spokesman asserted that he had “no comment” on the deal between Hutchison and BlackRock, but asserted that China supports Chinese companies, “including” those from Hong Kong, which must abide by Chinese law after the Chinese communist regime ended the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in 2020. “Hope they can have access to a fair and just business environment everywhere they go. We oppose any abuse of coercion and pressuring in international trade and economic relations,” Lin said. The ongoing debate over the Panama Canal has seen several Panamanian and Chinese government officials dismiss President Trump’s claims of Chinese influence in the trade route and calls to have the United States take back control of it. In February, the Chinese embassy in Panama claimed that the accusations made by the United States over Chinese influence in the canal were a “pure lie.” The comment was in response to the then-ongoing two-day visit of United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) Commander Adm. Alvin Holsey to the Central American nation. Holsey met with several Panamanian government officials to discuss topics including safeguarding the Panama Canal area from “Chinese Communist Party influence and control.” President Mulino, in a social media post, referred to Adm. Holsey’s visit by stating that the bilateral agenda with the United States is important and relevant — but stressed that, for Panama, it does not involve analyzing “situations that are not true.” President Mulino has repeatedly dismissed any possible negotiations pertaining to returning control of the Panama Canal to the United States, asserting that the trade route will remain fully under Panamanian control. Mulino, after stating that he would wait for President Trump to take office on January 20 before issuing any kind of official response, issued a formal letter to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hours after President Trump took office, expressing his “concerns” over Trump’s calls to retake control of the Panama Canal.

Title: Ryan Breslow is back as CEO of fintech Bolt, after years of controversy

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Ryan Breslow is once again the CEO of Bolt, the fintech company told TechCrunch on Wednesday. Bolt shared a communication that recently went out to investors in which Breslow wrote that “following a challenging few years,” he had been reinstated as Bolt’s CEO with “unanimous approval” of the board of the one-click checkout company. Justin Grooms, who has served as interim CEO since last March, will now serve as president of Bolt. Grooms, the company’s former director of sales, took over as CEO after Maju Kuruvilla was reportedly removed by Bolt’s board. Breslow, the outspoken founder of Bolt, stepped down as CEO in early 2022. Over the years, he has faced allegations that he misled investors and violated security laws by inflating metrics while fundraising the last time he ran the company. Breslow was also embroiled in a legal battle with investor Activant Capital over a $30 million loan he took out. Last September, Bolt shared that it had reached a settlement with Activant Capital. That settlement stipulated that Bolt would repurchase Activant’s shares of Bolt stock, after which Activant would no longer hold any interest in the company. In the communication to investors, as seen by TechCrunch, Breslow thanked the company’s backers for their “support and encouragement” and expressed gratitude to employees. Last year, Bolt was reportedly trying to raise $200 million in equity and an unusual, additional $250 million in “marketing credits,” at a $14 billion valuation. As part of the funding round, Breslow would be re-instated as CEO. By September that deal had apparently stalled. Today, Bolt told TechCrunch that it could not comment on the fundraise. Bolt’s annualized run rate was at $28 million in revenue and the company had $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March of 2024, journalist Eric Newcomer, who also saw copies of the leaked term sheet, reported last August. A valuation of $14 billion would be an enormous multiple over such numbers and higher than that $11 billion valuation achieved in January of 2022. Bolt, which provides software to retailers to speed up checkout, raised around $1 billion in total venture-backed funding and at one time was valued at $11 billion. Investors include funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Schonfeld, Invus Opportunities, CreditEase, H.I.G. Growth, and Moore Strategic Ventures, among others.

Title: China Market Update: NPC’s Government Work Report Reviewed – Consumption, Consumption, Consumption & AI

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern , Senior Contributor. CLN At the National People’s Congress, Premier Li provided the government work report. The lack of Western media coverage is interesting, so I pulled out the choice lines. Consumption comes up a lot, indicating where policy support is headed. Artificial intelligence was also explicitly mentioned. Real estate was not as big of a focus, though a large part of the bond issuance is linked to real estate support as local governments have been given more latitude to support project completion. Jonathan Krane’s thesis in creating our firm was to align China investment products with government policy. We are looking good in 2025 as this top-down consumption directive is implemented by government agencies and local governments. Numerically, the report was largely in line with expectations that were low to begin with, though the verbal was stronger than anticipated. It is important that the government recognizes deflation because ignoring it means not fixing it. They did not ignore it. On Thursday, the heads of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, PBOC, and Ministry of Finance are hosting a press conference at 10 am Beijing time. Further articulation of consumption policies would be interesting. China’s Uber for truck drivers company Full Truck Alliance (YMM U.S.) announced Q4 results after the Hong Kong close/pre-U.S. market opened. Asian equities were higher overnight, led by Hong Kong, Thailand, and Indonesia, while Vietnam was off as Trump’s cabinet tried to talk up markets on tariff deals after the close as the U.S. dollar weakened. However, it is important to remember that Trump’s cabinet is made up of staff and not stakeholders, as only the big guy counts. Hong Kong had a strong day, though volumes were a touch light, and advancers trounced decliners, led by Hong Kong’s most heavily traded stocks by value, including Xiaomi, +7.22%; Tencent, +2.95%; Alibaba, +1.64%; Meituan, +6.39%; and Semiconductor Manufacturing International, +6.6%. The NPC’s government work report contributed to Hong Kong-listed growth stocks' strong outperformance, though it was a broad rally. Superman was flying as CK Hutchison (Hong Kong ticker 1, how cool is that) gained +21.86% after selling their Panama ports to BlackRock (founder Li Ka-Shing is known as Superman for his business acumen). Mainland investors bought a net $1.08 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including Alibaba, which was a large net buy via Southbound Stock Connect. Mainland China had a good, but not great, day as technology and growth stocks also outperformed, though decliners outpaced advancers. Remember, stocks are reflective of consumer confidence. Real estate stocks were a rare underperformer in both markets, though remember there are very few stocks left in MSCI indices, which is why we’ve favored the bonds over the stocks. It is interesting that CATL fell by -0.76% as electric vehicles weren’t highly noted. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech gained 2.84% and 4.02%, respectively, on volume down 4.02% from Tuesday, which is 167% of the 1-year average; 428 stocks advanced, while 65 declined. Main Board short turnover decreased by -12.87% from Tuesday, which is 169% of the 1-year average, as 16% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The growth factor and small capitalization stocks outperformed the value factor and large capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were Information Technology, +6.23%; Materials, +3.92%; and Communication Services, +2.99%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sector was Real Estate, which fell 0.30%. The top-performing subsectors were industry conglomerates, semiconductors, and construction materials. Meanwhile, household appliances were the worst-performing subsector. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were light of late as Mainland investors bought a net $1.076 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, led by Alibaba, a large net buy; Tencent, a moderate net buy; Xiaomi, Ubtech Robotics, and Hua Hong Semiconductors, which were small net buys; SMIC and Meituan were small net sells. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board gained 0.53%, 0.41%, and 0.29%, respectively, on volume up 4.12% from yesterday, which is 129% of the 1-year average; 2,180 stocks advanced, while 2,798 declined. The value factor and large capitalization stocks outperformed the growth factor and small capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were communication services, +1.40%; financials, +1.31%; and consumer discretionary, +1.09%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were real estate, which fell 1.07%; health care, which fell 0.52%; and consumer staples, which did an inverse James Bond to close down by 0.07%. The top-performing subsectors were construction machinery, internet, and telecommunication, while leisure products, petrochemicals, and real estate were the worst. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were above average. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index rose versus the U.S. dollar. The Treasury bond curve steepened. Copper and steel fell.

Title: Goldman Wins Rare Solo Role on Blockbuster $19 Billion Port Deal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Photo: Panama Canal Authority (Bloomberg) — One of the biggest infrastructure deals in recent years has a clear winner on Wall Street: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Goldman is currently the only investment bank working on the sale of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. ports to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. The transaction — with proceeds of $19 billion — includes two ports on either side of the Panama Canal, which Donald Trump has long wanted in US hands. A small group of Goldman bankers from Hong Kong to New York, led by senior executives John Waldron and Raghav Maliah, hammered out the transaction in just a couple of weeks. They moved quickly to avoid any leaks, reaching out to various potential suitors including industry players and infrastructure-focused firms, the people said. Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. also considered bids. While other investment banks missed out, former Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat, who founded consultancy firm Teton Advisors, also advised CK Hutchison on the deal, the people said. The Art of the Canal Deal: How BlackRock Brokered Trump Win in Panama The BlackRock consortium isn’t using financial advisers for now, but banks are gunning to land advisory and financing roles with the group, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Data compiled by Bloomberg show that Goldman has historically been the top adviser to CK Hutchison, founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing. One of Hong Kong’s most prominent companies, CK Hutchison trades locally under the ticker 1.HK. Once the BlackRock consortium showed interest in the port assets, which include the two in Panama and more than 40 others worldwide, there was a rush to sign a memorandum of understanding and file it to the Hong Kong stock exchange ahead of Trump’s address to Congress in Washington, D.C., the people said. In a statement announcing the transaction, Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said the deal resulted from a “rapid, discrete but competitive” process — and was unrelated to politics and reports on the Panama Canal ports. CK Hutchison to Sell Panama Port Assets at Center of Geopolitical Storm Corbat and a representative for Goldman declined to comment. CK Hutchison referred questions to its statement. BlackRock didn’t respond to requests seeking comment. The role in such a high profile deal is a boost for Goldman, which is already leading the global M&A league table this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. CK Hutchison investors got a boost too. The company’s shares jumped 22% in Hong Kong on Wednesday. That’s the biggest one-day gain since 1998, a year before the US gave the government of Panama control of the Panama Canal. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Photo: evenfh / Shutterstock (Bloomberg) — Donald Trump promised on Day 1 to seize the Panama Canal. “We’re taking it back,” the US president declared in his inaugural address. Within weeks, Wall Street billionaire Larry Fink was on the line with the White House. His pitch: Fink’s investment company, BlackRock Inc., was interested in buying the ports on either side of waterway, shifting them into American hands, according to people familiar with the discussion. And with that, there would be no need to have the US take the century-old canal by force. So went days of whirlwind negotiations that now are set to deliver control of those ports to a consortium led by BlackRock, the $11.6 trillion investment giant Fink has run for almost four decades. The deal, which will hand the seller $19 billion, reflects an extraordinary confluence of Trump’s America First vision and Wall Street’s globe-spanning quest for profit. Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to regain US ownership of the Panama Canal, which he has claimed, without evidence, is run by China. Fink capitalized on that desire to secure the biggest infrastructure deal in BlackRock’s history – handing Trump a win as the president flexes over international trade, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, NATO and more. The deal is also a sign of Fink’s and BlackRock’s ambitions to clinch major deals in far-flung private markets and compete with the biggest alternative asset managers. In a statement announcing the transaction Tuesday, he boasted of BlackRock’s ties to companies and governments around the world, noting: “We are increasingly the first call.” When Trump took the lectern Tuesday night for a primetime address, he hailed the deal as a step toward “reclaiming” the canal for the US. He didn’t use BlackRock’s name. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals,” he said. “The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others.” BlackRock said it agreed to buy the two ports in Panama and more than 40 others around the world from CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., the sprawling conglomerate controlled by the Li family, one of Asia’s richest clans. In recent months, the Hong Kong family found itself thrust into the center of a political firestorm over who controls the crucial waterway and key ports. For Trump, having a US investment company take over the ports would reduce China’s influence in the region, according to people familiar with the talks, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity given the delicate diplomacy. The deal wouldn’t have come together without Trump’s support, these people said. BlackRock is acquiring the operations with Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure firm it bought last year and is headed by Adebayo Ogunlesi. Other investors include Terminal Investment Ltd., which operates ports served by the world’s largest shipping company, Mediterranean Shipping. Fink has moved in Trump’s circles for years, and people close to the deal say his personal involvement was crucial. In recent days, Fink briefed Trump as the talks quickly unfolded. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were also kept in the loop. In a statement, Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said the deal resulted from a “rapid, discrete but competitive” process — and was unrelated to politics. Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. also considered bids, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Representatives for both firms declined to comment. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment. CK Hutchison’s American depositary receipts rose as much as 3.4% to $6.02 at the start of trading Wednesday. They gained 17% on Tuesday. Panama will review the transaction and an audit of the Panama Ports contract will continue, according to a statement posted on Panama President Jose Raul Mulino’s account on X. Under terms disclosed Tuesday, BlackRock, GIP and Terminal Investment will acquire units that hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group. The consortium will also acquire 90% of Panama Ports Co., which operates the two ports in Balboa and Cristobal, on either side of the Panama Canal. “We’ll probably have ownership of the Panama Canal ones very shortly,” Fink told a financial industry conference Tuesday. As Trump publicly complained about China’s influence over the canal, Panama’s government weighed whether to cancel its contract with CK Hutchison to operate the ports, Bloomberg reported last month. That arose even though CK Hutchison is based in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory with its own borders, currency and legal system. Beijing has clamped down on the former British colony since 2020 when it imposed a broad national security law that paved the way for a crackdown on dissent. Reached Wednesday morning in Asia, CK Hutchison referred to Sixt’s earlier statement. In it, he said, “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports.” © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Panama president says Trump is lying about reclaiming Panama Canal
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/panama-president-says-trump-lying-about-reclaiming-panama-canal/

Watch CBS News March 5, 2025 / 11:21 AM EST / CBS/AP Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his Tuesday address to a joint session of Congress that his administration was "reclaiming" the Panama Canal. Mr. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Hong-Kong based group that operates ports near both ends of the Panama Canal. The announcement came after the president alleged Chinese interference with operations of the critical shipping lane. Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group's operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. "reclaiming" of the canal. Panama's government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction. Mulino, in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. "I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation," he wrote in the post translated from Spanish. He accused Mr. Trump of "lying again." "The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else," Mulino continued. CBS News fact-checked the president's remarks to Congress here, reviewing his claims about the Panama Canal in addition to other issues. Mr. Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. Mulino previously denied publicly the U.S. State Department's claim that his country had reached a deal to allow U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free. The Panamanian leader said in early February that he had told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that he could not set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them, adding at the time that he was surprised the State Department had issued a statement suggesting otherwise. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino around the same time and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal's operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations. "Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest," Mulino wrote. "It doesn't have anything to do with 'reclaiming the canal' nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty." In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama's government. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Mr. Trump has claimed that Carter "foolishly" gave the canal away. Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was "the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received." "I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports," Sixt said. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Title: Improving Blockchain Data Usability: A Key to Unlocking Institutional Capital
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/03/05/improving-blockchain-data-usability-a-key-to-unlocking-institutional-capital

Data is an essential element of an efficient market. If market efficiency is the degree to which prices reflect all available information, having quality information is crucial. And to get to information, you need data. Traditional financial markets are data-rich and have high levels of standardization and accessibility, giving market participants abundant avenues for analysis. Digital asset markets are awash in data, but this data has less structure and little standardization, complicating many aspects of fundamental and quantitative analysis. It’s somewhat ironic that data is a sticking point for digital assets since a much-lauded aspect of public blockchains is their transparency. Transactions and data on the blockchain are available essentially immediately to anyone with access to the system. But transparency does not equal accessibility and, much less so usability. Without prioritizing accessibility, dissemination and context, masses of raw blockchain data won’t automatically improve crypto market efficiency. And while blockchain data complexity may create alpha for savvy analysts, the lack of consistent data likely contributes to volatility, deterring institutional capital. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Until now, the somewhat disjointed state of blockchain data has not been an issue given a market dominated by retail flows. But if the market is to ultimately become institutionalized (that is, garner the involvement of serious allocators like pensions, endowments, and insurance), it needs to evolve. To improve, the digital asset space can learn from traditional market approaches. Tokens are expected to accrue value in line with a project’s success. Thus, key performance indicators (KPIs) should be readily accessible, acting like “investor relations” pages for token holders. It’s unrealistic for start-up crypto projects to disclose information like public corporations do, but interim steps can improve the situation. For example, there are data points that could be relevant for almost all projects to disclose, including: supply schedules (with details of inflation and burn mechanisms, as well as unlocks), fees, active users and daily transactions. Naturally, projects will not have all the same indicators — for example, KPIs for a smart contract platform will look different than those for an application or DeFi protocol. Smart contract platforms may want to show how many apps are deployed in the ecosystem. DeFi protocols may want to showcase TVL or volumes. Regardless of utility, each project should make an effort to disclose as many data points as possible. Critically, this data should have detailed definitions and methodologies, along with reproducible code for how the information is derived from the blockchain. It should also be available with complete histories through time, and be easily downloadable or accessible via APIs. Efforts by projects to systematically disseminate key information should reduce uncertainty (and thereby volatility) and aid capital inflows into the crypto space. Investors should expect this level of transparency and reward projects that prioritize showcasing KPIs, while pushing for improvement at portfolio companies that do not. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, noted in a recent earnings call that more transparency and analytics could broaden digital asset investment, akin to the evolution of markets like mortgages and high-yield bonds. There are already strong players like Artemis that are providing blockchain data and analytics and setting standards for digital finance. Such providers will be essential, just as platforms like Bloomberg and S&P’s Capital IQ are in the traditional markets. However, each project building digital assets should do their part to enhance data availability for investors. As the crypto market matures in transparency and analytics, as many other nascent markets did before it, the scope for investment in the space should expand materially.

Title: US: Supreme Court blocks Trump's freeze of $2 billion in aid

The US president revised the 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico a day after implementing them. Meanwhile, Canada filed a WTO complaint against the new US tariffs. This blog has been closed. Thanks very much for reading. Below you can review developments from Donald Trump's first weeks in office on Thursday, February 13, 2025: New Zealand has dismissed its ambassador to the United Kingdom, Phil Goff, over comments critical of US President Donald Trump. Goff seemingly questioned Trump's understanding of history in comments at a forum organized by the Chatham House think tank in London on Tuesday. "President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history?" Goff said. Goff contrasted Trump's stated policy of seeking a peace deal with Russia in Ukraine with British leader Winston Churchill's criticism of his predecessor, Neville Chamberlain, over signing the Munich Agreement that allowed Nazi Germany to annex the Sudetenland area of Czechoslovakia a year before the start of World War II. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters described Goff's remarks as "deeply disappointing." "They do not represent the views of the NZ Government and make his position as High Commissioner to London untenable," he said. The chief of staff to House Speaker Mike Johnson, Hayden Haynes, was arrested on Tuesday night after he crashed into a police vehicle following Donald Trump's address to Congress. Haynes was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence and was later released. Police said that Haynes had "backed into a parked vehicle" shortly before midnight. Johnson's office said that the speaker was aware of the incident. "The Speaker is aware of the encounter that occurred last night involving his Chief of Staff and the Capitol Police," spokesperson Taylor Haulsee said. "The Speaker has full faith and confidence in Hayden's ability to lead the speaker's office." The Trump administration's decision to pause US foreign aid would undo progress made in containing tuberculosis (TB) infections across low- and middle-income countries,the World Health Organization said. "Without immediate action, hard-won progress in the fight against TB is at risk. Our collective response must be swift, strategic, and fully resourced to protect the most vulnerable and maintain momentum toward ending TB," said Tereza Kasaeva, director of WHO's Global Program on TB and Lung Health. Critical international aid, particularly from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), helped avert about 3.65 million deaths from the deadly disease last year alone, according to the agency. The US has historically contributed about one quarter of the total international donor funding for TB programs, which amounts to about $200 million (€185.3 million) to $250 million annually in bilateral funding, the WHO said. USAID has been one of the major targets of the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the federal government, a campaign spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, who heads Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The Trump administration is looking to cut back over 80,000 jobs at the Department of Veterans Affairs, an agency that provides health care and other services for millions of veterans, according to an internal memo seen by news agencies. The internal memo, first reported by Government Executive, looks to "resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure." The memo calls for agency officials to work with the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency to "move out aggressively, while taking a pragmatic and disciplined approach" to the Trump administration’s goals. The VA’s chief of staff, Christopher Syrek, told top-level officials at the agency Tuesday that it had an objective to cut enough employees to return to 2019 staffing levels of just under 400,000.

The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) blocked the USDA from terminating probationary employees for 45 days. allowing the board to investigate the firings. The decision, issued by board member Cathy Harris, comes a day after a federal judge prevented Trump from removing her from her position. The move is seen as a significant obstacle to the Trump administration's efforts to carry out mass layoffs. Canada has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States. Canadian Ambassador to the WTO, Nadia Theodore, said her government had "requested WTO consultations with the government of the United States regarding its unjustified tariffs." WTO consultations are the first step of the international body's dispute settlement procedure. The two parties have 60 days to settle the matter before the claimant can request that a panel be set up to rule on it. A WTO official confirmed to AFP that "Canada initiated dispute proceedings yesterday against the US at the WTO on the additional tariffs," following a similar complaint filed by Beijing over fresh US levies on Chinese goods. Donald Trump says he will grant a one-month exemption for US automakers from new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada. The US president's 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, along with a doubling of duties on Chinese goods to 20%. The White House, however, said on Wednesday that after talks with Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, Trump will allow a one-month exemption from tariffs on auto imports from the neighboring countries. Tariffs create significant challenges for North American automakers. They build vehicles in all three countries and often move parts across international borders several times while assembling them into systems and finished vehicles. In an online post, President Donald Trump said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had called him "to ask what could be done about Tariffs." "I told him that many people have died from Fentanyl that came through the Borders of Canada and Mexico, and nothing has convinced me that it has stopped," Trump wrote. "He said that it’s gotten better, but I said, 'That’s not good enough.'" The US president also said that the call ended in a somewhat friendly manner. Trump has imposed broad tariffs on Canada, Mexico on Tuesday, citing an "extraordinary threat" from illegal immigration and drugs. Trudeau slammed the tariffs on calling it a "very dumb thing to do" and announced retaliatory measures. Trump also accused the Canadian leader of playing up a Canada-US trade war to cling to power. Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January, is to step down after a Liberal party leadership contest this weekend which will choose his replacement US President Trump was considering modifying the 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said. The announcement could come as early as Wednesday, only a day after Trump's tariffs were imposed on Canada, Mexico, and China. Lutnick dismissed the possibility of lifting the levies completely but signaled potential relief for specific sectors such as automakers. "But what he's thinking about is which sections of the market that can maybe, maybe, he'll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2," Lutnick said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video On April 2, Trump plans to announce what he calls "reciprocal" tariffs to match the tariffs, taxes, and subsidies from other countries. However, Canada has already stated that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is not willing to lift Canada's retaliatory tariffs unless Trump removes all tariffs. "We're not interested in meeting in the middle and having some reduced tariff. Canada wants the tariffs removed," Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc told the Canadian national broadcaster. In his address to Congress, US President Donald Trump accused Mexican drug cartels of already "waging war on America," adding that "it's time for America to wage war on the cartels." The accusations were launched on the same day his administration announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Trump claims the tariffs are an appropriate response to what he believes is a failure of the Mexican government to stop illegal drugs from entering the US. "The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control," he told Congress. Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum last month announced a deployment of additional 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border. The US Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that President Donald Trump's administration cannot stop payments to foreign aid organizations for work they have already completed for the government. The court supported US District Judge Amir Ali's decision, which ordered the Trump administration to quickly release funding to contractors and grant recipients from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the State Department for their past work. Ali had ordered the US State Department and USAID to pay nearly $2 billion to contractors by midnight on Wednesday last week. The Trump administration turned to the Supreme Court as the deadline approached. They argued that handling claims properly in such a short time was impossible. By a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court told Ali to "clarify what obligations the government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order, with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines." The court's decision, however, keeps Ali's temporary restraining order in place, which stopped the spending freeze.

In his first speech to Congress after becoming president again, Trump welcomed a deal by a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock to acquire two Panama Canal ports He described this deal as an early step in his administration's plan to "reclaim" the important waterway. President Mulino, however accused Trump of "once again lying" in a post on X, formerly Twitter. "The Panama Canal is not in the process of being reclaimed... the Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!" Panama, took over control of the crucial international waterway in 1999 under a treaty negotiated with the United States 20 years earlier. Trump has repeatedly threatened to "take back" control of the Panama Canal. A consortium led by US firm BlackRock has agreed to purchase the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the canal from a Hong Kong-based company CK Hutchison. The canal is home to several other ports. Greenland's prime minister said, "Greenland is ours" and cannot be taken or sold. This was in response to President Donald Trump, who told Congress the United States would acquire the territory "one way or another." "Kalaallit Nunaat is ours," Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede wrote, using Greenlandic for the "Land of the People" or the "Land of the Greenlanders." Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, in an interview with broadcaster TV2, echoed Egede in repeating that Greenland is not for sale. Located in the Arctic Circle, Greenland sits between Canada and northern Europe. Although an autonomous territory, it is still ruled by the Danish crown. Any American effort to acquire Greenland would therefore have to include Denmark.

PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal.Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal.Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal. Panama’s government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction.Mulino in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. “I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation,” he wrote. He accused Trump of “lying again.”Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in early February and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations.“Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest,” Mulino wrote. “It doesn’t have anything to do with ‘reclaiming the canal’ nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty.”In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government.The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away.Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.”“I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt said.

Title: Ethereum 2025 Price Prediction as Trump Announces US Crypto Reserve

Time Published: 2025-03-05T15:30:18Z

Following its inclusion in Donald Trump’s newly announced US Crypto Reserve, Ethereum’s price prediction for 2025 has become one of the hottest topics of debate among crypto enthusiasts and pundits. While a vast majority is expecting $ETH to ride the positive momentum and finally break out of its long-drawn sideways channel, some say there’s more price correction in store. In this guide, we’ll let Ethereum speak to us; we’ll analyze its technicals and fundamentals to draw out a clear picture of where we think the second-biggest crypto in the world could be headed in the coming 10 months. If you’re after a quick answer, here’s everything you need to know about $ETH’s upcoming performance: Overall, since the higher timeframes override the smaller ones, and because the market sentiment also screams bullishness, $ETH’s larger picture looks very positive. Once it breaks and holds above a lower high, many feel we can expect $ETH to reach new highs, including the $6K mark, in 2025. The best way to go about technical analysis is to start from the higher timeframes and then scoot lower. This helps establish a strong understanding of the overall direction of the cryptocurrency — whether certain short-term trends are aligned with the larger picture or just temporary price corrections. With that in mind, we’ll start our analysis at $ETH’s weekly chart. Right off the bat, we notice that Ethereum is at a major support zone (between $1.9K and $2.3K). This is where $ETH took support in November last year before bouncing to $4K. Additionally, this support zone also contains the $2K mark, which is an important psychological number. For those unaware, round figures such as this often act as strong support and resistance levels. The $2K level, in particular, is a very notable one, seeing as $ETH has reacted to it almost every single time ever since it first touched it all the way back in February 2021. Another massive positive sign is that $ETH (on the weekly chart) is currently at and reacting to the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is one of the most prominent indicators of technical analysis. Given that $BTC (on the daily chart) bounced off the 200 EMA less than a week ago, we can expect $ETH to do the same. According to Glassnode, a blockchain analytics firm, the $1.9K price point is also a major accumulation zone, with over 1.82M $ETH being bought at it by long-term investors since August 2023. Having mentioned the various reasons $ETH looks ripe for an upward rally, the biggest clue we get about its upcoming prices is through the good old rectangle pattern. Simply put, Ethereum has been trapped between the $2K and $4K levels. Plus, given that this has been the case for almost a year now, a breakout above the ceiling ($4K) could see $ETH reach a new high that’s as far away as the breadth of the rectangle. The upper and lower limits of the rectangle, in this case, are $2K apart, meaning we can expect $ETH to cross $6K once it breaks above $4K. Although the weekly timeframe is the boss and dictates the larger picture, the daily and 4-hour timeframes often provide an excellent outlook for the short term. Unfortunately, though, the two major moving averages (50 EMA and 200 EMA) are both sloping downwards on these timeframes. This suggests that institutional buying is yet to enter the market. However, trends in crypto could change in hours because large buying often results in towering candlesticks, and just a couple of those would be enough to throw $ETH over the EMAs. $ETH is up 5.75% today and is currently trading at around $2,200. The latest surge in its price is likely due to its inclusion in Trump’s Crypto Strategic Reserve. It is, after all, one of the only five cryptos that made it to the list. Not only is the amount huge, but $ETH also makes up nearly 65% of the firm’s entire $300M+ crypto portfolio. Clearly, Trump is backing Ethereum to hit it out of the park, which is one of the biggest reasons the $6K target looks extremely realistic. Also, Ethereum is the only other crypto besides Bitcoin to have spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds), which is a huge positive as far as investor participation in $ETH is concerned. The fact that BlackRock ‘likes’ Ethereum is nothing to sniff at, either. The asset management company launched a tokenized money market fund last year, and it chose Ethereum as its blockchain of choice for this fund. In other news, Ethereum is also nearing a huge Pectra upgrade. It was successfully deployed on the Sepolia testnet today, and Pectra’s mainnet is expected to launch in April. This update will consist of 11 major features, which will together make the Ethereum ecosystem more user-friendly, affordable, and efficient. For instance, the validator staking limit will be increased from 32 $ETH to 2,048 $ETH. In addition to being a game-changer for validators, who will be able to compound their earnings, this move is expected to reduce selling pressure over a long enough time period. What’s more, we’ll see a bunch of wallet and security improvements, too. These include batched transactions, gas sponsorship, application-wise spending limits, and different recovery mechanisms. With Ethereum expected to nearly triple in price this year, it’s certainly shaping up to be a great investment choice for traditional crypto traders. However, for those with an appetite for higher risks and rewards, the Meme Index ($MEMEX) presale could be a better pick. The $MEMEX presale is fast approaching the $4M mark, and each token is currently available for just $0.0166883 — here’s how to buy $MEMEX if you’re looking to get in as an early investor. What’s more, you’ll also be able to benefit from the project’s 579% staking rewards. Last but not least, we’d like to mention that although our analysis and experience tell us that both $ETH and $MEMEX are excellent crypto investment opportunities, this article shouldn’t be considered a substitute for professional financial advice.

Title: BlackRock’s $23-billion deal to strengthen US control over Panama Canal Ports, global trade sees rising American presence in other strategic assets

Global trade observers, who continue to assess the changing geo-political power equation and subsequent probability of tariff war and control over strategic assets like ports, say this implies US control extending to multiple entities in nearly two dozen countries, on a key trade route that will include a presence in Europe, Egypt, and Asia, among others. However, there will be no direct impact on India, senior Shipping Ministry officials here told businessline. “Not much of our cargo goes through the Panama Canal, so the impact on trade is limited. But, we will have to keep a watch on how things progress,” the person tracking these developments said. “But, the US’ presence through a BlackRock-led consortium will expand to many strategic assets possibly,” a second official said. Concerns on how retaliatory tariffs could impact container freight rates have also surfaced, but it’s early days still. The $23-billion deal BlackRock’s deal with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison is worth $22.8 billion. The companies in a joint statement said they have reached in-principle agreements whereby the BlackRock-TiL Consortium will acquire HPH’s 90 per cent interests in the Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama (also called the Panama Terminals); and 80 per cent of CK Hutchison’s effective and controlling interest in subsidiary and associated companies - owning, operating and developing a total of 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. The ports sale does not include any interest in the HPH Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China. Control for Panama Canal This sale is being seen as a major victory for US President Donald Trump, who has been insisting on taking control of the Panama Canal. This transaction is “purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” asserted CK Hutchison Co-Managing Director Frank Sixt in a statement. Nearly 40 per cent of American ships use the Panama Canal, but it accounts for about 5 per cent of global trade, and is a key link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The canal is used extensively for trade between the US East Coast and Asia. According to Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, Senior Director & Global Head (transport, mobility, and logistics) at Crisil Intelligence, the BlackRock deal means the US is “securing its supply chain”. “So the US will have more control over the ships; and a better hold over supplies entering through the country’s east coast, one of its major trade routes,” he said. Padmanabhan says there will be hardly “any direct impact on the trade with India”, but the more important issue to be looked into are “how the retaliatory tariff action will play out”. “Normally, you will continue to see export activity happening from the East Coast – Asia, including India – to the West – USA; and empty containers moving out of the US,” he said. Container price movement According to the Drewry container index, prices decreased 6 per cent to $2,629 per 40 ft container beginning March, 75 per cent below the pandemic peak of $10,377 (September 2021), and the lowest since May 2024. Freight rates from Shanghai to Los Angeles decreased 11 per cent or $411 to $3,477 per 40ft container, closely followed by the rates on Shanghai to New York, which decreased 10 per cent or $533 to $4,593 per 40ft container. Rates from Shanghai to Genoa fell 2 per cent or $90 to $3,747 per 40ft container, and those from Shanghai to Rotterdam and Rotterdam to New York reduced 1 per cent to $2,586 and $2,374 per 40ft container, respectively. On the other hand, rates from Rotterdam to Shanghai, and New York to Rotterdam increased 1 per cent to $503 and $835 per 40ft container, respectively. Meanwhile, rates from Los Angeles to Shanghai remained stable. Drewry expects rates to continue to decrease next week due to increased shipping capacity, it said in a report.

Title: Stock of the Day: BlackRock rises after Trump shouts out firm's deal for Panama Canal ports

The move: BlackRock rose 1% at the start of trading on Wednesday, reaching $961 per share. The stock has struggled this year, and is still down about 7% year-to-date. Why: The world's largest asset manager is leading a consortium to buy a majority stake in the two ports from CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong conglomerate. The deal is valued at $22.8 billion. In his address to Congress on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump acknowledged the deal, which involves BlackRock's acquisition of two Panama Canal ports. "Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal," Trump said during his address. CK Hutchison expects to receive over $19 billion in cash proceeds for the sale — worth as much as its valuation, according to Bloomberg. Its stock rose as much as 25% in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The consortium, made up of BlackRock's Global Infrastructures Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, will acquire 90% of the Panama Ports company. The firm operates the Balboa and Cristobal terminals. What it means: The deal hands a political win to Trump, who has said Chinese interests have taken control of the pivotal trade route. The White House has gone as far as suggesting that the canal be returned return to US hands. "The Panama Canal was built by Americans, for Americans, not for others, but others could use it," Trump said. If the ports change hands, this might relieve US pressure on Panamanian president José Raúl Mulino. However, he pushed back on Trump's Tuesday notion that Washington was "reclaiming" the canal. For BlackRock, it marks the largest infrastructure deal in its history. The ports have made up a large part of CK Hutchinson's port division, which was the firm's third-biggest business in the first half of last year, Bloomberg reports. Jump to

Title: US Firm Is Buying Up Panama Canal Ports

"My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it," Trump told Congress on Tuesday, alluding to a deal that would see an investment group led by US asset manager BlackRock buy up two ports at either end of the canal. In total, the consortium will buy 43 ports comprised of 199 berths in 23 countries from Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison for a cost of $19 billion, Reuters reports. CK Hutchison and Panama President José Raúl Mulino claimed the deal was not political, though it comes after Trump demanded "the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question" and complained about high shipping fees and Chinese influence. Mulino said this was "a global transaction, between private companies, motivated by mutual interests," per the New York Times. Frank Sixt, a co-managing director at CK Hutchison, said it was "purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama ports." However, the wealthy Hong Kong-based Li family that owns CK Hutchison believed it was under pressure to sell off its ports business, and particularly its Panama Canal ports of Cristobal and Balboa, and "specifically sought an American buyer," the Times reports. Executives at BlackRock then briefed Trump and other members of the administration on the deal, receiving their support. The consortium also includes Terminal Investment and Global Infrastructure Partners. CK Hutchison is set to receive $19 billion for its 80% stake in the Hutchison Ports group. The stake was valued around $13 billion, meaning "the disposal would be significantly value enhancing," Citigroup analysts said, per Reuters. CK Hutchison's stock closed up 22% on Wednesday for its highest price since August 1, 2023. Trump claimed the deal would "further enhance our national security," per CBS News. "China is operating the Panama Canal," he claimed without evidence, per the Wall Street Journal. Last month, Sen. Ted Cruz suggested China could block US traffic. (More Panama Canal stories.)

Title: DAVID BLACKMON: Trump Homes In On American Energy In Congressional Speech

Time Published: 2025-03-05T13:22:14Z

Unlike his predecessors, President Donald Trump always seems to have energy and its impacts to the lives of all Americans at the top of his mind. Following his stemwinding acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last August, I was able to highlight the more than 1,000 words specific to energy included in it. The president’s high prioritization of energy and energy policy came into sharp focus again Tuesday night in his speech to a joint session of congress. None of what he said about energy received applause from the Democrats present in the House Chamber, but that was no surprise. Trump noted early in the speech there was literally nothing he could say to evoke such a response from minority party. But ordinary Americans struggling to make ends meet after years of Biden/Harris-era inflation likely had a different reaction given that Trump’s focus on energy policy both in the speech and in action across the first six weeks of his second presidency has been focused on reforms designed to cut energy costs for everyone. “Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations,” Trump said early on. “I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying … We ended all of Biden’s environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable. And importantly, we ended the last administration’s insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction.” Mr. Trump concluded that portion of the speech by pointing to his Day 1 executive order that all federal agencies must eliminate 10 old regulations for every new regulation they wish to implement. Again, this focused effort to tear down the entrenched bureaucratic state is designed boost the economy, create thousands of high paying jobs and lower prices by cutting the cost of regulatory overhead for which consumers inevitably pay. Congress is also doing its part, having already eliminated some of the costliest Biden regulations via the Congressional Review Act. Every action described there will, if made permanent, boost the economy and reduce the cost of energy for all Americans. Yes, even for the Democrats, some of whom audibly hissed during that portion of the speech. Amazing. Where energy minerals are concerned, President Trump reiterated his desire to establish a U.S. presence in or control of Greenland and its enormous known reserves of rare earth minerals and other critical energy minerals. “I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland,” Trump said. “We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.” Trump said Greenland is not just about energy, noting its control is also crucial for national security and even international security. “One way or the other, we’re going to get it,” he said, adding, “We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.” The president also spoke about his administration’s efforts to re-establish U.S. control over the Panama Canal, noting that “a large American company (which turns out to be a BlackRock-led consortium) announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.” Preserving the free flow of shipping through the Panama Canal during times of peace and potential war is critical to U.S. energy security given that crude oil is the most internationally traded commodity and LNG is rapidly rising on that list. The maintenance of strong energy security is among the most crucial aspects of ensuring strong national security and economic prosperity. In reference to the amazing progress his administration has made in securing the southern border without any help from congress, Trump mocked Biden-era claims by the “media and our friends in the Democrat Party that…we must have legislation to secure the border.” “But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president,” he concluded. It has become starkly obvious over the last 6 weeks that the same principle applies to energy policy. The whole world has changed since Jan. 20.

Title: A once-hot startup got a $1.5 billion loan. More than $500 million went to a high school dropout's 'sham' hedge fund, judge rules.

Call it the case of the vanishing half a billion dollars. During the pandemic-era startup funding boom, the education technology company Byju's raised money from some of the biggest names in global investing. At its peak, the Bengaluru-based company was valued at $22 billion, making it the most valuable startup in India. But last week, a US judge ruled that entities associated with Byju's had fraudulently transferred over $500 million to a group the judge deemed a "sham." The summary judgment in Delaware bankruptcy court, released on Thursday, advances the lenders' yearslong search for the missing money. Judge John T. Dorsey ruled against Riju Ravindran — a former Byju's board member and the founder's brother — and entities related to the company, including a hedge fund founded by a 23-year-old high school dropout. Dorsey found the $533 million was fraudulently transferred to what he called a "high-risk and unproven hedge fund." It had few other investors, a high fee structure, and, at one point, a Miami IHOP headquarters address with a non-working phone, per court documents. The ruling opens the door for damages — with a hearing about specifics still to be scheduled — and for the lenders to try to recover some of that money. In November 2021, after equity fundraising from BlackRock, the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, and other power players, Byju's set up a special financing vehicle with $1.2 billion from top private lenders, including Ares Management and HPS Investment Partners. Led by the media-hungry founder Byju Raveendran, Byju's expanded quickly by snapping up other companies. Months after the lenders' money came in and without their knowledge, Ravindran transferred $533 million to a tiny hedge fund called Camshaft Capital, per Thursday's summary judgement. The fund was run by a portfolio manager named William Morton, who the lenders said in a complaint had no investment experience. The lenders' complaint said last year that Morton had recently bought three luxury cars: a 2023 Ferrari Roma, a 2020 Lamborghini Huracán EVO, and a 2014 Rolls-Royce Wraith. Ravindran's attorneys told the Delaware bankruptcy court that he moved the money to Camshaft because "Byju's felt the need to protect the cash." Ravindran said in sworn testimony that he had never heard of Camshaft before April 2022 and that he did no diligence prior to the transfers. Dorsey wrote in the summary judgment that Camshaft should have spotted "numerous red flags" pointing to the transactions' "fraudulent purpose." Camshaft then lent the money to a British company in a deal done without the lenders' approval, wrote Dorsey. The lenders have yet to trace the money, despite extensive efforts detailed in court documents. Last week's lawsuit is just one part of Byju's winding saga, which stretches across continents and involves more than a dozen lawsuits. While the level of funding Byju's commanded during its heyday sets it apart from the ed-tech competition, the company is part of a wave of global startups that picked up significant funding during the pandemic. At the time, investors scrambled to back companies amid record low interest rates. Now, lower valuations in a much different market threaten those good-times investments. After negotiations with Byju's fell apart over missed interest payments and other issues, the lenders put the special financing vehicle through involuntary bankruptcy. They appointed Timothy Pohl, a restructuring veteran, to manage the company and unravel the key mystery: the money's trail. But even after Pohl took over as the sole manager in March 2023, Ravindran continued to move money out, Dorsey wrote in Thursday's summary judgement. In May 2023, Raveendran told an advisor to the lenders that the money had gone "someplace the Lenders will never find it," the advisor later wrote in a declaration. So far, legal proceedings have offered few clues about the missing $533 million. Morton and his fund were held in contempt of court last year for failure to cooperate with discovery. He told The Wall Street Journal last spring that he had fled the US with no plans to return — and that Camshaft is not a sham. Raveendran and Ravindran are last known to be living in Dubai. Ravindran was also held in contempt of court last year. The lenders said in a statement on Friday that they see the ruling as a "significant step forward" in their recovery efforts. "We are gratified the Court unequivocally recognized that Riju Ravindran, Camshaft, and BYJU's together conducted a deliberate fraud on a global scale arising from the theft of $533 million," the lenders said in the statement. Byju's is still operating, but the company faces significant turmoil beyond the US bankruptcy case. BlackRock and at least one other equity investor have written off the value of their investments. BlackRock and the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment, nor did Byju's. Lawyers for Morton and Ravindran did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Morton or Raveendran. Ravindran could not be located for comment. Raveendran wrote on LinkedIn on Friday and again on Monday that he would rebuild the company. "I will keep on keeping on. Till the wrongs are righted, and the mistakes are corrected," he posted on Monday. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at mmorris@businessinsider.com or Signal or Telegram at +1 646 768 1627.

Title: BlackRock bought the ports of Hutchison Ports for $22.8 billion – Including the ports in the Panama Canal

An impressive deal has been announced as a consortium led by BlackRock has agreed with CK Hutchison to acquire its controlling stake in Hutchison Port Holdings (HPH). The acquisition includes ports in the Panama Canal, as well as dozens of other ports worldwide, with the deal valued at $22.8 billion! The agreement, which covers 80% of HPH, will include a range of ports in 23 countries, with 199 berths. Notably, the ports in Panama, located in the cities of Balboa and Cristobal, are among the most strategic aspects of the deal, while ports in Hong Kong and China are not included. TIL, a subsidiary of MSC, will participate in the acquisition through the consortium and has already expressed enthusiasm for the agreement. It is noteworthy that this deal comes at a time of intense geopolitical tensions, with the U.S. and China in ongoing confrontation. However, both CK Hutchison and its partners insist that this move is purely commercial and not related to political pressures, despite analysts linking the deal to political developments around the Panama Canal. “This transaction is the result of a competitive process and has nothing to do with political developments,” said Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison. The deal is pending legal and regulatory approvals, meaning investors should be cautious with CK Hutchison shares until its completion. Despite any political implications, the agreement is expected to have a positive impact on the global shipping industry, with many anticipating that the new owners will further enhance the business potential of the ports.

Title: ‘Our wealth management services are strengthened by the backing of the Mauritius IFC’ – Carrick Wealth

Carrick Wealth is an international financial advisory and wealth management business with five offices in Africa, three more planned to open in 2025, and more than $1 billion under management. The firm, in its 10th year of operating, counts BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Natixis among its partners, supporting them to access high-potential investments in Africa, a market that requires deep local knowledge and largely operates outside traditional Western risk-reward metrics.

Speaking on a webinar hosted by the Economic Development Board of Mauritius (EDB Mauritius), Beeharry explains that while tax neutrality is certainly one advantage of being domiciled in Mauritius – there is no capital gains, withholding tax or inheritance tax duties and the island has an extensive network of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) – he says that the private banking and wealth management initiatives and guidelines driven by robust regulatory and institutional bodies such as EDB Mauritius, the Bank of Mauritius and the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the regulatory body for non-banking financial services – have played a much bigger role in supporting Carrick to flourish. Since 1990, when Mauritius established itself as an International Financial Centre (IFC), it has been relentless in its pursuit to build on a banking legacy established almost 200 years ago by French traders and create a name for itself in international high-end wealth management, leveraging its strategic location between Europe, Africa and high-growth markets in Asia and historic links with all three continents. Family Office licenses were introduced in 2016 under the country’s Financial Services Act and subsequently upgraded, which allow for the operations of Single and Multiple Family Offices that can offer a wide and flexible range of trusts, foundations and other structures with Switzerland-style asset protection and confidentiality. The Family Office license holder benefits from a 10-year tax holiday based on certain employment and expenditure criteria and must have assets of at least $5 million for each family member. In a boost to these services, the Mauritius IFC recently introduced an innovative fund structure called the Variable Capital Company (VCC), which allows multiple sub funds or Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) within a single legal entity – particularly attractive for investors in private equity and venture capital. The Mauritius VCC ringfences each sub-fund or SPV assets and so prevents cross-contamination of risk. This gives reassurance to the end investor as well as increasing operational flexibility and reducing costs. There is also the ability to pay dividends out of the capital of the VCC. These are not yet available in many other financial jurisdictions and Beeharry highlights these structures as a key influence in the firm in devising its business strategy for and through Mauritius, adding: “The VCC allows an ease of doing business for our clients, but beyond that, when we look at the compelling advantages for companies like ours running Family Offices through Mauritius for ultras, it’s the confidentiality, the data protection and the strength of Mauritius, based on aspects like its rule of law, which enables safe and smart access to internationally robust financial services.” Mauritius is known as one of Africa’s strongest and safest democracies, with a history of independent institutions and a commitment to the highest standards of operations. Mauritius meets all 40 requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), is deemed to have no Harmful Tax Practice as per the OECD’s FHTP peer review mechanism and is whitelisted by the EU. In relation to FACTA, Mauritius signed an Agreement for the Exchange of Information Relating to Taxes with the US and established the legal framework to enable exchange of tax information between the two countries, including the Inter-Governmental Agreement. This guarantees the automatic exchange of information under the Common Reporting Standards (CRS). Beeharry says these strong regulatory factors, which have underpinned the doubling of the island’s capital markets in three years and attracted an ecosystem of banks, law firms, corporate services and private equity funds, will continue to support Mauritius in its drive to grow its reputation in global wealth management at a time when wealth and the population of high-net worth individuals is on the rise after a difficult few years. In further evidence of Mauritius being focused on the future, the FSC has also recently enhanced its regulatory framework to recognise cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum and Bitcoin, as asset classes under the Virtual Asset and Initial Token Offerings Services Act 2021 in recognition of the rising interest in security tokens built on blockchain technology and crypto investments. Warwyck, a private bank and wealth management firm is the first financial services institution on the island to secure virtual asset licenses under these new laws. As a result, Warwyck is able to offer digital asset custodian, conversion, trading and investment services in Mauritius. Its digital asset exchange-traded fund (ETF), offered under the VCC entity joins leading global investment firms which have launched digital asset retail funds over the past few years, those offering exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies or companies involved in blockchain technology. It is widely anticipated that a Donald Trump administration will push for regulatory changes in the US that will likely accelerate the institutional and retail adoption of crypto and tokenisation by integrating it into mainstream financial services. According to Henley & Partners, a high-net worth migration consultancy based in London, the total market value of crypto assets reached $2.3 trillion in 2024, an 89% increase on 2023. Warwyck CEO Devika Bhuwanee says: “Today, in wealth management we are seeing a growing number of investors seeking exposure to cryptocurrencies and we are seeing more wealth managers encouraging their clients to get exposure to crypto assets. The challenge they face is they typically must open a separate trading account with a crypto exchange to be able to buy, trade and hold these assets – an additional layer of complexity and risk. Here, at Warwyck, in one single trading account our clients get exposure to both traditional securities and to virtual assets. We can also facilitate the conversion of Bitcoin into fiat. “This is a service we can offer as a result of Mauritius pushing its regulatory framework to evolve in line with market demand.” EDB Mauritius Introduced the Regulatory Sandbox License (RSL) in 2016. This offers the possibility for an investor to conduct an innovative or disruptive business business activity for which there exists no legal framework, or adequate provisions under existing legislation in Mauritius. Under the RSL regime a temporary framework with guidelines is implemented allowing initial launch until the appropriate legal framework and adequate provisions are established. “We want to be a leading destination for structuring investments, particularly into the African and Asian markets and we will continue to be proactive in adapting to global wealth trends, regulatory compliance and investment opportunities,” says Vinay Guddye, director, financial services, EDB Mauritius.

Bitcoin has broken back above $90,000 per bitcoin, bouncing back after a roller coaster week that’s seen U.S. president Donald Trump trigger bitcoin and crypto price chaos. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has climbed around 10% over the last 24 hours, pushing the combined crypto market back over $3 trillion, helped by BlackRock revealing a market game-changer. Now, as Elon Musk issues a “foolish” crypto warning, Trump’s Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has reportedly confirmed Trump will unveil a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve during Friday’s White House crypto summit. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. President Donald Trump will announce a bitcoin strategic reserve on Friday, according to ... [+] Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, sending the bitcoin price sharply higher. “The President definitely thinks that there’s a bitcoin strategic reserve,” Lutnick, who has claimed to have millions of dollars worth of exposure to bitcoin, told independent news site The Pavlovic Today. “Now there will be the question of, how do we handle the other cryptocurrencies? And I think the model is going to be announced on Friday when we do that.” Lutnick added that bitcoin would receive a "unique status" under Trump's plans. “This is massive,” Pete Rizzo, the former Coindesk editor-in-chief who styles himself as a “bitcoin historian,” posted to X. On Friday, the first White House crypto summit will see influential crypto executives, founders and investors meet with representatives of the president’s working group on digital assets to hash out a regulatory road map for crypto as well as confirm details of Trump’s proposed crypto strategic reserve. “After a turbulent week of trading bitcoin has sharply rebounded to the $90,000 mark ahead of this Friday’s inaugural crypto summit," Petr Kozyakov, the chief executive of payment infrastructure platform Mercuryo, said in emailed comments. “Renewed optimism that U.S. president Donald Trump will make the announcement of a bitcoin reserve strategy is triggering a wave of buy orders for the king of crypto. A road map forward towards a crypto strategic reserve and a model for how it would be structured will be foremost in the minds of industry leaders attending the summit. The prospect of such a monumental move is bullish and may turn sentiment around in a digital token space still reeling from the recent hack of the Bybit exchange, the biggest of all time, and an implosion of the meme coin sector.” Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano all rocketed higher last weekend after Trump posted to his Truth Social account that he plans to create a U.S.-focused crypto reserve. “A U.S. crypto reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration, which is why my executive order on digital assets directed the presidential working group to move forward on a crypto strategic reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA," Trump posted to his Truth Social account, adding in a follow up post that bitcoin and ethereum would also be included. Smaller cryptocurrencies being named ahead of bitcoin in a potential reserve sparked a backlash from some bitcoin supporters and led to criticism of Trump’s advisors who are believed to be acting in their own interest. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has swung wildly after rocketing higher in the aftermath of Donald Trump's ... [+] election victory. In December, Trump confirmed he plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve. "We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else … but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead," Trump told CNBC. "Yes, I think so," Trump said in response to a question about whether the U.S. will create a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its oil reserve. In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference.

Title: Ports sale offers Panama way out of Trump row: experts

Trump has been fixated on the question of who controls shipping in the Panama Canal, which was built by Washington over a century ago to link the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and later handed over to Panama. The Republican leader has repeatedly threatened the use of force to seize the canal, claiming that Hutchison's ownership of two ports, one at either entrance to the canal, gave China control over the strategic waterway which links the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Panama rejected the claim that China had de facto control over the canal, which handles 40 percent of US container traffic, while taking various actions to appease Trump. Its campaign to dodge his fury received a major boost on Tuesday with Hutchison's announcement that it would offload its ports to a group led by giant US asset manager BlackRock. The sale offers Panama "a way out of the diplomatic crisis without needing to cancel (Hutchison's) concession, which would further damage the investment climate in Panama," Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America program at the Washington based Wilson Center think tank told AFP. Panama's government insisted that it had no hand in Hutchison's sale, insisting it was a deal "between private companies." Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, also argued that the deal was "purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports." But analysts said it came as a relief nonetheless for President Jose Raul Mulino, who had been under fierce pressure to reduce China's footprint in the country, without riling the second-largest user of the canal after the United States. In January, his government ordered an audit of Hutchison's Panamanian subsidiary, Panama Ports, in what was seen as a shot across the bow at the group owned by businessman Li Ka-shing, one of Asia's richest men. In the end, one of Hong Kong's largest conglomerates decided to bow to Trump's pressure. "In the Trump era, business is the new geopolitics," Sabrina Bacal, a Panamanian political scientist, told AFP. Natasha Lindstaedt, a political scientist at the University of Essex, called the situation "strange." "Possibly because the company was going to get audited by the Panamanian government and saw it more advantageous to sell than deal with the hassle," she said. - 'Taking back' the canal - In his inauguration speech on January 20, Trump declared the United States was "taking back" the Panama Canal, claiming China operated it. On a visit to Panama two weeks later, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued Mulino with an ultimatum to immediately reduce Chinese influence on the canal or face unspecified "measures." Panama sought desperately to appease the Trump administration by first pulling out of China's massive Belt and Road infrastructure program and then offering to act as a beachhead for Trump's mass migrant deportations. Panamanian authorities also began piling pressure on Hutchison, which handled 39 percent of the containers that passed through Panamanian docks in 2024, according to the Panamanian Maritime Authority. The country's Supreme Court agreed to consider two requests to annul the ports concession granted to Hutchison, which Panama's attorney general claimed was unconstitutional. The concession was first awarded in 1997 and extended for 25 years in 2021. While Hutchison's sale of the ports is expected to silence Trump's criticism of Chinese involvement in the canal, he could however continue to complain that US vessels are being overcharged to use the waterway. Last month, the US State Department claimed that Panama had agreed to let US naval vessels through for free -- a claim denied by the Panama Canal Authority, the independent agency that runs the shipping route.

Title: Trump says U.S. is 'reclaiming' Panama Canal after BlackRock strikes deal to buy Chinese-backed ports

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time HONG KONG — A Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell its stake in two Panama Canal ports to U.S. and Swiss investors amid pressure from the Trump administration over the ports’ ties to China. CK Hutchison, a conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, has agreed in principle to sell its controlling stake in a unit that operates the two ports to a consortium that includes the U.S. asset manager BlackRock, the companies said Tuesday. President Donald Trump had argued that the Chinese-backed ports, one each at the canal’s Pacific and Atlantic entrances, posed a national security threat because they gave the Chinese military potential control of the strategically vital canal. Though CK Hutchison said the proposed sale was unrelated to politics, Trump touted it as a victory in his Tuesday night address to a joint session of Congress. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” he said. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal.” Nearly 15,000 ships from around the world transit each year through the Panama Canal, which was built primarily with U.S. funds and was completed in 1914. About two-thirds of them are headed to or from the U.S. In 1999, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama under a treaty negotiated by President Jimmy Carter and ratified by the Senate in 1978, with the U.S. retaining the permanent right to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality. Trump has claimed without evidence that China controls the Panama Canal. He said he would consider using military force to seize it back from Panama, one of Washington’s closest allies in Latin America. “We didn’t give it to China,” Trump told Congress on Tuesday. “We gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.” Both China and Panama deny there is any foreign interference in the 50-mile canal, whose neutrality is enshrined in Panama’s Constitution. “China supports Panama’s sovereignty over the canal and is committed to maintaining its status as a permanently neutral international waterway,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. “China has never been involved in the management or operation of the canal, nor has it interfered in its affairs,” he said. The Trump administration and members of Congress were briefed on the proposed $22.8 billion deal, a person familiar with the matter told NBC News. The consortium, which also includes the Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, would gain control of an 80% interest in CK Hutchison subsidiary Hutchison Ports, which operates 43 ports in 23 countries. It would also receive 90% of Panama Ports, which operates the Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and the Cristóbal port on the Atlantic side. It does not affect the company’s ports in China. “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a news release. The news sent CK Hutchison up almost 22% Wednesday on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index. Control over the Panama Canal has been a high-profile focus of the Trump administration, with Marco Rubio making Panama part of his first foreign trip as secretary of state. Hutchison Ports won the rights to manage the two Panama Canal ports in 1997 in a bidding process that was described as fair and nondiscriminatory by U.S. officials at the time. In 2021, its contract was extended until 2047. Though the two ports sit at opposite ends of the Panama Canal, ships do not have to pass through them to enter. Other ports along the canal are operated by companies from Taiwan, Singapore and the U.S. The ports serve mainly to handle cargo, while the canal itself is run by the Panama Canal Authority, an independent Panamanian government agency. Though CK Hutchison is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, Trump administration officials had argued that it was subject to control by Beijing, which has been tightening its grip on the city. The potential sale, which is subject to regulatory approval, was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Panama Canal Authority Administrator Ricaurte Vasquez tour the Miraflores locks at the Panama Canal in Panama City Feb. 2, 2025. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS By Clare Jim and Scott Murdoch March 5 (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump has hailed a deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8 billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison which includes assets along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the U.S. consortium control of key Panama Canal ports amid White House calls to remove them from what it claims is Chinese ownership. On the first trading day after the deal’s announcement, CK Hutchison stock soared nearly 25%. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump told the U.S. Congress. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” The deal with the BlackRock-led consortium includes 90% of Panama Ports Company, which has operated the Balboa and Cristobal ports at each end of the canal for over two decades, CK Hutchison said. In total, the consortium, which includes Terminal Investment and Global Infrastructure Partners, will control 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries, the conglomerate said. The conglomerate’s stock rose as much 24.7% on Wednesday, outpacing a 1.7% rise in Hong Kong’s broader Hang Seng Index .HSI. Its price is now the highest since August 1, 2023. The sale involves CK Hutchison’s 80% stake in Hutchison Ports with an equity value of $14.21 billion. However, the conglomerate will receive more than $19 billion following repayment of some shareholder loans. The size of the proceeds would be similar to CK Hutchison’s entire Hong Kong market value prior to Wednesday’s share rally. The remainder of Hutchison Ports is owned by Singapore’s PSA International. About 12,000 ships used the Panama Canal last year that connects 1,920 ports across 170 countries. Its position is strategic for the U.S. as more than three-quarters of vessels passing through originate in or are bound for the United States. “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt in a statement. The conglomerate had been waiting for Panama Supreme Court to make a final ruling about the legal status of its contract to operate the ports after the local attorney general determined the contract “unconstitutional.” SURPRISE CK Hutchison, controlled by billionaire tycoon Li Ka-shing, has businesses in areas as varied as infrastructure, retail and telecom. It is also the world’s largest privately owned port operator. The sale of the ports unit does not include any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings HPH Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China, the conglomerate said in the statement. Sixt said the transaction was the result of “a rapid, discrete but competitive process” during which CK Hutchison received numerous bids and expressions of interest. JPMorgan in a report said while selling the Panama business is “understandable,” the deal is nevertheless a “surprise” given most of CK Hutchison’s other ports are not in regions directly exposed to Sino-U.S. geopolitical tension. It could be “an opportunistic deal,” JPMorgan said. “Based on our understanding of the management philosophy of CKH, any deal is possible as long as ‘the price is right’.” The brokerage said the deal would represent a significant strategy shift because ports would only account for 1% of the conglomerates earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, from 15%. The contribution of infrastructure, currently the largest segment, will rise to 33% from 28%. The $19 billion that CK Hutchison is set to receive from the sale is well above a $13 billion valuation on the ports assets estimated by analysts. “The disposal would be significantly value enhancing for CK Hutchison if it is completed on the preliminary essential terms,” Citigroup analysts said. CK Hutchison’s net debt level was HK$138 billion ($17.76 billion) in June and the sales proceeds could put the conglomerate into a net cash position, UBS analysts said.

The sale is "wholly unrelated to recent political news", a managing director said but was welcomed by President Donald Trump who said his administration "will be reclaiming" the Panama Canal. Business and economics reporter @taaffems Wednesday 5 March 2025 14:45, UK Two major Panama Canal ports have been sold from their Hong Kong owner to a consortium including American multinational investment company BlackRock. It comes after US President Donald Trump expressed a desire for America to "take back" the key shipping lane from alleged Chinese control. Hong Kong-based logistics giant CK Hutchison Holdings announced plans to sell a majority stake in the business that controls Balboa and Cristobal ports - which sit at each end of the shipping lane. The sale is of a 90% interest in Panama Ports Company, which is contracted to run the important ports until 2047. Money blog: Dollar sinks and market gains wiped out The Panamanian ports are being sold to a consortium including US financial behemoth BlackRock for nearly $23bn (£17.8bn). It comes after President Donald Trump applied pressure to end what he says is China's influence and control over the important shipping lane through which most goods pass. As part of wider comments, on taking control of other sovereign territories, Mr Trump threatened earlier this year to "take [the canal] back" having said, "China is running the Panama Canal". However, on Wednesday, CK Hutchinson Holdings insisted that the deal was "wholly unrelated to recent political news". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The deal was made a month after a visit to Panama City by US secretary of state Marco Rubio and was welcomed by Trump on Tuesday night. A happy Trump "My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it," Mr Trump told Congress. "Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals." The purchase is part of a wider deal for Hutchison Port's global business. In total, the consortium will control 43 ports in 23 countries, CK Hutchison Holdings said. The conglomerate pushed back against the idea the deal was impacted by politics. "I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports," CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt said.
