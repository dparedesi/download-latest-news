Title: Bitcoin To Drop To $100,000 Before A New All-Time High? Polymarket Traders Say Yes, But...

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) hovering under $110,000 has traders debating whether support will hold or a drop below $100,000 is imminent. What Happened: Position trader Bob Loukas noted on X that Bitcoin is approaching its Weekly Cycle Low, five weeks after peaking. While $118,000 would confirm a new cycle, short-term control remains with the bears. Loukas highlighted that BTC failed to break its all-time highs in mid-August, signaling the weekly cycle peaked around Week 18. Despite this, he remains bullish on the late-stage 4-year cycle, citing altcoins holding up as BTC dominance drops—a classic late-cycle pattern. Trader Joe Consorti pointed out that Bitcoin endured $2.75 billion in long liquidations across just four days, two of the three largest events of 2025. CoinDesk senior analyst James Van Straten drew parallels to September 2024: Bitcoin trended higher, then fell 11% after losing the trend line, consolidated for two weeks, and broke higher in mid-October, without breaching the early September lows. Also Read: Bitcoin Tumbles To $111,000: Bear Market Beginnings Or Still A Bull Market Dip? Why It Matters: Prediction markets show traders now see a 61% chance of Bitcoin dipping below $100,000 before 2026, up from 41% last week. Similarly, the probability of BTC hitting $100,000 before $130,000 has jumped to 61% from 36% as of Sep. 19. These predictions come on the heels of a major options expiry today, with over $22.3 billion set to expire on Deribit. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said BlackRock has registered the iShares Bitcoin Premium ETF, a covered call strategy designed to generate yield for Bitcoin holders. This product would complement its iShares Bitcoin ETF IBIT, which has seen $60.7 billion in inflows since January 2024. Read Next: Image: Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: Tricolor Auto’s Failure Has It All - ESG, Woke Capital, Illegal Immigration, Securities Fraud, Government Diversity Programs, BlackRock, etc.

Tricolor Auto’s Failure Has It All - ESG, Woke Capital, Illegal Immigration, Securities Fraud, Government Diversity Programs, BlackRock, etc. Tricolor Auto Group, the nation’s seventh largest used car dealer (and 3rd biggest in Texas and California), just filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy – e.g. liquidation. Its target customer had been illegal aliens, and with President Trump deciding to start enforcing the nation’s immigration laws, there has suddenly been a major “market correction” in that market segment. Not only has the customer base largely evaporated, but so have loan repayments, which Tricolor also serviced. The “tri colors” that the name references are the colors of the Mexican flag – red, white, and green. While the sudden loss of customers and loan repayments was the catalyst that caused the final collapse of Tricolor, its failure has revealed so much more, including securities fraud, Wall Street ESG gimmickry, race-based federal programs, etc. Tricolor has securitized more than $2 billion of its very high risk auto loans over the past seven years. The most recent issuance was in June of this year, with JP Morgan Chase and other money center banks peddling more than $200 million of “social bonds” to credulous investors. These securities are certified as “social bonds” by the US Treasury’s CDFI (“Community Development Financial Institution” program because Tricolor focuses on selling its cars and financial services to underserved communities, specifically Spanish-speaking non-citizens. Tricolor’s CEO, Daniel Chu, was quoted by Barron’s in 2022 as stating, “No one else is providing meaningful dollar credit to an illegal immigrant.” As documented in this recent Barron’s article (“Tricolor Files for Bankruptcy, The Auto Lender Was Once an ESG Favorite,” “Financial institutions until recently touted their social bond purchases as part of their commitment to ESG—or environmental, social and governance—principles. BlackRock took a $90 million stake in Tricolor in 2021 as part of its Impact Opportunities Fund focusing on businesses and projects owned, led by, or serving members of minority groups.” Of course BlackRock was involved. You may recall that a major contributor to the financial crash of 2008 was Wall Street wizards packaging up a bunch of sub-prime mortgages, securitizing them, and then selling those “mortgage backed securities” to investors as something other than perfumed garbage. That is effectively what Tricolor has been doing with its auto loans, with the help of Wall Street. In a Tricolor press release from March of this year titled “Tricolor Closes $328 Million Securitization to Advance Financial Inclusion at Scale in Underserved Communities,” CEO Chu stated, ”By providing deserving people with access to reliable, affordable transportation, Tricolor, which operates across six states and ranks as the third largest used auto retailer in Texas and California, helps move them into the financial mainstream and reverse systemic financial inequities in America.” Like the other securities issuance I referenced, JP Morgan Chase also promoted these odious securities, along with Barclay’s and Fifth Third Bank. Per Car Dealership Guy, Tricolor’s bonds have collapsed to a value of 12 cents on the dollar, virtually wiping out the investors who bought those bonds. But as bad as this all sounds so far, it’s actually worse. There was massive fraud by Tricolor, which is causing losses to all parties who did business with it. The banks who were packaging Tricolor’s securities also had lines of credit extended to Tricolor. There was a recent regulatory filing by Fifth Third Bank revealing that it was booking a $200 million impairment (loss) for fraud involving one of its customers. In this filing, Fifth Third disclosed that there was “recently discovered alleged external fraudulent activity at a commercial borrower,” and that it “is working with the appropriate law enforcement authorities in connection with this matter.” Barron’s confirmed that this commercial borrower was Tricolor. JP Morgan Chase also has about $200 million in loans outstanding to Tricolor, so it too will almost certainly be booking a massive impairment charge for this unrecoverable debt. Some of the news reports about the Tricolor fraud state that collateral was “double pledged,” meaning that unbeknownst to the banks lending money to Tricolor, the collateral they thought was backing up their loans was also pledged to other banks. Tricolor was also the servicer of its “buy here – pay here” loan portfolio, remitting collected payments to the banks who securitized their loans. From my experience dealing with fraud in this arena, it is quite likely that there was some level of kiting / ponzi scheme at work, and a constant inflow of new debt was necessary to keep servicing old debt that was not supported by actual assets. Working in Tricolor’s favor to perpetuate the fraud was the aura of woke virtuosity that kept the money flowing in, which also helped shield Tricolor from appropriate due diligence by those same woke banks throwing money at it. Working against Tricolor was President Trump’s immigration enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security issued this press release earlier this week: “Over 2 million Illegal Aliens Out of the United States in Less than 250 days.” This mass exodus of illegal aliens has obviously resulted in a collapse in Tricolor vehicle sales, but much of the existing customer base has now either been deported, or chose to self-deport. Their loans will obviously not be repaid. As for the cars being driven by illegal aliens who have left the country, Tricolor’s liquidators will see a huge loss on those vehicles that were surrendered. But the loss will be even worse on the cars that were simply abandoned to be stolen and stripped…or taken across the border. Blackrock, JP Morgan Chase, and all the other titans of Wall Street who bought into the hype about ESG investing deserve the loss they are going to take. But for American citizens seeking affordable used cars, there is some good news. Supply is about to improve in relation to demand. [buck.throckmorton at protonmail dot com] Comments 1 Sponge!

Time for big finance assholes to have skin in the game aka they lose their own personal money first to bondholders, investors, etc. Skin in the game by those peddling or directing investment funds into such are one of the biggest ways to kill risky investments being sold to ordinary unskilled investors.

Remember 2009? 2009 sucked in general, and sucked particularly for me. I had a lot of debt then, thanks to student loans. My income was okay, not great. But I had to have a car. The best deal on auto finance I could find was one of the big national banks, and the rate was a staggering 14.7%. Tight credit, lots of debt, short (but good) credit history all conspired to ensure that my car loan was *really* expensive. Was that a "financial inequity?" I was, after all, in an "underserved group" of recent college graduates with tons of debt and a bad risk profile. Where was my special deal?!?!?!

Not exactly, but close. Most collateral was not double-pledged in that period, but it was largely overvalued by underwriter(on purpose) to permit more leverage and major title problems that resulted in a lot of collateral being questionable when it came down. Thankfully, illegal alien used cars are a smaller market than real estate. Enjoy eating the losses, banks. Maybe one day you will learn. Posted by: Joe Mannix (Not a cop!) at September 26, 2025 11:13 AM (6bTRc) 53 I have to give proof of insurance when I've purchased vehicles. I'm sure that wasn't a requirement with Tricolor.

Gotta love "systemic inequities" here - yeah, it's kinda normal that there "systemic" differences between, you know, people in a country illegally, and everyone else in that country.

Being allowed to "mark to maturity" is how you get sudden collapses when everyone runs out of money, because "maturity" doesn't happen (default does, instead) and the collateral was shit and so the loss reserves run out instantly.

That is effectively what Tricolor has been doing with its auto loans, with the help of Wall Street." Do car loans get insured for default like sub prime mortgages? The unsolvable mess of 2008 was credit default swaps, a bunch of people wound up owning insurance policies, i.e. as the insurer. When the bundled insurance policies were traded, nobody bothered to check if the new owners could perform in the event of mass defaults. It was all new stuff that hadn't been specifically regulated.

Let that sink in for a moment — nearly three hundred federal agents, mingling among protesters, and we're just hearing about this now? But here's where it gets really infuriating. Just last December, the Department of Justice's own watchdog proudly announced there was "no evidence" of undercover FBI employees in the protest crowds. The Inspector General's report was crystal clear: no undercover agents at the Capitol on January 6. Period. End of story.

The big three need to be broken up (State Street, Blackrock, and Vanguard), the big banks like Chase, etc. need to be returned to Glass Steagal restrictions as well. We tried ignoring anti trust and regulatory limits to prevent too big to fail for the last thirty years or so. Didn't work, so we need to go back to those days--want to do risky shit, investment banks that can fail with the partners involved getting reamed if they do. Non risky shit, regular banking which needs to be safe, dull, and reliable.

The salesmen then sell the products to fund managers and institutional investors who are looking for high-risk returns and understand the underlying risks (rare) or who are looking for an extra tenth of a point on other people's money.

The loans were only made when the down payment was sufficient to cover the dealer cost of the car. So any loan payments were gravy. When the car was inevitably repossessed -- sometimes within only a few months -- the dealer got the car back and resold it. It was a good racket for the dealer. The "lender" was also the dealer.

A relief convoy battled incredible odds to bring supplies to the only airbase able to interdict the Italians and Germans trying to take over North Africa. A tanker carrying aviation fuel was hit by multiple bombs, but US merchantmen refused to abandon her, and brought her into port full of holes and under constant air attack. Once the fuel, lighter than water, was pumped out, the ship was as bouyant as lead. They tied her to two other ships to get out of the harbor and let her sink. Malta was saved once again.

Posted by: Elric The Blade at September 26, 2025 11:32 AM (iFTx/) ++++ Right, what Tricolor was doing was much worse. At least in the traditional "buy here, pay here" model, the dealer carried the risk himself. This is more akin to the mortgage scam. Nicer cars (usually), financed to extremely poor credit lists. The dealer is the lender, but the dealer has no money. He has a warehouse credit facility at a major bank that he draws to issue the loan. He lends the money to the customer, who then hands it back to the dealer. It hits the credit line and enters the sales book as cash. The dealer now has a liability one side (the note), and capital on the other (the cash). Standard (and dangerous) vendor financing. But the dealer sells the note at a discount to an investment bank (often the one that holds the credit line), who then packages it up into risk-tiered securities and sells them on to investors somewhere else. The dealer doesn't carry risk - unless he can't sell the notes. His risk is in that 30-90 period where he *does* hold the note.

The paperwork was a pain but I remember we put together a great chart showing that within 2 years, a $90k dump in Palm Springs was re-appraised for $250k, then $500, then $800. It was quite the scam.

The day he got his BBB passed, at the Iowa rally, he talked about exemptions (de facto temporary amnesty) for ag workers, you know, to help the poor farmers. Astonishing, really. Fortunately, apparently, the comment was met with silence from the crowd. Haven't checked lately, but recall that two months ago around 6 or 8 GOPe congressthings intro'd a bill for amnesty for ag and hospitality sector illegals. Stunning. And a good reminder of how bad things are. A massive, natural base of popular common sense support for reintro'ing rule of law in immigration surrounds a political class/business class that is utterly uninterested in legality, or social or economic consequences for citizens. Without Trump there'd be no hope at all. And with a Trump that is anything other than 100% all in, any hope based on analysis gets pretty thin. Three years from now, any Dem gets in the WH, it's as though Trump never existed, on this vital issue. There isn't much time, and there's barely any political margin of safety.

Posted by: mc at September 26, 2025 12:48 PM (TaHV5) 334 The illegal alien enema that Dr. Trump has prescribed is going to have a lot of economic knock-on effects. Supposedly, these aliens are paying taxes. Question is, are they? If they're off the books already, are employers keeping the withholdings themselves? And how much is spent to enforce gathering those taxes and fees? Especially locally, where corrupt mayors and governors play Sgt. Schultz - See nothin-k, know nothin-k. They have to for plausible deniability on who is here illegally. And there are the benefits sent illegally to non-US-citizens. Some by sloppy mistake, some by willful criminality - there's a recent article on how criminals in several countries made off with sbillions in health care funds, but stopped before trillions thanks to DOGE analysis. Most importantly: simple Supply and Demand. Demand drops because illegal alien demanders are being sent away. Not buying vehicles, housing, food. Hopefully that'll help with the inflation problem. Work Supply is also going to be a problem, which will mean price increases there. But the benefits will be to local workers, legal citizens. Ones less likely to remit money out of the country, out of the US economy.

The company confirmed partnerships with Oracle, SoftBank, and Nvidia, with plans for five new US data centers. To meet soaring demand for compute power, OpenAI is turning to debt financing and chip leasing, supported by Nvidia's $100 billion investment. Microsoft projects are excluded from Stargate, reflecting a diversified partnership approach.

Alibaba unveils trillion-parameter AI model and Nvidia partnership. Alibaba announced a partnership with Nvidia, plans for global data centers, and the launch of its largest AI model, Qwen3-Max, with over one trillion parameters. The model boasts strong performance in code generation and autonomous agents. New data centers will expand into Brazil, France, the Netherlands, and other countries, building on Alibaba's 91 facilities worldwide. The company also unveiled multimodal tools such as Qwen3-Omni, designed for immersive applications.

Importance for marketers: Direct integration of OpenAI models into enterprise data platforms simplifies deploying AI-driven analytics and personalization, enhancing marketing intelligence and customer engagement strategies. Google launches Data Commons MCP server for AI training and grounding. Google unveiled the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for its Data Commons, making real-world datasets—from census figures to climate statistics—accessible through natural language.

Developers can integrate this into AI systems, with open access via Gemini CLI, PyPI, and GitHub. A partnership with the ONE Campaign showcases early use in surfacing African economic and health data. Importance for marketers: Access to trusted, real-world data enhances the accuracy of AI-driven insights, critical for campaign planning, market research, and predictive analytics. Microsoft adds Anthropic models to Copilot for enterprise users. Microsoft will integrate Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4 models into Copilot, alongside OpenAI's systems. This diversification follows earlier deals to use Anthropic's AI in Office 365 apps. Opus supports deep reasoning, while Sonnet focuses on large-scale data processing and content creation. Enterprise users will be able to select the model suited to their task. Importance for marketers: Expanded model choices in Copilot enhance productivity and creativity, providing marketers with tailored AI tools for research, content generation, and campaign planning. Global experts call for 'AI red lines' at UN summit.

Notably, figures such as Geoffrey Hinton and Gary Marcus signed despite differing views on AI. UC Berkeley's Stuart Russell provided concrete red lines in prior work, emphasizing safety-first design. Importance for marketers: Regulatory frameworks around AI could shape how brands deploy AI responsibly, with compliance influencing data usage, content generation, and advertising standards.

Amazon debuts AI 'creative partner' for advertisers. Amazon launched a conversational AI assistant in beta on its Creative Studio portal, branded as a "creative partner" for marketers. The agent uses Amazon's retail data to support tasks from research and brainstorming to producing ads for Amazon DSP, Sponsored Display, and Sponsored Brand Video.

Pulse generates visual cards with tailored information such as event prep, health routines, and news, aiming to shift ChatGPT from reactive to proactive assistance. Privacy safeguards mirror standard ChatGPT policies, with feedback loops limited to individual users. Importance for marketers: Pulse highlights how personalization features could influence consumer engagement, shaping expectations for AI-driven marketing and raising data-use transparency issues. Musk's xAI sues OpenAI over alleged trade secret theft. Elon Musk's startup xAI has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it hired away employees to gain access to trade secrets tied to xAI's Grok chatbot and data center strategies.

Importance for marketers: The escalating legal battle underscores fierce competition in AI development, potentially affecting innovation cycles and the trustworthiness of AI providers in marketing applications. Google rolls out AI Search Live to all US users. Google launched AI-powered Search Live across Android and iOS in the US, enabling users to ask questions conversationally while pointing their camera at objects.

Google expands AI Mode in Search to Spanish users worldwide. Google extended its AI-powered conversational search, AI Mode, to Spanish speakers globally.

Available to Max plan users, it integrates with Gmail and Outlook to auto-label, propose meeting times, and draft responses. Importance for marketers: By automating email workflows, this tool streamlines communication and scheduling, freeing marketers' time for strategy while raising expectations for personalized, AI-assisted interactions in professional communications. Sam Altman signals compute-heavy new features for ChatGPT. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed upcoming "compute-intensive offerings" that will initially be restricted to Pro users. Altman described these as experiments in pushing the limits of infrastructure by allocating massive compute resources. He acknowledged costs may be higher but emphasized the long-term goal of lowering AI access costs. Importance for marketers: Marketers should expect premium features tied to higher subscription tiers, shaping budget decisions for advanced AI-powered content and campaign capabilities. Snowflake coalition launches open semantic standard for data.

Title: REX Shares and Osprey Debut The First-Ever US Ethereum ETF With Staking

Traditional investors in the United States will be able to gain direct exposure to a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), which has been introduced by financial institutions REX Shares and Osprey Funds. The REX-Osprey Ethereum staking ETF (ticker: ESK) debuted on US exchanges on Thursday, becoming the first regulated product offering spot ETH exposure while incorporating staking rewards. According to the September 25 press release, the fund “is the first U.S. fund to provide investors with cost-effective and convenient exposure to spot Ethereum via the 1940 Act ETF structure.” The investment vehicle also allows investors to participate in Ether’s proof-of-stake network by receiving monthly distributions without managing staking themselves. Staking allows holders of certain cryptocurrencies to gain rewards by locking their tokens into the network, a process that previously required technical know-how and direct interaction with cryptocurrency protocols. By packaging staking into an ETF structure, REX Shares and Osprey seek to make that process accessible to a broader range of investors via traditional brokerage accounts. The existing U.S.-listed spot ETH ETFs have accumulated roughly $25 billion in total assets under management since their launch early last year, with BlackRock’s ETHA leading the charge. ESK going live comes just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission delayed decisions on staking for Ethereum ETFs proposed by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. Notably, unlike other staking ETH ETFs that still require approval from the SEC, REX-Osprey’s ETF is structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940 framework, which bypasses the standard 19b-4 filing process. REX-Osprey introduced its Solana Staking ETF (SSK) in early July, making it the first crypto staking-enabled ETF to be approved in America. The two companies are also responsible for launching the first ETFs tracking the prices of Ripple’s XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), which debuted last week, following the same Investment Company Act 1940 playbook. Last month, REX-Osprey submitted paperwork with the SEC for permission to list a BNB staking exchange-traded fund. The introduction of staking ETFs marks a new phase for the fast-growing crypto industry, combining income-generating features with exposure to digital assets, all within an SEC-regulated investment vehicle. Meanwhile, over 90 other ETF proposals featuring assets like XRP and Solana, structured under the Securities Act, are still awaiting the SEC’s regulatory approval — some with decisions looming in October.

Title: BlackRock doubles down on Bitcoin with new income-focused ETF

Designed to leverage Bitcoin's volatility, BlackRock's covered-call fund could disrupt the crypto ETF market. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock is extending its push into Bitcoin with a new fund designed to turn the asset’s volatility into investor yield. On Sept. 25, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that the firm had filed for a product called the iShares Bitcoin Premium ETF, a covered-call fund structured under the ’33 Act. Unlike a traditional spot ETF that passively tracks Bitcoin’s price, the new product would layer an income strategy on top of BTC exposure. It plans to hold Bitcoin or related instruments while writing covered calls against those holdings to earn premiums. Those premiums would then be distributed to investors as income, allowing the fund to capture value from Bitcoin’s frequent price swings rather than simply mirror them. Meanwhile, Balchunas noted that this move could unsettle rival issuers already building income-based Bitcoin products, given BlackRock’s dominant position in the spot ETF market. The firm’s flagship iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has grown into the largest crypto ETF globally, managing tens of billions in assets since its launch last year. Balchunas pointed out that the latest filing illustrates BlackRock’s strategic focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, rather than joining competitors in pursuing ETFs tied to smaller altcoins. Over the past months, several issuers, including Grayscale, have applied for products linked to assets like XRP and Solana. However, BlackRock appears content to double down on the proven market leaders. That strong conviction appears to be paying off as the firm’s early Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs generate over $260 million in annual revenue. Speaking on these numbers, Leon Waidman, the head of research at Onchain Foundation, said: “[BlackRock built] a quarter-billion-dollar business, almost overnight. For comparison, many fintech unicorns don’t make that in a decade. This isn’t experimentation anymore. The world’s largest asset manager has proven that crypto is a serious profit center.” However, the firm’s global head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, argued that institutional participation in crypto ETFs remains in its early stages, suggesting more capital could flow in as regulated offerings mature.

Title: The #1 Waster of Healthcare Dollars and How to Stop It

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/26/2025 4:39:16 AM PDT by MtnClimber Washington steals HALF of healthcare spending! As Democrats threaten government shut-down over Medicaid cuts; as Americans are bracing for another increase in their healthcare costs; and as patients wait an average maximum of 132 days to see a primary care doctor, Americans can’t seem to wake up from the nightmare called U.S. healthcare. The rise in insurance premium costs is estimated at 7–10 percent next year. This is on top of already unaffordable family spending with the average American family expending $32,066 on healthcare in 2024 according to Milliman Medical Index. Faced with increasing pressure on their bottom lines, employers are passing these additional expenses on to employees with reduced benefits, narrower medical panels (which means longer wait times), plus higher deductibles and copays. Republicans plan cuts to Medicaid that Democrats and the complicit media say these cuts will “hurt families,” “increase uncompensated care,” “and lead to thousands of deaths.” Biden’s 2021–2023 lockdowns threw millions of people out of work. Unemployment made them ineligible for employer-supported health insurance. Biden then expanded eligibility, adding 17 million Americans to Medicaid rolls. More than 60 percent of these individuals have returned to work and become (again) eligible for employer-provided insurance. Cutting them from Medicaid rolls will actually increase funds available to pay for those who truly need Medicaid. NPR business analyst Maria Aspan is clear about whom she blames for elevated costs: “insurers, drug companies and your employer,” along with the Trump administration that has “government-sponsored alternatives” it won’t use, she says. Last year, the U.S. spent $4.8 trillion on its healthcare system. That amount is greater than the entire GDP ($4.7 trillion) of the third-most productive nation on earth, Germany.

I had an interesting chat with a neighbor, quite a skeptic as am I. He observed that, as a "fund," BlackRock was actually very susceptible when a "run" on their contractual holdings were to be made. Mostly we both have real estate, cash and no debt, but my bride and I have positions in to smaller "funds," which are coming to term. We will cash out, and apply the money to some remodeling on two houses. So those funds will be smaller thereby. Were a panic to occur and cause some runs, most people think of bank runs. But my neighbor and I imagine that there will be "funds" runs as well. When a fund cannot disgorge capital in a timely manner, we might well see the game of leverage. This, with a mind to Butler's text "War is a Racket," in which he mentions later in the small book all the little people who needed to sell their "bonds" at a loss, while larger entities were able to buy at a discount and hold to maturity. Who lost? Who loses? The little guys generally. We still hold to "zero debt," "cash is king" and trust but verify whenever possible to do so. I can imagine a time when BlackRock, State Street and others will not be able to generate "cash" enough when smaller entities want to "cash out." This has already been seen, in some smaller funds games. Best wishes. 20 posted on 09/26/2025 7:34:13 AM PDT by Worldtraveler once upon a time (Degrow government) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 19 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-26 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Further, the outlook is shaped by fundamental, macro and cyclical factors. It is noted that while recent earnings trends have been uneven across sectors, conditions are expected to begin stabilising in the coming months. The fund house, a 50:50 joint venture between Jio Financial Services and global asset management giant BlackRock, is positioning itself as a challenger brand in India’s crowded mutual fund industry, which already has more than 40 players. As part of its expansion, JioBlackRock has launched the Flexi Cap Fund, benchmarked against the NSE 500 index. The new fund -- JioBlackRock Flexi Cap Fund -- is powered by BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equities (SAE) approach. According to Kohli, a bulk of the portfolio will be invested in large-cap stocks because of the benchmark it is tracking. A key differentiator, according to the AMC, is the integration of BlackRock’s four-decade-old Systematic Active Equities platform, which blends big data, analytics, and human oversight to enhance portfolio construction. “The Flexi Cap Fund is our first active equity offering that leverages BlackRock’s proprietary Systematic Active Equity approach. This reflects our commitment to offering investors a dynamic, differentiated and potentially low-cost investment solution,” he said. According to him, backed by SAE, the fund aims to deliver long-term value through a disciplined investment process within a controlled risk framework across market cycles. The new fund is being offered at a total expense ratio of 0.50 per cent, among the lowest in its category. The new fund offer (NFO) is open until October 7.

Title: Ethereum price at crossroads, tests key support at $3,800 as analysts point at possible rebound

Full Content:
Ethereum (ETH) finds itself at a critical juncture as price tests support near $3,800 after a sharp pullback from recent highs. Analysts are now weighing the technical damage against on-chain signals that point in different directions. Recently, the price of ETH slipped below $4,000 and is now trading around the mid-$3,800s. The 24-hour range shows intraday swings between $3,833.75 and $4,051.26, while analysts single out the $3,800–$3,850 band as the immediate line of defence and $3,500–$3,400 as deeper liquidity zones if sellers push further. Notably, the Ethereum price has fallen beneath the clustered 20, 50 and 100-EMAs, which currently sit roughly between $4,083 and $4,238 and now act as resistance. Momentum indicators have also weakened, with the four‑hour RSI sitting near 29, indicating oversold conditions that often precede short relief rallies. On-chain flow metrics show notable exchange inflows, with a recent spike of about $66.7 million moved onto spot venues. That movement coincided with ETH dropping below $4,000, and it signals that some holders are routing coins to exchanges to sell. Large wallets holding more than 100,000 ETH have trimmed positions sharply, a development many analysts interpret as increased selling by the largest holders. At the same time, mid‑sized entities — addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH — are accumulating and taking a more prominent role in on‑chain ownership dynamics as highlighted by Joao Wedson. This transfer of supply from the very largest wallets toward a concentrated set of mid‑sized “sharks” has nudged the Gini coefficient higher after months of decline, underscoring renewed ownership concentration among wealthier addresses. The number of Ethereum whales is dropping sharply – and the sharks are now in the game! It’s the sharks (10k–100k ETH holders) who have been accumulating and taking a larger share of the market. Meanwhile, the Gini coefficient has stopped falling and is starting to rise again,… pic.twitter.com/Lk2E6saulJ — Joao Wedson (@joao_wedson) September 24, 2025 While these movements are seen as dynamic by some, it is also viewed as a double‑edged sword by others since it reduces one class of outsized selling but increase concentration risk. The Ethereum price correction has triggered heavy market liquidations, with roughly $409 million in Ethereum long positions liquidated. Funding rates on ETH futures have also flashed negative recently, according to Coinglass data, adding to the momentum behind short‑term selling. Institutional flows, especially on the Ethereum ETFs front, also paint a mixed picture, with some funds recording large inflows while others see significant outflows. Notably, over the recent week, more than $560 million reportedly moved into ETH‑linked funds, with BlackRock‑led products among the largest recipients, even as REX‑Osprey launched the first US staking Ether ETF. Views among market commentators diverge sharply, and long‑term bulls like Ted Pillows argue that ETH could ultimately trend well above $10,000 this cycle, though he anticipates a short‑term revisit to the $3,600–$3,800 area. $ETH is going above $10,000 this cycle. But before that, a correction will happen, and right now, it's happening. I think ETH could drop towards the $3,600-$3,800 level before a reversal and a new ATH. pic.twitter.com/Yy87rjHVAB — Ted (@TedPillows) September 23, 2025 Most importantly, reclaiming the $4,083–$4,330 zone would ease bearish pressure and could open a path back to $5,000. Conversely, a failure to hold critical supports would expose lower bands at $3,162 and $2,874, while the 200‑day EMA sits as a structural defence near $3,350.

Title: BlackRock exec says crypto ETF institutional adoption still early, XRP and SOL ETFs unconfirmed

Robbie Mitchnick stated that institutional penetration lags significantly behind retail adoption, despite the success of products such as IBIT and ETHA. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s global head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, believes the institutional adoption of crypto exchange-traded funds is still in its early stages. During a Sept. 25 interview with the Crypto Prime podcast, Mitchnick stated that institutional penetration lags significantly behind retail adoption, despite the success of products such as BlackRock’s Bitcoin (IBIT) and Ethereum (ETHA) ETFs. He added: “The vast majority of advisors in the US today still do not have the ability to make decisions on this on behalf of their clients.” Mitchnick said that most wealth management firms approved crypto ETFs for execution-only transactions, requiring clients to initiate purchases themselves rather than advisors making portfolio allocation decisions. Only a few leading-edge firms have crossed this threshold, with BlackRock’s model portfolio teams adding IBIT allocations for the first time in early 2025. Mitchnick also discussed the framework applied by BlackRock to decide on the launch of new crypto ETFs. Client demand is the primary driver, with the asset manager assessing the level of demand, the logic of the investment, and the problems the product solves. The next step is evaluating liquidity and maturity, culminating in BlackRock having clarity on its investment thesis and overall product and portfolio considerations. When questioned about potential ETFs tracking Solana and XRP, Mitchnick completely deflected and wouldn’t comment on the matter. Ethereum ETF demand faces constraints due to the inability to offer staking rewards, which typically provide annual yields of 3% to 4%. Mitchnick said that it had some impact on demand for these products. The staking integration involves complex tax and liquidity considerations within the grantor trust structure used by crypto ETPs. Staked Ethereum requires an unbonding period before it becomes freely tradable, which conflicts with ETF liquidity requirements. As a result, Mitchnick said that Bitcoin attracts broader institutional interest due to clearer positioning as “digital gold,” acting as a portfolio diversifier similar to traditional gold allocations. Meanwhile, Ethereum requires more nuanced discussions as a technology bet on blockchain adoption, resembling tech equities or venture capital investments. BlackRock sees limited tokenization opportunities beyond money market funds, where the technology creates clear utility by enabling 24/7 liquidity while maintaining full yield access. Mitchnick noted: “A lot of projects in the early years have gone wayward because they merely relied on that high-level value prop.” Lastly, he said that the firm remains bullish on stablecoins expanding beyond their current use in crypto trading to include cross-border payments and financial market settlement.

Irish Life Investment Managers hires BlackRock executive to run TirNua Capital Partners It is believed that TirNua Capital Partners will support Ireland’s energy transition. Stock image: Getty A major new fund to invest in ­Ireland’s energy transition infrastructure is being launched by Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM), the Irish Independent has learned. It has established a new unit to manage the fund, called TirNua Capital Partners. The group, part of Canada’s Great-West Lifeco, has hired David O’Brien as chief executive of TirNua Capital Partners. He was previously managing director and co-head of the Evergreen Infrastructure Partners, a unit of US investment giant BlackRock. Irish Life Investment Managers declined to comment. As of the end of 2024, Irish Life Investment Managers had more than €131bn of assets under management. It is the largest life and pensions group and fund manager in Ireland. In 2023, BlackRock achieved the first close of its Evergreen investment infrastructure fund, securing almost $1bn (€856m) in commitments from its founding partners. The open-ended equity fund focuses on investments in European and North American infrastructure connected to energy transition and energy security. It has cornerstone commitments from European Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo and Inarcassa, Italy’s national pension fund for engineers and architects. Mr O’Brien scaled multiple infrastructure fund strategies and led multiple infrastructure investments It is believed that TirNua Capital Partners will also focus on investing in infrastructure assets that will support Ireland’s energy transition. Ireland has a target of seeing 80pc of its energy needs provided from renewable sources by 2030. The Government also hopes to have at least 5GW of offshore generating capacity installed by then. By 2050, it hopes to have 37GW of offshore renewable energy capacity installed. However, the 80pc target is unlikely to be met. Industry executives point to a slow planning process, what they claim are inefficient energy capacity auctions, and the system of judicial reviews as hindering the pace of development. The target for the deployment of offshore energy capacity is also unlikely to be met. While at BlackRock, Mr O’Brien scaled multiple infrastructure fund strategies and led multiple infrastructure investments. As co-head of BlackRock Evergreen Infrastructure Partners, he led the fund’s development, fundraising and investment activities. Before joining BlackRock in 2011, he was director of corporate finance at Irish firm NTR, where he worked for six years.

Share this article BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, filed today for a Bitcoin premium income ETF in Delaware. The proposed fund represents a new investment product designed to generate income through Bitcoin-related premiums. The filing extends BlackRock’s crypto expansion beyond its spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which reached $90 billion in assets under management by September 2025. The firm captured 60% of the US Bitcoin ETF market share with IBIT. BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs generated $260 million in annual revenue less than two years after launch. The asset manager has been adding Bitcoin exposure to its in-house funds, with model portfolios allocating 1%-2% to crypto assets. The premium income structure targets income-focused investors seeking Bitcoin exposure with yield generation, differentiating it from BlackRock’s existing spot Bitcoin product that tracks the cryptocurrency’s price movements directly.

Title: ‘I was hoping for Paul Mescal,’ tourist says after meeting Jim Gavin on campaign trail

Jim Gavin chatted to Canadian couple Maja Crawley and Colin Landrie during a short Dart journey between Blackrock and Dalkey in South Dublin on Thursday. The pair seemed somewhat bemused to have come upon the Fianna Fáil presidential election candidate’s large entourage during their journey. An Irish Rail staff member kept a close eye to make sure there was no canvassing on board as this is a no-no for the transport company. Team Gavin told him they were only on board to “get from A to B” and the candidate was on safe ground talking to the Canadian pair who do not have a vote in the election. Dún Laoghaire TD Cormac Devlin told the tourists that Taoiseach Micheál Martin was in Canada to meet their prime minister Mark Carney. So did the couple from Winnipeg, Manitoba, expect to encounter a presidential election candidate on their trip to Ireland? “I was hoping for Paul Mescal or Dermot Kennedy,” Ms Crawley said. Mr Gavin does not have the same kind of star power as the actor or the singer-songwriter, but who does in fairness? The former Dublin GAA manager, a newcomer to politics, does enjoy some fame due to his multiple All-Ireland winning efforts and there was the odd ‘Up the Dubs’ as he canvassed in the South Dublin suburbs. He met footballers Paul Mannion and Con O’Callaghan in Dún Laoghaire. The pair later featured in a campaign video backing him. But what is Mr Gavin telling voters regarding his plans for the presidency? Voters Anne O’Leary and Rimiko Ogata got the pitch in a Blackrock cafe. They got a technical explanation of the powers of the presidency, such as scrutinising Bills and appointing taoisigh and ministers after elections. He also said the office had “the power to highlight things” like disadvantage and “those who mightn’t have a voice” and to “shine a light on people who provide services”. This would be a “big part” of his presidency, he told them. Ms O’Leary asked for an example and Mr Gavin mentioned the kind of places he visited while canvassing in Navan, Co Meath, the previous day including a childcare centre. “It’s about highlighting the really good things in the country,” he said. Speaking afterwards, Ms O’Leary and Ms Ogata said they had not been Fianna Fáil supporters in the past, but would consider voting for Mr Gavin. Ms O’Leary said that with Mr Martin as leader she was more open to the party. Ms Ogata agreed. Mr Gavin, of course, is the person the Taoiseach backed to be Fianna Fáil’s candidate. He held off Ireland South MEP Billy Kelleher in the internal parliamentary party vote to select a candidate, but by a thinner margin than many expected. One of Mr Kelleher’s supporters in that contest, Dublin MEP Barry Andrews, was on the canvass with Mr Gavin. Is he ruing the fact that it is Mr Gavin rather than Mr Kelleher pounding the pavements on the campaign trail? “It’s ancient history,” Mr Andrews said. “We had a great contest and are delighted that Jim is our candidate. “We’re very lucky. His record of service is really unbelievable. I came across him in humanitarian work when I was in [aid agency] Goal and he was in the Air Corps. “In the next four weeks he’ll grow as a candidate and get to know the people.” More importantly, does he believe Mr Gavin can stay ahead of the Fine Gael candidate, Heather Humphreys, when it comes to first preference votes? “I think so, yeah,” Mr Andrews said. A widely held view among commentators is that whichever Coalition party candidate is ahead – Mr Gavin or Ms Humphreys – will benefit from transfers from the other, propelling them to the presidency over left-wing Independent Catherine Connolly, who is backed by Opposition parties. Mr Andrews said “the concentration on first preference will be the main thing here” and “that’s why he’s working as hard as he is”. “He’s an amazingly energetic candidate,” he said. “People are really responding to him well on the road.” In Blackrock, Eugene Kenny, from “a Fianna Fáil house”, said he would vote for Mr Gavin as “he seems to be the best of the three at the moment”. He described him as a “middle-of-the-road kind of guy” who is “able to speak pretty well”. Another voter in the village, Jane McGauran, told Mr Gavin how Ms Connolly was particularly vocal on the horror of the war in Gaza. Dr McGauran is a volunteer with the Children Not Numbers charity and is a member of Irish Healthcare Workers for Palestine. She is in contact with families in Gaza who have “very sick children” including some with injuries from explosives. She asked if Mr Gavin would speak out about the war and advocate for injured children to come to Ireland. He told her what was happening in Gaza was “genocide” and said he would “speak out against that”. “The fighting needs to stop, the hostages need to be handed back by Hamas and we need to get aid into Gaza and to get those women and children and people out,” he said. “So I will champion that.” She later said she was impressed with Mr Gavin’s answer. “I hope he follows through.” Would she vote for him? “I’ll read his manifesto and I’ll have a think about it. I haven’t decided,” said the doctor, who is also considering voting for Ms Connolly. In these early days of the campaign, Dr McGauran was not alone during the canvass in being in the “thinking about it” category when it comes to Mr Gavin.

Ripple has unveiled a partnership that places its RLUSD stablecoin at the center of tokenized finance involving BlackRock and VanEck. The announcement, which was shared on the company’s official X account, connects Ripple directly to tokenized versions of institutional funds and sets the stage for deeper integration between the XRP Ledger and some of the largest names in asset management. Ripple confirmed that it is working with Securitize,the world’s largest tokenization platform, to bring in real-time liquidity for institutional assets provided by BlackRock and VanEck. Through this arrangement, holders of BlackRock’s $BUIDL and VanEck’s $VBILL can instantly convert their fund shares into RLUSD, allowing them to retain access to on-chain yield. With the partnership, BUIDL and VBILL holders will now be able to instantly exchange their shares for RLUSD 24/7. Acording to the announcement, Securitize is also expanding integration with the XRP Ledger. Considering Securitize is one of the largest tokenization platform, this move increases the XRP ecosystem’s exposure to tokenized assets and strengthens Ripple’s push to imporove its on-chain financial infrastructure. “Making RLUSD available as an exchange option for tokenized funds is a natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” said Jack McDonald, SVP of Stablecoins at Ripple. “ Speculation around Ripple’s relationship with BlackRock has been building for months, and many in the industry have linked Ripple’s cross-border settlement technology to the asset manager’s vision for tokenization. The company is now working to tokenize $2 trillion worth of assets on the blockchain. BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund, BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund), in March 2024, doing so through Securitize’s infrastructure. Securitize serves as the platform that tokenizes BlackRock’s fund, issuing digital tokens that represent ownership of the underlying real-world assets. The implications are significant. Ripple has managed to secure a foothold in the conversation by tying RLUSD to tokenized funds. Ripple’s RLUSD is now linked not only to BlackRock’s BUIDL but also to VanEck’s VBILL fund. This creates a direct link between Ripple’s stablecoin ecosystem and products from two of the world’s biggest asset managers. The partnership can be viewed as an important step that could eventually pave the way for XRP itself to be tied into BlackRock’s tokenization efforts. This partnership also speaks to Ripple’s strategy of expanding the utility of RLUSD. Since its launch, the stablecoin has steadily grown in adoption, reaching a market capitalization of about $742 million. The collaboration with Securitize, and through it with BlackRock and VanEck, also improves XRPL’s presence in the real-world asset (RWA) tonization sector.

Title: Kraken quietly closes $500M round as its unusual CEO pushes toward the IPO finish line
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/09/25/kraken-ipo-ceo/
Time Published: 2025-09-25T17:38:45Z
Full Content:
Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. “My neighbors think I’m under house arrest,” observes Arjun Sethi. It’s not hard to see why. On the driveway of Sethi’s comfortable Menlo Park home, located a few miles from Stanford University, sits a black Cybertruck that rarely leaves. Meanwhile, various figures stream in and out of a wide open garage anchored by a table littered with electronics. Inside, there are no pictures on the walls and the domicile’s only personality is supplied by a large German shepherd patrolling the backyard. Sethi is no criminal, though, and the house is not just his home. It is also the prime outpost for Kraken, the longtime cryptocurrency exchange where Sethi, who draws few lines between his personal and professional life, is co-CEO. The gray-flecked 42-year-old, who favors plain T-shirts, may not be concerned about what his neighbors think of him. But he does have to care about the opinions of another group: Kraken’s investors, who are expecting big things in the near future. Founded in 2011, Kraken has long flown under the radar compared with its bigger competitor Coinbase, but has always commanded the respect of traders and crypto veterans. In the past year, the company has reached for a bigger share of the spotlight with high-profile acquisitions and product launches ahead of an IPO planned for next year. All of this will test whether Kraken can meet the lofty $15 billion valuation that came with a new funding round it closed this month. Meeting that challenge will fall to Sethi who, despite an official title of co-CEO, is very much calling the shots at Kraken. An executive whose experience lies primarily in venture capital, he is an unusual choice to lead a company on the cusp of going public, but one very much in keeping with Kraken’s history as an unconventional company. Sitting at a large desk plunked in the center of his sparse living room one August afternoon, Sethi patiently replies to my questions as random figures pop in and out of the garage. He has a wide range of intellectual interests—he dabbled in journalism in college and has read extensively on major religions—but for Sethi nearly everything comes down to data. After founding a pair of startups and working as a senior product manager at Yahoo, Sethi cofounded the venture capital firm Tribe Capital. Even more than its peer VC firms, Tribe has a reputation for data-based decision-making, which led to bets on Kraken, as well as on Carta, which makes cap-management software, and the cloud computing firm Docker, among others. If the unsentimental Sethi has a passion, it is the idea of using blockchain technology to fix obstacles in the financial system that prevent people from tapping into collateral they own. He cites, for instance, the common conundrum faced by employees who leave a startup and must exercise their stock options and pay related tax within 90 days—resulting in many of them simply walking away from their equity. The solution, Sethi says, is tapping into the modular stack of services offered by decentralized finance (DeFi), which promises to give consumers an unprecedented degree of control over their assets, and let them lend or securitize them like never before. “My hope with crypto is to distribute those benefits more evenly. We’re not all the way there, but the first steps are happening—stablecoins, then tokenized assets, and now tokenized equities,” said Sethi. His vision is for Kraken to be a hub for all of these things, bringing the best elements of crypto and the traditional financial stack under one umbrella. To that end, the company spent $1.5 billion this spring to buy NinjaTrader, a platform for professional asset traders, in a move that boosted Kraken’s customer base by 2 million and represented, in Sethi’s words, the “largest-ever deal combining TradFi and crypto.” Coinbase is the dominant player in retail crypto, but Kraken’s bread-and-butter has always been professional and institutional customers. Lately, though, Kraken has been pushing to expand its presence in retail, including with the launch of xStocks, which are shares of popular companies like Apple and Tesla, wrapped in crypto and tradable on blockchains. The concept of blockchain-based stocks may seem exotic or downright unnecessary, but look closer and the early response to xStocks appears to validate Sethi’s views on where finance is going. He notes that xStocks, which the company hopes to offer in the U.S. next year, are taking off in markets like South Africa where the fees to purchase traditional stocks from brokerages can still be over 10%. By offering shares on a decentralized blockchain platform—xStocks can even be traded outside of Kraken’s exchange—there is less opportunity for middlemen like brokerages to exact high fees. Kraken is one of a handful of trading firms, including Robinhood, that are offering tokenized assets, and some big Wall Street names like BlackRock are doing the same. If this is indeed where the world is heading, it will be the latest instance of Kraken being ahead of the curve; previous examples include the exchange being one of the first to list Ethereum and to offer crypto derivatives. Unlike most startups, Kraken made it this far with very little in venture capital funding, raising only $27 million from its founding until this year. That recently changed, however, as the company decided to raise a $500 million round as part of its final gear-up for an IPO. The Information reported in July that the company was seeking to raise that amount; this week Fortune learned, from a person who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, that it successfully closed the round this month. The round featured no primary investor with Kraken itself setting the terms, including the $15 billion valuation, said the person. Contributors included investment managers and venture capitalists, as well as Sethi’s Tribe Capital and Sethi in a personal capacity. The investors are pouring money into a thriving business that pulled in nearly $80 million in post-Ebitda earnings, and over $411 million in revenue in the second quarter, according to figures published by Kraken. Those numbers, along with the firm’s longevity and strong reputation in the industry, put it in position to be one of the strongest of the crypto firms entering, or on the cusp of entering, public markets. If there is a wild card, though, it may be the firm’s senior leadership. Following our sit-down interview, Sethi and I take a turn around his Menlo Park neighborhood, and return to his house for dinner with a member of his team and a cousin who has turned up. The meal is delicious but unusual. The cousin has arrived with coolers full of stone crabs, which he and Sethi scatter on plates of ice around the kitchen. There is a shortage of crab utensils, but since this is Silicon Valley, Sethi punches an order into an app and more appear at the door in a matter of minutes—a trick he performs several times over the course of my visit. The main course comes in the form of thin, marinated fillets of something (Sethi won’t say what) that have arrived in a same-day delivery from Wyoming. Sethi artfully grills the stack of fillets in his backyard, serving them with a nice California red, and that’s all. The dinner was par for the course for how Kraken operates more broadly. For its first decade, Kraken was defined by its cofounder Jesse Powell. A soft-spoken philosophy major and self-described introvert, Powell steered the company through various crises that buffeted the crypto industry. At some point along the way, he took on a more abrasive persona on X, posting comments on topics like gender and pronouns that made him a villain among certain mainstream media outlets. A working-class kid from Sacramento, Powell has also been game to spar with San Francisco liberals, including by suing a co-op he says denied his bid to buy a unit on grounds of his politics. (The case is ongoing.) In 2022, Powell stepped down as CEO amid a federal investigation into his role at a Sacramento arts nonprofit he had founded. The probe created a multiyear legal ordeal for Powell, including an FBI raid of his house that was leaked to the New York Times. The Justice Department this summer acknowledged Powell had done nothing wrong, but the three-year legal cloud resulted in tumult at the top of Kraken. On stepping down, Powell named longtime lieutenant Dave Ripley as CEO, but last year the company announced Sethi had taken on the role of co-CEO. A co-CEO arrangement is unusual at the best of times, and according to multiple people with ties to the company, it is basically a fiction in the case of Kraken. One former executive, who asked not to be named in order to speak candidly, said that on a Zoom call shortly after the co-CEO announcement, an employee asked Powell who would be making decisions; the founder stated definitely that Sethi would decide everything—even as Ripley, the now co-CEO, sat nearby. That same person praised Sethi’s command of product, but also complained that the new leader appeared indifferent to staff morale, and has run Kraken more like a venture capital firm than a company, relying on outside associates more than longtime staff. The person added that Sethi’s ongoing ties to Tribe Capital, where he is chairman, pose a conflict of interest. “Arjun is chairman of Tribe Capital, but doesn’t run [Tribe’s] business day to day. This arrangement was approved by both the Kraken board and his LPAC [limited partner advisory committee] at Tribe,” said a Kraken spokesperson. Sethi’s arrival also roughly coincided with the departure of a number of senior executives, including Kraken’s CTO, COO, senior sales staff, and longtime lawyer. While executive turnover occurs at every organization, the scope of change at Kraken has likely contributed to the company’s IPO bid getting pushed to 2026 even as a spate of other crypto firms have gone public this year. The Kraken spokesperson addressed the turnover by pointing to an October blog post by Sethi and Ripley titled “A New Day,” which notes: “We made a number of changes to the organization to eliminate layers and make the organization leaner and faster.” She acknowledged the shake-up had affected morale, but added that employees are now “energized and excited” as Kraken’s pace of shipping products picks up. Another former executive contacted by Fortune, who asked not to be identified owing to legal constraints, also made the case that Sethi’s disruptive management style was necessary to prepare the company for its IPO push. The person added that Kraken’s many years in business had resulted in more pre-IPO regulatory and operational issues than other firms, and added that the co-CEO role has served the company well, with Ripley excelling at internal operational issues and Sethi handling sales and public-facing roles. For his part, Sethi described his co-CEO as a “multiplier of the strategy because Kraken has so many products” and said he is seeking to build a management structure similar to what Mark Zuckerberg has done at Meta, where dedicated teams serve each of the company’s discrete brands. Following a period of investor exuberance that peaked in 2021, the window for new companies to go public all but closed as investors came to see startup valuations as overly inflated. That finally changed this year, and for crypto companies, a new appetite for public companies combined with regulatory tailwinds has led to an IPO bonanza. In the past few months, stablecoin issuer Circle enjoyed one of the biggest same-day IPO pops in corporate history, while lesser lights of the crypto scene like Gemini and Bullish also made successful public debuts. For Kraken’s investors, the company’s decision to wait until 2026 to list publicly is likely a source of frustration and anxiety. Will the market still be eager for another crypto IPO? There is cause for concern on this front. There are a growing number of indicators that current stock prices are overvalued, and in the case of the newly listed crypto firms, their business prospects appear tenuous. In Circle’s case, declining interest rates are a direct drag on the firm’s stablecoin revenue, while both Bullish and Gemini have far fewer customers than the likes of Kraken and Coinbase. If the current crypto bull run is followed by a crash, as has happened in numerous previous cycles, these firms’ share prices risk being clobbered. All of this increases the pressure on Kraken to hasten its IPO. But if the bottom falls out of the market before it has time to list, Kraken investors can take comfort that—far more than most other crypto firms—it has a sound business model and multiple revenue streams. The company is also seeing growth in numerous key markets outside of its longtime strongholds of Europe and the U.K. This means Kraken, regardless of how its IPO plans shake out, is built to play the long game. “Our model’s built around pro traders and institutions,” says Sethi. “Features like Kraken Pro, our robust API, and advanced interfaces make us a destination for funds and high-volume clients—they use our exchange not because it’s flashy, but because it works and the liquidity is deep.” In the future, Kraken will be in an even better position if Sethi’s vision of a total convergence of traditional finance and crypto comes to pass. If it does, the company’s investors and executives—especially Sethi—stand to make a tidy bundle. So much so that Sethi will have the resources to easily fund a charm offensive to win over his suspicious neighbors—provided, of course, that he cares about such things. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Intel Shares Jump 6% After Reportedly Approaching Apple For Possible Investment

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Intel has held talks with Apple about a possible investment, Bloomberg reported Thursday, the latest effort by the beleaguered chipmaker to reinforce its business in recent weeks with funding from Nvidia, SoftBank and partial ownership by the U.S. government. Discussions between Intel and Apple are at an early stage and include talks about the two companies working together more often, though it’s not clear whether an agreement will be reached, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Apple and Intel partnered for years as Intel provided chips for Apple computers, though their cooperation was cut after Apple announced in 2020 the company would produce its own processing units, and Apple has since unveiled a second iteration of its chip, the M2, which is manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Intel shares rose by nearly 6% to just below $33 as of around 11:10 a.m. EDT, following an earlier premarket rally, while Apple’s stock ticked slightly higher (0.3%). Neither Apple nor Intel immediately responded to requests for comment from Forbes. Intel has reached out to other unspecified companies about potential investments and partnerships, according to Bloomberg. Intel’s shares have rebounded in recent months after the Trump administration signaled support for the chipmaker. President Donald Trump earlier this year called Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan “highly CONFLICTED” and urged Tan to resign, following his alleged ties to Chinese firms and a criminal case involving Cadence Design, where Tan previously served as CEO. Tan and Trump appeared to mend their relationship, however, after Tan visited the White House in August. Following the visit, SoftBank announced it would invest $2 billion in the company as part of both firms' “investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation” in the U.S., ranking SoftBank as Intel’s fifth-largest shareholder. Trump announced in late August that Intel agreed to give the U.S. a 10% stake in the company, making the federal government one of its largest shareholders behind BlackRock and Vanguard. Earlier this month, Nvidia said it would acquire $5 billion worth of Intel’s shares and announced the two companies would collaborate on developing custom data center and personal computer products.

Fianna Fáil presidential election candidate Jim Gavin has said he did not see bullying or sexism during his military career but he praised the Women of Honour group for highlighting abuse in the Defence Forces. A tribunal was established following allegations of widespread abuse and misconduct made by the group. Mr Gavin, a former Defence Forces member and Dublin GAA manager, visited Blackrock and Dalkey in south Co Dublin on Thursday to canvass voters. During a press conference, he said the Women of Honour had “done the State some service by stepping forward” and that “we need to learn from what happened”. He said that during his time in the military he served “with pride” and “to the highest standards” and he “set a very high standard for those people who I led and who I followed”. “I had a really positive experience in Óglaigh na hÉireann,” he said. “It gave me great opportunities. It shaped the person who I am.” Pressed on whether he has seen examples of bullying or sexism during his time in the organisation, Mr Gavin replied: “I didn’t see any of that.” He added: “That’s not everyone’s experience and I understand that. I championed those who have put their name forward and I think they’ve done the State a great service.” The former Air Corps member said he was “very proud” of what the Women of Honour did in stepping forward and that he was fully behind them and “really keen to see what comes out of this inquiry”. [ Presidential candidate Jim Gavin says online claims about him are ‘obvious lies’Opens in new window ] Mr Gavin, who is on leave from his role as chief operations officer of the Irish Aviation Authority for the duration of the campaign, was also asked if he was satisfied about a secret arrangement dating back to the Cold War era that allowed the UK to police the State’s airspace. “You mentioned that word secret so obviously one can’t comment on that,” he said, adding that “these are matters between the Irish Government and any other particular state”. Mr Gavin said he welcomed planned Government’s investment in the Defence Forces arising from proposals from the Commission on the Defence Forces. Separately, asked whether he felt people need help with the cost of living with the budget approaching, Mr Gavin said: “I think cost of living, housing, homelessness, these are challenges of our time and our Government will be defined by them. “The Taoiseach and the leaders in Government have said that there is more work to do, and I accept that. “And as president, though you are non-political, I will, without fear, nor favour, highlight issues that are important to Irish people and represent them to the best of my ability.” [ Presidential election: Meet the three hopefuls who will be on the ballot paper next monthOpens in new window ] Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Listen to our Inside Politics podcast for the best political chat and analysis Get the Inside Politics newsletter for a behind-the-scenes take on events of the day Our politics team's behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

UPDATED 09:00 EDT / SEPTEMBER 25 2025 by Duncan Riley Unified platform for identity, access and devices company JumpCloud Inc. today announced the launch of JumpCloud Asset Management, a new solution that gives information technology teams a simple way to automatically track, manage and report on all IT assets. The new offering has been designed to allow organizations to move past manual spreadsheets and different point solutions so that instead, they can create one source of truth for all hardware assets, from procurement to retirement. JumpCloud Asset Management helps organizations optimize costs and streamline compliance while reducing operational inefficiencies by giving IT teams complete visibility and control. The service also allows IT administrators to make smarter budget decisions and ensure every device is accounted for by centralizing asset data.

Securitize, a platform for tokenizing real-world assets, is expanding to the Sei blockchain with the tokenized Apollo Diversified Credit Fund (ACRED) the first to debut on the network. The move introduces tokenized private credit to Sei for the first time, the firm said. ACRED, which has $112 million in total value according to RWA.xyz, acts as a feeder into Apollo’s private credit strategy, which includes corporate lending, asset-backed deals and dislocated credit. Only qualified investors can participate, and the tokens are interoperable across blockchains via Wormhole, a cross-chain messaging protocol, allowing easier movement between networks and improving liquidity. Tokenized private credit is part of a broader shift in financial markets in which traditional instruments are represented on blockchain systems to speed up settlements and cut out intermediaries. The real-world asset market is now above $30 billion, RWA.xyz data show. "ACRED’s expansion to Sei further demonstrates how blockchain infrastructure can unlock new pathways for investor participation in private credit and accelerate digital innovation,” said Christine Moy, a partner at Apollo and the head of digital assets, data and AI strategy, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. Other funds will hit Sei in the near future, Securitize said. Securitize has already tokenized over $3 billion in assets, including offerings from BlackRock, KKR, and VanEck, the release said.

Title: Banks retreat from climate change commitments – but it’s business more than politics

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AAI.jhmy3ce5q Share article Print article Another business-led effort to fight climate change is unraveling. On Aug. 27, 2025, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance suspended its activities after several major U.S. and European banks backed out. While most observers are blaming the strong political backlash in the U.S. against climate change action and sustainable investing, we believe the banks didn’t need much of a push: These net-zero alliances never made much business sense and were not particularly effective at fighting climate change. Indeed, for us the puzzle was why they had flourished in the first place. To examine their rise and fall, we recently conducted a research project that encompassed interviews with more than 80 executives from various financial institutions, activist organizations and oil and gas companies. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance was founded in 2021. Members agreed to limit lending to carbon-intense sectors so that total greenhouse gas emissions from companies in the banks’ loan portfolios are close to zero by 2050. This target aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement but was not binding and lacked clear shorter-term targets and plans. Similar net-zero networks were established for insurance, asset management and other financial areas, all under the umbrella of the United Nations Environment Program’s Finance Initiative. Over the past 16 months, the insurance and asset managers’ alliances have also suspended their activities. These net-zero alliances were built on the premise that climate risk equals financial risk and that the challenge requires a collective response. Their goal was to leverage the power of finance to push companies to decarbonize their products and processes. Key financial regulators, central banks and a few of the largest asset managers propelled these alliances because they perceived that climate change poses serious long-term systemic risks to markets and economies around the world. Influential figures such as Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and former Bank of England head Mark Carney, now the prime minister of Canada, lent legitimacy to these initiatives. Some environmental groups also supported these alliances as a smart strategy to pressure companies on climate. Many other financial institutions then joined the net-zero bandwagon, but our research revealed that they didn’t do so because of concern about climate-related financial risks. Rather, they felt an array of pressure from peers, investors, activists, regulators and even their families. Many people we interviewed mentioned reputational risk as a key driver and saw a low-carbon transition as inevitable, driven by regulation, technological innovation and consumer demand. This was the Biden era, with billions of dollars flowing to clean energy through the Inflation Reduction Act. The burgeoning field also spawned a specialized but lucrative industry of data providers and consultants who actively marketed carbon management, disclosure and broader sustainability services. The global market for sustainability data and software was estimated at more than US$1 billion in 2024 and growing rapidly. Climate strategy and sustainability reporting was the fastest-growing business sector for accounting and consulting firms. And asset managers were happy to collect higher fees for funds screened for sustainability – even though these funds have not outperformed the broader market. These vested interests spurred continued expansion of net-zero networks. Indeed, at its peak in 2024, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance included over 140 members globally with $74 trillion in estimated total assets, representing over 40% of global banking assets. Given the size and scope of these net-zero networks, what triggered their rapid collapse? One major factor, of course, was the political backlash against anything connected with climate action and sustainable investing following the 2024 election of President Donald Trump. Finance officials in more than 20 U.S. states have demanded that major asset managers restrict the use of environment, social and governance benchmarks, accusing them of eroding “traditional fiduciary duty” and claiming they hurt investors. In August, 23 Republican attorneys general accused organizations created to set standards for corporate climate disclosures of operating an anticompetitive “climate cartel” and violating antitrust laws. While the political pressure in the U.S. has indeed been intense, the collapse of net-zero networks and the broader corporate retreat from climate commitments is largely due to the continued profitability of fossil fuels and the high costs and risks of deep decarbonization. Investors and banks, of course, want to keep on financing profitable companies and avoid pressuring their clients to take risky measures. Oil companies such as BP and Shell that had relatively strong climate targets suffered financially as a result, prompting them to retreat from these targets and shift capital from renewable projects back toward fossil fuels. High energy prices in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war made the sector even more lucrative. Low-carbon fuels and processes for industries such as aviation, steel and cement are still very expensive. Moreover, the Trump administration is abolishing most subsidies for clean energy and freezing permits for offshore wind, while easing regulations and opening more land for oil and gas exploration. These economic incentives made it hard for the banking alliance to reduce financing for fossil fuels – and the money has kept on flowing into oil and gas projects. European banks that sharply cut funding to fossil fuel companies saw their business diverted to other banks and to private, nonbank sources of finance, which has soared in the past two years. Facing this loss of business, major banks’ lending to oil and gas companies surged in 2024, driving loans to a three-year high of $869 billion. The costs of membership in the net-zero alliances also increased over time, with the adoption of stricter standards that called for specific plans and timelines for ending fossil fuel financing entirely. The new standards also required loan recipients to disclose Scope 3 emissions, which include emissions from a company’s suppliers and customers. Managers in financial institutions told us that the increasingly complex and demanding requirements were generating strong pushback from their clients. We also heard that membership was turning from a reputational asset to a liability, as activist organizations called out the hypocrisy of continued fossil fuel lending despite their commitments to phasing it out. Although banks are rushing back to finance fossil fuel projects, these loans typically have long terms of 10 to 25 years. This means they carry the risk that an eventual transition to clean energy will make these projects worthless, “stranded assets.” One study estimates that investors are currently exposed to more than $1 trillion in potential losses. Why do banks often ignore these risks? Our interviewees mentioned the organizational silos that separate analysts who assess climate risks from the loan originators. In other words, the employees deciding where to lend money may not be talking to the team that best understands the long-term risks. Moreover, current risk assessment tools are quite crude and don’t generate the quantitative metrics that loan underwriters want. Finally, loans are increasingly repackaged and sold, or securitized, into the larger corporate debt market, obscuring the risks. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance isn’t disappearing entirely. The group is currently deciding on whether to restructure into a much weaker “framework initiative” that provides voluntary guidance instead of binding commitments. And some banks leaving the alliance have stated that they will maintain their climate goals and sustainability policies. But climate risks are real and growing. The Boston Consulting Group recently estimated that just the physical risks – floods, drought and wildfires – could cost companies up to 25% of their profits by 2050 and substantially cut global GDP. A transition to a low-carbon economy will cost trillions of dollars and create massive disruption – as well as opportunities – as new technologies and companies emerge. The longer that action is delayed, the greater the risks to the planet – and of more drastic shocks to the global economy and financial system.

Zilch, the London-based fintech transforming the way people pay, today announces the appointment of Boriana Tchobanova as its Chief Operating Officer (COO) as it continues to strengthen its world-class management team. 0 25 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Tchobanova joins from American Express Global Business Travel, where she served as Chief Transformation Officer, leading the business’ post pandemic recovery and industry transforming M&A, and paving the way for its successful multiple billion-dollar IPO in 2022. Prior to this, Boriana spent almost 15 years with American Express across multiple senior roles in strategy, transformation and operations, including as COO of the company’s digital business. This appointment comes on the heels of Zilch doubling revenues to £110 million for the year ending March 2025 - marking a fourth straight year of 100% growth - with gross profit surging 143%. Zilch was recently recognised as EMEA’s fastest-growing tech unicorn by Deloitte and ranked the UK’s fastest-growing $1bn+ fintech by both the Financial Times and The Sunday Times. This impressive growth trajectory has seen the business attract a wide range of industry leading talent to turbocharge the next stage of its journey. Tchobanova’s appointment follows the appointment last year of Mark Wilson, BlackRock main Board Director and former CEO of FTSE 100 insurer Aviva, to the Board. Tchobanova will work closely with the CEO and business line leaders to drive operational excellence, transformational change and strategic delivery. Bringing her two decades worth of Fortune 100 experience, she will work with the team to deliver major initiatives that will support the organisation’s growth, unlock new revenue opportunities and improve efficiencies. Philip Belamant, CEO and Co-Founder of Zilch, said: “Zilch has achieved exponential growth over the past five years by pioneering a model that delivers better outcomes for consumers while building very strong operating leverage. This puts us in a powerful position as we enter the next phase of our journey, scaling a business built to stand among the most significant players in global finance. Attracting leaders from major incumbents is always a positive sign, but the real test is finding those who can bring deep institutional knowledge without being held back by the cultures, technologies or beliefs of those very institutions. We believe Boriana is one of those rare people, and I’m delighted to welcome her as we shape the future of Zilch.” Commenting on her appointment, Boriana Tchobanova said: “Zilch’s mission to eliminate the high cost of consumer credit for the mass-market and accelerate financial inclusion through advanced technologies is deeply meaningful to me. In just five years, the company has delivered record-breaking growth and is now building a category-defining business. The next phase - launching bold, customer-centric product innovation, pursuing transformative M&A and preparing for a potential listing - will demand operational excellence at scale. I’m supercharged to join Phil and his exceptional team for the road ahead.”Zilch has also appointed industry leading, full-service communications agency, MHP Group, who will deploy its specialist advisors across strategic communications, public affairs, creative campaigning and capital markets advisory. Its Financial Services team has supported fast-growth, pre-IPO fintechs on their journeys to going public, including Coinbase and Airwallex, with its Capital Markets and Corporate Advisory team ranked as one of the leading communications advisers. Alex Bigg, CEO of MHP Group commented: “We couldn’t be more excited to be working with Zilch, the UK’s fastest growing fintech unicorn. The business is on an extraordinary growth trajectory with ambitions of becoming a listed business. MHP Group has a long history of working with some of the most exciting high-growth private businesses and major listed brands, and our unrivalled depth of expertise and specialisms will see us support Zilch as it continues to build something truly powerful.”

Title: Can XRP extend its recovery after Ripple-BlackRock partnership?

XRP defended $2.7 support, but a bearish pattern could derail the recovery Fund holders of BlackRock’s BUIDL can redeem the shares to RLUSD for fast and efficient on-chain liquidity. The update did not stir XRP as the altcoin under the whims of the broader market sentiment. Ripple [XRP] has announced off-ramp support for BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, allowing fund holders to swap 1:1 with its stablecoin RLUSD. A similar feature will be enabled for VanEck’s tokenized product, VBILL, in the coming days. According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the move was a ‘real utility’ for users to have on-chain liquidity on the go. He added that the swap feature will be available on Ethereum [ETH] but will be expanded into the XRPL ecosystem. Source: X The off-ramping will be achieved through a partnership with Securitize, the real-world asset tokenization powering the VBILL and BUILD products. Conventionally, the off-ramping for these two tokenized treasury funds involves off-chain through bank transfers or equivalent cash via Securitize. This could take more time for settlement, hence the on-chain exit like RLUSD can be more efficient. But RLUSD isn’t the first one to offer this feature. Circle made the first move in April 2024, allowing BlackRock’s BUIDL fund holders to cash out via USDC. As of writing, RLUSD had a market cap of $742 million, with an 8% growth in the past month. Circle’s USDC, on the other hand, had a $73.6B market size and ranked second only to Tether’s USDT. Source: DeFiLlama Some notable rival stablecoins that posted double-digit growth over the same period were Ethena’s [ENA] USDe and PayPal’s PYUSD. For Ethena, its high yield has been a key selling point, while PYUSD has scored several partnerships on top of its 4% yield rate. However, RLUSD was launched last December, so the current pace of growth was commendable too. In fact, its aggressive expansion towards institutional clients could fuel its growth. For Jack McDonald, SVP of stablecoins at Ripple, the latest partnership will be a ‘natural step’ to bridge traditional finance and crypto. For his part, Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, said the integration will help ‘automate liquidity for tokenized assets.’ That said, XRP, like the rest of the market, was barely holding itself together after the recent liquidation cascade. It was down about 10% from its September high of $3.2 but defended the H2 support at $2.7, raising recovery hopes. But price action formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, which could drag it lower if validated.

Title: AIL season preview: Clontarf looking strong but back-to-back titles a tall ask

Rarely has a new All-Ireland League campaign been so generously sprinkled with stardust. Most notably, of course, Carlos Spencer has pitched up as the new head coach at Terenure College, but it doesn’t stop there. There are also strong rumours of Cian Healy and Keith Earls making prodigal returns for Clontarf in 1A and Thomond in 2C, and there’s been a wide influx from the Ireland Sevens squad, the schools and abroad to augment the presence of provincial academy players. Nenagh Ormond also provide some novelty value as the first club from Tipperary to play in the top-flight while there’s also been plenty of player movement during the summer. Jordan Coghlan has made a return home to Clontarf, with his relocation to Malahide outbidding even the pull of his Terenure friends and King Carlos. The champions have also acquired a host of talent from UCD, including Ireland under-20s lock Alan Spicer, while backrower Richie Whelan has returned from his stint in La Rochelle and Angus Lloyd is back again. After last season’s trophy-laden season, and despite losing John Vinson to Australia, ‘Tarf look strong once more, although no team has retained the title since Shannon in 2006. Cork Constitution were the latest to come up just short, and last season’s beaten finalists have lost two of the star turns in their 2024 success (outhalf James Taylor and winger Matthew Bowen) to Australia, as well as John Forde and Daniel Hurley to Blackrock. But they have again recruited well from UCC, while another of that title-winning side, Rob Hedderman, and Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks, have both rejoined. And Con are, well, Con. St Mary’s, who host Clontarf on opening day, were the first newly promoted side to make the playoffs and have retained all their key men, while UCD/Leinster academy prop Andrew Sparrow and former Ireland under-20 prop Oisín Michel look like good signings. After their Bateman Cup win, Lansdowne were the form team in the second half of the season. Along with Coghlan, their acquisition of Bobby Sheehan looks like one of the signings of the summer. Ditto former Connacht centre Tom Daly, the ex-UCD captain James Tarrant and Leinster academy scrumhalf Tadhg Brophy from Naas. Inspired by Marks, newly installed as captain, they beat Clontarf in a full-on Leinster Senior Cup semi-final and host Con for their opener. But last season’s top four will be hounded by the chasing pack. Ahead of welcoming Young Munster on opening day, Ballynahinch, fifth in three seasons running, had a low-key summer featuring a June trip to Boston. Aaron Sexton has returned from his NFL sortie, and they’ve signed the captain of Wallace High School’s historic Ulster Senior Cup breakthrough, John Rodgers, and his outhalf team-mate Quinn Armstrong, albeit influential centre George Pringle has moved to Australia. Despite losing Coghlan, Harrison Brewer is back in Terenure from Japan, as is Conall Boomer from the MSL. Despite earning a senior contract at Connacht, John Devine has joined, as has scrumhalf Griffin Culver from Manawatu, lock Sean Rigney, and 22-year-old Argentinian outhalf Julian Leszczynski. Terenure beat St Mary’s and Lansdowne to win the Leinster Senior Cup, thanks to a hat-trick by under-20 winger Dan Martin and an eye-catching debut by Ben Blaney (last season’s captain in the school’s run to the final) in Spencer’s first official game at the helm. They start with three away games as their refurbished clubhouse won’t be open for business until the second half of the season and there’s a new gym coming on board. They ought not to be dull. Limerick club rugby is struggling, witness Garryowen and Shannon propping up on the top two flights, yet Young Munster defy this trend and could well be dark horses again despite losing Rigney and Leszczynski. As usual, they’ve cast their net far and wide. The 28-year-old former PBC, UCC and Cork Con scrumhalf John Poland has returned from the New England Free Jacks, Connacht duo Harry West and Orin Burke have joined, and so too has a 20-year-old Kiwi lock AJ Henson, on the recommendation of Lifeimi Mafi. “I’m very happy with what we’ve brought in,” says head coach Ger Slattery. “Hopefully we can gel them into a team to give us a successful season.” UCD head coach Emmet McMahon is sufficiently buoyed by the talent coming through and some shrewd acquisitions to target a quicker start than last season, avoiding the playoffs on the last day by a point. Old Belvedere, runaway 1B champions, have recruited heavily and in acquiring Hugh Hogan as head coach, the Irish women’s loss is surely their gain. After their dramatic playoff final win over UCC, Nenagh Ormond will bring boundless enthusiasm and several returning sons to supplement a home-grown core. Former Cresent Comprehensive and Munsters’ outhalf Oscar Davey returns from the USA to offset Ben Pope’s return to New Zealand. The 41-year-old player-coach Derek Corcoran will occasionally don his boots, and they’ve enjoyed a Donnacha Ryan-arranged preseason in La Rochelle.

Outs: Ben Pope (returned home to NZ). Of the relegated duo, City of Armagh looked better equipped to bounce back than Garryowen on the basis of last season’s points tallies. Yet Garryowen were well beaten by Clogher Valley and Instonians in the Ulster Senior Cup. But City of Armagh have had a poor Ulster Senior Cup campaign, losing heavily to Instonians and Clogher Valley. By contrast, although relegation was compounded by departures, Garryowen’s Munster academy players have been swelled by the signing of Crescent and Irish schools fullback Fionn Rowsome. And after finishing last season strongly, Mike Sherry’s sky blues have had promising Munster Senior Cup wins away to Old Crescent and UCC. Having missed out in last season’s playoff semi-finals to Nenagh, Blackrock are strongly expected to mount another big promotion push under James Blaney. They’ve signed a couple of Leinster academy players in the powerful young Roscrea centre Jack Deegan and hooker Lee Fitzpatrick from Newbridge, as well as Connacht hooker Eoin de Buitléar. In Tomás O’Leary’s second season, UCC look less equipped after their late drive to last season’s promotion final having lost a few players to Con. Local rivals Highfield only just avoided a relegation playoff last season but good Munster Senior Cup wins over Cashel and Young Munster augur well. Morgan Lennon’s Old Wesley have been consistent contenders in recent seasons, although Reuben Pimm has moved to the Netherlands and they’ve lost Dan Campbell and Cronan Gleeson to UCD and Nenagh respectively. As was the case last season, Queens look like they’ll be heavily dependent on the availability of their sizeable Ulster academy contingent. As ever, Johne Murphy’s Naas will play some of the division’s best rugby, with Charlie Sheridan in midfield, although Leinster academy scrumhalf Tadhg Brophy has moved to Lansdowne. With James Cronin at the helm as player-coach, Highfield’s powerful maul and Ireland Sevens outside back Nicky Greene have shown up well in preseason and they could also be in the mix. Trinity, after Matty Lynch’s last-day dramatics against Cashel averted a second successive relegation, should be a year older and wiser after keeping their team largely intact, starting their campaign at home to Blackrock. Centre John O’Sullivan has joined from the ‘Rock’s Schools Cup-winning side, as has his team-mate Russian lock Artur Smykovskiy. Ambitious Instonians, with the Whitten brothers still in situ and Craig Gilroy a summer signing, will be seeking a fifth promotion in succession. Following a second successive relegation, nine-time champions Shannon have installed former captain Lee Nicholas as Director of Rugby to plot a return to the second tier, and the preseason form (featuring a 27-22 win away to Bruff) has been encouraging. Cashel will be itching to do likewise after their late mugging in the promotion final, although they look a little undercooked after a 32-12 loss in the Munster Cup at home to Highfield. The youthful, entertaining Corinthians set the early 2A pace last season but Connacht demands and midwinter triggered a fall-off and they missed out on the playoffs on points difference. Jim Harding has departed as head coach, and ex-Ireland under-20 centre John Devine has moved to Terenure. However, former Connacht and Terenure centre Colm de Buitléar has moved in the opposite direction, and under new coach Ambrose Conboy they’ve beaten Buccaneers (38-11), Galwegians (27-19) and Sligo (24-19) to win the club’s first Connacht Senior League crown since 1995. There’s a trio of Ulster sides in Banbridge, Ballymena and Dungannon (promoted via the playoffs). With Rob Lyttle in their ranks, Banbridge look the pick of the three. MU Barnhall beat Greystones, as they did in the playoff semi-finals last season, in the Leinster League final a fortnight ago to lay down a marker as both look like contenders again. Old Crescent will need to improve significantly as they were well off the pace last season, while newly promoted Wanderers, who had a poor Leinster League campaign, have enrolled Sean Skehan on a consultancy basis. On foot of the recent AIL survey, the main recommendation the IRFU has adopted is something they had wanted to do – regionalise Divisions 2B and 2C, in large part to save on travel expenses. This will not be popular with some clubs, who will understandably feel that the regionalisation of the lower two divisions will detract from the appeal of their campaigns and make them glorified junior clubs. This being the 11th season of the current format of five divisions of 10 teams apiece, it is also yet another redrawing of the AIL map. Depending on the make-up of the regions, it could also remove much of the jeopardy this season. After their relegations last season, Buccaneers (who have lost 33 of their last 36 AIL matches to suffer successive demotions) and Navan (who lost to Trinity and Greystones in the Leinster League) have had difficult starts to their campaign. So opportunity could knock again for Clogher Valley, who were denied a potential third successive promotion by their 23-22 semi-final playoff defeat to Dungannon but had good wins over Ballymena and City of Armagh in the Ulster Senior Cup before losing to Instonians. Nine of Galwegians’ 10 defeats last season were by a single score before they lost away to Navan in a playoff semi-final. With Stephen Mannion pulling the strings, Niyi Adeolokun has joined Brendan Guilfoyle’s ticket as attack coach. After encouraging Connacht League wins over Sligo and Buccs, they should be in the mix for promotion again and so avoid the IRFU’s expanded trapdoor. Ditto for Rainey Old Boys and UL Bohemians, while Malone’s early season form looks on a par with the former. After last season’s narrow escape, Sligo have hired former Connacht coach Grant Ross as their new Director of Rugby and have brought in four new forwards in Evan Ballantyne, Pat Lynch, Max O’Hehir, and Argentinian number eight Facundo Dellamea. Under New Zelander Ross their Connacht League form improved, beating Buccs and pushing Corinthians. Skerries, who survived via the playoffs, lost to MU Barnhall and Naas in the Leinster Senior league, but did have an encouraging win over Wanderers, whereas newly promoted Enniscorthy cancelled two of their Leinster League games and lost to Trinity in the other. After a seven-year absence and many near misses Bective Rangers are back in the senior ranks after a thrilling 39-34 win over Thomond in the playoff final augmented their first All-Ireland Junior Cup success. They’ve added to that momentum by beating Malahide, relegated to 2C from 2B, and Monkstown to claim the Leinster Shield and, as others have done upon emerging from the junior ranks, could even push for promotion. Thomond should also hold their own after their victory away to Omagh Academicals in the promotion/relegation playoff final ended their six-year absence from the AIL. They join fellow Limerick club Bruff, who gave Shannon a run for their money in the Munster Cup. Dolphin (who were a 1A club 11 years ago) were well beaten by Con in the Cup. They and Ballyclare lost in the playoffs last season, and the latter look likelier contenders than Belfast Harlequins, a 1A club 12 seasons ago, or Clonmel, beaten 60-0 by Young Munster in the Munster Cup.

Title: How a Billion Dollar Buy of Tesla Stock Set up a Trillion Dollar Vote
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/how-a-billion-dollar-buy-of-tesla-stock-set-up-a-trillion-dollar-vote/
Time Published: 2025-09-25T04:05:59Z
Full Content:
On September 15, 2025, Elon Musk filed a disclosure with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicating that he had acquired approximately 2.57 million shares of Tesla Inc. in open-market transactions on September 12, at a cost of nearly $1 billion. This represented his first meaningful open-market purchase of Tesla stock since 2020. Most of his holdings had come through exercising options granted under earlier compensation arrangements. According to the filing, the purchase prices averaged just under $390 per share. The market responded swiftly: Tesla’s stock surged to an intraday high of $425.70 before closing at $410.04. For a company with a market capitalization of roughly $1.4 trillion, such a reaction, amounting to more than a 5 percent move, was remarkable. Almost all major news outlets interpreted Musk’s purchase as a signal of renewed confidence in Tesla and, perhaps more importantly, of his willingness to devote more time and energy to the company amid his many competing ventures. That confidence proved contagious: Investors embraced the signal by imputing to the company nearly $70 billion of additional market value on the basis of the CEO’s $1 billion outlay. What the purchase does for Musk himself, however, runs deeper. First, there was a fortuitous coincidence: September 15, 2025, the date Musk’s purchase was disclosed, was also the record date for Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting scheduled for November 6. In practice, this means that all share acquisitions settling on or before September 15 are eligible to vote at the meeting. Purchases made on Friday, September 12, settled just in time under the new T+1 rule (excluding weekends) to be included on the record date. CEOs are generally predisposed to selling shares in their own companies, as they receive a ton through compensation, both to meet personal consumption needs and to diversify their portfolios. However, our prior research paper[1]discovered that when a contested voting event, such as a proxy contest, is on the horizon, CEOs slow their selling and may even accumulate additional shares to strengthen their voting and control power. In separate research, one of us documented record-date vote-buying by investors when controversial issues are on the meeting agenda.[2] This pattern maps exactly onto Musk’s behavior: He had been a consistent seller of Tesla stock in recent years, including liquidating tens of billions of dollars’ worth to finance ventures such as the acquisition of Twitter (now X), but in 2025 he made no sales, and, on the deadline for the record date, he executed a sizable purchase. So, what will be voted upon in the November shareholder meeting? At the center of the agenda is the proposed $1 trillion notional-amount compensation package for Elon Musk, a performance-based award of historic scale in corporate America. While the headline figure of $1 trillion has captured public attention, the actual realizable value will depend on whether an array of milestones are met, including market capitalization in multi-trillion-dollar increments, breakthroughs in full self-driving and robotics, and sustained profitability targets. What is clear, however, is that the vote will determine whether Musk receives the proposed package upon delivering the company’s most ambitious aspirations. At present, Musk beneficially owns 19.7 percent of shares outstanding (the percentage of votable shares could be a bit lower[3]) and other insiders such as his brother and board members hold an additional 0.2 percent.[4] For context, the largest outside shareholders are the usual “Big Three,” Vanguard (6.9 percent), BlackRock (5.7 percent), and State Street (3.5 percent). Put differently, Musk’s voting bloc by itself outweighs that of any single institution by a wide margin and is large enough to neutralize the combined opposition of two, or even three top outside investors. Tesla’s latest proposal may give some shareholders a sense of déjà vu. In 2018, they were asked to endorse what was then the most generous CEO pay deal in corporate history, an option grant nominally valued at $56 billion. That vote was advisory, a “say-on-pay” resolution that received about 73 percent support from unaffiliated shareholders (i.e., excluding Musk), allowing the board to justify implementing the plan. Yet in 2024, the Delaware Chancery Court voided the arrangement, faulting the board’s process and independence. Perhaps to avoid a repeat, the 2025 proposal has been structured differently on three key ways. First, the vote is binding (not “advisory”), i.e., approval by a majority of the shares present, and voting at the annual shareholder meeting is required for Musk to receive the award, ensuring that it has more legal force. Second, unlike in 2018 when Musk’s own shares were excluded, this time his stake will be included in the tally. This is perhaps because the current proposal has not been designated as a related-party transaction but instead as a board-approved employment agreement amendment, such that under the Nasdaq rule, Texas law, and Tesla’s bylaws all outstanding shares are entitled to vote. Musk needs about 40 percent of the outside votes to be cast in his favor. Given that 73 percent of more or less the same external shareholder base supported the 2018 package, achieving this threshold should not pose a significant challenge. Third, by disclosing the additional ownership, Musk was accidentally or effectively conducting an experiment that calibrates how the market would respond to a deeper personal commitment when concerns have been raised about the distractions faced by an unusually versatile CEO. Against that backdrop, a relatively small increase in his exposure, about 0.6 percent of shares outstanding, or $1 billion, triggered a nearly $70 billion rise in Tesla’s market capitalization. The leverage was striking: For every dollar Musk added, investors received seventy more. The implication is that if a marginal outlay can move the firm’s value so dramatically, then a fully focused CEO, dedicating his time and mind to Tesla’s most ambitious goals, could plausibly generate more in shareholder wealth over the next decade in $1 trillion units. Pope Leo has already expressed deep misgivings about the scale and symbolism of the package,[5] but much to his dismay, institutional investors may well vote it through.

Title: Ripple Powers New Offramp For BlackRock, VanEck Tokenized Fund

Time Published: 2025-09-25T04:00:37Z

Ripple has added another institutional rail to its stablecoin strategy: through an integration with Securitize, holders of BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized US Treasuries can now redeem fund shares for Ripple USD (RLUSD) around the clock—initially on Ethereum, with support for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in the pipeline. In a press release dated September 23, Ripple and Securitize said a new smart-contract flow “would allow holders of BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL to exchange their shares … for Ripple USD (RLUSD),” describing the mechanism as “an additional stablecoin off ramp for BUIDL and VBILL tokenized short term treasury funds.” The companies emphasized continuous availability—“24/7”—and framed the upgrade as programmable liquidity for compliant, on-chain investment products. Securitize also confirmed it is integrating with the XRP Ledger “to expand access and bring new utility to the XRPL ecosystem.” Jack McDonald, Ripple’s SVP of Stablecoins, positioned the move as a bridge between tokenized funds and transactional money: “RLUSD is for institutional use, offering regulatory clarity, stability, and real utility. As adoption grows, partnerships with trusted platforms like Securitize are key to unlocking new liquidity and enterprise-grade use cases.” On X, McDonald distilled the news for market participants: “RLUSD is now a key stablecoin offramp for BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized fund holders. The integration is starting with ETH, though Securitize is planning to integrate with the XRP Ledger.” Ripple President Monica Long linked the Securitize integration to a broader RLUSD tokenization push announced the prior week with DBS and Franklin Templeton, where RLUSD serves as a “liquid, stable and compliant exchange mechanism for tokenized assets in lending and trading use cases.” “This week, Securitize added RLUSD as a new offramp for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized funds,” she noted. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse underscored the 24/7 redemption promise and the XRPL roadmap: “Very excited to share that BlackRock’s BUIDL and @VanEck_US’s VBILL tokenized fund holders can redeem shares for RLUSD/ETH 24/7 365 through Securitize, and soon to come RLUSD/XRPL. Enterprise-grade instant onchain liquidity at your fingertips. That’s real utility.” The companies framed the design as explicitly regulatory-first. Ripple said RLUSD is issued under a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) trust charter, with “1:1 USD backing by high-quality liquid assets, strict reserve management and asset segregation, third-party attestations and clear redemption rights.” Ripple added that since launch in late 2024, RLUSD has integrated into DeFi and cross-border payment flows and surpassed $700 million in market capitalization. For tokenized funds, the off-ramp matters because it stitches together yield-bearing on-chain treasuries with settlement-grade stablecoin liquidity. BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL are tokenized short-term US Treasury strategies issued through Securitize on public blockchains; the new workflow lets qualified holders convert fund shares into RLUSD without banking hours friction, potentially improving collateral mobility for trading, lending, repo and treasury operations. The development also follows Ripple’s tie-up with DBS and Franklin Templeton, which is listing Franklin’s sgBENJI token on the DBS Digital Exchange alongside RLUSD to enable swapping between the tokenized fund and the stablecoin, and to explore using tokenized fund units as repo collateral—an example of how banks envisage tokenization rails meeting institutional liquidity needs. While the initial redemption path is live on Ethereum via Securitize, both firms signaled that XRPL integration is next, aligning with Ripple’s push to make RLUSD natively useful across multiple venues. If executed, XRPL support would extend the same institutional redemption mechanics to a different settlement environment—one that Ripple and parts of the treasury-tokenization market already touch via custody, payments, and prior Franklin Templeton XRPL issuance plans. Notably, BlackRock will be represented at Ripple Swell 2025 in New York on November 4–5 at Convene Hudson Yards. Maxwell Stein, BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, is slated to speak in a session titled “The Impact of Tokenized Financial Assets on Capital Markets,” alongside Rory Callagy of Moody’s.

Title: Candidates begin canvassing in Presidential Election

Independent presidential candidate Catherine Connolly has described America as an "imperial power" contributing to current volatility. "We have a very volatile situation in the world. We have imperial powers. America is one of those imperial powers. As a neutral country we have a duty [to] use our neutrality to call out the abuse of power, no matter where that is, whether by Russia or America," she said. Ms Connolly was asked about her comments at UCD last night drawing parallels between the current increase in military spending in Germany and its rearmament during the 1930s. She said that more and more there was a "profitable military industrial complex" that was heading in one direction rather than putting the money into peace. "After the Second World War, we said no more wars. And more and more, we have a more profitable military industrial complex that's heading in one direction. It's very hard to keep figures in my head. We're not putting that money into peace," she said. Last night, Ms Connolly contended that there are "parallels" between the rearmament policies of Nazi Germany in the 1930s and the recent decision by Chancellor Friedrich Merz to substantially increase military spending. She was outlining her concerns to UCD's Politics and International Relations Society, and remarked: "They're absolutely championing the cause of the military-industrial complex in Germany, as a booster for the economy ... Seems to me, there are some parallels with the ’30s." When the German Chancellor successfully campaigned in the Bundestag to boost defence spending earlier this year, he justified the move by citing the threat posed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president, saying: "We have for at least a decade felt a false sense of security." Around the same time, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said governments should be able to draw on €150bn in loans over the next five years, adding this would allow them to "massively step up their support to Ukraine". In her conversation with UCD students, Ms Connolly said she didn't want to "depress" them by referencing the "spend all over Europe on the military industrial complex", but added: "There is hope. And we have voices. And we can use them."

Ms Connolly, who is backed by the left-leaning parties in the Oireachtas, attended a meeting of the Dáil Public Accounts Committee this morning in her capacity as a TD for Galway West. Afterwards, and as a presidential candidate, she campaigned in the capital and is due to attend a rally in Harold's Cross this evening. Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys started her campaign today in Laois, with a lunchtime canvass in Portlaoise. Speaking in Portlaoise before travelling on to Limerick, Ms Humphreys said she's enjoying meeting people on the campaign trail and wants to be a president who focuses on the themes of "opportunity, unity and community". After canvassing in Limerick City, Ms Humphreys attended a Fine Gael rally in Patrickswell. Earlier, Ms Humphreys said housing supply is "the biggest challenge" facing the country and "very tough", but stopped short of agreeing with outgoing President Michael D Higgins that it has become a "disaster". Speaking this afternoon, Ms Humphreys said her focus is on securing 'number one' votes in the Presidential Election. Asked if she will be seeking Fianna Fáil 'number 2s', she said, "Regarding where people want to give their numbers twos, it’s a bit early at this stage. "My focus is going to be on looking for their support for me because if you don’t get enough votes, you don’t get elected," she said. Gavin had 'positive experience' in Defence Forces Fianna Fáil candidate Jim Gavin was in the capital this morning, with a canvass in Dalkey, Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire. Speaking in Dalkey, Mr Gavin said the Women of Honour, a group formed by current and former female members of the Defence Forces, have done a great service to the State by stepping forward and that lessons needed to be learned. When asked if he had witnessed any bullying or sexism in the Defense Forces, Jim Gavin said he did not. "I had a really positive experience in Defence Forces but I understand not everybody had that, and that's why I'm very proud of what they did, those women, they stepped forward. I'm fully behind them, and I'm really keen to see what comes out," he said. When asked if he would, as president, greet US President Donald Trump if he visited Ireland, Mr Gavin said: "Any elected head of state that comes, comes to the country that the president has to meet, I will meet them." Mr Gavin said he is looking forward to taking part in the upcoming presidential debates. "I'm really looking forward to it and enthused by it. I'll do my preparation as best I can and to represent my candidacy and what I'm going to offer and bring to the presidency of Ireland," he added. Yesterday, barrister Maria Steen failed to secure enough support to join the race, securing 18 Oireachtas nominations when 20 was required. After her campaign ended yesterday morning, Ms Steen told the media that "rarely has the political consensus seemed more oppressive or detached from the public's wishes". However, Taoiseach Micheál Martin rejected suggestions that the failure of Ms Steen to secure a nomination was "anti-democratic". Voting takes place on 24 October. With just three candidates, it is the smallest field in a Presidential Election since 1990. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Longevity At Work: Why The Retirement Crisis Is A Unique Opportunity

ByJulian Hayes II, Contributor. For decades, 65 has been treated as the finish line of work. But that age marker signaling retirement was never designed for today's world. It originated in 19th-century Europe, when reaching the age of 70 was still a statistical rarity. Today, with people regularly living into their 70s, 80s, and 90s and thriving, the framework is becoming obsolete. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink underscored this in his 2024 annual letter to investors. He noted that if people are living longer and healthier lives, then the model of retirement must evolve in tandem with them. The old assumptions no longer fit. By mid-century, one in six people globally will be over the age of 65, according to Fink's letter. In the U.S., there's a high probability that the Social Security Administration program will be unable to pay full benefits by 2034. These demographic and financial pressures are often described as the core of a looming retirement crisis. But there's another issue that isn't readily discussed. Too many organizations still assume careers wind down at 65 and treat older employees as liabilities. In reality, longevity is extending careers by decades. Some countries are already adapting. The Netherlands, for instance, links its retirement age directly to life expectancy, acknowledging the current demographic reality and resetting expectations for both citizens and employers. The conversation typically comes to a halt at the point of system strain. However, another story is hiding in plain sight: older employees are staying in the workforce at record levels. A 2025 Newsweek survey found that 51% of adults nearing retirement age now expect to work indefinitely. That same report showed the share of Americans 65 and older in the workforce grew by 33% from 2015 to 2024, compared to less than 9% growth in the labor force overall. Among small businesses, the share of employees aged 65 and above has increased by 50% since 2019, according to Gusto's 2025 labor report. The drivers are financial—rising healthcare costs, disappearing pensions, shifting Social Security rules—but also deeply human. Many older workers mention purpose, mental stimulation, and social connection as reasons for staying employed. For organizations, this is a potential opportunity and can serve as a dividend for retention: experience, judgment, and cultural stability that compound over time. Workers who’ve weathered multiple business cycles bring perspectives and mentorship that younger teams can't replicate. With flexible arrangements, phased retirement, or hybrid roles, CEOs can leverage decades of knowledge and loyalty that might otherwise be lost. For much of the 20th century, the deal was straightforward: work 40 years, retire at 65, and rely on a pension. That contract has dissolved as careers now stretch six or seven decades, pensions are rare, and Social Security is under strain. Retirement is shifting from a hard stop to a glide path. Instead of abrupt exits, older employees are transitioning into flexible roles, project-based work, and different career arcs. For many, it is less about a paycheck than about relevance, stimulation, and purpose. Forward-thinking companies will design new principles and compacts that include: Longevity has already created a new class of late-career professionals. Companies that design and optimize for them will hold a distinct competitive advantage. Longevity is no longer a future variable; it is a present reality. The real question for leaders is whether they will treat it as a cost to contain or as capital to deploy. That requires a shift in both mindset and structure. CEOs and organizational leaders must: The retirement age of 65 may have been fitting for a different century, but today it is a relic of the past. What was once described as an impending retirement crisis can, in the hands of forward-thinking leaders, become a source of resilience and a unique competitive advantage.

ByKirk Ogunrinde, Former Contributor. GSR Markets, a crypto trading firm, has filed to launch a new ETF that bundles a number of crypto treasury companies’ shares into one single fund, allowing investors to easily gain exposure to firms buying up crypto tokens. GSR's Digital Asset Treasury Companies ETF would bundle companies that buy and hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets—known as digital asset treasury firms—into one single fund that investors can buy. The ETF would also allow private investments in public equity (PIPE) deals—deals that allow investors to purchase equity directly from a publicly traded company—according to the filing. While other ETFs offer crypto exposure, GSR's fund is the first to offer exposure to the select group of crypto treasury companies. The ETF is expected to launch pending regulatory approval by the Securities and Exchanges Commission, but a date has not been given. GSR trades crypto tokens and provides venture funding for over 300 companies, according to its website. What Is A Digital Asset Treasury Company? Digital Asset Treasury Companies are firms raising capital through various measures to fund and hold significant portions of cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy , a software enterprise company turned crypto treasury, was the first to adopt this tactic in 2020 with bitcoin and crypto companies like Upexi Inc, Sharplink Gaming, and Bitmine Immersion Technologies have followed. Crypto ETFs, similar to stock ETFs, allow investors to invest in cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. These funds are overseen by professional fund managers and are under regulatory guidance. Investments can be managed through traditional brokerage accounts, without investors having to manage digital wallets or secure storages. Firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale manage crypto ETFs across tokens like bitcoin, Ether, and Solana. Tangent The crypto treasury trend gathered steam this year, as companies rushed to take advantage of a crypto spike amid bitcoin's all-time high in August. According to crypto tracker bitcointreasuries.net, the 194 bitcoin treasury companies hold more than $117 billion worth of the token.
