Title: Is NVIDIA (NVDA) The Best Performing Large-Cap Stock in the Last 3 Years?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-nvda-best-performing-large-130212301.html
Time Published: 2024-10-28T13:02:12Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. The past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries‚Äô balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging. The tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end. However, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year. The aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent. Coming back to tech ‚Äì the industry wouldn‚Äôt stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown. The US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a Financial Times‚Äô survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed‚Äôs rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession. For instance, Piper Sandler‚Äôs Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the ‚Äújumbo‚Äù rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn‚Äôt avert the problem. However, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists‚Äô estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn‚Äôt without historical precedent. Further, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week‚Äôs worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024. Moving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is ‚Äòtactically bullish‚Äô on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets ‚Äúpricing in a soft landing‚Äù. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end. With regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said: ‚ÄúI think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we‚Äôre kind of underweight on software.‚Äù Rowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don‚Äôt change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up. For our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. 3Y CAGR: 82.08% NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), for all intents and purposes, is considered the driving force behind the AI boom, especially on the hardware side. Nvidia‚Äôs core business revolves around designing Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). The company‚Äôs biggest market is the gaming industry since GPUs are almost essential for high-performance rendering due to their parallel processing capabilities. As it turns out, GPUs are also incredibly useful for training AI models for the same reason, since AI models require a lot of matrix calculations simultaneously. It goes without saying that Nvidia isn‚Äôt the sole GPU designer but what put it at an advantage over its competitors is its proprietary parallel computing platform ‚Äì CUDA. Having a GPU market share of 70.5% as of 2016, Nvidia recognized the need for a programmable architecture very early since programming parallel processing is recognized as notoriously difficult. The CUDA platform is now supported by a library of thousands of specific applications, which makes it hard to compete with Nvidia in the space of parallel programming platforms. This, coupled with the explosive demand for GPUs for training AI models, resulted in NVDA becoming the most valuable company in the world in June 2024 before Apple regained the top spot for itself. NVDA grew at an annualized rate of 82% over the past three years, and has gained nearly 212% over the past year and 184% year-to-date. Nvidia‚Äôs highly anticipated GPU ‚Äì Blackwell ‚Äì is expected to offer substantial inference performance gains over its previous GPUs, and is already experiencing a high level of demand from hyperscalers. The GPU will be rolled out in Q4, 2024, but has already been booked out for 12 months. This is what Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein senior analyst, had to say about NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in one of the latest CNBC programs: ‚ÄúPeople are getting excited about the story again as we approach earnings, year-end, and next year when the new platform with Blackwell starts to ramp up. By all indications‚Äîbased on supply chain checks and everything else‚Äîdemand for this product looks off the charts.‚Äù The analyst believes the stock is trading at a discount: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much cheaper today than it was before the run started a year and a half ago. The stock has risen significantly, but earnings have increased even more than the stock.‚Äù Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock Now Holding 403,725 Bitcoin (BTC) Worth $26,980,000,000 After Accumulation Spree

BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, is now holding tens of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC), the firm‚Äôs data shows. According to the asset management‚Äôs disclosures, BlackRock holds 403,725 BTC worth $26.98 billion in its iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF). Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says that in the last two weeks alone, BlackRock has gobbled up 34,085 BTC worth $2.3 billion. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) went live on January 5th of this year and has since delivered 44.80% returns as of September 30th. In a recent report, BlackRock, a firm with over $10 trillion in assets under management, said that Bitcoin could act as a hedge against the United States‚Äô mounting debt and other macroeconomic concerns. ‚ÄúWhile Bitcoin has shown instances of short-term co-movements with equities and other ‚Äòrisk assets,‚Äô over the longer term its fundamental drivers are starkly different, and in many cases inverted versus most traditional investment assets. As the global investment community grapples with rising geopolitical tensions, concerns over the state of US debt and deficits and increased political instability around the world, Bitcoin may be seen as an increasingly unique diversifier against some of these fiscal, monetary and geopolitical risk factors investors may face elsewhere in their portfolio.‚Äù At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,735.

Title: BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings near Satoshi‚Äôs ‚Äì Is a BTC battle brewing?

BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin accumulation signals a bullish trend for Bitcoin. Amid growing speculation that Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs may soon surpass the holdings of Satoshi Nakamoto, BlackRock has hit a significant milestone in its BTC accumulation. According to a recent update from Lookonchain, the asset management giant now holds over 400,000 Bitcoin. At press time, it was valued at approximately $26.98 billion. Source: Lookonchain/X Over the past two weeks alone, BlackRock has added 34,085 BTC to its portfolio, worth roughly $2.3 billion. This latest acquisition highlighted BlackRock‚Äôs dominance in the cryptocurrency space as it continues to expand its Bitcoin holdings. On the flip side, BlackRock‚Äôs BTC ETF (IBIT) has seen remarkable growth, surpassing the $23 billion mark, according to Farside Investors. Notably, IBIT has been on a consistent inflow streak since the 14th of October. Between the 14th and 25th October, IBIT recorded inflows nearing $400 million on some days, reflecting strong investor interest and confidence in BlackRock‚Äôs BTC strategy. This underscored BlackRock‚Äôs strategic approach to Bitcoin amid its growing adoption. Seeing this the crypto community has responded with optimism. Source: X As of the latest update, Bitcoin was trading at $67,773.35, marking a rise of over 1% within the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. Additioanlly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was also lying above the neutral threshold, signaling that bullish momentum was overtaking bearish forces. Source: Trading View For Bitcoin‚Äôs roadmap ahead, an analysis by IntoTheBlock, cited by AMBCrypto, revealed that approximately 92.88% of BTC holders were ‚Äúin the money,‚Äù meaning their holdings were valued higher than their initial purchase price. Meanwhile, only 2.45% of holders were ‚Äúout of the money,‚Äù reflecting a robust market sentiment and suggesting potential for further price gains. Source: IntoTheBlock Speculation about future ‚ÄúBitcoin wars‚Äù is already circulating, with some predicting that giants like BlackRock could eventually seek to fork the original Bitcoin chain and promote their own version as the legitimate one. While such a scenario may currently seem like a conspiracy theory, the rapid accumulation of BTC by BlackRock has raised concerns about its growing influence over the market. Read Bitcoin‚Äôs [BTC] Price Prediction 2024‚Äì2025 However, they are not alone‚Äîother major players such as MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, as well as Tesla, Binance, and SpaceX, have also been steadily amassing Bitcoin. Therefore, whether MicroStrategy and other institutions will be able to challenge BlackRock‚Äôs dominance remains an open question.

Title: Bitcoin Headed to All-Time High ‚Äì MicroStrategy Stock Hits $234 and $BTC ETFs Could Hit 1M

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Michael Saylor‚Äôs MicroStrategy is once again in the news, this time with an ATH stock price of $234. Bitcoin ETFs are also nearing 1M $BTC as the last two weeks alone registered $3B inflows. This dual stunner news could be just what Bitcoin needs to shoot through its previous ATH of $73K. The coin recently passed $68K, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be slowing down. MicroStrategy is the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. As of September 2024, the company owns 252,220 $BTC ($17B), and it keeps buying. According to Scott Melker (crypto investor and author), MicroStrategy ‚Äòhas also outperformed all companies in the S&P 500 over the past five years.‚Äô Its stock ($MSTR) is currently $234, an 85.15% increase in the last year and a 271% year-to-date increase. In a recent shareholders proposal, MicroStrategy underlines that $MSTR has outperformed Microsoft stock by 313% this year. They attribute this achievement primarily to the large Bitcoin holding, similar to BlackRock, Microsoft‚Äôs second-largest shareholder. $MSTR‚Äôs next target is $245, according to Mark Palmer and other stock analysts. It‚Äôs far from an impossible task for a company with a 17.8% yield since adopting Bitcoin. US ETF issuers currently hold 976,892 $BTC (over $66.2B), almost 5% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total market cap. If it happens this week, we need to see $301M daily net inflows. This should be easy, as Bitcoin ETFs received $3B inflows in the past two weeks alone. Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, posted a chart of spot Bitcoin ETFs since inception. And the increase in holdings speaks for itself. From a zero-dollar industry in January 2024, $BTC ETFs pushed past 600K $BTC in February, nearing 1M $BTC today. Remember, it hasn‚Äôt even been a year since $BTC ETFs appeared. And we‚Äôre already talking about nearly $67B in total holdings. If we also consider the excellent timing (Russia lifting the Bitcoin mining ban, the Fed potentially cutting interest rates again, and the upcoming US elections), a Bitcoin bull rush might be coming. We know the Bitcoin halving typically leads to a price surge after several months. But we‚Äôve rarely had such great tailwinds accompanying a halving before. Hendrik Andersson (Apollo Capital‚Äôs chief investment officer) said a Donald Trump victory would be the ‚Äòbiggest deciding factor‚Äô of a crypto market rally.

Title: How a Trump or Harris presidency could impact your investments

With the presidential election just over a week away, and the candidates in a dead heat in the polls, Americans are in suspense about how their lives will change under a new leader. Business Insider has prepared a five-part refresher amid the final stretch to unpack the impacts that either a Donald Trump or a Kamala Harris presidency could have on US consumers. This first installment is focused on the investment landscape. Trump and Harris have each outlined policy proposals that would affect different parts of the stock market. The platform of whoever wins will also be crucial in determining the path of interest rates, which shape the bond market. But they're not expected to have diametrically opposed impacts on everything, with both candidates seen as positive forces for crypto. Detailed below is the latest research and commentary from top Wall Street strategists outlining how the market and investing landscape could shift under a Trump or a Harris administration. The guide covers four asset classes and is divided between the impact Trump or Harris could have on each. For equities, it's helpful to look at how both the micro (specific sectors set to be affected) and the macro (how the broader market will respond) could be influenced. Much of the industry guidance for the stock market under Trump boils down to his proposed tax policies. Bank of America estimates his plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from 21% would boost corporate earnings by 4%. How much it would influence each sector would ultimately depend on sensitivity to changes in the tax rate. To that end, BofA says the consumer-discretionary and communication-services sectors ‚Äî the areas most sensitive to tax-rate changes ‚Äî would benefit the most. On the flip side, less exposed areas, such as utilities, real estate, and energy, would get the smallest boost. For energy, specifically, Trump's pro-drilling stance ‚Äî while supportive of industry activity ‚Äî would likely lead to oversupply and lower oil prices, BNY Wealth says. That, in turn, would hurt corporate profitability in the sector and drag on stock prices. It's also worth noting that energy was the worst-performing sector during Trump's administration. Another area of the stock market seen as benefiting from a Trump win is financials. Allies of the former president have said he aims to unburden banks from many of the regulations that were imposed following the 2008 financial crisis, something that his first administration tried to do, with limited success. Those looser regulations could also ignite a fresh wave of mergers and acquisitions, which would increase advisory revenue for big banks and help drive up profits from dealmaking. Views on the full equity-market landscape are divided, particularly along partisan lines. Trump's proposed tax and regulatory policies are seen by his supporters as pro-business moves that would be good news for corporate profit growth and deal activity. But Trump critics say his proposal for universal tariffs and steeper levies on Chinese imports ‚Äî as well as a crackdown on immigration ‚Äî would be inflationary, which could hold back stock prices. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation says the tariff plan, in particular, could hurt profit margins and put pressure on consumer spending. Bank of America estimates that 60% tariffs on China and 10% on other countries would lower S&P 500 earnings per share by 3.1%. That would be a problem since earnings growth has long been the stock market's primary driver of gains. "The conventional wisdom is wrong: Trump is not going to substantially cut taxes once in office; he is going to raise taxes by jacking up tariffs. To the extent that this dampens economic activity, it is bad news for stocks," BCA Research's chief strategist, Peter Berezin, said. Just like with Trump, much of the guidance around the stock market under Harris involves her tax plan. Her proposal to hike the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% would have an inverse effect on sectors. That means consumer discretionary and communication services ‚Äî the top beneficiaries under Trump ‚Äî would be hit the hardest under a Harris administration, BofA says. "Consumer discretionary stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 modestly since Harris' presidential candidacy was announced, perhaps reflecting concerns that a Democratic President could result in higher corporate taxes and employee wages," BNY Wealth said. Financial firms could also feel a negative impact from both higher taxes and Harris' proposed regulatory tightening. But there are bright spots. A Harris victory would likely benefit homebuilder stocks because of her proposal to build 3 million houses. Renewable-energy stocks would also likely see gains because of Democrats' favorable views of wind and solar energy. Both sectors have outperformed in recent months during periods when Harris saw positive momentum in election polls. The stock market has soared to records during Joe Biden's presidency, up more than 50% since his inauguration, and a Harris win would likely continue many of the policies that have supported the market. Those include infrastructure investments and tax incentives to bring manufacturing jobs back to the country, such as in the semiconductor industry via the CHIPS and Science Act. But BofA says Harris' proposed tax hike would also put downward pressure on corporate profits, with an estimated 5% earnings hit. Beyond that, a quadrupling of the stock-buyback tax to 4% could also take 1% off S&P 500 profits, the firm said. With all these crosscurrents swirling, a neutral market outcome must also be assessed. Capital Economics says it believes neither a Trump nor Harris win will mean all that much for stock prices because bigger trends ‚Äî specifically, artificial intelligence ‚Äî will shape the market's direction. "Our upbeat projections for the stock market in 2024 and 2025 are predicated on a view that hype over AI will continue to fuel a stock market bubble," the research firm said. Capital Economics has a 2025 year-end target of 7,000 for the S&P 500, regardless of which candidate wins the election. Meanwhile, Bank of America says that as long as corporate profits continue to grow, the stock market will rise regardless of who wins the White House. The performance of the US bond market largely hinges on the direction of interest rates. As interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and vice versa. And since presidential actions usually influence rates, the bond market will likely be shaped by what either Trump or Harris ends up doing. A Trump win is seen as a scenario that would usher in higher interest rates, which would push bond prices lower. It ultimately boils down to inflation. Economists see Trump's double-whammy proposals of mass deportation and universal tariffs as inflationary. And since the Federal Reserve's primary tool for fighting inflation is raising interest rates, bond prices would suffer if yields rose. "Our assessment is that a Trump win would lead to higher US yields," Capital Economics said. Forecasts from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ‚Äî a nonprofit think tank ‚Äî say a wider deficit and an increasing pile of debt under a Trump presidency, compared with a Harris presidency, would also put upward pressure on interest rates. That would also hurt the performance of bonds. Capital Economics says it expects interest rates to fall under a Harris win, which would be good news for bonds, as she likely wouldn't pursue certain inflationary policies like tariffs or immigrant deportations, which could fuel wage inflation. Harris' policies, considered to be less inflationary than Trump's, would also likely allow the Federal Reserve to continue cutting interest rates, which would boost bond prices. In a Bloomberg survey of institutional investors last month, 30% of respondents said they would add to their bond exposure if Harris won, while just 17% said they would buy more bonds if Trump won. Additionally, 46% of respondents said they would reduce their bond exposure if Trump won, compared with just 23% under a Harris win. A Trump win is seen as bullish for bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency industry, as Trump has firmly embraced digital assets in recent years. The Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani said bitcoin could hit $90,000 by December if Trump won the election, about 37% above its current level. "Elections remain hard to call, but if you are long crypto here, you are likely taking a Trump trade," Chhugani said. Harris has also embraced the crypto industry in recent months, though she's seen as slightly less bullish than Trump, given his public displays of support, including addressing crypto conferences and launching his own nonfungible tokens. Yet Wall Street seems to think that a big case for bitcoin will remain intact no matter who wins. The US government debt pile is expected to grow regardless of who controls the White House. That scenario is among bitcoin's biggest bull theses. "I'm not sure if either President or other candidate would make a difference. I do believe the utilization of digital assets is going to become more and more of a reality worldwide," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said during his company's third-quarter earnings call. Trump's tax plan and protectionist trade policies are expected to strengthen the dollar. This is the opposite of what the presidential hopeful has said he wants since a weaker currency makes a nation's exports more competitive in global trade. These policies are expected to be inflationary, which would push interest rates higher and could prompt the Fed to tighten. Those climbing rates would then underpin dollar gains. If Trump retakes the White House, "the dollar would probably rally sharply, at least in the near term, on expectations of higher US tariffs and interest rates," Capital Economics said in a recent research note. A Harris presidency would continue the trends of a weaker dollar because of the "policy continuity" with the Biden administration, Capital Economics said. Since Harris' overall platform is less expansionary, it's expected to drive less inflationary pressure and therefore keep the coast clear for the Fed to cut rates and stimulate the economy as planned. That likelihood of lower interest would, in turn, push the dollar lower. Jump to

In 1946, Randy Gardner participated in a Stanford University study to assess how long humans could go without sleep and whether there were any ill effects. After 11 days and 25 minutes, he finally fell asleep. Waking after a 14-hour nap, he claimed that staying awake for so long had no adverse effects. The researchers, however, thought otherwise, noting that he had suffered from short-term memory loss, paranoia and hallucinations. While it seems clear that depriving yourself of sleep for such an extended period could not be good for you, the question is, are we all depriving ourselves of much-needed sleep on a daily basis? While sleep needs vary, short sleep duration is defined as less than seven hours per night. On average, 35 per cent of adults sleep less than seven hours per night. Beyond feeling less than well-rested, the question is whether it has any other negative consequences. As a cardiologist interested in helping people prevent heart disease and live longer, my view on this is clear. Yes. While Randy Gardner was not trying for a Guinness world record for staying awake, attempts were banned in 1977 because of the inherent dangers. According to Netflix, sleep is its biggest competitor By comparison, though, there are still ongoing record attempts at holding live rattlesnakes in your mouth - it‚Äôs 13, in case you were wondering - and how many bees you can cover yourself in, a frightening 637,000. In the eyes of the Guinness World Records committee, these feats hold an ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù risk of being reattempted compared to depriving yourself of sleep for long periods. That should tell you all you need to know. But what about the impacts of shortened sleep on health? Even four nights of shortened sleep can move people closer to becoming insulin resistant, the precursor state to diabetes. Shortened sleep is also linked to higher rates of high blood pressure, plaque build-up in the heart arteries, heart attacks and strokes. Your efforts at dieting can also be seriously thrown off by shortened sleep. People who have shortened sleep routinely eat 270 calories per day more on average. Even those who do manage to reduce their calorie intake are less likely to lose weight, and more of that weight is likely to be muscle and not fat. One of the biggest challenges of shortened sleep is its impact on mood and cognitive wellbeing. Recent evidence suggests that high levels of physical activity are linked to lower rates of dementia, except in those who are routinely sleep-deprived. So, for all of you exercising for the cognitive benefits, you might not be getting the gains you should be getting. The biggest challenge with getting more sleep is that the world incentivises you not to. According to Netflix, sleep is its biggest competitor. With endless competition for our attention, we all know the feeling of staying up that bit later because we want to watch just one more video or extra episode. What‚Äôs ‚Äújust one more episode?‚Äù Well, studies of those who had the highest amounts of night-time light exposure show a 20 to 30 per cent increased odds of dying prematurely compared to those with much less night-time light exposure. Most people don‚Äôt even realise that they are currently part of the world‚Äôs biggest experiment on sleep, and here, I‚Äôm not talking about smartphones. Twice a year, the clocks change by one hour, either giving us one additional hour of sleep or taking one away. When we lose one hour of sleep, the rates of heart attacks increase by 24 per cent. When we gain it back, they come back down, but only by 21 per cent. There is even some evidence to suggest that rates of suicide increase and that judges give harsher sentences when daylight savings changes result in an hour less sleep. So even if your phone doesn‚Äôt steal your sleep, daylight savings time just might. Some people need very little sleep because they carry certain genes that limit their need for sleep, but these gene defects are rare. Others will claim that some of the greatest figures in history got by on very little sleep: Winston Churchill, Bill Clinton and Margaret Thatcher, to name a few. My response to this claim is simple: Bill Clinton had a triple bypass at age 58, Margaret Thatcher developed dementia in her early 70s, and Winston Churchill had his first of eight strokes in his mid-70s. I‚Äôm not saying sleep was the only factor here, but you will need to get some better examples if you are going to try to convince me. To get more sleep, you simply need to stick to the fundamentals. You probably don‚Äôt need supplements, and I strongly advise against sleeping tablets. Most people need to go to bed and get up at exactly the same time every single day ‚Äì yes, that includes weekends. This will train your circadian rhythm to work with you and not against you. Changing time zones interrupts your circadian rhythm, but so does staying up two hours later, which is why we call it social jet lag. Charging your phone in another room, investing in blackout blinds, and keeping your room cool will all help you get a good night‚Äôs sleep. These simple changes have the biggest impact on sleep. Do I think that a few nights of shortened sleep will damage your health? No. Do I think a few decades will? Yes. You don‚Äôt need to set any world records; you just need about seven to nine hours most nights.

Saudi Arabia will host the biggest names in finance and technology this coming week in a test of investor appetite for the kingdom's ambitions of transforming itself into a global hub at a time of widening regional conflict. International executives will have to contend with a region rocked by geopolitical tensions, with the threat of further military confrontation between Israel and Iran at the highest levels in decades. And they will land in a country that is increasingly facing up to the fact that even its vast oil wealth has limits. But those arriving at the Future Investment Initiative - often dubbed Davos in the desert - seem undeterred, sensing an opportunity to plug into Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's trillion-dollar Vision 2030 economic remake. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s David Solomon, Citigroup Inc.'s Jane Fraser and BlackRock Inc.'s Larry Fink have become regulars at the Riyadh summit and are set to return this year. Reflecting Saudi Arabia's focus on technology and artificial intelligence, they'll be joined by prominent names in those industries. Alphabet Inc. President Ruth Porat and TikTok Inc. Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew are set to speak at the summit for the first time. Benjamin Horowitz, tech entrepreneur and co-founder of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, is also making an appearance. Wall Street and Silicon Valley have increasingly turned to the oil-rich Middle East as liquidity gets tighter in other parts of the world, especially China. Saudi Arabia itself commands nearly $1 trillion in sovereign wealth, though the Crown Prince wants titans of industry to stop deploying that money overseas and instead help support his domestic ambitions. Yet the backdrop is one of increasing uncertainty. Saudi foreign policy has recently focused on lowering regional tensions in the hope that a more stable region will bring in foreign capital and technological know-how. But events of the past year have served as a reminder of how unstable the region can be. "The impact of regional instability on the prospects for foreign investment is completely negative, with the possible exception of the defense industry," said Gregory Gause, Professor of International Affairs at Texas A&M University. Capital is "not attracted to conflict regions, even if the country is not an immediate participant in the conflict." To be sure, Saudi Arabia is still pushing ahead with its big development plans. Deals worth more than $28 billion are likely to be announced over the next week by executives from around the world, according to Richard Attias, CEO of the FII Institute. Some of these will focus on AI, including potentially a new fund with Andreessen Horowitz that could grow to as large as $40 billion. The kingdom is also expected to announce a new company that will invest at least $10 billion in making Saudi Arabia a top global producer of hydrogen - a low carbon fuel that could be key to the world's transition away from burning fossil fuels. Ahead of the event, General Atlantic said it's opening its first office in the Middle East - in Saudi Arabia - to scout for more deals in the region. Two exchange-traded funds will make their trading debuts in Riyadh, giving Saudi investors access to Hong Kong stocks - a reflection of the kingdom's growing ties with China as it looks to boost investment flows with its biggest trading partner. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan, and the Commissioner for the Belt and Road, Nicholas Ho, will speak at FII as some of the highest profile speakers from Asia. Still, the regional conflict is undoubtedly weighing on global investor sentiment in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, the biggest Gulf economy, is feeling some of that. The number of actively-managed emerging market funds with Saudi exposure had been rising sharply until earlier this year, but stalled at around 56% as tensions between Israel and Iran escalated, according to Copley Fund Research. The data show that the number of funds invested in the Saudi stock market fell slightly between March and September this year and that the country is the third-biggest underweight after Taiwan and India. Coupled with that, Crown Prince Mohammed has had to come to terms with the limits of even Saudi Arabia's vast financial resources to pay for his ambitions. The government, which is forecasting deficits out to at least 2027, has said some projects will be need to be delayed. At the same time, the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom's powerful sovereign fund that the de-facto ruler chairs, is becoming a tougher place for foreign firms to get money out of. An increased focus on domestic projects like the $1.5 trillion Neom has global asset managers fretting that the PIF will have less cash to spend abroad. "The FII has always been designed as a mechanism for investment into Saudi, however in reality it has been an opportunity for foreign execs to extract financing from the Kingdom," said Zaid Belbagi, managing partner of political risk consultancy Hardcastle Advisory. "Sold-out hotels at $500-1000 per night are indicative of sustained international interest." The organizers of the Riyadh jamboree remain confident, and about 7,000 people have registered to attend this year's event. That's higher than the numbers for last year's summit, which took place days after the current conflict in the region started. When asked what attendees were speaking about ahead of the event, FII Institute's Attias said the US election was front of mind. There are many executives that feel developments in the Middle East hinge on the outcome of the vote, he said on a Bloomberg television interview on Monday. Even so, investors are coming "despite what is happening in the world," Attias said. "The show must go on."

Title: Asset managers roll out new ETFs to tap in to AI buzz

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Exchange-traded funds focused on artificial intelligence are proliferating as asset managers offer investors new ways to tap in to the market enthusiasm for AI, even while it remains unclear which companies will emerge as the long-term winners from the latest technology revolution. More than one-third of the two dozen ETFs that include artificial intelligence or AI in their name have been launched in 2024 alone, according to data from Morningstar. In the past week, three more joined their ranks, including a cloud computing ETF rebranded and revamped to specifically target AI. The AI ETF group now has assets of $4.5 billion, drawing it closer to the $5.5 billion nuclear power-themed ETF universe, and pushing it well above the cannabis sector, with $1.37 billion in assets. "I'm not surprised their ranks are multiplying," said Daniel Sotiroff, senior analyst at Morningstar. "This is a fast-growing, fast-moving industry, and it is easy to hope that you could end up making a lot of money in a short period of time." The 200%-plus stock gain by chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) - AI's poster child - over the last 12 months likely just reaffirms that confidence, Sotiroff said. Beyond Nvidia, AI is likely to produce a larger and broader swath of beneficiaries in the future, said Tony Kim, head of the fundamental equities technology group at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). Kim is the manager of the two new AI-themed ETFs launched by BlackRock on Tuesday, the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF and the iShares Technology Opportunities Active ETF. The first of the firm's AI products, the $630 million iShares Future AI & Tech ETF, launched in 2018, currently trades just below a 52-week high recorded on Oct. 14. While its initial AI product is linked to an index, the two new funds are actively managed and designed to capture emerging opportunities within AI, according to Jay Jacobs, head of active and thematic ETFs at BlackRock. "The AI market is going to change dramatically," said Kim. "What you think it is today, isn‚Äôt going to be what it becomes tomorrow or next year or in a few years." ARMS RACE BofA Securities market analysts Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian said in a recent report they believe there is "an AI arms race" under way among giant technology companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). They calculate that capital spending this year from four megacaps making big AI bets will total $206 billion, up 40% over 2023. Meanwhile, capital spending by the other 496 companies in the S&P 500 will dip slightly, they project. Venture capital firms also are directing as much as $79.2 billion in funding to AI startups by the end of the year, 27% above 2023 levels, according to an estimate from venture firm Accel. That means that 40 cents of every dollar invested by VC firms will go to an AI company. Of course, investing in an AI-themed ETF does not guarantee market outperformance. The largest of the AI funds, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF, is up about 20% so far this year, against a 22% rise for the benchmark S&P 500. Amplify ETFs earlier this month rebranded an existing cloud-computing ETF to reflect a new focus on the emerging technology, naming it the Amplify Bloomberg AI Value Chain ETF. "Now, we're trying to get exposure to the cloud with a specific AI tilt," said Nathan Miller, vice president of product development at Amplify. The long-term goal, he added, is to be ready to profit if and when all that capital spending on AI starts to show up in earnings, and be ahead of the curve in identifying new opportunities. "Like every ETF firm out there, we are trying to offer investors something differentiated," Miller said.

Time Published: 2024-10-28T04:30:56Z
Full Content:
MicroStrategy MSTR executive chairman Michael Saylor humorously reached out to Microsoft MSFT CEO Satya Nadella, suggesting he can help with the company‚Äôs Bitcoin BTC/USD strategy. What Happened: In a post on X on Friday, Saylor advised Nadella that if he's interested in creating the next trillion-dollar opportunity, he should reach out. This comes as Microsoft, per an SEC filing, prepares to discuss a possible Bitcoin investment at its December shareholder meeting. MicroStrategy, despite being much smaller, has outperformed Microsoft by 313% largely due to its Bitcoin holdings. The company‚Äôs total bitcoin holdings as of Oct. 20 stand at 252,220, worth $9.91 billion. Microsoft's second-largest shareholder, BlackRock BLK, has already shown confidence in Bitcoin, offering its clients a Bitcoin ETF. Also Read: If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here‚Äôs how much you‚Äôd have today. Why It Matters: Saylor's message highlights MicroStrategy's strong performance amid its heavy Bitcoin investments, with the company's stock up 444% over the past year, including a 244% YTD increase. Investor confidence in MicroStrategy recently grew as BlackRock raised its stake in the company to 5.2%, making MicroStrategy a key entry point for institutional Bitcoin exposure. What‚Äôs Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga‚Äôs upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.

The stock climbed to as high as 2,624.40 rupees in early trading Monday, from its issue price of 1,503 rupees. Mumbai-based Waaree had seen strong interest for its deal, with the issue getting subscribed by more 70 times. The debut comes on the back of a world-beating rally in India‚Äôs renewable-energy stocks this year. The firm‚Äôs gain stands in contrast to Hyundai Motor India‚Äôs IPO that culminated in a first-day decline last week. The $3.3 billion IPO, the nation‚Äôs largest ever, drew poor interest from retail investors ‚Äî a break from the frenzy seen in some recent IPOs, particularly smaller issues. Waaree‚Äôs retail portion of the IPO was subscribed nearly 11 times, according to exchange data, underscoring the appetite for new listings in India remains strong. The appeal of India‚Äôs renewable sector, where stocks have rallied this year, is also drawing investors. Waaree sells products such as solar modules and inverters. It posted a profit of more than 4 billion rupees ($47.7 million) on revenue from operations of 34.1 billion rupees for the three months ended June, according to its red-herring prospectus. Its shares attracted investments from prominent Wall Street names, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc., and Morgan Stanley. The company‚Äôs business prospects align with Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs goal to boost renewable-energy production by more than twofold from current levels. The sector may need investments of $2.2 trillion by 2050, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. Indian IPOs have raised $13.1 billion so far this year, more than the annual volumes in the past two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Listings in the nation this year have on average generated a nearly 27% first-day gain. Among IPOs between $500 million and $1 billion, the gain was about 66%.

The stock climbed to as high as 2,624.40 rupees in early trading Monday, from its issue price of 1,503 rupees. Mumbai-based Waaree had seen strong interest for its deal, with the issue getting subscribed by more 70 times. The debut comes on the back of a world-beating rally in India‚Äôs renewable-energy stocks this year. The firm‚Äôs gain stands in contrast to Hyundai Motor India‚Äôs IPO that culminated in a first-day decline last week. The $3.3 billion IPO, the nation‚Äôs largest ever, drew poor interest from retail investors ‚Äî a break from the frenzy seen in some recent IPOs, particularly smaller issues. Waaree‚Äôs retail portion of the IPO was subscribed nearly 11 times, according to exchange data, underscoring the appetite for new listings in India remains strong. The appeal of India‚Äôs renewable sector, where stocks have rallied this year, is also drawing investors. Waaree sells products such as solar modules and inverters. It posted a profit of more than 4 billion rupees ($47.7 million) on revenue from operations of 34.1 billion rupees for the three months ended June, according to its red-herring prospectus. Its shares attracted investments from prominent Wall Street names, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc., and Morgan Stanley. The company‚Äôs business prospects align with Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs goal to boost renewable-energy production by more than twofold from current levels. The sector may need investments of $2.2 trillion by 2050, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. Indian IPOs have raised $13.1 billion so far this year, more than the annual volumes in the past two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Listings in the nation this year have on average generated a nearly 27% first-day gain. Among IPOs between $500 million and $1 billion, the gain was about 66%.

Title: Broadcom (AVGO): Leading with Custom Silicon and Strategic Acquisitions

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. The past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries‚Äô balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging. The tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end. However, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year. The aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent. Coming back to tech ‚Äì the industry wouldn‚Äôt stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown. The US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a Financial Times‚Äô survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed‚Äôs rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession. For instance, Piper Sandler‚Äôs Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the ‚Äújumbo‚Äù rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn‚Äôt avert the problem. However, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists‚Äô estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn‚Äôt without historical precedent. Further, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week‚Äôs worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024. Moving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is ‚Äòtactically bullish‚Äô on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets ‚Äúpricing in a soft landing‚Äù. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end. With regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said: ‚ÄúI think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we‚Äôre kind of underweight on software.‚Äù Rowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don‚Äôt change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up. For our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. 3Y CAGR: 55.87% Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been one of the most profitable stocks in the S&P500 index over the past few years. The company has been very successful in its patent portfolio strategy by acquiring other tech companies by leveraged buyouts. Some of its recent acquisitions include CA Technologies and VMware, with VMware being especially prominent. Further, Broadcom is the biggest player in the custom silicon market that lets other companies design their own AI accelerators, which are increasingly opting for specific chips for specific use cases. Following is what Clearbridge Large Cap Value strategy had to say about AVGO in their Q3, 2024 investor letter: ‚ÄúIn IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.‚Äù Overall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Intel (INTC) Poised for a Quantum Leap with Silicon Spin Qubits?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against other best quantum computing stocks to buy according to analysts. The modern digital world is built with its transistor-based chips on the foundations of Quantum Mechanics, the physics governing the world at the fundamental level. However, the world has barely scratched the surface when it comes to the full potential of Quantum Mechanics, that is, until Quantum computing came to the foray. In the same spirit but in different light to its classical counterpart, quantum-computing technology seeks to exploit particle superpositions for computing operations. It differs from classical computing due to the particle superpositions that occur at the quantum scale, allowing a qubit to be in a state of both 0 and 1 until it interacts with the environment. This exploit would allow Quantum computers to outperform classical computers exponentially in certain computing tasks. This could have huge implications for healthcare, finance, telecom, and energy industries, among others, ushering the world in a new era of accelerated economic growth. Mckinsey estimates that an economic value of $0.9 ‚Äì $2 trillion can be extracted by 2035 across four industries ‚Äì chemicals, life sciences, finance and mobility ‚Äì due to quantum computing. The McKinsey report estimates the Quantum computing market size to be between $45 billion to $131 billion by 2040. Precedence Research appears more conservative and probably more grounded (You‚Äôll see why). According to their report, the market for quantum computing is around $1 billion as of this year and is projected to expand at a CAGR of 30.9% from 2024 to 2034, reaching a size of $16 billion by the end of the forecast period. The US is expected to comprise $7 billion of the projected quantum market pie by the end of 2034. The market in the US is expected to grow at a CAGR of 31.2% from 2024-2034. As of 2023, North America unsurprisingly comprises 61% of the quantum-computing market. As we point out in a similar article from May, analyzing the quantum-computing equity market based on an ETF exposed to it is a bit tricky. Very few companies have core business related to quantum computing and most companies in these ETFs have peripheral Quantum computing projects but are big and high-performing in other industries that are core to their business, so an ETF‚Äôs performance wouldn‚Äôt be saying much about the quantum computing industry. Therefore, we‚Äôll delve a little deeper to see what actual challenges there are in the industry and whether they can be practically solved for the delivery of a return on investment as far as scalable practical use cases go. Solving Quantum computing is akin to a Herculean labor. It‚Äôs hard to argue with the laws of physics, and when it comes to Quantum computing, a major problem yet to be overcome is Decoherence-induced errors. Decoherence is the enabler of transition from Quantum physics to the everyday physics we experience. Qubits (the quantum equivalent of bits) can only remain in a superposition as long as there‚Äôs no interaction with the environment. Even the slightest interaction causes them to decohere to classical bits, introducing computing errors. The hard part is to keep them in a superposition long enough for quantum computation to be viable. Further, to scale quantum computing, you have to add more qubits to the system, but adding more qubits, in principle, increases the probability of error. Finally, any approaches to error correction must obey the Quantum no-cloning theorem, which makes these approaches inherently more challenging than their classical counterparts. In 2022, Azure Quantum demonstrated the soundness of physics required to build topological qubits (these qubits are different in that they can maintain coherence for longer and would thereby lead to a reduced error rate through more stability). On the other hand, Researchers at Quantum AI, an arm of another big tech company, made a breakthrough in 2023, demonstrating a reduced error rate even with an increased number of traditional Qubits. However, rare correlated error events that happened roughly every hour limited the exceptionally low error rate required for practical quantum computing, with more research required to tackle them. Despite these steps, the challenges remain to be effectively overcome. It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess how long it‚Äôll take for quantum computers to scale and become economically viable. If the amount of capital being invested by venture capital firms in the industry is any guide, it certainly doesn‚Äôt look good for the industry as of recent. According to IQM‚Äôs State-of-Quantum Report of 2024, the venture capital invested in Quantum startups dropped by 50% worldwide in 2023 compared to the year prior, with the US quantum startup ecosystem seeing the greatest decline of capital at 80%. As far as public equity in the quantum computing industry goes, it is overall yet to be profitable. The industry hasn‚Äôt experienced any operating leverage in any meaningful sense and is focused on growing revenue in its early stage. The hard problems with regards to practicality and scalability has resulted in many quantum computing stocks trade at price levels that make them non-compliant with stock exchanges, resulting in delisting threats by stock exchanges. Also read why Jim Cramer can‚Äôt recommend a particular quantum computing stock here. For our list, we‚Äôve selected companies that have a presence in the quantum computing industry and ranked them on the basis of their 12-month price upside on analysts‚Äô consensus. Please note that we have used the median upside because average upsides can be greatly affected by outlier analysts on either side of the low or high. For some stocks, both mean and median upsides were too low, but since we wanted to limit our list to pure-play stocks as much as we could, we chose them using the high end of the upside, provided that at least 9 analysts had contributed to their average upside. Finally, we ranked the stocks on weighted scores, with median upside having a weight of 0.4 while analyst count having a weight of 0.6. For stocks for which we have used high-end of the upside, the weight for the upside is 0.2, with analyst-count weight reduced to 0.4. For stocks whose upside is based on only one analyst, and if the upside is over 30%, we assigned weights of 0.01 to both the upside and the analyst count. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Median Upside Potential: 20.86% Number of Analysts: 25 Insider Monkey Weighted Score: 23.3 Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has had a bad run in the past few years due to bad management decisions, failure to advance in chip fabrication, and decreased market share due to ARM-based chips. It‚Äôs down 53% year-to-date and 60% on a 5-year annualized basis. We have included Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) solely because of the potential of its quantum technology and low competition in this market compared to Intel‚Äôs other markets. Intel‚Äôs silicon spin qubit approach rather than superconducting qubits has the promise to reduce the complexity associated with quantum hardware since spin qubits can operate at higher temperatures. Spin qubits are also smaller than superconducting qubits, allowing for more complex versions of quantum computers in principle on a chip of the same size. In a paper published by Intel researchers in Nature in May 2024, researchers found that Intel‚Äôs approach results in 99.9% gate fidelity, an important milestone. Intel is well-positioned owing to its transistor-manufacturing credentials to create spin qubits through its 300mm CMOS manufacturing techniques. Overall, INTC ranks 6th on our list of best quantum computing stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Despite the ongoing subdued market mood, Waaree Energies received the strongest subscription response from all sets of investors and also debuted slightly below our expectations. Pre listing, we had recommended profit booking if Waaree lists at double of its issue price which was the street expectations. With listing at Rs 2550, we believe the stock can deliver healthy returns post listing as well. We believe the long term investor demand would continue at the counter on the back of sector demand and expansion plans, with an opportunity to play at the largest manufacturer of solar PV modules in India, bolstered by favourable government policies and few incentive (PLI) schemes. Hence, we recommend long term investors to ‚ÄúHOLD‚Äù while short term investors can look for a target anywhere between Rs 2750-2800 to book profits. Fresh accumulation can be attempted anywhere between Rs 2200-2300 if the opportunity arises due to market scenario and profits booking attempts.

It fell for the fifth consecutive session. It closed lower for the fourth consecutive week falling 2.71% over the week. Indian markets have fallen on all days of the week reeling under FPI selling pressure, weak Q2 results from most corporates and rising treasury yields in the US. Though a bounce in the markets is overdue, it needs reversal of selling pressure from FPIs and some sentiment stability in the local investor community. Nifty could now take support from 23892 while 24378 could prove to be tough to breach on the up in the near term. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. ‚ÄúA significant market trend during the recent days of market correction is the flight to quality. While the Nifty corrected by 8.3% from the recent peak, the mid and small cap indices corrected by 9.8% and 9.3% respectively from their recent peaks. Actually the index movements conceal the carnage in the mid and smallcaps where the correction has been above 30% in dozens of stocks and even by more than 40% in some momentum stocks. It is important to know that many largecaps are steady in this volatile market. The trend of flight to quality is likely to sustain given the good numbers from banking majors like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank where valuations continue to be fair. Investors can profit from these polarised valuations. The global market structure may turn favourable after the subdued Israeli strikes against Iran avoiding the Iranian oil fields which has resulted in a sharp drop in crude prices. The imminent US presidential elections and the uncertainty associated with that will continue to weigh on markets.‚Äù Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. Nifty outlook: With Friday‚Äôs closing hour managing to push Nifty above the initial two hour‚Äôs close when the selling intensity was at its highest, we now have initial signs of a reversal. The August low of 23894 will thus act as a downside marker for all upside attempts. However, we also expect rejection trades to resurface on pull back to 24350.

Guidance revised sharply across metrics The rupee witnessed range-bound trade and appreciated by just 1 paisa to 84.07 against the US dollar in initial deals on Monday, weighed down by significant foreign fund outflows and the strength of the American currency in the overseas market. We zoom in on the prospects of Manappuram Finance, as also the prospects of two other stocks ‚Äî NHPC,andSBI Cards and Payment Service Crude oil futures traded lower on Monday morning after Israel‚Äôs retaliatory attack on Iran over the weekend, which avoided oil and nuclear facilities. This eased the market concerns about possible crude oil supply disruptions in the West Asia region. At 9.17 am on Monday, January Brent oil futures were at $72.40, down by 4.27 per cent, and December crude oil futures on WTI (West Texas Intermediate) were at $68.60, down by 4.43 per cent. November crude oil futures were trading at ‚Çπ5782 on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) during the initial hour of trading on Monday against the previous close of ‚Çπ6040, down by 4.27 per cent, and December futures were trading at ‚Çπ5776 against the previous close of ‚Çπ6023, down by 4.10 per cent. Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty opened positively on Monday, with Sensex up 0.43% at 79,741.46 and Nifty gaining 0.33% at 24,261.15, amid mixed global cues. Despite this, sentiment remains cautious, influenced by sustained FII selling and weak earnings, said Ajit Mishra, SVP at Religare Broking. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have sold ‚Çπ1,02,931 crore in October, impacting market momentum. The dollar index rallied for the fourth consecutive week and is keeping intact the overall uptrend. The index has risen breaking above the resistance at 104. It closed the week at 104.25, up 0.74 per cent. A strong rise in the US Treasury yields is aiding the greenback to retain its strength. Markets turning slightly cautious ahead of the US Presidential Election next month is also giving the dollar a safe-haven support. The uptrend is strong, and we expect the rally in the dollar to continue for another couple of weeks until the outcome of the US elections is known. Sudarshan Chemical (SCIL) announced a large acquisition of Germany-based Heubach Group at a highly discounted valuation on October 11. The speciality chemicals player manufactures colour pigments and is the largest domestic player. While the leap the company has made is commendable and at the opportune moment, investors may hold the stock till further details emerge. The roadmap in turning around the acquisition, part of which turned insolvent, and incremental growth from the acquisition need to be articulated by the company before investing in the stock. The stock trading at 28 times one-year forward earnings also captures the deal enthusiasm and the company prospects in the long term. Here is what the charts say about the shares of Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, Inox Wind and Trent Nifty 50 (24,181) and Bank Nifty (50,787) depreciated 2.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent last week. The former posted a weekly loss for the fourth time in a row, indicating strong selling pressure. Here, we analyse derivatives data of both indices. The sharp decline on Friday has changed the outlook to negative for the stock of IndusInd Bank (‚Çπ1,041.60). Support levels are at ‚Çπ990 and ‚Çπ807. A close below the latter will even change the long-term outlook to negative. In the quarter ended September 2024, NTPC‚Äôs consolidated revenue from operations and EBITDA dipped around 8 per cent each year on year to ‚Çπ44,696.3 crore and ‚Çπ11,655.2 crore respectively. After the results announcement last Thursday post-market hours, the stock dropped 3 per cent on Friday. In fact, the shares of NTPC have corrected 11 per cent from its 52-week high of ‚Çπ443.2 recorded on September 30, 2024. However, on the back of strong tailwinds, BSE Power had a stellar run during the last 12 months, rising 80 per cent. NTPC too, in line, recorded a 72 per cent rise during the same period. Following Dusshera, the festival season peaks in the coming week, with Dhanteras and Diwali round the corner. As we start celebrating the festival of wealth and prosperity, gold continues to shine as a symbol of tradition. This year, the fireworks started early for gold investors with prices on a steady rise since the beginning of 2024. ‚Äò Wu ji bi fan‚Äô as Jacki Chan says in Karate Kid, that is, when things reach an extreme, they can only move in the opposite direction. As did the IT stocks and Nifty IT Index after peaking in a frenzy in early 2022. However, in the last one year, they have attempted a strong recovery piggy-backing on the AI theme, and Nifty IT is now 6.5 per cent above the 2022 peak. It is not clear though if this will sustain. While recent Q2 results indicate the slowdown may have bottomed out, the pace of revenue growth still remains underwhelming. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) has relaxed the definition of what constitutes an inactive trading account. The period for marking an account as inactive has been changed from 12 to 24 months. Existing clients who are inactive as per earlier guidelines, but are active as per revised guidelines, may be considered as active for trading after updating their details, the exchange said in a circular on Friday.

According to deep discount broker, SAS Online‚Äôs breadth analysis, Only 15 per cent of NSE stocks are trading above their 50-day moving average, and just 9 per cent are above their 20-day moving average, suggesting a possible relief but overall, a strong bearish grip. The brokerage said the number of stocks with RSI in the bullish zone has dropped to 20%, indicating exhaustion in upward momentum.

Here‚Äôs an interesting stock idea: The stock idea that we have for you today is Thermax. The stock has surged about 5 per cent on Friday breaking above key resistance on Friday. The price action indicates that a fresh leg of upmove has begun. The outlook is bullish and the share price can go up in the coming days. Check out the latest episode of bl.Today‚Äôs Pick to learn more. Last week we said that #Nifty can bounce back from its support around 24,400. But that view has gone wrong. The fall last week confirms a head and shoulder pattern on the chart. That leaves the danger of seeing more fall in the short-term. A short-lived recovery is also possible before another leg of fall happens. However, from a big picture there are good chances that we could be in the last leg of this correction. So, we expect the broader uptrend to resume after one more leg of fall from here. #Nifty can fall to 23,500-23,000 on a break below 23,900. After this fall, the overall uptrend can resume. #NiftyBank index can fall to 49,700-49,400 and then rise back to 51,000-52,000 again.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Reach $3 Billion Inflows In October, Retail Investors Lead The Charge ‚Äì Report
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-reach-3-billion-inflows-in-october-retail-investors-lead-the-charge-report/
Time Published: 2024-10-27T19:30:26Z

Bitcoin ETFs ended last week on another positive note with $997.70 million in net inflows and demand reaching its highest level in six months. Undoubtedly, these ETFs have marked the turning point for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since the beginning of the year, as it opened up the cryptocurrency to inflows from every side. Interestingly, data has shown that retail investors are responsible for most of the demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs, accounting for 80% of the total assets under management. According to Bloomberg data, Bitcoin ETFs have dominated the ETF landscape in 2024, claiming the top four positions for inflows among all ETFs launched this year. Specifically, out of the 575 ETFs introduced thus far, 14 of the top 30 are new funds focusing on Bitcoin or Ethereum. The standout performer is the BlackRock IBIT fund, which has attracted over $23 billion in year-to-date inflows. Last week was another example of the positive performance in Spot Bitcoin ETFs, despite the coin‚Äôs consolidation below the $68,000 price level. According to flow data from SosoValue, weekly inflows started on a positive note on Monday, October 21, with $294.29 million entering the funds and ended the week with $402.08 million in inflows on Friday, October 25. Interestingly, Spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold about 938,700 BTC in 10 months since launch and are steadily approaching the 1 million BTC mark. Although these ETFs have opened doors for institutional investors, a recent report from crypto exchange Binance indicates that retail investors are the primary drivers of this surge in demand, accounting for 80% of the holdings in Spot BTC ETFs. Originally intended to provide institutional investors access to BTC, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have now become the preferred choice for many individual investors looking to take advantage of the regulatory clarity they offer. Nonetheless, there has been a steady demand from the institutional side, with institutional holdings rising by 30% since Q1. Among institutional investors, investment advisers have emerged as the fastest-growing party, with their holdings increasing by 44.2% to reach 71,800 BTC this quarter. Thanks to the rapid growth of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, an impressive 1,179 institutions, including financial giants such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, have joined the crypto‚Äôs cap table in less than a year. For comparison, Gold ETFs were only able to attract 95 institutions in their first year of trading. This upward trajectory of institutional investments in Bitcoin is poised to continue into the foreseeable future, which bodes well for the overall price outlook of Bitcoin. As these ETFs attract more institutional capital, they are likely to produce second-order effects like increased BTC dominance, improved market efficiency, and reduced volatility that could significantly benefit the cryptocurrency ecosystem. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,100.

Clontarf returned to winning ways by travelling to Cork and avenging last season‚Äôs epic semi-final defeat with a 20-16 win over the champions Constitution. Con led 13-6 at the break thanks to a try by Irish Sevens winger Sean French, but Clontarf stormed back in the second half through tries by centre Tadhg Bird and Leinster academy winger Aitzol Arenzana-King. Shock of the day was at Lakelands Park where City of Armagh secured a last gasp 30-26 win. Terenure had not lost at home in over a year and had beaten each of the other ‚Äúbig four‚Äù. But Armagh roared into a 23-5 interval lead, Kyle Faloon kicking three penalties and converting Dylan Nelson‚Äôs try in addition to a penalty try. Terenure responded with three converted tries by Craig Adams (his second), Harrison Brewer and Henry McErlean, but Armagh went to the corner for hooker Jonny Morton to burrow over. Ballynahinch moved into second with a 33-7 win at home to Garryowen, securing a bonus point by half time before a second try by another ex-Irish Sevens winger Zac Ward. St Mary‚Äôs also secured a bonus pint by half time in UCD through tries by Leandro Ramirez, Dan Goggin and Jack Nelson (two) en route to a 29-21 win which moved them above Terenure ahead of the sides‚Äô first derby in seven seasons at Templeville Road a fortnight hence. Young Munster also had a bonus point by the interval through tries by Manuel Covella, Jake O‚ÄôRiordan, Christian Foley and Hubert Gilvarry, and another by Stephen McLoughlin, converted by Argentinian Julian Leszczynski, had them 36-7 ahead before a late rally by Lansdowne. In the 2B summit meeting at Corinthian Park the young home side led 14-0 through tries by Orin Burke and John Devine, the second created by Sean Naughton‚Äôs break and offload, but Instonians led at half time through unconverted tries by Bradley McNamara, Ian Whitten and Schalk van der Merwe, two conversions hitting the upright. After a red card for the 37-year-old Whitten, eldest of four Instonians‚Äô siblings, Corinthians‚Äô late siege led to centre Tom Waters crashing over for a 21-15 win. It was just a third defeat in 41 games for ‚ÄúInst‚Äù, and the second in that run by Corinthians. In 2B neighbours Galwegians lost 26-24 in Malone, a fifth defeat by two points or one, leaving them winless with six bonus points and a points difference of minus seven.

Title: BlackRock Makes History With 400,000 Bitcoin (BTC)

U.Today - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has reached a new milestone in its Bitcoin holdings, with a total of over 400,000 BTC. Right now, the hedge fund's holdings are valued at around $26.98 billion, with a total of 403,725 BTC. This big accumulation comes as the asset management giant bought another 34,085 BTC over the past two weeks, which is estimated to be worth about $2.3 billion, reports Lookonchain. The ongoing inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are helping BlackRock to grow its presence in the cryptocurrency market, making the firm a dominant force. This shows that more and more, Bitcoin ETFs are becoming a big way for institutions to own BTC. As the company increases its holdings, some people think that Bitcoin's future might change. Many are already projecting a sort of Bitcoin wars in the future, making dystopian predictions that BlackRock will eventually push for the fork of the original BTC chain and then promote its own forked chain as the real one, using all its massive resources to do so. It does not sound like something impossible, but in the current realm it seems more like a conspiracy theory. Such a rapid accumulation of Bitcoin has people wondering where BlackRock will draw the line in its pursuit of dominance in the cryptocurrency market. On the other hand, the financial behemoth faces challenges to its influence from other significant stakeholders in the Bitcoin space, including figures like Michael Saylor with MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, mining entities, early adopters and millions of individual investors who form a large and decentralized market presence. Whether they will be able to present a solid opposition to BlackRock is another question however. This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: Zelensky the Lying War Criminal Tries to Create World War III

Time Published: 2024-10-27T16:30:39Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/27/2024 9:30:39 AM PDT by delta7 world into World War III. He actually suggested he be given nuclear weapons if not allowed to join NATO. I have had employees both in Kyiv and Donetsk, and the sad part about this is they have lost their country, and for what? I warned them that he was dishonest and had been constantly lying and trying to manipulate the world. He intentionally dresses as if he is in the military, no matter what he attends. He thinks this is a psychological ploy to get him never-ending money constantly. The only way to world peace is to arrest this clown, and he should be in prison for the rest of his life without parole. Zelensky lied to get into office and pretended to be Christian, even baptizing g his two children. He promised peace to win, and my sources in Kiev swear the election was rigged. He promised peace, and has done everything put what he promised and then declared Martial Law so he does not have to stand for election every again as long as he can keep this war going. Heis VICTORY PLAN was nothing but to conquer and destroy Russia. He then suddenly became Jewish to select the fact that he was a Neo-Nazi and used to joke on stage about confiscating assets from Jews and Russians which he classified as the same. Friends in Israel do not consider him Jewish and he was pushing his claimed Jewish heritage and then asking for money implying this was vaguely connected to exterminating the Jews. The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelensky also had secret hidden offshore accounts along with all the other corrupt Ukrainian politicians. He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person‚Äôs throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person‚Äôs torso in half with a carpenter‚Äôs saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women‚Äôs abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: ‚ÄúSome Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ‚Äù id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia‚Äôs enemy is the West‚Äôs friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,‚Äù he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn‚Äôt join NATO. ‚ÄúEither Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.‚Äù There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very ‚Äúdangerous provocation.‚Äù Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: ‚ÄúI can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.‚Äù Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia.

He intentionally dresses as if he is in the military, no matter what he attends. He thinks this is a psychological ploy to get him never-ending money constantly. The only way to world peace is to arrest this clown, and he should be in prison for the rest of his life without parole. Zelensky lied to get into office and pretended to be Christian, even baptizing g his two children. He promised peace to win, and my sources in Kiev swear the election was rigged. He promised peace, and has done everything put what he promised and then declared Martial Law so he does not have to stand for election every again as long as he can keep this war going. Heis VICTORY PLAN was nothing but to conquer and destroy Russia. He then suddenly became Jewish to select the fact that he was a Neo-Nazi and used to joke on stage about confiscating assets from Jews and Russians which he classified as the same. Friends in Israel do not consider him Jewish and he was pushing his claimed Jewish heritage and then asking for money implying this was vaguely connected to exterminating the Jews. The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelensky also had secret hidden offshore accounts along with all the other corrupt Ukrainian politicians. He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person‚Äôs throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person‚Äôs torso in half with a carpenter‚Äôs saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women‚Äôs abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: ‚ÄúSome Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ‚Äù id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia‚Äôs enemy is the West‚Äôs friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,‚Äù he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn‚Äôt join NATO. ‚ÄúEither Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.‚Äù There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very ‚Äúdangerous provocation.‚Äù Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: ‚ÄúI can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.‚Äù Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world‚Äôs financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person‚Äôs throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person‚Äôs torso in half with a carpenter‚Äôs saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women‚Äôs abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: ‚ÄúSome Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ‚Äù id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia‚Äôs enemy is the West‚Äôs friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,‚Äù he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn‚Äôt join NATO. ‚ÄúEither Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.‚Äù There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very ‚Äúdangerous provocation.‚Äù Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: ‚ÄúI can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.‚Äù Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world‚Äôs financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Friends in Israel do not consider him Jewish and he was pushing his claimed Jewish heritage and then asking for money implying this was vaguely connected to exterminating the Jews. The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelensky also had secret hidden offshore accounts along with all the other corrupt Ukrainian politicians. He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa.

Because the ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Free Republic Browse ¬∑ Search News/Activism Topics ¬∑ Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelensky also had secret hidden offshore accounts along with all the other corrupt Ukrainian politicians. He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person‚Äôs throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person‚Äôs torso in half with a carpenter‚Äôs saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women‚Äôs abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: ‚ÄúSome Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ‚Äù id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia‚Äôs enemy is the West‚Äôs friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,‚Äù he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn‚Äôt join NATO. ‚ÄúEither Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.‚Äù There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very ‚Äúdangerous provocation.‚Äù Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: ‚ÄúI can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.‚Äù Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world‚Äôs financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person‚Äôs throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person‚Äôs torso in half with a carpenter‚Äôs saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women‚Äôs abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: ‚ÄúSome Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ‚Äù id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia‚Äôs enemy is the West‚Äôs friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,‚Äù he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn‚Äôt join NATO. ‚ÄúEither Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.‚Äù There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very ‚Äúdangerous provocation.‚Äù Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: ‚ÄúI can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.‚Äù Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world‚Äôs financial capital will move to Beijing.

Free Republic Browse ¬∑ Search News/Activism Topics ¬∑ Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person‚Äôs throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person‚Äôs torso in half with a carpenter‚Äôs saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women‚Äôs abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: ‚ÄúSome Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ‚Äù id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia‚Äôs enemy is the West‚Äôs friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,‚Äù he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn‚Äôt join NATO. ‚ÄúEither Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.‚Äù There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very ‚Äúdangerous provocation.‚Äù Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: ‚ÄúI can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.‚Äù Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world‚Äôs financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person‚Äôs throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person‚Äôs torso in half with a carpenter‚Äôs saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women‚Äôs abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: ‚ÄúSome Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ‚Äù id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia‚Äôs enemy is the West‚Äôs friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,‚Äù he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn‚Äôt join NATO. ‚ÄúEither Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.‚Äù There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very ‚Äúdangerous provocation.‚Äù Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler.

Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person‚Äôs throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person‚Äôs torso in half with a carpenter‚Äôs saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women‚Äôs abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: ‚ÄúSome Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ‚Äù id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire.

Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia‚Äôs enemy is the West‚Äôs friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine.

They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person‚Äôs throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person‚Äôs torso in half with a carpenter‚Äôs saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women‚Äôs abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: ‚ÄúSome Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ‚Äù id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia‚Äôs enemy is the West‚Äôs friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,‚Äù he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn‚Äôt join NATO. ‚ÄúEither Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.‚Äù There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very ‚Äúdangerous provocation.‚Äù Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: ‚ÄúI can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.‚Äù Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world‚Äôs financial capital will move to Beijing.

The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF.

They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,‚Äù he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border.

The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very ‚Äúdangerous provocation.‚Äù Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: ‚ÄúI can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.‚Äù Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia.

The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing.

By Bob Unruh October 27, 2024 If picking a despicable name for your political opponent were a competition, Democrats and other leftists across America may have thought they had the winner as, for years, they have called President Donald Trump a ‚ÄúHitler.‚Äù It was their attempt to find the most horrific, reprehensible descriptive for him. But they lost, according to a controversial former Roman Catholic archbishop. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet ‚Äì delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! That church leader, Carlo Maria Vigano, who was the Vatican‚Äôs ambassador to the U.S. from 2011 until 2016, described Kamala Harris as ‚Äúan infernal monster who obeys Satan.‚Äù The election this year is, in fact, described by many as a spiritual fight, what with the likelihood Harris would push harder for the Biden-Harris administration‚Äôs top agenda items of abortion for all and transgenderism, including body mutilations, for children, both industries opposed by most Christians. That‚Äôs besides the inflation, open southern border and more that the administration has inflicted on Americans. Vigano, in an open letter to Catholics, explained there‚Äôs no question that they should vote for Trump. He said voters in just days must decide ‚Äúbetween two radically opposed ways of conceiving the government of your Nation.‚Äù Vigano, excommunicated this year, said, ‚ÄúThe choice is between a conservative President, who is paying with his very life for his fight against the deep state, and an infernal monster who obeys Satan. ‚ÄúFor a Catholic, there can be no question: voting for Kamala Harris is morally inadmissible and constitutes a very grave sin. Nor is it morally possible to abstain, because in this war declaring oneself neutral means allying oneself with the enemy.‚Äù Vigano ran into trouble inside the politics of the Catholic community for his criticisms of Pope Francis, a liberal whose leftist pronouncements often have stunned the community, and the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù reforms in the church. The New York Post explained, ‚ÄúHis letter contains numerous references to numerous conspiracy theories, including references to the ‚Äòdeep state,‚Äô calling the 2020 presidential election ‚Äòthe fraud of 2020‚Äô and suggesting that the world governments engineered climate change to ‚Äòto make the global warming fraud credible.'‚Äù He also condemned America‚Äôs ‚Äúwoke‚Äù ideologies, abortion and transgenderism, and the ‚Äúdens of indoctrination and corruption from kindergarten onwards‚Äù that American schools have become. He explained voting is a moral duty, but the 2024 vote choice is more than that, as it is ‚Äúbetween two radically opposed ways of conceiving the government of your Nation: you are called to choose between democracy and dictatorship, between freedom and slavery.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúOn one side we have candidate Donald J. Trump, who, despite serious problems in his positions ‚Äì especially in the matter of abortion and assisted procreation ‚Äì has as his objective the common good and the protection of the fundamental freedoms of citizens. In Donald Trump‚Äôs America, every Catholic can practice their Faith and educate their children in it without interference from the State. On the other side we have a candidate and a party that promotes everything that directly opposes the Faith and Morals of the Catholic Church. In Kamala Harris‚Äô America, Catholics ‚Äì but also Protestants ‚Äì are considered fundamentalists to be marginalized and eliminated, and their children are considered the property of the State, which arrogates to itself the right to lead them astray from an early age in both body and soul. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs America can become great and prosperous again. Harris‚Äô America is destined for invasion and for moral, social, and economic destruction: the most ferocious dictatorship,‚Äù he warned. Democrat-run cities, for example, now are ‚Äúdumps filled with derelicts and criminals, drug dealers and addicts, prostitutes and robbers. Your schools are dens of indoctrination and corruption from kindergarten onwards. In your courts, criminals are acquitted and innocents are imprisoned: new ideological crimes are prosecuted, while illegality is tolerated and encouraged. In your hospitals, multinational corporations rule, and you are their guinea pigs to be exterminated or made chronically ill so that you will be their perpetual clients,‚Äù he wrote. He described the green ideology, promoted by Biden and Harris, ‚Äúlies without any scientific proof.‚Äù America now, he said, has ‚Äúa puppet in the White House and a corrupt and incompetent Vice President who has never stopped lying and deceiving voters about her past and her future. Power is managed by the criminal deep state ‚Äì whose names and faces we now know ‚Äì that is responsible for the destruction of your great Nation.‚Äù: Under Harris, he said, American would be destined to be ‚Äúmanipulated by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not think that these are remote hypotheses: wherever the woke Left takes power, it establishes the most vicious, anti-human, and anti-Christian dictatorship that humanity has ever known. And we know that every time the Left has come to power, it has never left through democratic means,‚Äù he warned. Singled out for condemnation are Obama, Clinton, George Soros, Klaus Schwab, Jeffrey Epstein, Sean Combs, the World Economic Forum, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Vanguard, BlackRock and StateStreet. ‚ÄúBehind these people ‚Äì by now we should know this ‚Äì are people devoted to evil, united by the satanic hatred against Our Lord Jesus Christ and those who believe in Him, mainly against the Catholic faithful. We want Christ to reign, and we proclaim it with pride: Christ is King! They want the Antichrist to reign, whose tyranny is made of chaos, war, disease, famine, and death.‚Äù He pointed out while Trump holds some positions with which Catholics do not agree, he represents the ‚Äúonly possible choice to counter the globalist coup that the woke Left is about to implement definitively, irreparably, and with incalculable damage for future generations.‚Äù Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/27/2024 9:13:59 AM PDT by delta7 Zelensky Tells Trump That Ukraine Faces a Fork in the Road: Join NATO or Go Nuclear What way out do we have?' the wartime leader tells the 45th president. 'Either Ukraine will have nuclear weapons, which for us will be a defense, or we'll need to have some sort of alliance.' COMMENT: Mr. Armstrong, I have family in Kyiv, and as you have reported, they are unhappy with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I am not sure who is pulling his strings, but he is a threat to Ukraine. As you have pointed out, they had their freedom. Attacking the Donbas was not for the people‚Äôs benefit. It seems that anyone who tells the truth is attacked as putting out Russian propaganda. He has shut down all the press that even questioned what was going on in Ukraine. I wish more people would open their eyes. Thank you for trying. ANSWER: It is not Russian propaganda but Neocon propaganda that we need to be worried about, just like the weapons of mass destruction of Saddam that never existed or the Russians that were never behind Vietnam. When the war just began, I reported that 100,000 Ukrainians had been killed in the first few months. The emails came in accusing me of putting out Russian propaganda. It did not matter that my sources were from Ukraine. Then, the head of the EU gave the same number. Zelensky made her take that out, claiming it was classified information. Here is the original clip and the edited one. This was NOT Russian propaganda. Even Ukrainian TV has reported that over 1 million Ukrainians have been killed in this war, and for what? So Blackrock can buy up all the farmland? Zelensky is asking for nuclear weapons. He knows that Russia would then have no choice but to annihilate Ukraine. Putin would be justified in responding just as President Kennedy responded in 1962 because of nuclear weapons being stationed in Cuba. The Ukrainian People Deserve to Decide their own Fate, not one dictated by the Neocons in the USA or NATO. Zelensky has been asking to JOIN NATO, which is instant World War III or give him nuclear weapons. This is just unimaginable! Ukraine should have been split according to ethnicity, the same as the fall of Yugoslavia. Just as a Serb killed the archduke and heir to Austria in Seriavo and started World War I, the ethnic hatred in this region can only be suppressed by division. TOPICS: Foreign Affairs KEYWORDS: agitprop; concerntroll; delusionalzeepers; dugwaydork; killkillkillforpeace; mic; ukraine; war; welfarewar Be sure to view Ursula Van Der Crazies edited speech. You will see how the West is lying about this war.

Politicans instalked in a coup who in turn sold everything of value not nailed down to western benafactors... then the money was spent to build an army twice the size of Russia‚Äôs. As the AFU grew Ukraine leveraged most national assets against loans. The strategy employed by NATO in Ukraine ensures you fight snd die in place. This strategy was designed to ‚Äúthe last Ukrainian‚Äù make it impossible for Ukraine to assert its birthright and remain bought or defaulted to western ownership. Russia is actually Ukraine‚Äôs only hope of ever discharging the debt owed to the west, which if totally defeated in a war those loans are moot. Zelinski and a puppet government living in exile in the west are not going to pay the loans with any of the stolen funds they took. Ukraine got robbed by the west over and again. A coup that essentially transferred ownership of Ukraine‚Äôs birthright is a creative rape of a people separating them from a soverign nation. Never trust a democrat. Never trust America as an ally... which is why Brics took off on steroids to flee USD Oppression, and a repeat of the scheme to rape Ukraine. Russia is destroying the AFU. The pace of advancement in Ukraine by Russia, and daily reduction of 3k soldiers daily, mean that Kiev could be within artillery range by 1 January 2025. Today Rusdia has more soldiers, drones, vehicles, tanks, artillery, etc., than Ukraine and even in June 2024 Ukraine had more troops and drones. Putin will have to destroy AZOV and disarm Ukraine. NATO screaming about foreign soldiers helping Russia is more about who is occupying Ukraine and its pasification which will not affect Rusdian soldiers as Putins allies finish off lone wolves, and enforce the peacekeeping. Ukraine deserves Biden and Zelinski. 14 posted on 10/27/2024 1:34:15 PM PDT by Jumper [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Thank you for trying. ANSWER: It is not Russian propaganda but Neocon propaganda that we need to be worried about, just like the weapons of mass destruction of Saddam that never existed or the Russians that were never behind Vietnam. When the war just began, I reported that 100,000 Ukrainians had been killed in the first few months. The emails came in accusing me of putting out Russian propaganda. It did not matter that my sources were from Ukraine. Then, the head of the EU gave the same number. Zelensky made her take that out, claiming it was classified information. Here is the original clip and the edited one. This was NOT Russian propaganda. Even Ukrainian TV has reported that over 1 million Ukrainians have been killed in this war, and for what? So Blackrock can buy up all the farmland? Zelensky is asking for nuclear weapons. He knows that Russia would then have no choice but to annihilate Ukraine. Putin would be justified in responding just as President Kennedy responded in 1962 because of nuclear weapons being stationed in Cuba. The Ukrainian People Deserve to Decide their own Fate, not one dictated by the Neocons in the USA or NATO. Zelensky has been asking to JOIN NATO, which is instant World War III or give him nuclear weapons. This is just unimaginable!

It would be a violation of international law for a nation to give a nuclear weapon to Ukraine. Ukraine can build a nuclear weapon. It has the know-how and the plutonium. However, Russia can move military targets out of its cities, which would make it a violation of international law to attack Russian cities. Yup. Z-man gotta go. Go nuclear - like Chernobyl? Is he offering to glow in the dark? International Law is obeyed when it is convenient and violated covertly when it is not convenient. I‚Äôm sure your friends will be happier as a part of Russia ruled by Putin. Call this nitpicking, but the remark about Saddam‚Äôs WMD really hacks me to this day. He went to great pains to convince everyone he was close to having nuclear weapons. He violated something like 17 UN resolutions demanding that inspectors be allowed in. Debate the prosecution of the second Iraq war all you want, but this was a very bad guy who was asking for it. I can not supply proof, but I put my money on the CIA. They have cost more people in the world their freedom than any other organization since the end of WW II. The USSR runs a poor second. If Trump loses the election, future generations will probably find the CIA behind the steal. They have cost more people in the world their freedom than any other organization since the end of WW II.

Title: Disney is on Project 2025‚Äôs List of Companies That Need to Change the Way They Do Business

in Hong Kong Disneyland, Shanghai Disneyland, Theme Parks, Updates Credit: Disney Project 2025 has finally entered the mainstream media over the past few weeks. It is a conversation agenda, and should Donald Trump retake the White House in 2025, Related: Supreme Court Sides With DeSantis in Punishing Disney World Cast Members However, this document also takes issue with The Walt Disney Company and its business practices. Should there be a second President Trump term, this could impact how Disney conducts its business in the future. So, what is Project 2025, and what does it say about The Walt Disney Company? Essentially, Project 2025 is a wish list for a conservative government takeover if Donald Trump wins the White House in November. It is an outline of legislative priorities that can be accomplished without Congress, which would ultimately give the President more power. The Heritage Foundation created the document with input from over 100 conservative organizations and former President Trump appointees. Conservatives are referring to it as a second American Revolution. Related: With the Supreme Court and DeSantis Against Them, Disney World Cast Member Get Help From the Federal Government Among its proposals for the federal government would be to eliminate job protections for federal workers, allow the President to make changes in widespread areas of the government, and place most of the federal government directly under the President‚Äôs control. It calls for slashing government investment in climate and renewable energy research and increased domestic oil production. It does not call for a nationwide ban on abortion and contraceptives but does say that pills used in abortions should be banned. It also calls for broader government control over technology, including the banning of all pornography on the internet. Project 2025 also wants parental controls over schools and a wider use of school voucher programs. Related: Disney Under Fire for Videos Claiming They Don‚Äôt Hire ‚ÄòWhite Men,‚Äô But How Real is the Threat? There are two mentions of The Walt Disney Company in the document and the company‚Äôs business dealings with China. The document says: In some cases, these voices, like global corporate giants BlackRock and Disney‚Äîor the National Basketball Association (NBA)‚Äîdirectly benefit from doing business with Beijing. Part of the Project 2025 agenda is to dramatically increase tariffs on the Chinese, which would hurt American business in China. If re-elected, Donald Trump has also said he would ban Chineses citizens from owning a range of assets in America, but he would also ban American companies from investing in China. This would complicate Disney‚Äôs investment in Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland and put future investment in those theme parks in jeopardy. The second mention of Disney comes in a section on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This section accuses some global voices of silencing accusations that China released the COVID-19 virus from a lab. The report reads: In some cases, these voices, like the global corporate giants BlackRock and Disney, directly benefit from doing business with Beijing. If enacted, Project 2025 could have a dramatic effect on how The Walt Disney Company does business in China, but also here in the United States. You can read the entiretity of Project 2025 here.

Title: Wall Street and tech royalty fly to Saudi event amid Mideast war
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/27/davos-in-the-desert-saudi-arabia-future-investment-initiative-goldman-sachs-citigroup-blackrock-tiktok-mohammed-bin-salman/
Time Published: 2024-10-27T15:03:17Z
Full Content:
Saudi Arabia will host the biggest names in finance and technology this coming week in a test of investor appetite for the kingdom‚Äôs ambitions of transforming itself into a global hub at a time of widening regional conflict. International executives will have to contend with a region rocked by geopolitical tensions, with the threat of further military confrontation between Israel and Iran at the highest levels in decades. And they will land in a country that is increasingly facing up to the fact that even its vast oil wealth has limits. But those arriving at the Future Investment Initiative ‚Äì often dubbed Davos in the desert ‚Äì seem undeterred, sensing an opportunity to plug into Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman‚Äôs trillion-dollar Vision 2030 economic remake. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.‚Äôs David Solomon, Citigroup Inc.‚Äôs Jane Fraser and BlackRock Inc.‚Äôs Larry Fink have become regulars at the Riyadh summit and are set to return this year. Reflecting Saudi Arabia‚Äôs focus on technology and artificial intelligence, they‚Äôll be joined by prominent names in those industries. Alphabet Inc. President Ruth Porat and TikTok Inc. Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew are set to speak at the summit for the first time. Benjamin Horowitz, tech entrepreneur and co-founder of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, is also making an appearance. Read More: Saudi Arabia, UAE Bet on Chips to Power Post-Oil Future Wall Street and Silicon Valley have increasingly turned to the oil-rich Middle East as liquidity gets tighter in other parts of the world, especially China. Saudi Arabia itself commands nearly $1 trillion in sovereign wealth, though the Crown Prince wants titans of industry to stop deploying that money overseas and instead help support his domestic ambitions. Yet the backdrop is one of increasing uncertainty. Saudi foreign policy has recently focused on lowering regional tensions in the hope that a more stable region will bring in foreign capital and technological know-how. But events of the past year have served as a reminder of how unstable the region can be. ‚ÄúThe impact of regional instability on the prospects for foreign investment is completely negative, with the possible exception of the defense industry,‚Äù said Gregory Gause, Professor of International Affairs at Texas A&M University. Capital is ‚Äúnot attracted to conflict regions, even if the country is not an immediate participant in the conflict.‚Äù To be sure, Saudi Arabia is still pushing ahead with its big development plans. Deals worth more than $28 billion are likely to be announced over the next week by executives from around the world, according to Richard Attias, CEO of the FII Institute. Some of these will focus on AI, including potentially a new fund with Andreessen Horowitz that could grow to as large as $40 billion. The kingdom is also expected to announce a new company that will invest at least $10 billion in making Saudi Arabia a top global producer of hydrogen ‚Äî a low carbon fuel that could be key to the world‚Äôs transition away from burning fossil fuels. Two exchange-traded funds will make their trading debuts in Riyadh, giving Saudi investors access to Hong Kong stocks ‚Äî a reflection of the kingdom‚Äôs growing ties with China as it looks to boost investment flows with its biggest trading partner. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan, and the Commissioner for the Belt and Road, Nicholas Ho, will speak at FII as some of the highest profile speakers from Asia. Still, the regional conflict is undoubtedly weighing on global investor sentiment in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, the biggest Gulf economy, is feeling some of that. The number of actively-managed emerging market funds with Saudi exposure had been rising sharply until earlier this year, but stalled at around 56% as tensions between Israel and Iran escalated, according to Copley Fund Research. The data show that the number of funds invested in the Saudi stock market fell slightly between March and September this year and that the country is the third-biggest underweight after Taiwan and India. Coupled with that, Crown Prince Mohammed has had to come to terms with the limits of even Saudi Arabia‚Äôs vast financial resources to pay for his ambitions. The government, which is forecasting deficits out to at least 2027, has said some projects will be need to be delayed. Read More: Saudi Prince‚Äôs Trillion-Dollar Makeover Faces Funding Cutbacks At the same time, the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom‚Äôs powerful sovereign fund that the de-facto ruler chairs, is becoming a tougher place for foreign firms to get money out of. An increased focus on domestic projects like the $1.5 trillion Neom has global asset managers fretting that the PIF will have less cash to spend abroad. ‚ÄúThe FII has always been designed as a mechanism for investment into Saudi, however in reality it has been an opportunity for foreign execs to extract financing from the Kingdom,‚Äù said Zaid Belbagi, managing partner of political risk consultancy Hardcastle Advisory. ‚ÄúSold-out hotels at $500-1000 per night are indicative of sustained international interest.‚Äù The organizers of the Riyadh jamboree remain confident, and about 7,000 people have registered to attend this year‚Äôs event. That‚Äôs higher than the numbers for last year‚Äôs summit, which took place days after the current conflict in the region started. Investors are coming ‚Äúdespite what is happening in the world,‚Äù FII Institute‚Äôs Attias said. ‚ÄúThe show must go on.‚Äù ¬© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: A Bitcoin supply shock is brewing ‚Äì Will BTC hit $70K next?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/a-bitcoin-supply-shock-is-brewing-will-btc-hit-70k-next/
Time Published: 2024-10-27T15:00:19Z

With BTC at a tipping point, the market may soon witness a decisive movement as conditions for a supply shock develop. Bitcoin [BTC] has been consolidating within the $66K-$67K range for the past seven days, currently trading at $67,160 with a slight 0.57% gain from the previous day. This consolidation mirrors BTC‚Äôs July pattern, where resistance at $68K led to a swift drop below $55K. Thus, staying within this range is critical to avoid a similar downturn. Interestingly, October‚Äôs gains have largely been driven by a post-halving supply squeeze, bringing fresh scarcity to the market. Now, as BTC wraps up its most bullish month, conditions may be ripe for a supply shock if demand aligns. Historically, the post-halving period has acted as a significant catalyst for bullish rallies, particularly from an economic standpoint. As BTC supply tightens, miners are often the most impacted, leading to their widespread capitulation. In simple terms, as block rewards decrease, miners may find it challenging to cover their operational costs, prompting many to exit the market. This shakeout leaves only the most efficient miners in the ecosystem, potentially creating a more robust environment for price appreciation as supply diminishes. Source : X As evidenced by the chart above, miner reserves have been steadily declining since the April halving, reflecting these dynamics. While one might assume this would create selling pressure, the scarcity of BTC among miners ‚Äì especially as block rewards hit lower lows ‚Äì has not significantly impacted the market. If demand remains high, much of the selling pressure is absorbed, creating ideal conditions for a supply crunch. This environment kept October bullish, with BTC nearly testing $70K. However, a breakout has yet to materialize, indicating that the anticipated supply shock has not occurred. This scenario maintains optimism for a potential parabolic rally as we approach the end of Q4. The effects of the halving are evident: Bitcoin‚Äôs mining difficulty has reached an all-time high, meaning it now requires more computational power to process transactions. This situation is forcing out less efficient miners. Source : Bitcoin Magazine Pro As a result, the hash rate has also increased, indicating a more secure and robust network. This trend highlights the consolidation of mining operations, where only those with the best technology and lowest costs can survive. In short, a mass capitulation could still be on the horizon, potentially leading to a significant price increase as available supply dwindles against persistent demand. Currently, all exchanges are seeing a significant increase in BTC reserves, indicating selling pressure primarily from the mining community for the reasons mentioned above. As noted earlier, a supply shock could materialize if demand remains high despite this pressure; otherwise, a repeat of the July cycle might occur. Interestingly, October has seen a notable uptick in ETF inflows, suggesting growing retail interest. Source : BGeometrics Furthermore, BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings have exceeded 400K BTC, reaching 403,725 BTC, worth $26.98 billion. Over the past two weeks alone, BlackRock has purchased 34,085 BTC, valued at $2.3 billion. This indicates that institutional demand is surging, reinforcing AMBCrypto‚Äôs initial hypothesis of a brewing supply shock. Read Bitcoin‚Äôs [BTC] Price Prediction 2024‚Äì2025 While the current consolidation is crucial for preventing BTC from faltering, a consistent balance between demand and supply will ultimately determine whether BTC can reach a new ATH before the end of this quarter. Regardless, the miner capitulation highlights the effects of the post-halving environment; their exit now requires a more sustained buying effort at current prices. While a slight retracement may occur, a full-fledged pullback seems unlikely.

Title: The Green New Scam Is Dying
URL: https://activistpost.com/2024/10/the-green-new-scam-is-dying.html
Time Published: 2024-10-27T14:08:08Z
Full Content:
October 27, 2024 Authored by James Rickards via DailyReckoning.com It‚Äôs no secret that the vast majority of the so-called elites are advocates of climate alarmism and are taken in by the Green New Scam. Whether this preference is based on ignorance of the science, ideological zeal, a willful desire to hurt American growth or simple greed because of their investments in Green New Scam infrastructure varies case by case. The typical upper-income supporter of the climate cult including academics, media figures and celebrities is probably ignorant of the fact that there is no evidence that CO2 emissions cause climate change and that the real causes are solar cycles, volcanoes, ocean currents and atmospheric moisture not caused by humans. The historical record actually demonstrates that warming periods produce higher CO2 levels ‚Äî not the other way around. CO2 doesn‚Äôt cause warming. It‚Äôs caused by natural warming. In other words, climate alarmists have causation completely backward. Climate alarmism is based almost entirely on computer models, which depend on the inputs the modelers themselves build into them. A model is only as good as the inputs and assumptions programmed into it. Virtually every one of these models has overestimated warming, sometimes by orders of magnitude, because it‚Äôs based on faulty assumptions that overestimate the impact of CO2 on climate. In other words, it‚Äôs junk science. But they keep relying on these models because their political agenda requires it. There‚Äôs no doubt that a fair number of neo-Marxists embrace the climate scam because they know it damages U.S. industry, raises costs to U.S. consumers and helps to undermine the U.S. economy. Following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of communism, anti-capitalistic collectivists admitted that they needed to promote the climate agenda because the only way to combat global warming is through collective action. It requires a coordinated global effort that limits national sovereignty. The neo-Marxists are impervious to evidence; they just want to hurt America and wasting money on windmills instead of building new refineries is a good way to do it. That leaves the greed crowd. They‚Äôre early investors in windmills, solar modules, lithium car batteries, EVs, charging stations, carbon credits and other infrastructure of the climate scam. They stand to make billions of dollars off the narrative with help from extravagant government subsidies. They don‚Äôt really care if it all collapses in the end (which it will) as long as they get rich at taxpayer expense in the meantime. All of this behavior is clear as far as it goes. What is not clear is the extent to which the Green New Scammers are doing this with your money. The best example is multibillionaire Larry Fink, who runs the giant BlackRock investment fund. Fink has been aggressive in promoting the climate scam along with racial quotas, DEI and defunding police. He‚Äôs entitled to his opinions. But is he entitled to pursue his radical agenda with pension fund money from conservative states and institutions? Fortunately, a backlash has begun against Fink and his fellow wokesters. More state pension fund managers are beginning to pull their funds from BlackRock and other investment managers that pursue far-left policies not in the best interests of their beneficiaries. This backlash may not change Larry Fink‚Äôs lifestyle. But over time, it might change the world for the better. A major part of the climate agenda includes electric vehicles (EVs). I‚Äôve been warning for years that EVs aren‚Äôt feasible as a transportation solution for more than relatively few Americans and that they are little more than glorified golf carts despite the $70,000-and-up price tags. In the first place, EVs don‚Äôt cut carbon emissions. The car itself does not have emissions, but it‚Äôs charged with electricity from power plants that do. The batteries are made with poisonous chemicals and metals including lithium, cobalt, copper and nickel that come from mining operations that use enormous amounts of water and electricity to extract the needed materials. It takes thousands of tons of ore to extract enough critical minerals to make one battery. EVs don‚Äôt take a charge in extreme cold, and the batteries can‚Äôt hold a charge. Travel range is grossly overstated for many reasons, including the fact that EV car heaters drain the batteries (with internal-combustion engines, ICEs, the engine makes heat which can easily be directed into the car to keep passengers comfortable with no additional energy required). Resale values of EVs are close to zero because buyers of used EVs have to shell out $25,000 or more for new batteries after the vehicle is about seven years old. The list of drawbacks goes on. Most Americans have resisted EVs because they understand the disadvantages. But many Americans were drawn to the false promise of emission-free transportation and other ridiculous claims by the Green New Scammers. Now even the most committed EV buyers are waking up. A fairly recent survey by consulting firm McKinsey and Co. shows that 29% of EV owners in nine major economies want to return to ICE vehicles. When the sample is narrowed to just the U.S., 46% of those surveyed want to return to ICEs. The McKinsey officials who conducted the survey claimed to be ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù by those results. That probably says something about the fact that McKinsey experts were just as deluded about EVs as the buyers surveyed. When breaking down the results, 45% say EVs are too expensive, 33% say they have charging concerns and 29% are concerned about the limited driving range. The truth is that the EV was invented in 1837 and reached the peak of its popularity in 1910 just before the mass production of internal-combustion cars by Henry Ford. The American public got it right when they flocked to the Model T. It sounds like they‚Äôre getting it right again after a brief infatuation with the false promise of the EV. The bottom line is that the Green New Scam is falling apart. It can‚Äôt happen soon enough. Sourced from ZeroHedge Become a Patron!

Title: Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI): An Unstoppable Stock That Could Make You Richer

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Unstoppable Stocks That Could Make You Richer. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) stands against the other unstoppable stocks. In the current climate of extreme market volatility, finding safe and stable investments is challenging. Valuations seem overstretched following one of the longest bull runs, with major indices reaching record highs. Despite this, the focus should remain on stocks of companies with strong fundamentals and solid long-term prospects. Similarly, it's crucial to consider companies that can withstand uncertainties caused by various headwinds, such as rising geopolitical tensions, the US election, and the high interest rate environment. While the recent Federal Reserve rate cut, declining inflation rates, and a prolonged bull market have benefited investors, not all stocks are responding uniformly. READ ALSO: 8 Worst Performing Tech Stocks in 2024 and 10 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2024. As the US election approaches, economic issues remain the primary concern for most voters. Despite the equity market's upward trend, the US economy has experienced several shocks, including slowdowns in the labor and real estate markets. Although inflation has decreased from a high of 9.2% to 2.4%, the Federal Reserve had to cut interest rates by 50 basis points to prevent a recession. "Even as the data shows inflation has theoretically been slowing down, it has become more important in people's minds over the course of the last three quarters, not less important," said Jay Campbell, partner at Hart Research, the Democratic pollster for the survey. The significant drop in inflation has coincided with higher growth expectations, driving upward momentum in the equity markets. Strong macroeconomic data, such as impressive GDP and retail sales figures, have supported these growth expectations. Amid these expectations, bond yields have increased, indicating that investors are selling safe-haven assets. Economists at Goldman Sachs suggest that the rise in yields is due to promising growth prospects rather than factors like the anticipation of Donald Trump's potential presidency or concerns about the Fed's rate cuts causing inflation to spike again. "Yields have risen significantly over the past several weeks, which we find has owed primarily to continued strong U.S. growth momentum rather than shifts in election odds," Goldman said in a recent note. Conversely, escalating trade and tariff tensions between the US and China pose a threat to market sentiment. The International Monetary Fund has warned that these tensions could have costly economic consequences globally. "We are seeing geopolitically driven trade around the world, which is why when you look at overall trade to GDP that's holding up fine, but who's trading with whom is certainly changing," said Gita Gopinath, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to CNBC on October 23, 2024. In response to perceived unfair trade practices by Beijing, the US and EU have increased tariffs on certain Chinese goods, further escalating trade tensions this year. Despite rising geopolitical tensions, long-term investing remains the best strategy for building a profitable portfolio and sustaining growth over time. Key factors to consider include investing in businesses rather than just share prices, understanding the underlying business, and consistently investing during both market highs and lows. Our Methodology For this article, we identified approximately 20 stocks with a year-to-date share price gain of over 30% as of October 25 and an average analyst price target upside of at least 30%. We then narrowed the list to the 8 stocks with the highest average analyst price target upsides, ranking them primarily by upside potential and secondarily by year-to-date gains. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Average Analysts Upside Potential as of October 25: 33.40% Year-to-date gains: 66.89% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47 Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an unstoppable stock that could make you richer as it is developing high-performance server and storage solutions that are in high demand amid the artificial intelligence race and digital revolution. It is turning out to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom as it makes computers that companies use as servers for data storage. At the start of 2024, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) held just 6% of the worldwide server market. Selling liquid-cooled, high-performance servers for demanding computing tasks has allowed it to carve out a niche for itself. Because of this, Nvidia found Supermicro to be a perfect partner and provided it with top-tier data center GPUs to aid in producing dedicated AI servers. Though not exclusive, its strategic partnership with Nvidia has strengthened its competitive edge in the server market. Super Micro's revenue more than quadrupled from $3.6 billion in fiscal 2021 to $14.9 billion in fiscal 2024, coinciding with the generative AI market's explosive growth. Additionally, its earnings per share (EPS) increased by almost ten times. More than half of its revenue now comes from AI servers. The confirmation that Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is shipping more than 100,000 graphics processing units used for artificial intelligence underlines the strong demand that could translate into billions of dollars in revenues. Like other cloud service providers, Super Micro claimed to have recently installed over 100,000 GPUs with liquid cooling for some of the largest AI factories ever built. The soaring GPU orders are one of the reasons analysts remain bullish about Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), with an average price target of $64.22, implying a 33.40% upside potential as of October 25, 2024. As per Insider Monkey's Q2 2024 database, the company was in the portfolios of 47 hedge funds. Scout Investments, Inc, an affiliate of Carillon Tower Advisers, released a second-quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) was the top detractor to returns in the second quarter. Super Micro designs and manufactures server solutions based on modular and open-standard architecture. This modular approach combined with a strong engineering culture helps the company to supply the market with advanced servers and rack-scale compute solutions quickly. After an impressive return in the first quarter, the company offered disappointing near-term earnings guidance, though we do not believe its long-term opportunity has diminished. We expect continued strong growth for several years, although the range of outcomes is quite wide; it is difficult to forecast AI server market growth with precision." Overall SMCI ranks 8th on our list of the unstoppable stocks that could make you richer. While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SMCI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

ERIC KIM $10T in Blackrock ‚Ä¶ . Larry Fink, BlackRock‚Äôs CEO, has significantly shifted his stance on Bitcoin over recent years. Initially a skeptic, Fink once doubted the value and viability of cryptocurrency. However, he now sees Bitcoin as a ‚Äúlegitimate financial instrument‚Äù and has even labeled it ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù emphasizing its potential as an uncorrelated asset for hedging against economic instability and currency devaluation. Fink believes Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal stems from its liquidity, transparency, and resilience in the face of global financial challenges, making it suitable for investors concerned about economic turbulence or currency devaluation. His support for Bitcoin grew further after BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF launch, which has garnered billions in investor inflows, marking a historic rise and increased legitimacy for the asset. Fink noted that the ETF‚Äôs success exemplifies the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, suggesting that factors like liquidity and transparency will be more critical than regulatory constraints in driving its adoption. This strategic move reflects Fink‚Äôs and BlackRock‚Äôs broader vision to integrate digital assets into mainstream finance . . Here are some notable quotes from Larry Fink on Bitcoin: 1. ‚ÄúI was a skeptic, a proud skeptic‚Ä¶ It is a legitimate financial instrument that allows you to maybe have uncorrelated type of returns.‚Äù ‚Äî Reflecting his changed perspective, Fink described Bitcoin as a valid asset for hedging, especially valuable amid economic or currency instability . 2. ‚ÄúWe believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself.‚Äù ‚Äî In a 2024 earnings call, Fink emphasized Bitcoin‚Äôs emergence as a standalone asset class with growing acceptance and liquidity, suggesting its potential to rival traditional commodities like gold . 3. ‚ÄúI truly don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a function of regulation‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a function of liquidity, transparency.‚Äù ‚Äî Fink argued that Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption will depend more on market dynamics than on regulatory changes, likening its growth to the early mortgage and high-yield markets . 4. ‚ÄúBitcoin is digital gold.‚Äù ‚Äî Embracing Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a store of value, Fink compared it to gold, underscoring its legitimacy and attractiveness for investors seeking alternatives to traditional financial assets . 5. ‚ÄúWe will continue to pioneer new products to be making investing easier and more affordable.‚Äù ‚Äî Fink outlined BlackRock‚Äôs mission to innovate in investment products, including digital assets, aiming to broaden access to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies . These quotes highlight Fink‚Äôs evolution from skepticism to advocacy, positioning BlackRock at the forefront of institutional investment in digital assets.

ERIC KIM Here are some quotes on BlackRock‚Äôs investment in MicroStrategy and cryptocurrency: 1. ‚ÄúBlackRock Inc. has filed an SC 13G/A form‚Ä¶ disclosing ownership of 1,023,418 shares of MicroStrategy‚Ä¶ representing 7.5 percent ownership.‚Äù This reflects a growth in their stake over time, with the latest increase noted in early 2024 . 2. ‚ÄúBlackRock owns a 5.53 percent stake in Michael Saylor-led MicroStrategy, which owns the largest amount of BTC of any company. BlackRock is MicroStrategy‚Äôs largest shareholder,‚Äù marking a significant position in Bitcoin indirectly . 3. ‚ÄúBlackRock‚Ä¶ with over $9.5 trillion under management, is regarded as a leader in the future of investing,‚Äù and is increasingly making moves toward cryptocurrency and blockchain . These quotes showcase BlackRock‚Äôs evolving investment strategy and growing exposure to digital assets, aligning with institutional trends. ‚Ä¶. BlackRock‚Äôs investment in MicroStrategy has evolved significantly over the years, especially as MicroStrategy increased its focus on Bitcoin. Starting with modest holdings in the early 2010s, BlackRock gradually raised its stake as the company‚Äôs profile grew, reaching 1.4 million shares in 2019, a stake valued at approximately $200 million. However, as MicroStrategy shifted heavily into Bitcoin, BlackRock strategically increased its stake, making substantial gains as Bitcoin‚Äôs price surged. By early 2023, BlackRock held about 757,000 shares, representing an 8.1% stake. This position grew further in early 2024 when BlackRock disclosed ownership of over 1 million shares, representing 7.5% of MicroStrategy. This growth illustrates BlackRock‚Äôs interest in cryptocurrency-related investments through indirect exposure to Bitcoin, aligning with the company‚Äôs broader interest in digital assets, including its push to launch a Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) in the U.S. BlackRock‚Äôs increasing investment in MicroStrategy reflects a broader institutional shift toward digital assets, with the company strategically positioning itself as a significant investor in both blockchain technology and the digital asset ecosystem more broadly. This aligns with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink‚Äôs recent statements on the potential of digital currencies to transform financial systems and transactions globally. Sources: ‚Ä¢ Fintel (fintel.io) ‚Ä¢ Market Realist ‚Ä¶ BlackRock has been increasing its stake in MicroStrategy, which has significant holdings in Bitcoin, providing BlackRock with indirect exposure to Bitcoin. As of early 2024, BlackRock reported owning over 1 million shares of MicroStrategy, representing a 7.5% ownership stake, up from 757,000 shares in 2023. This strategic investment aligns with BlackRock‚Äôs gradual embrace of digital assets through indirect holdings and its own initiatives, such as a Bitcoin spot ETF. BlackRock‚Äôs involvement in MicroStrategy reflects a broader institutional trend toward Bitcoin and digital assets as alternative investments .

ERIC KIM December 9-10, 2024;;; Microsoft will buy Bitcoin??? . Microsoft‚Äôs upcoming shareholder meeting on December 9-10, 2024, will include a proposal for the company to consider investing in Bitcoin. This proposal, backed by the National Center for Public Policy Research, advocates for exploring Bitcoin as a treasury asset to hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Proponents argue that Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, offers potential for value preservation in uncertain economic times. Microsoft‚Äôs board, however, opposes the proposal, advising shareholders to vote against it. They argue that the company‚Äôs current investment strategies prioritize stability and risk management, and point out that cryptocurrency‚Äôs volatility could undermine these objectives. Microsoft‚Äôs board asserts that their existing processes for evaluating various assets already include considerations of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, making the proposed assessment redundant. This vote highlights broader debates about cryptocurrency‚Äôs role in corporate finance, with influential shareholders like BlackRock having shown interest in Bitcoin investments. The vote‚Äôs outcome could signal corporate sentiment on Bitcoin adoption among large technology firms, particularly if the proposal gains notable shareholder support despite the board‚Äôs opposition. If adopted, the decision could mark a significant shift, potentially encouraging other companies to re-evaluate cryptocurrency investment strategies in the corporate sector. However, if rejected, it would reinforce the conservative stance many corporations maintain regarding crypto assets due to their inherent risks and market volatility.

Title: Boeing Co (BA): Among the Best Dow Stocks to Buy According to Analysts

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 9 Best Dow Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) stands against the other Dow stocks. Since its introduction in 1896, the Dow Jones has undergone significant changes but remains a popular benchmark for measuring the economy and the overall stock market outlook. While the Index has gained 13% year to date, it has lagged the S&P 500, up by 21% over the same period. The significant underperformance is because the Dow is mostly made up of blue-chip American companies, most of which have come under pressure amid deteriorating macroeconomics. While the Index is mostly made up of financial services companies at 23%, followed by technology at 20%, it has felt the full brunt of deteriorating economic conditions. READ ALSO: 8 Worst Performing Tech Stocks in 2024 and 10 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2024. The U.S. economy is reeling from the effects of high interest rates, resulting in a slowdown in the labour market, and the manufacturing sector has significantly affected the Dow holdings. Additionally, the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have rattled investors' sentiments, resulting in most of them shunning equities in favor of safe havens like bonds and treasuries. The uncertainty around the upcoming U.S. presidential election has only exacerbated the situation, with investors shunning stocks that would be affected mainly by a change of policies once there is a leadership change at the White House. According to analysts at Bank of America, who ends up in the White House and Congress could have a significant impact on critical corners of the stock market. ‚ÄúProfits accelerating are far more important than who is sitting in the Oval Office. But politics can make or break sub-sectors,‚Äù the firm wrote in a research note to investors. Amid the headwinds, the overall equity market has been trading higher, with major indices led by the Dow and the S&P 500 rallying to record highs. The strong gains have come on most companies delivering solid financial results and shrugging off the effects of high interest rates. Nevertheless the rallies have resulted in overstretched valuations, raising serious concerns for the investment community. ‚ÄúThe market had moved into overbought territory, making it vulnerable to anything it perceives as negative ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs now worried that the Fed has not declared victory on inflation, and not to mention, the concerns post-election,‚Äù said LPL Financial chief global strategist Quincy Krosby. A resilient U.S. economy that has steered clear of recession has helped support most stocks in the Dow, helping fuel the upward momentum. The International Monetary Fund thinks growth in the U.S. will remain robust. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF increased its estimate for U.S. GDP in 2024 to 2.8% from its 2.6% forecast in July while raising its 2025 growth forecast for the country. It‚Äôs the only advanced economy with its economic trajectory revised upwards for both years by the IMF. Nevertheless, it has warned of slowdowns in emerging markets. ‚ÄúProjected slowdowns in the largest emerging market and developing economies imply a longer path to close the income gaps between poor and rich countries. Having growth stuck in low gear could also further exacerbate income inequality within economies,‚Äù the IMF warned. With the U.S. economy expected to remain resilient as the Federal Reserve pushes forth with interest rate cuts, Dow stocks that have underperformed are well poised to bounce back. A lower interest rate environment on the back of improved economic conditions heading into year-end would make the case for the best Dow stocks to buy, according to analysts. Our Methodology To compile our list of the best Dow stocks to buy according to analysts, we started by analyzing the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We screened these stocks based on average price targets, focusing on stocks with significant upside potential. Finally, we ranked these companies in ascending order based on their price target upside as of October 23. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A commercial jetliner parked at an airport, reflecting the companies success in aviation. Average Upside Potential as of October 23: 23.74% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 Down by about 50% over the past five years, Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) has lagged the Dow Jones index and the overall market. While the company boasts of a Competitive edge and virtual duopoly in the aerospace industry, a string of quality control and legal challenges have dragged the brand's reputation down the drain. The aerospace giant has struggled with manufacturing problems, management turmoil, and horrible financial results. A string of safety issues touching on aeroplanes has caused Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) to get hit with billions of fines and fees, rattling its sentiments in the market. While employee strikes in recent weeks have exacerbated the situation, the company‚Äôs long-term prospects remain intact, affirming why it is one of the best Dow stocks to buy, according to analysts. Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) and Airbus operate as a virtual duopoly in the large commercial jet aircraft market. It is a significant U.S. military contractor as well. Therefore, there is very little chance that its customers will abruptly stop purchasing its products in the near future. Rival Airbus has such a large backlog that it rejects some orders because it cannot produce the planes quickly enough. Consequently, regardless of its issues, Boeing will always have business at its exposure. Without a doubt, Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) faces difficulties, and it is uncertain if it can finance the next generation of narrow-body aircraft within the next ten years. Nevertheless, its multi-year backlog guarantees its long-term prospects. Likewise, investors rate Boeing as a Buy with an average price target of $197.83, implying a 23.74% upside potential. By the end of the second quarter of 2024, a notable 42 out of the 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had invested in Boeing Co (NYSE:BA). Overall BA ranks 2nd on our list of the best Dow stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of BA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than BA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A packed theater of moviegoers watching a blockbuster film produced by the entertainment company. Average Upside Potential as of October 23: 15.91% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is an entertainment company that produces and distributes film and television video streaming content. It also operates the world‚Äôs largest theme park business, accounting for over 30% of its revenues. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has sought to alleviate concerns about its theme park business by announcing plans to invest $60 billion in the unit over the next 10 years. It plans to introduce four new cruise ships, lands, and rides across its global theme parks. In addition, the company is pursuing growth opportunities around content streaming with its Disney+ streaming service. The unit already has over 118 million subscribers, providing a new avenue for growth, especially in generating advertising revenues. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a well-known brand, and even though the state of the economy has an impact on its short-term prospects, there are many reasons to be hopeful about the long term, particularly if it can continue to turn a profit from its streaming business, which is a challenge for many media companies. While trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 18, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) rewards investors with a 0.93% dividend yield. Additionally, analysts on Wall Street believe it is a strong buy with an average price target of $112.13, implying a 15.91% upside potential. In the second quarter, 92 hedge funds held positions in the company, collectively valuing their stakes at $4.76 billion. The substantial hedge fund interest underscores the company's attractiveness as a stable and promising investment opportunity. Meridian Funds, managed by ArrowMark Partners, released its second quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: ‚ÄúThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) operates a diversified entertainment business with theme parks, media networks, and streaming services. We own Disney because we believe its strong brand, valuable IP, and expanding streaming offerings will drive sustainable long-term growth. The company‚Äôs stock, however, underperformed in the quarter due to concerns about a slowdown in growth at its theme park division. While park revenue still grew by 10% year-over-year, management‚Äôs commentary suggested a moderation in post-pandemic demand and rising costs, leading to a disappointing outlook for park operating income in the second half of the year. This overshadowed the positive news that the company‚Äôs streaming segment, driven by strong subscriber growth at Disney+, reached profitability ahead of schedule. We held our position and will continue to monitor the performance of the theme park division.‚Äù Overall DIS ranks 5th on our list of the best Dow stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of DIS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Informatica (NYSE:INFA) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss. In a recent Tech Check program, CNBC‚Äôs Deirdre Bosa reports on how OpenAI‚Äôs head of Global Affairs is laying out his vision of what the government can do to keep American Artificial Intelligence on top. Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn‚Äôt guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits. READ ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4 As we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it‚Äôs equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries.

The company has launched a new analysis code tool for Claude which is currently in preview, enabling the AI to provide ‚Äúmathematically precise and reproducible answers‚Äù by performing calculations and analyzing data from files such as spreadsheets and PDFs, and that too, with interactive visualizations. ‚ÄúThink of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer. Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data ‚Äî cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result‚Äù. Despite the rapid advancements in AI technology, there are growing concerns about its limitations and potential drawbacks at the same time. In recent news, OpenAI‚Äôs AI-powered transcription tool, Whisper, has been reportedly ‚Äúhallucinating‚Äù. OpenAI may deem it to have near ‚Äúhuman level robustness and accuracy‚Äù, but interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers, and academic researchers reveal that some of the invented text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and even imagined medical treatments.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‚ÄòTransocean Ltd. (RIG) Went Bankrupt But The Stock Rebounded Dramatically From Those Lows‚Äô

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on Tesla and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, emphasized the ongoing significance of fossil fuels in supporting technological advancements, even as investments in renewable energy continue to increase. He stated: ‚ÄúThis is not just a grudge match between the old and the new, a battle of electric vehicles versus internal combustion. The truth is, fossil fuels are essential for a lot more than vehicles, like it or not.‚Äù READ ALSO Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks and Jim Cramer‚Äôs Latest Stock Picks Cramer highlighted the growing energy demands of major tech companies, noting that the data centers they are constructing consume vast amounts of electricity. While these tech giants are making substantial investments in nuclear energy, he pointed out that this power source is unlikely to significantly impact data centers for at least another decade due to the complexities of building nuclear facilities and community resistance to having them nearby. ‚ÄúIf we need more energy, we‚Äôre going to get it from what comes out of the ground ‚Ä¶ fossil fuels that will power the data center, specifically natural gas‚Ä¶ You may be reluctant to invest in it, you might think who cares, but you need to know how vital all of this fossil fuel technology is to the growth of the Magnificent Seven.‚Äù Cramer also reflected on the shift in the U.S. energy landscape, recalling how the nation was once heavily reliant on OPEC for oil imports just two decades ago. Today, he pointed out, the U.S. produces over 13 million barrels per day, making it the largest oil producer globally and a net exporter. He mentioned the Permian Basin's unexpected resilience, continually producing despite earlier predictions of depletion. Cramer noted that the decline of OPEC has transformed the geopolitical landscape. He referenced the 1973 oil crisis, triggered by OPEC's retaliation against U.S. support for Israel, which led to stagflation and economic turmoil. In contrast, he pointed out that despite Israel's current conflict, the U.S. economy is not experiencing stagflation or recession, resulting instead in a bull market. He attributed this stability to the industry, saying: ‚Äú... This industry that spent billions upon billions of dollars to try to be as low carbon as possible is the reason why oil prices have actually come down during this period. They've gotten so much production that OPEC is now powerless.‚Äù Turning his attention to the broader oil industry, Cramer explored the role of oil service companies that facilitate production, including offshore drillers. He recalled becoming optimistic about oil service stocks earlier in the year, anticipating higher energy prices but admitted that this expectation did not materialize due to economic concerns dampening oil and gas markets. Despite current investor reluctance toward oil service stocks, Cramer suggested that sentiment could shift over time, especially because of the Federal Reserve's recent rate cutting. ‚ÄúNow that the FED is our friend and more rate cuts are on the table, that's good news for the industry. I am not worried about the election either. If Trump wins, maybe we're back to that ‚Äúdrill baby drill‚Äù thing. If Harris wins, we get exactly what we've had the last four years. Not ideal for the industry but it's still led to record oil and gas production here in the United States.‚Äù Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episodes of Mad Money on October 23 and 24. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey‚Äôs database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An aerial view of an oil rig with drillers in hard hats working on the platform. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) was recently discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money. Here‚Äôs what he had to say about the company: ‚ÄúWe hardly ever talk about the smaller offshore operators like Transocean, symbol RIG, I always love that‚Ä¶ Transocean has lost money for the past 7 years. Its stock has plunged from $30 a decade ago to just below $4‚Ä¶ in 2020 when oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic. Every major offshore driller except for Transocean went bankrupt but the stock rebounded dramatically from those lows before peaking at eight bucks and changed in the summer of last year. Since then it's pulled back along with energy prices.‚Äù Cramer highlighted the company‚Äôs two impressive eighth-generation drillships that are operational in the Gulf of Mexico. He called them ‚Äútechnological marvels‚Äù. Cramer went on to say: ‚ÄúSecond, Transocean‚Äôs in the news. Last night, Bloomberg reported that the company's exploring a merger with smaller rival, Seadrill. I don't really have much of an opinion on the potential deal but it signifies more confidence in the offshore space than I've seen in over a decade. By the way, of course, the industry needs consolidation. Honestly, this group has been so bad for so long that it's tough to recommend them here but if you strongly believe that the price of oil‚Äôs headed higher next year or the year after then Transocean is a winner. Personally, though, I don't want to bet on that.‚Äù Transocean (NYSE:RIG) offers offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells globally, operating a fleet of mobile offshore drilling units, including ultra-deepwater and harsh environment floaters. The company provides rigs, equipment, and crews to integrated and independent energy companies, as well as government-owned energy companies. On October 23, Bloomberg reported that Transocean (NYSE:RIG) has been engaged in discussions regarding a potential merger with rival offshore drilling contractor Seadrill Ltd. As oil explorers increasingly turn to offshore resources, these talks come at a time when the industry is experiencing renewed activity. Although conversations are ongoing about the possible structure of this merger, no final decision has been reached, and both companies may choose to continue operating independently. Overall RIG ranks 9th on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of RIG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RIG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A drilling rig in the desert with an orange sunset in the background. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41 Cramer called Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) one of the ‚Äúlargest pure-play drillers‚Äù while mentioning that the stock has had a bad year and was down 20%. He further said: ‚ÄúWith Wall Street expecting nearly 9% earnings growth, Halliburton is even more of a bargain trading at eight times next year's earnings estimates even though it's also expected to put up 9% growth in 2025. However, those valuations are only attractive if SLB and Halliburton can make the numbers. Otherwise, their stocks‚Äô going to stay in the doghouse.‚Äù Cramer went on to say: ‚ÄúNow, the other major oil service company, Halliburton reports in two weeks, November 7. This stock has lagged SLB this year because Hal's more levered to the North American market rather than the international markets that are doing better. We'll see what Hal has to say in a fortnight, but if the outlook that SLB just gave us is correct, low growth for international, no growth or declines from North America then Hal should be in worse shape than SLB. Even though Halliburton remains an excellent operator, it's just the wrong business mix for the current environment.‚Äù Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is a major provider of products and services in the global energy sector, specializing in production enhancement, cementing solutions, and comprehensive drilling support. For the second quarter, the company reported total revenues of $5.8 billion, with an operating margin of 18%. During the earnings call, CEO Jeffrey Allen Miller expressed optimism about steady growth for the company throughout the remainder of 2024. Management highlighted strong demand for the company's services in international markets, noting high activity levels and equipment shortages across all major basins. The environment supports expectations of approximately 10% revenue growth for the international business for the full year. However, the outlook for North America presents a different picture, as management anticipates a decline in revenues between 6% and 8% compared to the previous year due to reduced activity levels. Looking ahead to the third quarter, Halliburton‚Äôs (NYSE:HAL) Completion and Production division is expected to experience a sequential revenue decrease of 1% to 3%, with margins projected to drop by 75 to 125 basis points. In contrast, the Drilling and Evaluation division is forecasted to see a sequential revenue increase of 2% to 4%, accompanied by a rise in margins ranging from 25 to 75 basis points.

BlackRock and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will invest in the $1.4 billion IPO, which will be the country's second-biggest stock offering this year, the sources told Reuters. Swiggy, Blackrock and CPPIB did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside business hours. Indian shares have fallen for four weeks in a row, the longest such losing run since August 2023, with the benchmark Nifty 50 index down more than 8 per cent from record highs hit on Sept. 27, due to persistent foreign selling. Hyundai India shares fell 7.2 per cent on their debut last week after retail investors gave a lukewarm reception amid concerns about a lofty valuation. Swiggy, backed by SoftBank and Prosus, was concerned to avoid a tepid response to its relatively large IPO, coming amid global uncertainty from the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, and decided to cut the valuation in consultation with investors, said one source, with direct knowledge of the company's plans. Swiggy does not want a "bad IPO", this person said. Its last funding round, led by Invesco, valued it at $10.7 billion in 2022. It competes with Zomato in India's online restaurant and cafe food deliveries sector, and both have made major bets on a boom in "quick-commerce," where groceries and other products are delivered in 10 minutes. Despite recent jitters, India's IPO market has been buoyant, with around 270 companies raising $12.57 billion so far this year, well above the $7.4 billion raised in all of 2023.

By Aditya Kalra NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian food delivery giant Swiggy has slashed its IPO valuation again, to $11.3 billion, 25% below the initial goal of $15 billion as market volatility and the lacklustre debut of Hyundai (OTC:HYMTF) India weigh on sentiment, two sources said on Sunday.
