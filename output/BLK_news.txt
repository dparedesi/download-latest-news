Crypto pundit Finance Bull has advised XRP investors against selling their holdings now despite the market downturn. This came as the pundit explained that the CLARITY Act could pass next year, which he predicts will positively impact the altcoin’s adoption. In an X post, Finance Bull told XRP investors to think again if they are considering selling their coins right now. He reminded them that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that the CLARITY Act is expected in early 2026, which the pundit indicated will benefit the token when that happens. Finance Bull explained that when the CLARITY Act passes, Ripple will be forced to declare the fate of its XRP in escrow, and that when that happens, the company won’t sell its holdings. Instead, he predicts that they will pre-allocate it to bank corridors, sovereign rails, liquidity hubs powering cross-border settlement, institutional infrastructure, and countries integrating next-generation payment rails. Finance Bull further remarked that this flips the entire conversation, as what looks like overhead supply is already reserved, meaning that XRP won’t face a sell-off as some investors may fear. He added that the real move is locked liquidity flowing into banks, FX routes, and custody frameworks, which would boost the altcoin’s adoption. The pundit stated that this isn’t about market-making but about monetary wiring and that once Ripple releases its official escrow roadmap, the re-pricing will be instant, irreversible, and demand-driven. Interestingly, Finance Bull claimed that BlackRock will be one of the institutions that will adopt the altcoin when there is regulatory clarity through the CLARITY Act. Notably, BlackRock is one of the crypto ETF issuers that has yet to file for a spot XRP ETF, but the pundit has suggested that could change soon. In a press release, Ripple announced a strategic partnership with TJM Investments, providing a boost for XRP’s adoption. The crypto firm stated that under the terms of the partnership, it has invested in THM and will continue to provide best-in-class infrastructure to support TJM’s execution and clearing services. This builds on the existing relationship between Ripple’s multi-asset prime brokerage platform, Ripple Prime, and TJM. Ripple stated that the expanded partnership will enable TJM offer its clients improved capital and collateral efficiency as well as enhanced clearing stability and balance-sheet support. This development comes as Ripple continues to explore ways to enhance the utility of RLUSD and XRP. The firm recently announced plans. The firm recently announced plans to begin testing RLUSD on Base, Optimism, Unichain, and Ink. At the time of writing, the altcoin price is trading at around $1.80, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Texas: Why Not Monetize Everything?

In Greg Abbott’s Texas, everything has a price or makes a profit. Mothers Against Greg Abbott posted this video showing how it’s done. A for-profit online charter school is opening in a for-profit prison whose inmates are families arrested by ICE. The school will be supplied by a giant online corporation called Stride, which used to be K-12 Inc. K-12 Inc. was known for low-quality instruction, low graduation rates, and scandals. Its executives are paid multi-million dollar salaries. It’s ironic that the government is paying Stride to provide low-quality online instruction to hapless children whose families are about to be ousted from America. Peter Greene has the story here. The detention center in Dilley is operated byCoreCivic, a Tennessee-based for-profit operator of prisons, jails, and detention centers. In 2025, they scored $300 million in ICE contracts. CoreCivic was founded as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) in 1983, by Thomas W. Beasley, Robert Crants and T. Don Hutto. Beasley served as the chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party; Crants was the chief financial officer of a real estate company in Nashville; Hutto was the president-elect of the American Correctional Association, and according to a 2018 Time Magazine investigation, ran a Manhattan-sized Tennessee cotton plantation where Black convicts picked cotton for no pay… One of its first big investors was Michael Milken. That investment came a decade after he pled guilty to six felonies in the “biggest fraud case in the securities industry” ending his reign as the “junk bond king.” In 1996, he had established Knowledge Universe, an organization he created with his brother Lowell and Larry Ellison (Oracle), who both kicked in money for K12. Steve Fink, a trusted Milliken confidant and lead independent director of Stride, is the brother of Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of Blackrock, which has been a longtime investor in Stride. In 2011, the New York Times detailed how K12’s schools were failing miserably, but still making investors and officers a ton of money. Former teachers wrote tell-alls about their experiences. In 2012. Florida caught K12 using fake teachers. The NCAA put K12 schools on the list of cyber schools that were disqualified from sports eligibility. In 2014, Packard turned out to be one of the highest paid public workers in the country, “despite the fact that only 28% of K12 schools met state standards in 2011-2012.” In 2013 K12 settled a class action lawsuit in Virginia for $6.75 million after stockholders accused the company of misleading them about“the company’s business practices and academic performance.” In 2014, Middlebury College faculty voted to end a partnership with K12 saying the company’s business practices “are at odds with the integrity, reputation and educational mission of the college.” In 2016 K12 got in yet another round of trouble in California for lying about student enrollment, resulting in a $165 million settlement with then Attorney General Kamala Harris. K12 was repeatedly dropped in some states and cities for poor performance. In 2020, they landed a big contract in Miami-Dade county (after a big lucrative contribution to an organization run by the superintendent); subsequently Wired magazine wrote a story about their “epic series of tech errors.” K12 successfully defended itself from a lawsuit in Virginia based on charges they had greatly overstated their technological capabilities by arguing that such claims were simply advertising “puffery.” Well, who cares? Who cares if Stride-K12 provides high-quality education? So what if it’s a waste of taxpayer money? The “students” are children who are being deported. Their parents are being deported too. Who cares? Thank you, Diane – the real question is how to stop these people so that they can’t revive, like some Dracula. Martha Ture Mt.

The convict lease system was the order of the day when labor was never enough. The labor required to pick enough cotton to be profitable created a permanent underclass n the cotton belt until the advent of the mechanical harvesting of cotton. That underclass included newly freed slaves, whose fate was often to be arrested for misdemeanors and pit into a system designed to trap them and use them for either county finance or personal gain or both. This system largely survived any attempts at reform on a governmental level, but buckled as labor became unneeded. Today a single man sitting in a million dollar machine harvests acres per hour, which makes the use of slave labor and its companion, the worker kept on penury, obsolete. What we have replaced this system with in Core Civic is the monetization of warehousing human beings. If you know a bunch of people on your community, you will probably know someone caught in the web of the system that makes some people wealthy. When it is profitable for people to be put in jail, more people will go to jail. Their presence in jail puts money in a thick wallet, and does not reward the private prison for doing a good job.

Title: A 10-Hour Data Center Outage Is Testing the Ambitions of KKR, GIP
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2025/12/19/851780.htm
Time Published: 2025-12-19T14:15:54Z

Data center operators are fixated on the “five nines” — an expectation that they’ll keep the infrastructure behind financial markets, e-commerce and artificial intelligence running 99.999% of the time. So as news rippled out last month that a CyrusOne facility in Aurora, Illinois, that handles trillions of dollars in trading volume each day went down for 10 hours, industry insiders were stunned. To them, it was an eternity, and the failure at the data center outside Chicago is a black eye for CyrusOne’s backers. KKR & Co. and Global Infrastructure Partners, now a unit of BlackRock Inc., announced their acquisition of CyrusOne in 2021 for $15 billion. They secured billions more in financing for the firm as they deepened their foothold in a booming industry increasingly dominated by the likes of Blackstone Inc. and Blue Owl Capital Inc. Data centers, the physical embodiment of the AI revolution, are one of the hottest bets in private markets. But as the debate rages over whether the boom is a bubble — debt levels and valuations are climbing — the challenges for Wall Street can be much more tangible: from cooling the space to literally keeping the lights on. KKR pursued the investment for years and was the driving force behind the deal as it worked to rope in various bidding partners. CyrusOne touches several of the private equity firm’s major units. Last year, KKR led part of a $7.9 billion loan to the data center operator, co-arranged by its own capital markets team and funded by its Global Atlantic insurance arm alongside some of its clients. And KKR owns its CyrusOne stake through its infrastructure and real estate funds, as well as Strategic Holdings, a unit that holds long-term investments on the firm’s balance sheet. All that cash wasn’t enough to stave off disaster at Aurora, an older property in CyrusOne’s portfolio of more than 55 operational data centers. A series of missteps by facilities workers at a site running on older systems led to a major outage for CME Group Inc. Such incidents typically require the data center operator to compensate the client, according to people familiar with the industry. CME entered a 15-year lease at the Aurora data center in 2016, according to a prior announcement. “They will need to double down on becoming a resilient data center because this is a failure that happened and shouldn’t have,” said Andrej Danis, head of AlixPartners’ Americas telecommunications and digital infrastructure practice. KKR and GIP said they’re confident in CyrusOne’s strategy and that it’s poised to benefit from growing demand. “Under our ownership, CyrusOne has accelerated its expansion, enhanced its competitive position while deepening its commitment to innovation, and reinforced its standing as a premier developer and operator of mission-critical data centers,” Waldemar Szlezak, KKR’s global head of digital infrastructure and a CyrusOne board member, said in an emailed statement. Will Brilliant, GIP’s global head of digital infrastructure and a CyrusOne board member, echoed Szlezak’s remarks in a separate statement. “We fully support CyrusOne, as we have done throughout our ownership, to invest significant resources to maintain a leading position as a provider of critical data center development and operations services for its customers,” Brilliant said. For Wall Street, the stakes are high. Data centers are a key focus for KKR’s infrastructure business, one of the fastest-growing and best-performing strategies for the firm, which is led by Co-Chief Executive Officers Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall. GIP, which announced in October that it was making a bet on developerAligned Data Centers, is central to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s ambitions to expand the $13.5 trillion money manager beyond its stock-and-bond roots into more lucrative realms. n backing CyrusOne, KKR and GIP took on a dot-com-era company with a complex history. Cincinnati Bell acquired the firm from Abry Partners, before spinning it off. CyrusOne then made strategic takeovers of data centers from other companies through deals with firms including Cervalis, Sentinel Data Centers and Zenium. The Aurora data center, acquired through a sale-leaseback transaction with CME, gave CyrusOne a foothold in financial services. Knitting together assets from various deals was a complicated undertaking. As a public company, CyrusOne was wrestling with activist investor Jana Partners and leadership turnover. After longtime CEO Gary Wojtaszek departed in 2020, the company was run by a variety of successors with short tenures. They include Tesh Durvasula, an interim CEO for less than a year; Bruce Duncan, who had no prior data center experience; and David Ferdman, a co-founder who was asked to return to lead the company through the latest ownership transition. While CyrusOne received interest at various points from about a dozen parties, some prospective investors were discouraged by the management churn. Blackstone evaluated the company but never entered serious discussions, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the talks were confidential. Blackstone declined to comment. After KKR and GIP swooped in, they took board seats and installed Eric Schwartz as CEO. Schwartz was comfortable maintaining a lower profile than other data center CEOs, industry associates said. And he stuck with decisions that had been made before him, including one to outsource facilities operations at roughly 50 North American data centers to Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. That move, set in motion by Wojtaszek, divided top executives, according to a person familiar with the matter. Some argued it would help the firm offer a standardized playbook across properties, while others worried it would erode the quality of service, people said. Rivals such as QTS don’t outsource facility operations, other people said. Wojtaszek didn’t reply to messages seeking comment. Some would-be tenants opted to take their business elsewhere in part because they weren’t comfortable with CyrusOne having fewer in-house boots on the ground in case of an emergency. CyrusOne maintains oversight of operations at its data centers while tapping third-party personnel for support, another person said. Other data center companies have such arrangements, too. Industry executives said the shift showed how CyrusOne was moving further away from its roots as a data center operator to become more of an asset-gathering operation to benefit financial backers. KKR and GIP’s arrival accelerated changes at CyrusOne. The company focused on building from the ground up — and at scale. It benefited from a push by big technology firms to tap data center landlords for infrastructure and power to train AI models. But even with the AI boom in full swing, CyrusOne fell behind in market share to more dominant players like QTS in recent years, according to some industry rankings. Things came to a head at the Aurora data center on Thanksgiving, when a cascade of missteps by workers there collided with the reality that the roughly two-decade-old facility ran on outmoded architecture and didn’t automate critical functions. A day earlier, onsite staff and contractors switched the data center’s cooling towers, which keep the machines from overheating, to a new operating mode to prepare them for cold weather, according to a confidential report reviewed by Bloomberg. That transition failed to adhere with protocol and higher temperatures overwhelmed the cooling system. A spokesperson for JLL did not have immediate comment when reached by email. Initial remediation work only made the problem worse, according to the report. As heat built up, the chips and computers powering critical market functions couldn’t operate. Industry executives said the incident shows what can happen when data centers use outdated cooling technology and lack both the basic automatic controls for temperature and automation systems that can override human lapses. Meanwhile, CME didn’t have the ability to keep trading functions up and running seamlessly and opted against initiating a complex disaster recovery plan to shift operations to a secondary data center in the New York area. The money managers behind CyrusOne remain all-in on the AI boom. KKR recently struck a deal with Compass Datacenters to take a stake in a pool of data centers. Last year, the firm reached a $50 billion pact with Energy Capital Partners to develop data centers decked out with power sources so they can reduce their reliance on the grid. The duo announced earlier this year that their first project would be a $4 billion data center in Bosque County, Texas, built by CyrusOne and ECP.

Title: Here’s How Much % Of Bitcoin Supply Is Currently Sitting In Losses

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. On-chain analytics platform Glassnode has revealed the number of Bitcoin supply that is currently sitting at a loss. This comes as the BTC price continues to trade below the psychological $90,000 level following its crash, which began last month. In a report, Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin supply in loss has risen to 6.7 million BTC, marking the highest level of loss-bearing supply observed in this cycle. The analytics platform further noted that this represents 23.7% of the circulating supply, which is currently underwater. 10.2% of this supply is held by long-term holders and 13.5% by short-term holders. Glassnode stated that this distribution suggests that, much like in prior cycle transitions into deeper bearish regimes, the loss-bearing Bitcoin supply accumulated by recent buyers is gradually maturing into the long-term cohort. Meanwhile, the analytics platform noted that the 6-7 million range, which has been at a loss since mid-November, mirrors early transitional phases of prior cycles, where mounting investor frustration came before a shift toward more bearish conditions and intensified capitulation at lower Bitcoin prices. Notably, the Bitcoin price has dropped to levels last seen in 2024, erasing its year-to-date (YTD) gains. Glassnode stated that this has left behind a dense supply cluster accumulated by top buyers in the $93,000 to $120,000 range. The resulting supply distribution is said to reflect a top-heavy market structure where recovery attempts are capped by heavy overhead sell pressure, especially in the early stages of a bearish phase. Glassnode declared that as long as the Bitcoin price remains below this range and fails to reclaim key thresholds, most notably the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis at $101,500, the risk of further corrective downside persists. Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin spot market flows continue to reflect an uneven demand profile across major venues. The Cumulative Volume Delta bias is said to show periodic bursts of buy-side activity, but has failed to develop into sustained accumulation, especially during the recent BTC price pullbacks. The on-chain analytics platform noted that the Coinbase spot CVD remains relatively constructive, indicating steadier participation from US-based investors. On the other hand, Binance and aggregate Bitcoin flows remain choppy and largely directionless. Glassnode stated that these dispersion points point to selective engagement rather than coordinated spot demand. Meanwhile, the platform alluded to recent Bitcoin price declines, which it pointed out have not triggered decisive expansion in positive CVD. Glassnode noted that this suggests dip-buying remains tactical and short-term. In the absence of sustained accumulation across all venues, Bitcoin’s price action continues to rely more on activity in the derivatives market and liquidity conditions rather than organic spot demand. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $86,800, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Share this article Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer for global fixed income, is set to be interviewed for the role of Federal Reserve chair at Mar-a-Lago in the final week of the year, CNBC reported Friday. Rieder has spent more than a decade at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Like CEO Larry Fink, he has shifted from early skepticism about crypto to a more pragmatic stance, increasingly framing digital assets as part of a modern portfolio. In public remarks, Rieder has said investors should consider allocating a portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin, describing it as a potential store of value alongside assets such as gold. The Fed chair is one of the most influential positions in global finance, responsible for setting US monetary policy and regulating the nation’s banking system. While Jerome Powell’s term as chair officially ends in mid-May 2026, the succession process is already underway. Trump is currently interviewing finalists, including Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, and Rieder. The president expects to announce his nominee in late 2025 or early 2026.

Title: The Asset Layer of the Web: Tokenization Is Becoming Finance’s New Backend Infrastructure
URL: https://hackread.com/asset-layer-web-tokenization-backend-infrastructure/
Time Published: 2025-12-19T11:42:26Z

Retail trading and price swings have defined the public view of cryptocurrency for nearly ten years. Yet, as news outlets tracked market cycles, a structural overhaul took hold in the background that went largely unnoticed. The industry has quietly transitioned from a speculative ecosystem into the infrastructure layer modernizing global finance. This new backend, often described as the “asset layer of the web,” is upgrading the financial system by moving value from slow, siloed legacy databases to instant programmable blockchains. Market data confirms this shift is operating at scale. By December 9, 2025, the total value of stablecoins had climbed nearly 50% for the year to reach a capitalization of $312.55 billion. This surge indicates that digital value transfer is no longer experimental; it is the preferred rail for a significant portion of global liquidity. This institutional maturity was the central theme at Binance Blockchain Week 2025. Industry leaders convened not to discuss token prices, but to analyze how blockchain is functioning as a settlement engine for the real economy. During the Digital Money at Scale panel, Reeve Collins, Co-founder and Chairman of STBL, captured the essence of this utility-driven shift. “Stablecoins are simply a better way to move money globally, instantly, and for free,” Collins noted. His observation highlights the core utility driving adoption: efficiency. While price action draws attention, the true revolution lies in the friction reduction for moving capital across borders. Institutions are moving on-chain to solve specific operational inefficiencies inherent in legacy systems like SWIFT or the DTCC. Traditional finance often relies on a T+2 settlement cycle, where funds and assets take days to clear. The Asset Layer offers a solution through tokenization, converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. This allows for instant settlement, 24/7 liquidity, and programmable ownership logic. This demand for efficiency has triggered an explosion in real-world assets. The market cap for tokenized RWAs has reached $18.25 billion, representing a massive, nearly 230% growth. Furthermore, the number of investors utilizing these instruments has widened, with 564,846 holders now owning tokenized assets ranging from private credit to treasury bills. Institutional portfolios are reflecting this change. A recent State Street study indicates that while institutions currently hold approximately 7% of their portfolios in digital assets, this figure is projected to rise to 16% within three years. Asset managers are moving faster than asset owners, recognizing that tokenization is arguably the most significant evolution in market infrastructure since the introduction of electronic messaging in the 1970s, a sentiment echoed by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Critically, this infrastructure is already handling volumes that rival traditional clearing houses. During the Binance Blockchain Week panel, Zach Witkoff, Co-Founder and CEO of World Liberty Financial, highlighted a specific use case involving the client that proves the technology’s readiness for high-stakes finance. “USD1 was used to settle the largest transaction in crypto history, MGX investing in Binance,” Witkoff stated. “Five years ago, no one would’ve imagined a $2 billion deal settling in stablecoins.” This transaction serves as a proof point that blockchain rails are now capable of settling billion-dollar institutional deals with speed and finality that legacy banking rails struggle to match. For years, the technology to modernize finance existed, but the requisite trust did not. Major payment networks and banking giants hesitated to fully commit to blockchain rails due to regulatory ambiguity. That hesitation is now dissipating as major jurisdictions implement comprehensive legal frameworks. The regulatory landscape has shifted dramatically with the passage of legislation such as the US GENIUS Act and the implementation of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. These frameworks provide the legal certainty institutions require to treat tokenized assets as legitimate financial instruments rather than gray-market experiments. This clarity allows legacy players like Visa and Amex, which previously faced crippling diligence hurdles, to integrate stablecoins and tokenized assets into their product suites. Reeve Collins addressed this evolution directly during the panel, arguing that the barrier to entry was never technological. “The only real difference between 2018 and now is the regulatory landscape,” Collins explained. “That’s what held tokenization back, not the technology.” With rules of the road now established, corporate balance sheets are increasingly comfortable with digital asset exposure. While risks such as smart contract vulnerabilities and liquidity fragmentation remain, regulated structures compliant with MiCA are mitigating these concerns, effectively granting permission for the world’s wealth to migrate on-chain. The rise of tokenization signals the end of the separation between crypto markets and traditional markets. In the near future, there will likely be only markets, all running on a unified blockchain backend that offers superior transparency and efficiency. Just as the internet protocol TCP/IP runs invisibly beneath the web, tokenization is becoming the invisible standard for value transfer. The focus will shift away from the underlying technology to the products it enables, such as instant cross-border payments, yield-bearing stablecoins, and globally accessible capital markets. The infrastructure is built, the regulations are in place, and the asset layer of the web is now open for business. (Photo by Shubham Dhage on Unsplash) Your email address will not be published.

Title: Deportation, Inc.

Time Published: 2025-12-19T11:00:00Z

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED The true cost of fulfilling Trump’s mass deportation agenda and who’s profiting. The most defining feature of Donald Trump’s first year back in office has been the brutality of his deportation machine and his administration’s numerous attempts to upend due process. Back in March, the Trump administration wrongly deported Kilmar Ábrego Garcia to a notoriously violent prison in El Salvador. Ábrego Garcia’s legal status protected him from deportation to his home country for fear of persecution. “I think most Americans are intelligent enough to recognize that everybody deserves due process,” says Ábrego Garcia’s attorney Benjamin Osorio. “There’s a process. They get a jury of their peers. And the same thing in immigration: This guy had a lawful order protecting him from being removed from the United States, and the government violated that.” This week on The Intercept Briefing, host Akela Lacy speaks to Osorio about Ábrego Garcia’s case. After months of being shipped around detention centers, he is free and fighting deportation orders from home with his family. “I think the courts have probably never seen more immigration habeases in their life.” says Osorio. “In the habeas sense, I would think that Kilmar’s case has had a lot of effect in the immigration practice.” Ábrego Garcia’s story epitomizes the unlawfulness and cruelty of the Trump administration’s deportation agenda and for that reason his story has become a political flashpoint. But what’s less understood is the scale and scope of fulfilling the administration’s vision of mass deportation. A new investigative video series from Lawfare and SITU Research called “Deportation, Inc.: The Rise of the Immigration Enforcement Economy,” maps out a vast web of companies that make up the rapidly growing deportation economy, how we got here, and the multibillion-dollar industry driven by profit, political power, and a perverse incentive structure. “The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 was a pivotal moment. It was a major restructuring of immigration, and that was also a point at which the framing of immigration went from more of a civil matter to more of a national security concern,” says Tyler McBrien, managing editor of Lawfare. “And with that transition, the amount of money and contracts began to flood in.” Gauri Bahuguna, deputy director of research at SITU, adds, “It was in the Obama administration where the detention bed quota comes in, and that’s really the key unit of measurement that drives this particular part of the immigration enforcement industry, is ‘How much money can you make per detained individual?’” “Even though the bed quota is gone formally from the law there, it still exists in contracts with companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group,” says Bahuguna. “There is payment for detaining a certain number of people, whether or not the beds are occupied, and then the perverse incentive to keep those facilities filled because there’s an economies of scale.” McBride underscores that the current immigration system is “treating people as these products and units and to maximize profit.” Listen to the full conversation of The Intercept Briefing on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen. Akela Lacy: Welcome to The Intercept Briefing, I’m Akela Lacy. The most defining feature of Donald Trump’s second term so far has been the brutality of his deportation machine, from masked agents tackling people in the streets to shipping people off to prisons in far-flung countries. The Trump administration wrongly deported Kilmar Ábrego Garcia to a notoriously violent prison in El Salvador back in March. But last week, a judge’s order finally freed him. Kilmar Ábrego Garcia: [Speaking in Spanish] Interpreter: I stand here today with my head held up high. AL: That’s Ábrego Garcia speaking at a press conference after his release, joined by advocates and an interpreter at his side. KG: [Speaking in Spanish] Interpreter: Regardless of this administration, I believe this is a country of laws, and I believe this injustice will come to its end. AL: Ábrego Garcia is now back in Maryland with his family and is continuing to fight deportation orders. His story epitomizes the unlawfulness and cruelty of the Trump administration’s deportation agenda. Joining me now to update us on Ábrego Garcia’s case is one of his lawyers, Benjamin Osorio. Benjamin, welcome to The Intercept Briefing. Benjamin Osorio: Thank you. AL: Kilmar Ábrego Garcia was released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement — ICE — custody last Thursday. To start, can you tell us how he’s doing since his release? Benjamin Osorio: He’s pretty tired. I don’t know if you saw when he went to go check in with ICE that morning, it looked like he hadn’t slept. I think he’s exhausted from the whole process. He’s bounced around from being deported in March to detained at CECOT — obviously, he’s much happier to be out of CECOT and back in the United States. But then, re-detained again, briefly out for a weekend, back in ICE detention, and then now out. He’s ecstatic to be with his family, but at the same time, I mean, he’s still limited in what he can do and obviously still facing federal charges. AL: During the press conference when he spoke after his release, during the segment where an advocate and a pastor are speaking, you can see him visibly getting emotional. It seemed like he was tearing up. Has this episode changed him? Benjamin Osorio: I didn’t know him before, so it’s hard to say whether it’s changed him, but again, somebody having been through what he has been through, I don’t know how it could not. At this point, if I was him, I would just want resolution to everything and not be in detention. AL: Back in March, Ábrego Garcia was detained by ICE in Baltimore, as you’ve mentioned, and then within a few days he was sent to CECOT, the notorious prison in El Salvador. What can you tell us about his experience in CECOT? Benjamin Osorio: Well, it’s been reported, so this isn’t anything confidential or of that nature. But he was taken off the plane and beaten — that’s sort of their welcome greeting — was beaten as he was taken off the plane. And then their heads were shaved. They were basically beaten on a daily basis, from what it sounds like. They were put on their knees for long periods of time, and if you passed out, you were beaten. They were not allowed to go to the bathroom — many of them urinating on themselves, defecating on themselves. He would talk about, in the middle of the night, you would hear people screaming out for help and nobody doing anything. The lights on 24/7 — blinding lights. Sleeping on all metal beds: no sheets, no pillows, no nothing like that. So it doesn’t sound like a pleasant experience. AL: How did that compare to his experience at the ICE detention facilities that he was shuffled around to? BO: He’s been segregated from everybody else, so not the same group housing that you would typically find in ICE. But being in solitary and only interacting with other individuals for certain hours of the day also has a detrimental effect on your morale and psyche. AL: Of course, yeah. BO: ICE conditions aren’t good, but again, better than CECOT. AL: Can you remind us, for people who might not know the full story, from the beginning of this ordeal, what happened to him? What was the process? Why was he moved to these different centers, and what happened there? BO: Since he’s been back in the United States, he was paroled back in when he was brought back in. He’s been shuffled back and forth between both immigration and criminal custody. So that’s been one of the reasons that he’s been moved back and forth. He was taken out to Tennessee, staying in a Putnam County Jail there, while they were arraigning him on the federal charges and then figuring out whether he was going to be released on bond. Once he was released on bond, he was then re-detained by Baltimore [Enforcement and Removal Operations] and then taken down to Farmville [in Virginia]. The judge in the federal district court case had ordered him to be kept within 200 miles, and then they transferred him from Farmville to Moshannon detention center [in Pennsyvlania]. And that’s where he was released from recently. AL: Can you talk a little bit about the legal strategy of these dueling, federal attacks against him — both on the immigration front and the criminal front — and how that complicated his situation? Benjamin Osorio: I guess, let’s talk about the three-front war, right? So he’s got an immigration case, which is pending before the immigration court. He then also has the habeas case, which — even though he’s out now — continues because of some of the things that have happened in the immigration case that’s taking place in the federal district court in Maryland. And then he’s got the criminal case taking place in federal district court in Tennessee. So he’s got a criminal defense team working on the criminal case. He also has us, who are partnered with Quinn Emanuel working on the district court litigation. And then he has us just working on the immigration court litigation. “Typically before the Trump second administration, you were not seeing these third-country removals that you’re seeing now.” So it’s kind of messy, but what he was granted before is called withholding of removal. Typically before the Trump second administration, you were not seeing these third-country removals that you’re seeing now. So if you won withholding of removal, they can’t remove you to your home country, but they can remove you to a third country. So let’s say that he has this protection from El Salvador, they were not supposed to have been able to send him to El Salvador, but they could send him to Mexico, to Honduras, to Guatemala as part of these third-country agreements. They could do that. He would be a very visible candidate for them to try to go after to do that. We feel that we also were fighting the immigration case to try to normalize his status, get that back reopened, and adjust his status. Now when they paroled him back into the United States, they also created some new immigration options for him as well, potentially applying for asylum because he’s back within one year of having entered the United States, but also he’s married to a U.S. citizen. So now that he has a lawful entry back into the United States, he could potentially adjust status through her. So it’s messy. And obviously, the government has put the full force of DOJ and DHS behind it to try to make an example of him. “The government has put the full force of DOJ and DHS behind it to try to make an example of him.” AL: You mentioned like his particular circumstances made him the perfect target for this administration and what they’re trying to do. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about that and how his case became a flashpoint in this administration’s immigration policies. This was the case that finally pushed Democratic senators to say, “We’re going to go and visit these detainees,” people who have been removed. Why did that happen? BO: I think most Americans are intelligent enough to recognize that everybody deserves due process, right? There’s a reason that if somebody that we all know goes and commits a murder, they still get a trial. We don’t summarily execute them unless they’re a danger to the police officers arresting them or anything else like that. There’s a process. They get a jury of their peers. And the same thing in immigration: This guy had a lawful order protecting him from being removed from the United States, and the government violated that. And so the Constitution is designed to protect us from the government. And so here is the government violating somebody’s due process, violating the Constitution. And I think that’s why people cared about it. I don’t think it was necessarily about Kilmar, or his specific person — or it’s not about whether Kilmar is a good guy or a bad guy. It’s about, the government owes a responsibility to do the right thing, AL: The order to release Kilmar — a federal U.S. district judge in Maryland said that federal authorities lacked a legal basis for continuing to detain him. Has his case changed anything in your view, as far as how judges are handling other similar cases, or how the administration is approaching targeting people like Kilmar? BO: Yes. The federal district courts probably are not fond of how many habeas we filed. But there’s been a change in bond rules too. I’m not sure if you’re familiar with this. In September, there was a case that came out from the Board of Immigration Appeals called Matter of Yajure Hurtado, and it basically tries to change the rules to make so many people ineligible for bond. Because they were trying to change the rules without actually going through Congress to change the law — which actually governs statutes and mandatory detention and who’s eligible for bond — we started filing a ton of habeases. And so I think the courts have probably never seen more immigration habeases in their life. “ I think the federal district courts probably are not fond of how many habeas we filed.” Like I said, they’re probably sick of it, but at the same time, they’ve been great and fast-acting on these habeas. Sometimes a habeas, a normal habeas, could pin for a while. But they’ve been great on ordering either the immigration courts to hold a bond hearing and find a head jurisdiction or beyond that ordering these people released. So in the habeas sense, I would think that Kilmar’s case has had a lot of effect in the immigration practice. AL: What’s next for Ábrego Garcia after his release? Obviously, you mentioned his pending cases. BO: It’s hard to say. We’re still in the middle of briefing both before the immigration side of things, both at the immigration court level because the immigration judge just issued a new order the other day, and then also before the Board of Immigration Appeals. And then because of some of the acts that the board and the IJ have taken — the immigration judge — have taken, now Judge [Paula] Xinis has ordered an additional briefing on the [Temporary Restraining Order] right now in federal district court. Look, I was shocked. People were asking us when we first started if we were going to be able to bring him back. And then I was kind of shocked that Xinis found that he didn’t have a removal order. It’s not something I would’ve predicted in the beginning. But then when there was that hearing a couple weeks ago, and she was talking about there not being a valid order because he was ordered removed to Guatemala. I mean there’s been a lot of different turns here. I think it’s hard to predict what ultimately happens. Like I said, if I’m him, I just want to be out and I want to be with my family, and if that means it’s in Costa Rica or whether that’s here in the United States as long as I’m not detained, I would be happy. AL: Any final thoughts? One thing I would ask maybe if you want to elaborate on is this idea that it doesn’t really matter what kind of person it is when we’re talking about these cases. Like, what matters is the statute and the constitutional protections that are here. And that’s completely at odds with how the administration has framed all of this — that the people it’s going after are criminals who deserve whatever’s coming to them. I think that’s an important distinction, but if there’s any other point that you touched on that you want to elaborate on? BO: I just think it’s funny. I hear different officials go on TV and they say, we’re going after the individuals who are breaking the law, or we’re going after the individuals here who are here unlawfully. But there have been many cases where they are making the people unlawful. So when they take away Temporary Protected Status from people from Haiti and Sudan and from Venezuela, these countries that have ongoing crisis in them, they made them undocumented. And when they say that we want people to do things the right way — look, Congress passed Section 208 [of the Immigration and Nationality Act] and made asylum a lawful pathway. Asylum is a lawful pathway to get status here in the United States. Now, if Congress wants to change the laws, that would be well within their right to do. But until they do that, their attempts to block asylum-seekers and their attempts through different regulatory changes or through the Board of Immigration appeals to whittle away asylum and go after victims of domestic violence — I don’t know, to me, that’s not the American way, and it’s sad that our government is targeting some of the most vulnerable individuals in our society. AL: What else is on your docket right now? BO: It’s pretty crazy, the number of detentions has obviously picked up pretty significantly, and that’s sort of my specialty, is detained removal. “Our immigration system is broken.” It’s just very sad because I see so many families — and families of people with U.S. citizen spouses and families of people with U.S. citizen kids — getting ripped apart. People always ask me, they say, “Why don’t people just do it the right way?” I have friends who are not immigration lawyers or, I’m from Georgia, I have a lot of friends who have maybe very different views on immigration than I have, and they’re like, “They’ve been here for 20 years. Why haven’t they fixed their status?” And I’m like, “Our immigration system is broken. I don’t think you understand like how complicated it is for somebody who’s been here 20 years.” Even if they have a U.S. citizen spouse, if they have more than two entries, they might be subject to a 212(a)(9)(C) and be subject to the “permanent bar.” That means they have to stay outside for 10 years — away from their U.S. citizen spouse, away from their U.S. citizen kids. “People don’t understand like how much damage we’re doing to future generations of Americans.” And then I have other things, where people are active members of this community. I have a family I represent that the U.S. citizen spouse works for a local school board, and they have two small U.S. citizen kids. And it’s sort of complicated, but at one hearing where the judge was ordering him removed, even though we won later on appeal and he’s still here — a 7-year-old girl’s coming up to me. And I have 6-year-old twins. So she’s about my kids’ age, and she’s asking me, “When is Dad going to come home?” And I’m like, “I don’t know. I don’t know.” And so I just think people don’t understand like how much damage we’re doing to future generations of Americans. I don’t think people understand how much damage we’re doing to the economy. I don’t think people understand how much damage we’re doing to the American brand here. AL: Thank you so much for taking the time, Ben. We know you have a lot on your plate, so we really appreciate it. BO: Thank you. AL: After a quick break, we’re going to zoom out and talk about exactly who is profiting from the Trump’s deportation agenda, and take a closer look at what has become a rapidly expanding and lucrative industry. We’ll be right back. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept? By signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Break AL: Welcome back to The Intercept Briefing. The militarization of U.S. borders and immigration policy is a project that’s been long in the making. Bill Clinton: We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of law. George W. Bush: We’re going to get control of our borders. We’re going to make this country safer for all our citizens. Barack Obama: Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws. Unknown: President Obama has deported more undocumented workers than President Bush did. Donald Trump: And we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of the United States. AL: The violent immigration raids we see in communities across the country today could not have happened without the bipartisan efforts of past presidents — those who paved the way for an insatiable immigration bureaucracy and an unhinged administration ready to take it over. As of November, ICE is detaining more than 65,000 people, a historic high, according to The Guardian. Under the guise of protecting national security, officials have transformed U.S. immigration over the last two decades into a cash cow for private corporations. Today, Trump’s deportation machine takes up more than half of all federal law enforcement spending. And Trump’s marquee spending bill raises that to 80 percent. Democratic senators just released a report that found that the Trump administration diverted $2 billion in Pentagon funds to target immigrants, as our colleagues Nick Turse and Noah Hurowitz reported earlier this month. A new investigative video series from Lawfare and SITU Research maps out this vast web that comprises the deportation economy: how U.S. immigration enforcement has evolved into a rapidly growing multibillion-dollar industry shaped by private profit, political power and a perverse incentive structure. Joining me now to talk about this industry are some of the folks behind the project. Tyler McBrien is the managing editor of Lawfare, a nonprofit publication covering law, national security, and foreign policy. Tyler McBrien: Thanks for having me, Akela. AL: And we’re joined by Gauri Bahuguna, a computational designer and deputy director of research at SITU Research, a visual investigations practice in Brooklyn, New York. We’ve worked with SITU on reporting on reconstructions of police responses to protests, it’s great to have you on. Welcome, Gauri. Gauri Bahuguna: Thank you for having me. AL: To start, for both of you, what drove you all to do this project? What did you feel was missing from the public’s understanding of how the system works? GB: This project actually began as far back as 2023, and at the time we were interested in expanding the notion of immigration enforcement beyond the border. So at the time we were looking at the various, the physical, the digital, and the political infrastructures that create this everywhere border, so to speak. And from there, obviously, the election last year was a huge point for us to track and study. The industry part came up in our research of how and why this immigration enforcement seems to be a growing hot- button issue. “We were interested in expanding the notion of immigration enforcement beyond the border.” TM: What we are trying to do with this project is to make visible an entire system, as much as that’s possible. All the facets of the immigration enforcement economy — be it detention, deportation, surveillance, and interdiction — because I’m sure listeners can relate, the past year has just been this feeling of jumping from fire to fire. And you can easily miss the forest for the trees. We wanted to highlight not just these big-name companies that people will be familiar with — the Palantirs, the Googles, even maybe the GEO Groups, the private prisons — but also smaller companies that do food service or IT services that make up these web of contracts for ICE and DHS. AL: Tyler, that’s a good segue because we know that this is obviously a cornerstone of the Trump administration’s agenda, but there’s been a bipartisan effort to build up this machine since long before he first took office, which really accelerated when George W. Bush created the Department of Homeland Security and ICE after 9/11. But what other figures helped drive that expansion prior to Trump? How did we get to where we are today? TM: The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 was a pivotal moment. It was a major restructuring of immigration, and that was also a point at which the framing of immigration went from more of a civil matter to more of a national security concern. And with that transition, the amount of money and contracts began to flood in because of this “higher echelon” issue of national security versus civil enforcement. 2002 was a pivotal moment, but like we said, it was building before that. We really try to convey that in the videos — of having not only Trump on the campaign trail promising the biggest deportation campaign in history, but also dating back to Bush, of course to Bill Clinton, and before. Just to also back up, the framing that we wanted to put forth was that of the military–industrial complex, and throw out this provocation that we may be seeing an immigration–industrial complex following the same dynamics. “The framing that we wanted to put forth was that of the military–industrial complex. … We may be seeing an immigration–industrial complex following the same dynamics.” AL: Gauri, can you talk about the main ways that this deportation economy operates? GB: It was in the Obama administration where the detention bed quota comes in, and that’s really the key unit of measurement that drives this particular part of the immigration enforcement industry, is “How much money can you make per detained individual?” And for now, even though the bed quota is gone formally from the law there, it still exists in contracts with companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group, where there is a minimum quota that ICE must fulfill in order to be in contract with these companies. And any detainees above that minimum guaranteed daily population, they get discounts on. So there is payment for detaining a certain number of people, whether or not the beds are occupied, and then the perverse incentive to keep those facilities filled because there’s an economies of scale. TM: This is another, I think, motivation behind the project is to highlight not only the ideological and political motives of the current immigration system — think Stephen Miller’s vision — but also the profit motive driving this perpetual system. And the upshot of it is something that Gauri just touched on, which is treating people as these products and units and to maximize profit there. AL: Can you talk more about this incentive structure and who is profiting? Like you mentioned, everyone knows Palantir, GEO Group, CoreCivic, and you mentioned there’s some other names that people may not be as familiar with playing a significant role there. But yeah, I’m curious to hear more about who is actually profiting. GB: The main profiteers are those large private prison corporations like CoreCivic and GEO Group, because ICE has different kinds of facilities that range from completely owned and operated by ICE to agreements with the marshals, and then completely contracted detention facility centers. And because of the pricing structure offered by these private companies, it is the lowest price per night per detainee in private detention centers. However, ICE will often work with local and state governments, who then subcontract out to these private companies to detain populations. So what happens is that almost or close to 90 percent of all of the detainee population are held in private prisons because it just makes that much more economic sense. TM: As Gauri said the biggest ones are the private prison contractors. I think the biggest single contractor is GEO Group, which listeners will probably be familiar, but they’re also smaller firms. In surveillance, we have the big names like Google, Palantir, Clearview, but there are also smaller companies, like BI2 Technologies. There are investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard. In the video, we have this map that shows just this web of companies. But I think what was really interesting in doing this project was to come to realize that this analogy between the military–industrial complex and the immigration–industrial complex was sometimes not so much an analogy as just the extension of one into the other. So some of these firms are the same. You have Northrop Grumman, where you have big weapons manufacturers. You have gun manufacturers that are also benefiting. AL: Because they’re arming the guards? TM: Exactly. And arming for some of the immigration raids, so for example, Operation Midway Blitz. AL: Does the incentive structure that you were talking about, Gauri, does that have the potential to limit future avenues for policy change on immigration? And is that already happening? Like the idea that the incentives are built around the fact that this economy already exists and it needs to continue existing or else it’ll be bad for the economy, and does that make it harder to unwind this machine? GB: That’s an interesting question. I think because these are being detailed in the contracts themselves, I would imagine, it is something that could be addressed and there could be safeguards against having these types of quotas. Because again, it is just another expression of the detention bed quota, and they did successfully get that repealed. AL: But the idea that like, even though they repealed that, it’s still part of this structure. Like, the economy is operating with a mind of its own, like outside of the policy sphere. TM: I think that’s the dynamic that we’re warning that is already happening and will continue to happen and further entrench. So if you think about detention, for example, which is the first chapter of the video that we put out. Often companies like GEO Group will have idle facilities that were just a red line on their balance sheet. And now there’s this huge incentive to get these idle facilities up and running — fill the beds. And then the way that it can become entrenched in that community, for example, is then that creates some jobs. And it’s this perverse choice between an economic boon to the local community in some small way versus not having those jobs. And so, you can see how these incentives — these just pure economic incentives — can just keep driving the machine as you said. AL: This is obviously very linked to the broader phenomenon of mass incarceration in the U.S. and the push and pull over cutting the number of people that we have behind bars outside of the immigration system. Did that come up at all in this project? Are there characters or actors who play a major role in building up the carceral system who also play a role in this system? We know private prisons, GEO Group and CoreCivic, are a big part of this, but obviously they don’t incarcerate the majority of people in the U.S. But I’m curious how this came up, if at all, during your research and how you think about the nexus between the U.S. prison system and immigration detention. GB: Yeah, absolutely. They’re so closely tied together because GEO Group, their facilities are both, again, they’re private prisons and also immigrant detention facilities. I believe some of the private prisons were then converted into detention centers. And now because there is this tipping point where there’s just so much more money in this immigration enforcement, you see other actors [are] moving toward that. “The myth really that it creates jobs for local people was something that we found to be not necessarily true in our research.” I also just wanted to note that the myth really that it creates jobs for local people was something that we found to be not necessarily true in our research. And one of our colleagues actually took a road trip through America and visited a lot of these towns that were in close proximity to these facilities. And because of the stop-and-start nature, so sometimes they would be filled, so the detention center was operational, so there were a few jobs given out. Then it would shut down, so they would all lose their jobs immediately. And more recently, with the immigration detention facilities, because of language requirements, they were not even hiring people from the neighboring towns. So it’s not even that there was a direct benefit to the community. AL: That’s really interesting. Did they interview people who lived in the town or where, who were they talking to? GB: Yes, pretty much people in the local watering hole. This is the facility that is also mentioned in the video in Michigan, one of the GEO Group idle facilities that was just recently opened, and I believe it’s the largest immigration detention center in the Midwest. So he was speaking to a lot of people in small towns around that detention center, and they all expressed similar sentiment. AL: I also just want to touch on this idea that ICE and CBP have really exponentially increased the amount of power and influence that they have over not just immigration policy, but our government in general. “ Two small agencies that were intended for a very particular purpose have pretty much become the face of the government at this point.” There’s been so much great reporting on just how much money has been diverted from other parts of the government, or how many agents have been diverted to these agencies to sort of power this machine. But I wonder, can you talk about that phenomenon? Like, these two small agencies that were intended for a very particular purpose have pretty much become the face of the government at this point. TM: Yeah, I guess I don’t want to overstate something that I said earlier about the profit motive and the economic factors driving all of this/ That’s a fear, and something that we’ve been seeing that is driving policy. But of course the political and the ideological motives are also driving this. You see this in the national security strategy that was just released by the administration — that border security and controlling immigration is the national security threat. So you see it elevated in the political arena as well. And then it’s not just the administration. You have Congress to thank for the exponentially higher billions that are flooding into DHS and ICE, who can then award the contracts to these companies. GB: It’s the result of decadeslong lobbying campaigns, right, to push for these harsh immigration laws. So I think there’s definitely the political angle, and also because of how CBP and ICE are allowed to operate, which is slightly different from other law enforcement agencies; they have a lot more leeway. Border Patrol, for example, they have a 100-mile radius within the U.S. border, that they can stop people without a warrant and just question them. I think these types of extra powers make it easier for the conversion or the misappropriation of a military force, so to speak. TM: And just to add one point to what Gauri said about lobbying. If you take GEO Group, for example, their PAC, according to FEC filings, was the first to max out donations to Trump’s 2024 campaign. AL: On this point about this being part of the national security strategy and this lobbying apparatus, this is also a strategy that Trump and his allies want to push beyond the U.S. and into Europe, for example. Can you talk a little bit about that, how the Trump administration is essentially lobbying to export this around the world, export this system around the world? TM: Yeah. I can speak to one aspect of this. Take the video that we put out on detention. We broke it down into three ways in which the detention economy works. One is permanent facilities. We talked a lot about private prisons. One is temporary or soft-sided facilities. But the third that we cover — as a sort of form of outsourcing or contracting — is “alternative jurisdictions,” as we call it. So think El Salvador, CECOT. Think the talk about detaining migrants at Guantánamo Bay. And then of course the system of deportation, these third-country removals, these are transactional often in nature, in terms of what a country would economically benefit very often from receiving migrants from the United States. We wanted to expand the idea of what a contract could be or what this transaction could look like beyond just the U.S. government and a private company in the US. It’s really more expansive than that. AL: Can you talk about how you compiled this project? I know a lot of the information was public or open source, but tell me about your approach. Where did you start? GB: So the first step was to identify who are the main actors within this economy. And that was identified through looking at the budgets and the contracts that you mentioned. This is open-source information. And then after that, we really wanted to understand further how this is exploding as a way. So I think looking for the details within the contracts that really jumped out, like the tiered pricing, for example. And then moving into now, how do you put this all together and visualize it? And I think that’s where we started being a bit more experimental with our research. And so one example is the parametric tool that we use to visualize deployed resources, which is one of the soft-sided detention facility contractors. So just trying to visualize what detention at this scale means because I don’t think that’s something that is particularly present in most of the conversations. So it was a combination of trying to find and really parse through these government contracts and all of this jargon. And then translate it into a way that was, again, paints this picture of it being beyond the border and located to other geographies within the United States. TM: On this parametric tool. I think Gauri and some of her colleagues at SITU really helped understand projections and what these big numbers and big promises would actually mean. “What do these massive numbers mean and what will they continue to mean?” What that gets at is just the reason for contracting in the first place. The government just doesn’t have the capacity to find, detain, and deport the numbers of people that they are setting as a goal. And sometimes not even the single facility or single company that are contracted to do something can do it, which means that there likely will be more contracts and more money going into it. So I think that’s one thing that the SITU team really helped me visualize at least, was, what do these massive numbers mean and what will they continue to mean? AL: Tyler you brought up Stephen Miller earlier. Obviously we’re going to have to talk about him at some point. Top White House adviser Stephen Miller is widely recognized as the brains behind Trump’s deportation agenda. The New Republic’s Greg Sargent had this great piece about his vision earlier this week. He wrote, “Miller’s grander aims are best understood as an effort to destroy the entire architecture of immigration and humanitarian resettlement put in place in the post-World War II era.” I really encourage people to go read this because they interview Miller’s family members and go into like this book that his family member wrote about the immigration apparatus, like when they came to the U.S. Anyway, very interesting. But can you guys talk about Miller, his vision, and how that’s coming to life under Trump’s second term — and how that deviates or doesn’t deviate from lthe post-9/11 vision of this system? TM: I haven’t read the piece, and I can’t believe you’re asking me to crawl into Stephen Miller’s mind. [laughs] AL: Sorry, someone has to. [laughs] TM: I would go back to what I was saying in the past answer, where the way to achieve the scale at which Stephen Miller wants to deport and relocate people again is only achieved through a massive expansion of contracts. And that’s why the funding bill was so material to this. AL: You’re talking about the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” TM: Exactly, yeah. So I think Stephen Miller and even the Trump administration as a whole can announce that they want to hit these benchmarks, but it’s then these contractors who come in. GB: Yeah, I agree with what you said but also wanted to acknowledge the very prominent white nationalist undercurrent of his vision. AL: Yeah. GB: And I think that we can see that play out in how the language of how to describe migrants is very dehumanizing, “illegal aliens.” And it’s just rife with xenophobia in every news coverage. And I think that is moving the country toward a more, or less tolerant overall perspective of what migrants are and specifically which migrants are “good” and worthy of being in this country. And I think that is probably the most scary part of his vision coming to life. TM: Yeah, it’s a great point. We were constantly asking ourselves what part of this system we have today is continuity and what part is rupture. And I think to Gauri’s point, I mean that the rupture is just the destruction of any sort of refugee program, save for white Afrikaners from South Africa, is just a nakedly, racist policy. I think there’s just no other interpretation. AL: You’ve both mentioned this capacity issue — Miller and Trump have these quotas that incentivize these policies, but maybe don’t have the capacity to fulfill that vision, even though they’ve been very successful at it so far. But this brings up this notion that I heard a lot prior to Trump’s election. Policy people and reporters who cover immigration were saying, “Not that this is overblown, but take it with a grain of salt because there is no capacity to do what they’re saying that they want to do.” We’re obviously seeing that not really be borne out right now. But even if there isn’t capacity to achieve their goals, does it matter because of how much they’ve already been able to do? Obviously by diverting money, resources, and agents from all of these other departments, but despite all the handwringing over capacity, like this is still obviously happening in full force. GB: I don’t think it matters that much both for the base that they’re trying to appeal to and also the corporations and individuals involved in this large scale operation. What happens is that yes, it’s completely impossible for them to meet the targets they’re setting for themselves, but in doing so, they create like an urgency and that’s when more of these regulations start to dip and drop. [White House border czar] Tom Homan, for example, has already been calling to reduce the detention standards in ICE facilities, if it’s not permanent facilities, and we go into the tents. And then within the tents again, how much more can you pack in so you squeeze more profit, reduce the living conditions of these places, and then you have a lot more to show for that’s closer to this target, but whether or not they ever reach, it doesn’t matter to the people affected. AL: Right. I want to mention another piece that was recently published. Above the Law published this story about ICE, perhaps, inadvertently, posting a “watchlist” of immigration lawyers. We know the administration routinely attacks its perceived enemies, including immigration attorneys. What do you make of that and how the administration has gone after the legal system to power its agenda? TM: Yeah, I think it’s a clear attempt to reduce the friction that they face in the immigration system. And often that friction is happening in the courts. Some of the biggest administration immigration stories of the year have been about these high profile deportation cases. Kilmar Ábrego García, for example, Mahmoud Khalil, of course. You’re seeing the strategy deployed across other issue areas too. It’s the flip side of the capacity — they’re building out capacity while also trying to reduce the barriers, and most of the barriers are legal ones. AL: Right. GB: Even just in the geographic distribution, it’s again, trying to set up these obstacles for accessing legal counsel. So that’s very intentional, right? They’re extremely rural areas where most of these facilities are. It’s very difficult for people to be in touch with lawyers in facilities like Alligator Alcatraz; there was no access at all. So I think there is this both contempt and disregard for the law, but also intentional fear of limiting access. AL: Given where we are today and how big this deportation economy has grown and how deeply it’s spread its tentacles into all of these other sectors that we’ve touched on, is it possible to unwind this and what would that take? TM: It’s such a hard question. Like I said earlier, we throw out the analogy to Eisenhower’s military–industrial complex farewell speech. I think it’s safe to say that his warning went unheeded, and the military–industrial complex only increased exponentially. Which is one of the reasons we wanted to shift this new warning that, you know, maybe it will be heeded this time. But it is worrying to me because I think you contrast the current moment to the first administration, first Trump administration, where there were sometimes successful worker-organized protests, for example, especially at tech companies. After contracts with ICE were made public, workers came together to protest and sometimes those contracts were canceled. I feel like you’re not seeing the same dynamic here. There is, I guess, some power in the consumer base and if consumers are made aware of companies or investments that they are a part of that are also being used to detain and deport people often illegally, then perhaps there’s some sort of pressure point there. AL: And this reminds me, we didn’t even talk about this. The first anti-ICE protests that we saw under Trump [this term] brought the first National Guard deployment that we saw. And now I feel like people don’t even really — he’s deployed the National Guard to so many cities that people don’t necessarily connect that to that being an effort to tamp down on opposition to this deportation machine. GB: That actually connects quite well to what I’m about to say, which is I am a little skeptical about whether the toothpaste can be put back into the tube just because of how deep these roots have gotten into every part of our daily lives. And so the first pieces were about detention, and we’re going to do one on deportation and interdiction. Then the final one is a data surveillance piece. And I think that is really, that’s where so much money — like far beyond what the deportation and detention is estimated. I think this data surveillance piece is what will ultimately also impact citizens most directly, right? It’s being tested on migrants and then slowly, as you mentioned with the National Guard, it just creeps into daily life and becomes normalized. So I think just because of the, and we see that the large tech companies are also embedded into this administration, so I just feel like we’re moving towards a very dark point of no return. AL: Thank you for using the toothpaste and the tube analogy, because I think that is a perfect analogy for this. It’s not only impossible to do, but it’s very messy. Thank you both for joining me on the Intercept Briefing. This has been a great conversation on a depressing topic, so we really appreciate it. GB: Thank you. TM: Yeah, thanks so much for having us.

What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. This is not hyperbole. Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy. IT’S BEEN A DEVASTATING year for journalism — the worst in modern U.S. history. We have a president with utter contempt for truth aggressively using the government’s full powers to dismantle the free press. Corporate news outlets have cowered, becoming accessories in Trump’s project to create a post-truth America. Right-wing billionaires have pounced, buying up media organizations and rebuilding the information environment to their liking. In this most perilous moment for democracy, The Intercept is fighting back. But to do so effectively, we need to grow. That’s where you come in.

Title: Brad Lander on What It Takes to Win as a Progressive

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access The outgoing New York City comptroller discusses governing on the left, his run for Congress, and why housing and affordability should define the next Democratic fight. Brad Lander, the outgoing New York City comptroller, is running for Congress against Representative Dan Goldman in New York’s 10th District. Brad Lander is leaving his post as New York City comptroller and running for Congress in New York’s 10th District, which includes parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan. A longtime progressive, Lander recently mounted a mayoral bid that finished third in the Democratic primary—but under ranked-choice voting, his cross-endorsement and campaigning alongside Zohran Mamdani helped consolidate progressive support and proved pivotal to Mamdani’s victory. In conversation with Nation president Bhaskar Sunkara, Lander reflects on that race, his years as the city’s chief fiscal watchdog, and the relationship between movement pressure and governing power. —Bhaskar Sunkara Bhaskar Sunkara: You spent over a decade in the City Council. When you look back now, what do you see as the through line of your work during that period that most shaped how you view politics? Brad Lander: You can fight harder, win more, and build a broader coalition when you approach politics as a team sport. When I joined the City Council, we teamed up with the Working Families Party and other allies to create the Progressive Caucus—to bring in the workers, tenants, and community leaders that did not previously have a home in the Council to partner in campaigns for dignity for all New Yorkers. And we did well. We banned stop-and-frisk and strengthened protections for tenants against eviction. We became the first city in the country to guarantee a living wage for Uber drivers and deliveristas, stable schedules for fast food and retail workers, and strong protections for freelancers from wage theft. We desegregated the middle schools of Brooklyn’s District 15 and brought participatory budgeting to New York City. All of those campaigns were won by “inside/outside” coalitions. They won meaningful material gains, so they built trust and strength for the next fight, and for more genuinely participatory democracy. BS: Did your time as comptroller change how you think about budgeting and public management and about the practical limits of what progressive governance can do within those constraints? BL: Serving as comptroller reinforced for me that good progressive governance depends on getting the fundamentals right. The constraints—financial, legal, administrative, personnel—also turn out to be the tools. The nuts and bolts of government, constructed through contracts, public finance, and labor agreements are what actually hold up our schools and subways, public hospitals and housing and services. So you have to really understand how they work, in order to put them together in new ways. Take the pension funds: We grew New York City’s funds to over $300 billion, while divesting fossil fuels and pushing our portfolio companies and asset managers hard on decarbonization, saving 35,000 rent-stabilized apartments through an innovative investment to buy the mortgages on them when Signature Bank failed, and helping tens of thousands of workers win union contracts through neutrality agreements that we insisted on as investors. There are, of course, limits to what you can do, but we so rarely test them. BS: We last spoke when you were just launching your mayoral run. Tell me about some of the lessons you drew from that race and if there’s something, at either an ideological or practical level, that’s informing how you’re approaching this congressional campaign? BL: Obviously, the mayoral race didn’t go quite like I planned it! But I feel really proud of the campaign we ran. The cross-endorsement of Zohran not only helped defeat Andrew Cuomo; it also opened up a deep well of solidarity—that politics can be a team sport to win for our values, and also that Muslim and Jewish New Yorkers can organize together. When I was arrested by ICE agents while trying to accompany neighbors seeking asylum, it was as part of a team of organizations bearing witness, in the tradition of nonviolent resistance. So we’ve been back again every week, and the movement to resist ICE and protect neighbors is growing in every corner of the city. Our democracy is precarious because people feel so precarious. They are constantly treading water, see that the system is rigged, and want bigger change. But our system isn’t delivering it. In moments of crisis, voters want leaders who understand the stakes and are willing to fight like our lives on the line. That’s how I’m approaching this campaign. I’ve spent my life organizing my neighbors to win big fights, from stopping evictions, to building new housing, desegregating our schools, and protecting immigrants from ICE. I recognize this moment, and I’m ready to meet it. BS: NY-10 spans working-class communities and very wealthy ones—people who experience the city in fundamentally different ways. What rises to the top for you as the district’s most immediate, everyday challenges? BL: Affordability and housing. It’s just a huge issue for families across the district, whether they’re in Red Hook or in Greenwich Village. These are neighborhoods people truly love, with little leagues and small businesses and schools and religious congregations that people treasure, but they don’t know how their kids will possibly be able to live here. This has been the work of my career. Fighting evictions and building affordable housing at the Fifth Avenue Committee, community planning and organizing for the Gowanus Neighborhood Rezoning, preserving or building over 50,000 affordable homes as comptroller. I’ll bring this expertise to Congress to help cities build housing people can actually afford, protect tenants, end homelessness, and fix public housing. BS: What federal interventions would make the most direct difference for renters and working families here? BL: We need to use every tool in our tool belt—and then construct some new tools as well. That means combining the abundance agenda with a social housing agenda, as my Local Progress colleagues recently argued in The Nation. For example, federal housing, transportation, and infrastructure subsidies should also come along with requirements that municipalities eliminate restrictive and exclusion zoning, and with incentives to experiment with new housing models, so more housing gets built overall, and more inclusively—this is the idea of Senator Warren’s American Housing and Economic Mobility Act. Congress should repeal the Faircloth Amendment and work with cities and states to set up “public developers” to spark a new generation of experimentation. And the federal government should strengthen tenant protections—as we did creatively with the first-ever Responsible Property Management Standards adopted by a pension fund—because tenants shouldn’t be kicked out of their homes just because rents are rising in their community and because we won’t sustain support for growth if people believe they will be. BS: Dan Goldman votes with the Democratic caucus almost all of the time. What would you put forward that he hasn’t? BL: NY-10 voters want a representative who shares their urgency, and their values. They want a representative who will fight like our lives and our country are on the line, because they are. They don’t want a representative who is vacationing in the Bahamas in the same resort as Donald Trump Jr. during the government shutdown. They don’t want a representative trading stock to the tune of $10 million in industries he’s meant to oversee in Congress. They don’t want a representative who voted to censure Rashida Tlaib, but who views Randy Fine as a partner. They don’t want a representative who keeps voting to send 2,000-pound bombs to Netanyahu to continue the genocide in Gaza. This district needs someone who actually represents them. I am a progressive Democrat, yes, and also a veteran lawmaker. I will organize with this community to protect our neighbors from ICE and fight fascism, and fight for an economy that isn’t rigged against working people. I will also use the experience I have from 12 years on the New York City Council and four years as City Comptroller to build coalitions across ideological differences. I know how to get work done and I will be laser focused on delivering for this district. This district is full of people hungry to organize with their congressmember to protect neighbors from ICE and fight fascism, but also to fight for an economy that isn’t rigged against working people. I’ll offer bolder leadership, that’s out on the front lines organizing. As I did in the City Council, I’ll lead on workers’ rights and economic justice issues, including protecting freelancers and gig-workers who lack even basic protections or dignity. BS: What do you see as Congress’s role in pushing for peace and a Palestinian state? BL: For too long, US foreign policy leadership, including among Democrats, has failed to recognize and advance this clear truth: Israelis will only be safe and free when Palestinians are free and safe. Congress has an important oversight responsibility to ensure peace in the region and ensure that Palestinians and Israelis are each guaranteed security and sovereignty. That means Congress should stop supplying Israel with offensive weaponry contributing to the destruction of Gaza—which I recognize as a genocide, following most international human rights organizations, and after reading the works of Rafael Lemkin, a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor who developed the term—and insist that Israel follow international law. We should recognize a Palestinian state, while insisting that it too follow international law and reject terrorism. For any of that, we must curb AIPAC’s outsized influence in our politics. More broadly, I’ll fight for a new Democratic foreign policy vision that defends human rights and international norms, emphasizes global peacemaking over militarism, and defeats authoritarianism through multilateral alliances to combat inequality and poverty. New Yorkers’ hard-earned tax dollars should not be going to fund forever wars and human rights violations—whether by foreign leaders or American ones. I will push to rebuild USAID for a new era, to protect civilians from Ukraine to Sudan to Venezuela, and to roll back the imperial presidency, whichever party is in power, and restore Congress’s constitutional role to set foreign policy. BS: What does meaningful resistance to Trump look like? BL: We need a Democratic Party that is not afraid to fight Trump but also is actually committed to creating an economy that does not solely benefit corporate interests. A Democratic Party that is capable of projecting a vision for an economy where working people can thrive, where housing, health care, and childcare aren’t out of reach, and then actually delivering that for people A Democratic Party that can win in a wider range of places, which means trying a wider range of things. We need a Democratic Party that isn’t afraid of innovating, or of holding ourselves and our leadership accountable. We have to seize this moment. Trump is facing record low popularity and Americans are growing impatient with him on affordability. They believe he is going too far on immigration. We already have openings of resistance, and it requires Democrats moving with urgency to escalate the fight, propose new ideas, and be ready to deliver on them. BS: Even with Biden-era policy wins, Democrats still struggle with working-class voters. What do you think the party is getting wrong—and how would you argue for a different direction? BL: When heirs to corporate empires hold office, people rightly feel that the party is out of touch. Working class people have watched wealth continue to flow upward, watched corruption run rampant, watch prices grow faster than wages. Democrats need to call this out plainly and propose real, concrete solutions. I’ve spent decades delivering real economic wins. We won Universal Pre-K and 3K, paid sick leave, living wages and stable schedules for deliveristas, wage theft protections. When people see Democrats deliver on bread-and-butter issues—childcare, healthcare, housing, and better jobs—it rebuilds faith that the party is listening to them. It also matters who the messengers are. We need a Democratic Party full of younger, working-class people who look like and represent their districts. I have worked hard to recruit and support young, diverse, working-class candidates, not only in New York City through WFP and the Progressive Caucus, like my City Council successor Shahana Hanif, but also through the national organization Local Progress that I helped to build along with Ady Barkan. BS: What’s your biggest regret from your council years? BL: While we made some progress in my City Council district by desegregating our middle schools and through the Gowanus Neighborhood Rezoning, where we conducted the first Racial Impact Study for a rezoning, but we fell short on broader policies to combat segregation. Two things I fought for but didn’t win: a bill banning co-op discrimination and a comprehensive planning framework that would further fair housing goals. BS: And what’s biggest regret as comptroller? BL: My last big swing is to get our pension funds to drop BlackRock, our biggest asset manager, because they are misaligned with our decarbonization plan. We’ve already divested fossil fuels and taken on big banks and utilities, but BlackRock has retreated in the face of Trump. So far, I haven’t been able to get a majority of the pension fund trustees to vote with me here. BS: What are you most proud of from your time on the City Council? BL: Desegregating the middle-schools of Community School District 15 in Brooklyn, the Gowanus Rezoning, and first-in-the-nation living wage and labor protection laws for deliveristas, Uber drivers, fast-food workers, and freelancers. BS: And how about as comptroller? BL: The investment that helped save 35,000 rent-stabilized apartments after the Signature Bank collapse. We stepped in to prevent those homes from being snapped up by speculators and preserved them as affordable housing. Every unit is preserved as rent stabilized and delivering strong returns for New York City’s retirees, too. BS: We’re in a moment of revived big ideas—from Trump’s national populism to Zohran’s democratic socialism. What’s your own larger vision for a just United States? What is “Landerism?” BL: Like I said in my campaign launch ad, it’s corny, but it’s a vision where democracy is understood as neighbors working together to make our lives in common better. Where Mr. Rogers takes on ICE, AIPAC, and corporate power to build a neighborhood that everyone can afford and where everyone is welcome. Practically, that means making a sharp critique of inequality, building a broad coalition around basic ideas of empathy, and getting into the weeds to make sure government actually delivers the goods.

Title: From Apple staff to Forbes 30-U-30 list — This young Indian-origin founder helps banks ensure financial compliance

Kalyani Ramadurgam, the Indian-origin co-founder of Kobalt Labs, alongside former Affirm software engineer Ashi Agrawal, have made it to the Forbes 30-Under-30 United States List for 2026 in the finance category. Founded in 2023, Kobalt Labs uses machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models to comb through “mountains of documents”. It helps banks vet their business partners, ensure compliance with financial regulations and promptly disclose security breaches, as per Forbes. Kalyani Ramadurgam formerly worked at Apple, where her role involved preventing individuals on terrorism watch lists from using Apple Pay, according to Forbes. Despite Apple's technological prowess, she was “shocked that the compliance process was analog and tedious”, requiring thousands of pages of documentation to be reviewed manually. She told the publication, “It meant reading through not just hundreds, but thousands of pages of documentation. Organisations were just throwing bodies at the problem.” This frustration inspired her to co-found Kobalt in 2023 with Agrawal, aiming to “bring compliance into the machine-learning age”. According to Forbes, Kobalt Labs uses AI to help banks comb through massive amounts of data and documents to review their partners. Its tool ensures compliance with financial laws, including disclosure of security breaches, halting money transfers from sanctioned countries and more. The company has raised $13 million in funding and has over 20 customers, including Celtic Bank and Bilt. The Forbes 30-Under-30 US 2026 list, released on 2 December 2025, features achievers who collectively raised $3.8 billion in funding. The average age is 27 years, with the youngest being 17.

Title: Are Bears Still in Control? Bitcoin’s (BTC) Shows Downside Signals Despite Fresh Inflows
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/are-bears-still-control-bitcoin-btc-shows-downside/
Time Published: 2025-12-19T01:00:42Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action has entered a conflicted phase, with renewed institutional inflows clashing against clear signs of market stress. After peaking above $126,000 earlier this year, the world’s largest crypto has retreated sharply and is now trading more than 30% below its all-time high. Related Reading: Bipartisan SAFE Crypto Act Unveiled: New Task Force To Combat Digital Asset Scams While some capital has returned through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), broader market signals suggest that selling pressure and weak participation continue to weigh on sentiment. Consequently, recent weeks have shown that Bitcoin’s recovery attempts remain fragile. A major source of downside pressure has been sustained selling by long-term holders. Data from K33 Research shows that roughly 1.6 million BTC that had been dormant for at least two years has been sold since early 2023. In 2025 alone, more than $300 billion worth of long-held Bitcoin has re-entered circulation. Analysts note that this type of distribution creates gradual, grinding declines rather than sharp capitulation events. With fewer active buyers in the market, the reactivated supply has proven difficult to absorb. Blockchain data indicates that the past month marked one of the heaviest long-term holder sell-offs in over five years, reinforcing the idea that structural selling remains unresolved. Institutional demand has shown brief signs of recovery. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded roughly $457 million in net inflows on December 17, snapping a multi-day outflow streak. Fidelity’s Bitcoin fund accounted for the majority of the inflows, with BlackRock also posting gains. Despite this rebound, ETF activity has been inconsistent. December inflows remain modest compared with earlier in the year, following nearly $3.5 billion in ETF outflows in November. Market observers say these inflows, while supportive, have not yet been large or sustained enough to offset ongoing sell-side pressure from long-term holders and cautious retail participation. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin continues to flash bearish signals. The price has traded within a broad $82,000–$95,000 range for over a month, forming patterns such as an inverse cup and handle on the daily chart. Bitcoin has also slipped below key moving averages, while momentum indicators suggest sellers remain in control. Recent liquidation events have reinforced this weakness. Around $152 million in Bitcoin positions were liquidated in a single day, and derivatives open interest has declined since the October market crash tied to macroeconomic shocks and tariff-related concerns.

Until selling from long-term holders eases and liquidity improves, downside risks are likely to remain part of the market’s near-term outlook.

SummaryThe speaker urges President Trump to directly address the American people with urgency, calling on them to actively participate in saving the republic rather than portraying everything as already fixed.Key recommendations for Trump:Explain specific obstacles, such as 14 blue states blocking the "no tax on tips" policy by continuing to collect taxes, and thousands of judicial rulings that delay progress but eventually get overturned.Acknowledge achievements (e.g., gas prices down 30-50%, slowed inflation, reduced illegal border crossings by 96%) while being straightforward that serious challenges remain and the country faces existential threats from globalists.Avoid overly optimistic or technical messaging that downplays ongoing struggles; instead, emphasize the fight against deep state resistance, NGOs, and foreign influences.Mobilize citizens peacefully by enlisting their support, similar to how mobilized minority groups (e.g., Jewish and Muslim communities) defend their interests effectively despite small numbers.Frame the situation as a historic crisis requiring collective action, invoking figures like George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, and JFK's "ask not what your country can do for you" call.Directly conscript the public into a "holy quest" for 1776 2.0, stressing that Trump cannot succeed alone and needs the people's full engagement in voting, activism, and support.The speaker criticizes Trump's recent speech as too technical, dense, and insufficiently urgent (grading it B+ to B-), arguing it focused on policy details and victories without adequately conveying the dire threat from globalist agendas (carbon taxes, forced injections, UN control, technocracy, replacement migration, Islamic jihad).Additional points:Past successes in Trump's first term came from advisors like Flynn, Bannon, Stone, and the speaker, who influenced policy.Warns of infighting among patriots and urges unity against known globalist plans to decentralize power from entities like BlackRock and the UN.Highlights perceived escalating threats, including Islamic jihad orders, attacks on Christians/Westerners, and left-Islam alliance for destabilization.Advises Trump to bypass legacy media, flood independent platforms (e.g., Rogan, Musk, Bannon), and repeatedly demand public involvement.Claims many of Trump's current plans (e.g., 1776 worldwide) originate from the speaker's ideas, which reach high-level White House listeners.The speaker expresses personal urgency, plans to send memos to the White House, TOPICS: KEYWORDS: alexjones; america; frootloops; ibtz; nutjobs; retarded; save; sillyhead; spammingfr; zot Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

I’ve got news for you. You can’t tell the American people to do anything. You have to show them No one knows that more than Trump. Stand back. It has to get worse before it gets better Hint. Everyone needs to review the declaration and the constitution This is a government by the people. These people who want to do nothing but be led. Hmmm... Kinda' like your post, yeah. I dare say that's exactly what he's been doing since 1993. Which? What’s your point?

In the case of BlackRock, the asset manager has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with ADI to explore accelerating blockchain adoption across financial markets and bolster the United Arab Emirates’ status as a world digital asset hub. “The partnership targets institution-grade tokenized asset structures, improved distribution, and clear regulatory frameworks that support market growth,” ADI said. The Mastercard collaboration is centered on blockchain-based payments and asset tokenization throughout the Middle East, and “brings stablecoin settlement, cross-border payments, and digital asset rails to the region with regulatory alignment built in.” And investment firm Franklin Templeton signed its MoU with the ADI Foundation to explore regulated digital asset infrastructure within Abu Dhabi Global Market. This effort “focuses on building compliant pathways for institutions to create and launch tokenized products.” Advertisement: Scroll to Continue It also explores creating digital rails for improved distribution and settlement, along with research into stablecoins and tokenized assets that are in keeping with regulatory requirements. “Three global institutions partnering within days of launch signal what they need: a blockchain built for regulatory frameworks,” ADI said. “These partnerships expand the ADI Foundation’s influence, reach, and capabilities, bringing more projects into the ecosystem as enterprises discover ADI Chain through BlackRock, Mastercard, Franklin Templeton, and expanding institutional networks.” In other blockchain news, PYMNTS wrote last week about the increasing presence of “mainstream incumbents” in this space, following a wave of crypto announcements from globally recognized names such as YouTube, BMW, HSBC, JPMorgan and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Put together, the report added, those announcements signal where digital assets are gaining traction. They share a common thread: settlement, rather than speculation or consumer hype. “Stablecoins and tokenized assets are increasingly being treated as tools for moving value with greater speed, programmability, and cost efficiency inside existing financial and commercial systems,” PYMNTS wrote. “What is emerging is a bifurcation in how blockchain is being adopted: as a new financial ecosystem on one end, and as a productized set of rails embedded into legacy institutions on the other.” Mastercard, BlackRock Join Middle East-Focused Blockchain Effort Everyday Planning and Shopping Lead Consumer Shift to AI Assistants Instacart Settles FTC Lawsuit Alleging Deceptive Advertising and Subscription Enrollments Coinbase Teams With Kalshi to Offer Prediction Market Access We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. AI visibility tracking. Brands can monitor mentions and sentiment across AI-generated answers. Competitive insights. Users gain real-time visibility into competitor presence and topic gaps. Enterprise impact. Marketing teams get immediate brand intelligence inside ChatGPT, streamlining analysis. Enterprise brands now face a new visibility challenge: tracking how AI models represent them in real-time answers. Conductor on Dec. 18 launched a ChatGPT app that delivers real-time AI search intelligence through a verified MCP server in OpenAI's App Directory. According to the company, the integration enables brands to track how they appear, are cited and are interpreted across AI-generated answers without leaving the ChatGPT interface. The app targets enterprise marketing and digital teams seeking to monitor brand visibility in large language model (LLM) outputs. Conductor asserts the tool uses a "Split Reasoning" architecture where ChatGPT handles user intent while Conductor's API provides verified data, aiming to reduce reliance on potentially outdated or hallucinated responses. The app is available as a free early access preview to Conductor customers with MCP server access and a paid ChatGPT plan. Future access will require a Conductor subscription. Key questions about Conductor’s ChatGPT app, data privacy and enterprise use. In June 2025, Conductor executed a dual transformation in go-to-market strategy and product platform. The company shifted from traditional lead generation toward content-driven brand building, a move VP of Marketing Lindsay Boyajian Hagan described as requiring "really hard conversations" across leadership. Simultaneously, Conductor unveiled Conductor AI, a platform designed to help brands win visibility in generative AI answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity and Gemini. The bet paid off quickly. Conductor reported record Q3 results on Dec. 16, adding more than 50 new enterprise logos including Aladdin by BlackRock, Four Seasons and TD Bank. Net revenue retention exceeded 125% and monthly active usage grew 132% year over year. Forrester named Conductor a Leader in its Q3 2025 SEO Wave, citing superior content SEO, AI-enabled automation and an intuitive interface. AI-powered search is fundamentally reshaping how brands reach audiences, forcing enterprise marketers to rethink visibility strategies built for a pre-LLM era. The transition from traditional SEO to answer engine optimization (AEO) reflects how large language models now mediate between brands and consumers. Brands must measure new KPIs beyond rankings: narrative inclusion, citation frequency and sentiment within AI outputs. Industry experts project a 25-50% decline in organic website traffic, with Gartner predicting a 50% drop by 2028. Approximately 27% of Americans have replaced traditional search engines with AI chatbots. Enterprise platforms now include: Brand visibility tracking across AI overviews and LLM responses Sentiment analysis within generative AI environments Citation frequency measurement in AI-generated content Competitive benchmarking in answer engine results How are brands adapting to the shift in content discoverability? By focusing on customer engagement, predictive capabilities and continuous analysis while monitoring brand visibility across AI platforms. We're proud to be the only enterprise platform in our category included at launch, a recognition of the trusted enterprise-grade intelligence we've been building for years. - Conductor Leadership According to Conductor, the ChatGPT app introduces several capabilities designed for enterprise brand monitoring. The company differentiates from competitors like Semrush and Ahrefs by asserting its MCP server delivers AI search performance intelligence—including mentions, citations and sentiment—rather than static keyword datasets. Conductor, founded in 2006, provides an SEO and content intelligence platform tailored for mid-size to large enterprises. Its primary users are organic marketing teams, content teams and digital product managers focused on search visibility and website performance. Have a tip to share with our editorial team?

Title: Why 2025 Became the Year Crypto Stopped Chasing Hype
URL: https://beincrypto.com/biggest-crypto-narratives-from-2025/
Time Published: 2025-12-18T21:02:52Z
Full Content:
Written byCamila Grigera Naón Edited byMohammad Shahid In 2025, the most influential narratives in crypto shifted away from hype toward utility and systems delivering measurable, real-world impact. The year marked a transition to production-ready systems that enhance the global movement and settlement of value. Experts from SynFutures, Brickken, and Cake Wallet said that stablecoins, privacy, tokenized assets, and applied AI shaped adoption through genuine demand rather than speculation. In many ways, 2025 was an exceptional year. It marked the first time crypto reached this level of institutional integration, with users often interacting with crypto rails without consciously engaging with “crypto” as a product. While the sector remained shaped by volatility, only a few crypto narratives stood out for their practical utility. By contrast, those driven primarily by hype and sensationalism faded quickly. In conversations with BeInCrypto, industry representatives offered a consistent assessment: narratives grounded in integration and execution endured, while novelty-driven stories steadily lost relevance. Despite a wide range of narratives, stablecoins consistently emerged as the most frequently cited theme. Stablecoins have helped bridge the gap between risk-tolerant crypto participants and more cautious users seeking limited exposure to an industry long associated with volatility. By maintaining a peg to assets such as the US dollar or gold, stablecoins positioned themselves as a more reliable alternative to other types of digital assets. Their borderless nature also gave them particular appeal over fiat currency. Our 2026 Infra Year Ahead Report is out now!Stablecoins have become the most important infrastructure story in crypto.Every fintech wave promised to fix payments but just layered better UX on the same infrastructure. Revolut and Nubank delivered better experiences while… pic.twitter.com/zEhC6sndmv Regulatory milestones, including the passage of the GENIUS Act, further strengthened confidence in stablecoins, allowing their utility and infrastructure efficiency to stand on their own merits. “Stablecoins solved a very concrete, everyday problem: moving and settling money efficiently across borders without relying on slow, fragmented, and expensive banking rails,” said Brickken CEO Edwin Mata. “For users, they provided access to digital dollars and euros in jurisdictions where banking access is limited, costly, or unreliable,” he added. The impact was concrete, not theoretical, as Stripe and Visa integrated stablecoins into settlement and treasury operations. At the same time, Circle enabled businesses to use USDC as working capital rather than as a speculative asset. As stablecoins matured into dependable settlement tools, they enabled the expansion of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). According to SynFutures CEO Rachel Lin, RWAs managed to bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto. However, the way this was achieved wasn’t comprehensive. The success of RWAs was actually much more selective than previously anticipated. “Tokenized treasuries, funds, and yield products showed real traction because they offered tangible benefits: better settlement, composability, and broader access,” Lin told BeInCrypto, adding, “However, 2025 also clarified that RWAs only work when legal clarity, liquidity, and credible issuers are in place. The narrative moved from experimentation to execution, but it’s still early.” The evidence spoke for itself, with large banks and asset managers relying on tokenization to improve efficiency. Earlier this week, JPMorgan launched a tokenized money market fund on Ethereum, marking a move beyond internal testing or pilot programs. Meanwhile, asset managers such as BlackRock expanded tokenized fund offerings, and banks integrated stablecoins into treasury and settlement workflows. Another narrative that drew widespread attention across industries, particularly within the crypto sector, was artificial intelligence (AI). Early AI hype centered on fears that autonomous agents would replace human decision-making, a narrative that quickly lost momentum. What endured was a more practical focus on how AI could enhance the user experience by helping individuals understand exposure and manage risk. “AI added real value where it reduced cognitive and operational complexity—particularly in trading interfaces, risk controls, and decision support. Products that used AI to help users understand exposure, automate execution within guardrails, or avoid costly mistakes delivered tangible improvements,” Lin explained. The rise of AI agents also generated significant attention, though expectations became more measured over the year. Their success depended less on autonomy and more on trust, auditability, and user-defined limits. Use cases such as liquidity management, automated strategy execution, and treasury optimization demonstrated potential when clear guardrails were in place. Yet, as AI became more deeply embedded in crypto products, it also sharpened long-standing concerns around data exposure. This convergence pushed privacy from a niche concern into a central narrative of 2025. Privacy emerged as one of the most consequential crypto narratives of the year, driven by growing awareness of how financial systems expose user information and behavior. spent last night deep in the a16z state of crypto 2025 report…and wow, privacy is quietly becoming the next trillion-dollar narrative> google searches for “crypto privacy” and “financial privacy” are up 10x since january> total flows through railgun passed $200M> zcash’s… https://t.co/zv36Kcgi10 pic.twitter.com/T8p3EsR9Hn As a result, long-standing concerns around data visibility moved to the forefront. In parallel, privacy, once treated as a niche preference, increasingly appeared as a structural requirement. “One of the biggest narrative shifts in the industry to date happened this year, where people woke up to the need (and market demand) for simple, approachable privacy for their money,” Seth for Privacy, Vice President of Cake Wallet, told BeInCrypto. Rising usage of Monero, increased global media attention on Zcash, and a broader shift toward privacy features across stablecoin and Layer 2 networks reinforced this pivot. “All of that solves one of the biggest painpoints of crypto for users – how do I retain privacy that I have today in the financial system or with cash, with the decentralization and power of crypto?” Seth added. The rise of privacy solutions, alongside other successful narratives of the past year, reinforced that crypto adoption increasingly hinges exclusively on utility. As crypto continues to mature, success may be defined not by how loudly it announces itself, but by how reliably it works.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The AI talent wars show no signs of slowing, with companies making headlines weekly for their latest high-profile hires. This includes engineers they are poaching from each other or acqui-hiring but also, increasingly, senior executives that can support them as they scale up. Less than 10 days after Slack CEO Denise Dresser became OpenAI’s chief revenue officer, former British finance minister George Osborne announced he was joining Sam Altman’s company. Shortly thereafter, the crypto exchange Coinbase separately appointed Osborne to lead its internal advisory council. The announcements drew particular attention in the U.K., where commenters noted that Osborne joins a growing list of former British politicians now working for major U.S. tech companies. If you’re not familiar with him or this trend, here’s what you need to know. A former conservative Member of Parliament, George Osborne served as chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016 — a role equivalent to that of a finance minister or treasury secretary in other countries, and currently held by Rachel Reeves. After Prime Minister David Cameron resigned following the 2016 Brexit vote, Osborne eventually left public office in 2017. Alongside multiple other engagements, including a part-time advisory role for the investment firm BlackRock, he served as editor of the Evening Standard from 2017 to 2020. During that period, he also co-founded a VC firm, 9yards Capital, with his brother Theo and Theo’s brother-in-law David Fisher as co-founders and managing partners. Several companies in 9yards’ portfolio have gone public since then — including Robinhood, Toast, and Coinbase. Osborne announced on X that he was joining OpenAI “as managing director and head of OpenAI for [C]ountries, based here in London.” He will help expand existing partnerships and build new ones, OpenAI chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane wrote on LinkedIn. Introduced in May 2025, OpenAI for Countries is an initiative through which the AI company partners with governments looking to build in-country data center capacity and localize ChatGPT for their language and culture. OpenAI for Countries is an extension of the Stargate project, a $500 billion initiative through which OpenAI is currently building five new data centers across the U.S. with Oracle and SoftBank. But beyond infrastructure, its stated goal is to “support countries around the world that would prefer to build on democratic AI rails.” As OpenAI turns 10, it is only natural that it starts hiring the kind of talent that won’t get turned down at the Ritz for wearing sport shoes. An Oxford graduate and the son of a baronet, Osborne fits the bill — but his network and reach are even more valuable, and his podcast with former Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls, called “Political Currency,” underscores his extensive political connections. His track record and contacts could be even more directly relevant for Coinbase, which he was already advising and where he will now “play a much more active role in helping us with policymakers around the world,” the company’s chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad told Reuters. Staying on the right side of regulators is particularly important for crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, which has been making efforts to influence governments in the U.S. and beyond. But this is also critical for OpenAI, which intends to weigh in as AI gains a foothold in governments’ agendas. According to Lehane’s LinkedIn post, Osborne’s decision to take the role “reflects a shared belief that AI is becoming critical infrastructure — and early decisions about how it’s built, governed, and deployed will shape economics and geopolitics for years to come.” Osborne’s latest role immediately drew parallels with other high-profile British politicians who went on to join major U.S. tech companies. These include former U.K. deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who served as Meta’s policy chief for over six years, and, more recently, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak taking on advisory roles with Microsoft and AI firm Anthropic. This trend raises different concerns depending on your perspective. Some critics worry about active Members of Parliament like Sunak potentially advocating for U.S. corporate interests while still serving in government. Others take issue with former officials like Osborne leveraging their government experience and connections to secure highly lucrative private sector positions. The “revolving door” phenomenon between government and the private sector isn’t new. But the practice has attracted heightened scrutiny in Europe, especially when controversial foreign companies — whether tech firms or retailers like Shein — hire former government officials to help navigate regulations and influence policy. Seen from the other side, this is simply a matter of leveraging skills and experience. In his bio on 9yards’ team page, the VC firm touts that “George devised many regulations that positioned the U.K. as a global fintech leader, including the open banking regime and the FCA ‘sandbox.’” Others, however, view Osborne’s career moves more critically. They point to his controversial austerity policies as chancellor, and note that he has a history of ethics concerns around the revolving door. For example, when he took the Evening Standard editor job in 2017, he failed to seek approval from the government’s ethics watchdog first — a move that led to the body being criticized as “toothless.” His attitude at the time was telling: “At the age of 45, I don’t want to spend the rest of my life just being an ex-chancellor,” Osborne declared. Either way, that mindset — transitioning quickly from public service to high-paying private roles — is precisely what makes his OpenAI and Coinbase appointments part of a broader pattern that concerns ethics watchdogs today.

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/18/2025 11:46:36 AM PST by E. Pluribus Unum In a move that’s raising alarms across the nation, BlackRock through its 2024 acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) has surged into direct ownership of U.S. energy infrastructure, shifting from passive investor to hands on controller of critical utilities and grids. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved a $6.2 billion takeover of Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, by a BlackRock led consortium with Canada Pension Plan in October 2025, granting private equity majority control over power serving 150,000 customers. Meanwhile, GIP is in advanced talks for a potential $38 billion acquisition of AES Corporation, a major player with renewable assets nationwide. In Texas, BlackRock’s footprint grows via GIP owned firms like Eolian, developing massive battery storage projects such as the 400 MW/1.8 GWh Padua Complex near San Antonio to stabilize ERCOT amid retiring fossil plants and exploding AI driven demand. After retreating from ESG commitments and exiting net zero alliances under political pressure, Texas removed BlackRock from its fossil fuel boycott list in June 2025, paving the way for deeper ties including Larry Fink co hosting energy investment summits with state leaders. Summary of Video TranscriptThe transcript from an InfoWars report by John Bowne criticizes BlackRock's expansion into U.S. energy infrastructure following its 2024 acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP).It highlights BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's positive view of infrastructure investing as a "golden age," driven by decarbonization, AI demand, and capital needs.The report alleges BlackRock is shifting to direct ownership and control of critical utilities, potentially prioritizing profits over affordable rates.Specific claims include:A BlackRock-led consortium (with Canada Pension Plan) gaining approval in October 2025 for a $6.2 billion takeover of ALLETE (parent of Minnesota Power), serving 150,000 customers, despite opposition from consumer advocates concerned about rate hikes and reduced accountability.GIP in advanced talks for a potential $38 billion acquisition of AES Corporation, a major renewable energy player.BlackRock's investments in Texas projects, such as battery storage via GIP-owned firms, to support grid stability amid AI growth and fossil plant retirements.It mentions a Texas Attorney General lawsuit against BlackRock over ESG policies allegedly manipulating energy markets, and notes Blackstone's separate ongoing process to acquire the Texas-New Mexico grid operator (TXNM Energy).The report expresses concerns that private equity firms, having exhausted retail sectors, are targeting infrastructure, potentially loading debt on utilities, subsidizing big tech, and eroding public oversight.

Title: Ray Dalio Joins Billionaires Funding ‘Trump Accounts’ for Children
URL: https://observer.com/2025/12/ray-dalio-backs-trump-accounts/
Time Published: 2025-12-18T19:05:24Z
Full Content:
The U.S. government’s “Trump accounts” have quickly attracted billionaire backers. Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio is the latest wealthy figure to support the initiative, pledging roughly $75 million to seed 300,000 accounts in his home state of Connecticut. His grant will add an extra $250 to accounts in Connecticut zip codes where the median income is $150,000 or less. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The savings accounts, set to launch next July for children with a U.S. Social Security number, were introduced earlier this year as part of Trump’s tax bill. Babies born between 2025 and 2028 will automatically receive a $1,000 deposit from the U.S. Treasury Department. All children under the age of 18 are eligible to open an account. The government is encouraging parents, philanthropists and local governments to contribute to the tax-advantaged accounts, which can be invested in stock market index funds and later convert into traditional IRAs when recipients turn 18. Funds can eventually be used for expenses such as education, job training and buying a first home. Dalio, whose net worth is estimated at $15.4 billion, praised the accounts as a tool for building financial literacy among children. “These Trump Accounts are great not just because they put money into stocks for these young people but also because they draw their attention toward how finance, stocks, companies and capitalism work to improve society and can work for them,” he wrote in a post on X yesterday (Dec. 17). His announcement mirrors a similar contribution from Michael Dell and his wife, Susan. Earlier this month, the couple unveiled a $6.25 million donation that will place $250 into the Trump accounts of 25 million children aged ten and under who aren’t eligible for the Treasury’s seed deposit. The Dalios and the Dells have collaborated philanthropically before. In 2020, the Dalios purchased 60,000 Dell laptops to support virtual education during the Covid pandemic. Dalio’s broader charitable efforts also include more than $7 million in contributions to Dalio Philanthropies, his family foundation, as well as roughly $280 million donated to nonprofits in Connecticut. The Dalios’ support for Trump accounts also ties into a new component of the initiative known as the “50 State Challenge” which aims to encourage philanthropists to expand funding in their local communities. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the program during a press conference yesterday. “Ray has made the first move, but we welcome other donors and foundations in Connecticut and across the country to join him,” Bessent said, adding that 20 state governments are also in talks about supplementing the accounts. The government has also launched trumpaccounts.gov, a website dedicated to the initiative that highlights “additional support” from at least eight companies nationwide. In most cases, corporate participation has taken the form of matching government contributions, with companies such as Dell, BNY and BlackRock pledging to supplement the Treasury’s $1,000 deposits for their employees’ children. Not every billionaire, however, is convinced. While calling the accounts a “nice gesture,” Elon Musk took to X yesterday to describe the initiative as unnecessary in light of A.I.’s economic potential. “There will be no poverty in the future and so no need to save money. There will be universal high income,” Musk wrote, echoing a Silicon Valley belief that technology-driven productivity gains will eventually provide people with steady, recurring payouts.

Title: A Passage to Innocence – Frank McNally on an anthology of old school routes remembered

Full Content:
With a name like his, he was probably condemned to a foray into literature sooner or later. But the Robert Burns behind a new book called Kings and Queens of the Road is an accidental writer. He fell into the role from his day job as a civil engineer, and more particularly a civil engineer committed to creating “people-friendly public spaces”. Born in Monaghan, he’s back there now as the county’s chief executive. In between, however, he cut a swathe through south Dublin, where the former Green Party TD and junior minister Ossian Smyth recalls him as “The TK Whitaker of cycle lanes”. His book, a joint production with the Museum of Childhood Ireland, takes its inspiration from the Patrick Kavanagh poem Inniskeen Road: July Evening, in which “the bicycles go by in twos and threes”. But in Dublin, during Covid, Burns oversaw construction of the 4.5km segregated cycle route between Blackrock and Sandycove for a mere €1 million. Now the bicycles go by there, not just in twos and threes, but at a rate of 20,000 a week. The idea behind Kings and Queens of the Road was to get people – around 60 of them in this case – of all ages and backgrounds to recall their childhood journeys to school: a rite of passage that, as the anthology of their stories prove, stays with you all your life. The title too comes from Kavanagh’s poem, although it was somewhat ironic in that context, where the poet’s social exclusion from a dance in Billy Brennan’s barn makes him the reluctant monarch of a now empty road, “a mile of kingdom”. The new book, by contrast, is inclusive to a fault. Routes described range geographically from Caherdavin to China (where the Irish-exiled artist Jin Yong grew up in a town where it could be -30 degrees in winter and where once, as a nine-year-old, he took a short cut across a frozen river only for one of his legs to slip through the ice. Luckily, the rest of him didn’t, and he survived to reach school, where the teacher let him and his “rock-hard” trousers thaw out by the fire). The stories are not all about walking and cycling either. Another artist, Leanne McDonagh, a Traveller, recalls the excitement of days in the 1990s when her father would turn up at school not in the usual Hiace van but a horse and cart. “This of course was the coolest thing ever ... myself and my siblings would climb on to the sulky hoping to get the side seat first because we all knew that to be sitting on the edge was the most exciting place to be, only topped by the chance of holding the reins and taking the lead on the journey home to the site.” The well-named Aidan Herdman, now retired from a job in Guinness’s brewery, was one of several who read his contribution at the book’s launch last week. Although his school was in Stoneybatter, he recalled a time – not much more than 50 years ago – when the hazards of the route included herds of cattle being walked from a train station in Cabra to the market at Prussia Street. He was not much of a herdman in practice, alas: “I was so scared when they approached me that I ran into a house driveway and closed the gate.” [ Dublin city cycle lane funding slashed by €16mOpens in new window ] The cattle drive was a gauntlet also run by journalist Frank McDonald, formerly of this parish. He grew up just off the North Circular Road and wove his way to school through an area dominated less by cycle paths than cow pats: “It took a bit of skill on the bike to avoid them.” The longest memory in the book is that of Desmond Morris, the English zoologist and broadcaster, now in his late 90s and living in Kildare. His childhood in Swindon included the second World War, when along with his books he had to carry a gas mask to school. The war in Northern Ireland features too. Writer Sheena Wilkinson recalls 1980 and the hazards of taking two buses across a barricaded city centre to her grammar school in “posh south Belfast”. Late on her first day there, she then walked into a no-warning ambush of middle-class smugness: “’Not a good start,’ says my form mistress, and the other girls, who arrived in their mummys’ Range Rovers, or who walked through neighbouring leafy avenues with their pals form the prep school, look at me with scorn.” [ A Troubles childhood: Fifty years on, I think of how I am victim and ‘perpetrator’ at the same timeOpens in new window ] As Museum of Childhood founder Majella McAllister writes in an introduction, the anthology and a related exhibition is the product of a two-year conversation begun on “Back to School” day 2023. Part of the aim, she said, was to reframe the role of children “as rightful users of public space whose needs have been systematically marginalised”. The book, with illustrations by Molly Buí Hennessy, is available in selected shops and, as part of a travelling exhibition, will be distributed free to libraries across Ireland. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Aptos introduces post-quantum signatures before they’re urgently needed
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/aptos-introduces-post-quantum-signatures-proposal
Time Published: 2025-12-18T16:40:32Z

Aptos has proposed an optional post-quantum signature scheme, citing long-term risks that advances in quantum computing could pose to existing cryptography. Blockchain network Aptos is moving toward a post-quantum signature option, reflecting growing concern that advances in quantum computing are no longer purely theoretical and could eventually affect how blockchain networks secure accounts and transactions. On Thursday, Aptos outlined a proposal to introduce post-quantum signatures, addressing the network’s reliance on digital signatures for ownership, transaction authorization and overall security. While existing cryptographic schemes remain secure against classical computers, researchers warn that sufficiently powerful quantum machines could one day forge them, potentially compromising account security retroactively. “Quantum computing is not a distant spectre anymore,” Aptos Labs wrote in a post on X, pointing to early discussions around quantum scaling by IBM and growing regulatory momentum, including the publication of post-quantum cryptography standards by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). “This matters for networks like Aptos because Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) can make today’s signature schemes forgeable, possibly breaking security models,” the post said. CRQCs are machines theoretically powerful enough to break today’s cryptography. In response, developers have proposed AIP-137, an Aptos Improvement Proposal authored by cryptographers at Aptos Labs, which would add support for a post-quantum signature scheme at the account level. If approved through governance, AIP-137 would introduce SLH-DSA, a hash-based digital signature scheme standardized as FIPS 205, as an optional account signature type. The change would make Aptos one of the earliest production blockchains to natively support post-quantum accounts. However, existing accounts would remain unaffected. Post-quantum accounts would be opt-in only, allowing users to adopt selectively. Aptos is one of the larger layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchains, designed primarily to support decentralized applications. Earlier this year, its head of ecosystem, Ash Pampati, told Cointelegraph that consumer-focused applications were gaining traction on the network, particularly those blending elements of Web2 and Web3. As Cointelegraph previously reported, Aptos has also emerged as a venue for tokenized real-world assets, with asset managers including Franklin Templeton and BlackRock deploying products on the network. Related: Google announces quantum advantage, 13,000 times faster than supercomputers While many in the crypto industry argue that quantum threats to blockchains, particularly Bitcoin, remain years away, networks are increasingly taking preparatory steps, with Aptos far from alone in doing so. Earlier this month, Solana tested quantum-resistant transactions on a dedicated testnet, an experiment aimed at evaluating how post-quantum signature schemes could be integrated into its transaction model without disrupting existing accounts. Within the Bitcoin community, a smaller but vocal group of developers, researchers and fund managers has also begun pushing for faster progress on quantum-resistant cryptography. Some have rallied around BIP-360, a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that would introduce quantum-resistant signature options. However, the idea remains in its early stages and is subject to debate. Others, including early Bitcoin figure Adam Back, have dismissed near-term quantum concerns as a form of fear, uncertainty and doubt, or FUD, arguing that Bitcoin does not rely on encryption for its core security model. Instead, Bitcoin uses digital signature schemes and cryptographic hash functions, which are not imminently threatened by practical quantum computers. Related: Are quantum computers stealing Bitcoin?

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The university lauded him as "among the rare titans whose vision has reshaped not just business, but culture and society more broadly." WWD Editor, International HAILED BY YALE: Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, “embodies the rare combination of business acumen, strategic discipline, aesthetic sensitivity, moral courage, and cultural stewardship that defines history’s most influential leaders.” So said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, as the university bestowed the French luxury titan with its Yale Legend in Leadership Award on Wednesday during its Yale CEO Summit in New York City.

Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of LVMH Americas, accepted the trophy on Arnault’s behalf from Ivanka Trump, Anna Wintour, and Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and CEO of Blackstone. The event was livestreamed on CNBC.com and Arnault delivered an acceptance speech in English via a live video link from Paris. “We are part of French history. Very often when I travel around the world, I feel myself like a kind of ambassador, not only a businessman,” Arnault related, given that his family-controlled luxury group is the steward of so many European heritage brands, from Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy to wine maker Château d’Yquem, whose origins date back to 1593. “I am proud that the group has built continuously, has grown continuously because we are showing something in the world for which the interest of people is constantly growing,” he added. Sonnenfeld described Arnault as “among the rare titans whose vision has reshaped not just business, but culture and society more broadly. His leadership illuminates the extraordinary possibilities that emerge when commercial imagination is paired with cultural vision, civic engagement, social impact, and long-term stewardship. “Under his stewardship, LVMH became the first European company to surpass a $500 billion valuation, transforming a constellation of independent, often family-run ‘maisons’ into a pioneering global powerhouse — without ever sacrificing their soul, heritage, or devotion to meticulous craftsmanship,” he continued. “As the architect of the modern luxury industry, he has shown that genuine leadership in this realm is not about excess but about excellence; not about exclusivity but about enduring cultural contribution.” Arnault has served as chairman and CEO of LVMH since 1989.

Title: Why Is Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Down Today? BlackRock Deposits Spark Worry

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down today as the crypto market remains in a phase of extreme fear. This latest crash came amid BlackRock’s move, which sparked fear of a sell-off from the world’s largest asset manager. The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down today following BlackRock’s transfer of 2,257 BTC and 74,973 ETH to Coinbase, indicating plans to offload these coins. Notably, the BTC and ETH ETFs recorded outflows on December 16, likely why the asset manager moved these coins to redeem shares for its IBIT and ETHA ETFs, which were sold that day. These Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have continued to record mixed flows, which have partly contributed to declines in BTC and ETH prices. Notably, the Bitcoin price had surged to around $90,000 yesterday from an intraday low of around $87,000, before retracing below $87,000 about an hour later. This immediately sparked theories of manipulation, with some crypto pundits revealing that BlackRock wasn’t the only one selling. Related Reading: The Bearish Structure That Puts Bitcoin Price At $92,550, And Then $82,000 Crypto pundit Kruse claimed that Binance first bought nonstop for over 30 minutes to pump the price, then started dumping millions of BTC and ETH to liquidate longs. He noted that the Bitcoin price pumped about $3,300 in 30 minutes, with $106 million in shorts wiped out during that period. Following that, BTC printed another volatile hourly candle to the downside, which flushed out $52 million in longs. A similar price action had also played out for the Ethereum price. Kruse declared that this wasn’t random volatility but rather liquidity hunting. The pundit further warned that this is how leverage gets punished in crypto. He then reiterated that the volatile Bitcoin and Ethereum price actions weren’t random, indicating the market is being manipulated. Onchain Sleuth Tracer also accused Binance of being responsible for the Bitcoin and Ethereum price declines. He claimed that the crypto exchange pumped and dumped millions of BTC to liquidate traders, with $194 million in shorts and longs liquidated in one hour. Crypto asset manager Bitwise has predicted that the Bitcoin price will break the four-year cycle and set new all-time highs in 2026. The asset manager alluded to factors such as the Bitcoin halving and interest rate cycles as what will drive this rally for the flagship crypto. The firm also remarked that crypto booms and busts fueled by leverage are weaker than in past cycles. Bitwise also stated that institutions are likely to allocate more to Bitcoin ETFs, which is why they expect the Bitcoin price to reach new all-time highs next year. Furthermore, the firm noted that the pro-crypto regulatory shift will continue to allow companies to adopt crypto at a faster rate. The crypto asset manager also predicted that the Ethereum price could reach a new all-time high if the CLARITY Act passes.

Title: The Key To Understanding The Cult Of Globalism’s War On The West
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/the-key-to-understanding-the-cult-of-globalisms-war-on-the-west/
Time Published: 2025-12-18T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
The culture war in the western world is currently hitting a crescendo. At first the media said it was all “conspiracy theory” being amplified by a “fringe minority” of radical right wingers. Then, they admitted the conflict was real but claimed that conservatives were monsters trying to “dismantle democracy”. Today, the culture war has become the dominant issue of our age with the debate echoing through the halls of the White House. Leftists hoped they could make it all go away by dismissing it. They hoped they could continue with their ideological takeover at their leisure. They failed. The rebellion in the US is a product of decades of effort by liberty advocates and it is finally bearing fruit. However, I think many Americans and some Europeans are discovering that movements like progressive wokism (essentially Cultural Marxism) are much more than a mere reaction to the return of conservatives to the cultural space. The fight that’s happening in front of the curtain is only a dim reflection of the fight that’s going on behind the curtain. Almost every facet of leftist political and social activism is bankrolled by some of the wealthiest organizations and individuals on the planet. In fact, I would argue that without the billions of dollars in global funding provided by NGOs, government entities and corporations, the political left as we know it would not exist and the world would be much quieter. A prime example is anti-ICE organizations: These groups have access to extensive cash reserves to finance call networks, they pay for hundreds or even thousand of protesters and agitators, they pay for legal representation and bail to get their activist agents out of jail, and they often obtain inside information on ICE operations before those operations occur. These groups function less like homegrown civil rights efforts and more like clandestine government agencies. And, if you check the tax backgrounds of all of them you will find, without fail, that they’re propped up by NGOs like the Open Society Foundation, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, global corporations like Vangaurd and Blackrock, and government bureaucracies like USAID (before it was shut down). Nothing about these movements is natural, they are purely astroturf. It might look like chaos, but every time you see leftist mobs on the news trying to interfere with ICE arrests and deportations, what you are watching is a highly organized machine flush with globalist cash working to undermine US sovereignty. The mass immigration of third worlders is coordinated by globalists. The protests against deportations are funded by globalists. The politicians that promote open border policies and enable the invasion of the west are closely associated with prominent globalists. The war on the west is a globalist war; radical activists are mindless soldiers and paid mercenaries. They are not the source of the conflict; they shield the source. Unfortunately there are too many conservative commentators out there that REFUSE to accept the reality that the actions of the political left are coordinated by a deeper conspiracy. I don’t know why they deny the existence of this cabal, I can only surmise that the idea of a top-down conspiracy to bring about the downfall of western culture is too frightening for them to ponder. There is also the problem of motive. There’s plenty of conservatives and patriots with a vague notion of why the globalists do the things they do. Evil exists, that’s not up for debate. But beyond the underlying mental factors of psychopathy and delusions of godhood, the issue of relativism is ever present. It is a globalist obsession. Globalism is rooted in cultural relativism, moral relativism, legal relativism, even biological relativism. Western culture is basically the antithesis of relativism, and thus, it must be destroyed in order for globalism to thrive. Everything else is just a tactic, a strategy to destroy the west while taking none of the blame. Only the west codifies the idea of inherent liberties into its legal framework. Only the west (specifically the US) places individual citizen rights as equal to or greater than the policies of government. Only the west values free thought over uniformity. Only the west (largely the US) preaches the necessity of popular revolt in the wake of collectivist tyranny. The problem is, most of the world has no concept of these ideals. They have spent their lives acclimating to cultures where “rights” are also relative – Relative to the whims of socialist and authoritarian regimes. It therefore makes perfect sense for globalists to fund the importation of millions of foreigners, mostly from the third world, into the west. These are people whose minds are already enslaved by a lifetime of submission to collectivism and oligarchy. The migrants go along with the plan because the incentives are too enticing. Their masters are aiming them at the west and saying: “Go and pillage, take what you can! We will let you plunder these wealthy places as long as you do as we say after the coffers are looted and the blood in the streets is dry in the sun…” In other words, the globalists are giving the oppressed third worlders a steam valve, an opportunity to “chimp out” and act on their worst impulses. It is a sad but pervasive observation that the majority of enslaved minds HATE the existence of free people, even if those people live on the other side of the planet. This doesn’t only apply to hostile migrants, it also applies to the progressives that live next door to us. Look at what happened during the pandemic. Look at how they act when faced with facts that contradict their political beliefs. They snap, they crash out, they go insane. They spit and froth and rage like animals. They revile us and nothing would make them happier than to see us dead. All because we don’t blindly embrace their doctrine. Wokeness, along with multiculturalism, is a globalist construct adapted as a new world religion and all of its tenets are designed as an attack on western values. We respect meritocracy, so they create DEI and equity. We promote personal responsibility, so they promote narcissism and self worship. We revere free markets, so they enable expanding socialism. We respect biological science and the biblical definitions of man and woman, so they create gender fluid ideology. We respect moral objectivity and the reality of good and evil, so they conjure up the philosophy of moral relativism as a license for ubridled degeneracy. To be sure, there are other cultures that do not embrace wokeness, but they don’t present a legitimate threat to globalism. They don’t have a legacy of free thought, they have no interest in rebellion and they are mostly disarmed so they wouldn’t be able to fight back if they wanted to. Wokeness was specifically tailored as a weapon against the west; a weapon that targets our belief in liberty and attempts to use it against us. For if an individual has a right to choose their own path, how far does this right extend? Do individuals have the rights and the freedom to congregate into mobs and systematically burn the west down? Liberals would say “yes”, and if anyone tries to stop them those people are tyrants. Are we tyrants if we fight back? Are we fascists if we defend out culture and borders from erasure? Are we hypocrites if we ignore the sovereignty of people whose only goal is to eliminate our sovereignty? My counter-argument to this philosophy is that leftists and globalist have no right to socially engineer the west. They only have the right to leave the west and start their own systems somewhere else. If they hate the west so much, why don’t they relocate instead of staying here, or inviting in millions of immigrants that also have no respect for our heritage? Because this is not a civic disagreement between citizens with a mutual love of country – This is a war between mortal enemies who share nothing in common. They don’t want to live peacefully in another place where they can experiment with socialism to their heart’s content. They want to conquer and subjugate. Globalism must be global. If any competing systems are allowed to exist they will act as proof that the relativist method is an inferior method. The key to understanding the globalist war on the west is first to recognize that a conspiracy of “elites” is a hard, irrefutable fact. Second, we must accept that war has been declared on us and this war is one of total conquest. We are not allowed to live separately and peacefully, our very existence is seen as a threat to the establishment. Third, globalists view western culture as antithetical to their future aims. Globalism cannot prevail as long as western ideals exist. Finally, as noted, most of the world is against us whether they know it or not. Even old allies in Europe are becoming enemies. Import masses of third worlders into America and they don’t become American, America becomes the third world. Import millions of socialists into the US and the US becomes increasingly socialist. This is very simple to understand, but leftists (and some libertarians) refuse to acknowledge the truth. Not all cultures are equal. Some are better than others. It’s fascinating how liberals continue to pretend as if different nations and cultures don’t produce tribes that are contrary to each other. We are not the same and natural coexistence is a myth. Coexistence of such groups is created through intimidation, extortion and force. The liberal Utopian ideal of multiculturalism requires oppressive centralization and tyranny. Globalism is the mechanism by which total and eternal oligarchy is achieved. They use open borders, mass immigration, woke cultism, economic crisis, international conflagration, engineered pandemics, anything you can think of and more to tear their enemies down. We are their enemy. We didn’t choose this fight, they did, and they will continue changing strategies until they find one that works (or until we end their little experiment).

Title: BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton Announce Collaboration with the ADI Foundation Signaling Institutional Adoption

December 18, 2025 06:00 ET | Source: ADI Chain ADI Chain ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Days after the mainnet launch, the MENA region's first and largest institutional L2 has secured partnerships with BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton, demonstrating institutional confidence in compliance-first blockchain architecture. The Institutional Validation Each of ADI's latest partnerships targets different infrastructure needs: Three global institutions partnering within days of launch signal what they need: a blockchain built for regulatory frameworks. These partnerships expand the ADI Foundation's influence, reach, and capabilities, bringing more projects into the ecosystem as enterprises discover ADI Chain through BlackRock, Mastercard, Franklin Templeton, and expanding institutional networks. Launch and Access The ADI utility token launched simultaneously with the mainnet across Kraken, Crypto.com, and KuCoin, and became available through Wallet in Telegram and Fasset shortly after. The market response showed demand for compliance-ready infrastructure: that interest extends beyond institutional players. The Build Continues BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton joined an ecosystem spanning partnerships across 20 countries. Over 50 institutional and enterprise projects are in the pipeline for deployment on ADI Chain, with institutional and technology partnerships continuing to expand. Projects deploying on ADI Chain already demonstrate the network's institutional use cases: The foundation's strategic partnerships expand its capabilities and market access: ZKsync powers ADI Chain's zero-knowledge proof infrastructure, Alchemy provides national-scale deployment capabilities, WalletConnect enables cross-chain interoperability, and Covalent delivers real-time blockchain data for institutional applications. Core infrastructure milestones continue advancing as well. ADI Chain was chosen to host the UAE Dirham-backed stablecoin, which will be issued by two major players in the region: First Abu Dhabi Bank and IHC, and is set to be regulated by the UAE Central Bank. Alongside technical infrastructure, the Foundation will launch an educational initiative, ‘Future Tech 4.0’ in partnership with ADGM and leading universities to develop over 10,000 Web3 specialists. A Year of Building Most L2 blockchains compete on transaction speed and low fees. ADI Chain took a different approach, building for compliance, regulatory alignment, and government deployment. The thesis was straightforward: emerging market governments and institutions need blockchain infrastructure designed specifically for them. One year ago, the ADI Foundation announced its formation at Abu Dhabi Finance Week. Last week, it returned to the same stage to announce the ADI Chain Mainnet launch. Twelve months from formation to operational infrastructure, with partnerships confirmed within days. BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton signed partnerships days after launch, showing they had monitored development closely. When institutions of that scale move that quickly, it validates the category itself. ADI established "institutional L2 for MENA" before competitors could claim the space. ADI aims to bring one billion people onchain by 2030. One year in: mainnet operational, partnerships across 20 countries, 50+ projects ready to deploy, 500+ million people already within reach. The goal now looks less distant. About the ADI Foundation & ADI Chain The ADI Foundation is an Abu Dhabi-based non-profit founded by Sirius International Holding, a subsidiary of IHC, dedicated to empowering governments and institutions in emerging markets through blockchain infrastructure. The foundation's mission is to bring one billion people into the digital economy by 2030, building on a foundation of 500+ million people already within its ecosystem reach. ADI Chain is the first institutional Layer 2 blockchain for stablecoins and real-world assets in the MENA region, providing settlement infrastructure for First Abu Dhabi Bank and IHC's dirham-backed stablecoin, set to be regulated by the UAE Central Bank. The network operates on three pillars - Compliance, Efficiency, Security - serving governments implementing blockchain infrastructure across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs record $450M inflows in ‘early positioning’ push

Spot Bitcoin ETFs logged their strongest inflows in over a month amid renewed institutional demand tied to shifting macro expectations. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $457 million in net inflows on Wednesday, marking their strongest single-day intake in more than a month as institutional demand showed signs of re-acceleration. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led the inflows, recording the largest daily intake at roughly $391 million, accounting for the majority of the day’s net inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) followed with around $111 million, according to data from Farside Investors. Other funds saw modest withdrawals. Bitwise’s BITB saw about $8.4 million in outflows, ARK 21Shares’ ARKB recorded roughly $37 million in outflows, and Hashdex’s DEFI posted around $1.5 million in net outflows on the day. The inflows lifted cumulative net inflows for US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs to more than $57 billion, while total net assets climbed above $112 billion, equivalent to around 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. The rebound followed a choppy stretch in November and early December, when flows alternated between modest inflows and sharp outflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs last saw inflows above $450 million on Nov. 11, when funds pulled in roughly $524 million in a single day. Related: Crypto ETPs to enter ‘cheesecake factory’ era in 2026: Bitwise Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, said the renewed interest appears to reflect early positioning rather than late-cycle enthusiasm. “ETF inflows feel like early positioning,” Liu said. “As rate expectations soften, BTC becomes a clean liquidity trade again. Politics sets the mood, but capital moves on macro.” However, Liu cautioned that while momentum could continue, it is unlikely to be smooth. “Momentum likely holds, but expect it to be uneven,” he said. “Flows will track liquidity and price action. As long as BTC remains a clean macro expression, ETFs stay the path of least resistance.” On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said he plans to appoint a new Federal Reserve chair who strongly supports cutting interest rates. Speaking during a national address marking the first year of his second term, Trump said he would announce a successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell early next year, adding that all known finalists favor lower rates than current levels. Lower rates are usually considered bullish for risk assets like crypto. Related: Spot Bitcoin ETFs see $358M outflow: Are investors really abandoning BTC? Bitcoin has returned to price levels last seen nearly a year ago, leaving behind a dense supply cluster between $93,000 and $120,000 that continues to cap recovery attempts. This top-heavy structure has pushed the amount of Bitcoin held at a loss to 6.7 million BTC, the highest level of the current cycle, according to Glassnode. The report said demand remains fragile across both spot and derivatives markets. Spot buying has been selective and short-lived, corporate treasury flows episodic, and futures positioning continues to de-risk rather than rebuild conviction. Until sellers are absorbed above $95,000 or fresh liquidity enters the market, Bitcoin is likely to remain caught between structural support near $81,000, per Glassnode.

Title: Either way the EU loses: Why ignoring the US on Russian assets will be the bloc’s undoing

Time Published: 2025-12-18T08:21:03Z

It is crunch time for Ursula von der Leyen and her Brussels-based cabal who have attempted to bend and break EU law in order to force through a dubious legal claim for the use of sovereign Russian wealth to further fund Ukraine’s military. Kiev is long past broke, owes the EU some €45 billion and faces a fiscal shortage of €70 billion for the next year, and is suffering a slow and painful frontline collapse. Moscow has long described the EU’s attack on its assets as “theft,” the IMF and European Central Bank both oppose the move, and the ratings agency Fitch has already issued a downgrade warning to Euroclear, the clearing house at centre of the scandal. The stakes Von der Leyen, along with her compatriot German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, have managed to bring what is widely regarded as a potentially disastrous initiative to an EU vote under dubious circumstances which, if it fails, will leave the two German politicians’ reputations in ruins. Merz has been at the megaphone this week while von der Leyen has pressed the flesh with bloc members. In the past 48 hours, the former chairman of the Blackrock Germany board has declared the ‘pax Americana’ is over, compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler (Merz’s grandfather was a Nazi), and warned of direct NATO-Russia conflict. However, it could be worse. If the vote to use Russian assets to finance Kiev’s military is passed, it will permanently damage the EU’s reputation, spell the end of any Russia-EU cooperation for decades while triggering a global legal onslaught. A slew of cases will be opened in the bloc, not least by Belgium, which has protested against the EU attempts to get its hands on some €180 billion of Russian sovereign wealth held in the Belgian clearing house Euroclear. Russia has also begun legal proceedings in a Moscow arbitration court for damages. Some €280 billion of assets belonging to countries deemed “unfriendly” by Moscow, presently held in type-C deposits in Russia, could be seized in retaliation for the European attack on Russia’s funds, as well as a wave of litigation potentially targeting all complicit institutions in every major global financial hub. Death and “pax Americana” The European option also ignores the military reality in Donbass and Ukraine, by seeking to pour billions into continuing a war that Kiev is undoubtedly losing. US President Donald Trump’s team, however, have proposed a different mechanism which Russia has not outright rejected, by which the Russian funds in question are used for an investment vehicle. Such a mechanism could have a very positive impact on the investment climate in a post-conflict Ukraine, given the rampant and endemic corruption associated with the country and in particular Vladimir Zelensky’s inner circle. Effectively what we are witnessing is the European Union rejecting Washington while trying to force on Kiev a militaristic future which only promises years of warfare. The US, which let us remember initiated this entire round of diplomacy, has a proposal on the table that could secure a stable and lasting peace, offer security guarantees to all parties involved, and have a positive impact on the investment climate in a country that will need unprecedented investment. The Spin While you may have read that the European Union has already taken an indefinite hold over Russia’s assets in lieu of reparations to Ukraine, neither of these claims is true. The EU has misused article 122 of its constitution to assert a temporary hold over Russian assets for as long as they can prove that the conflict in Ukraine poses or threatens to pose an economic risk to the bloc. There is no indefinite freeze on Russian assets for reparations to speak of. Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever has spoken of the EU “stealing” Russian assets. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Rueben has already described the EU tactics as “a declaration of war.” Slovakia’s Robert Fico, who was shot at close range by a pro-Ukraine activist, has claimed Brussels is only “prolonging the war.” Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has also refused to support financing Ukraine. Italy, Malta, and others are also said to be firmly against the plot to steal Russia’s assets and are advocating for a different option. The vote Though the matter is regarded as a foreign policy issue involving the assets of a non-member of the bloc and would normally require unanimity to pass, von der Leyen has managed force a vote under qualified majority voting. This means that 15 of the 27 member states, and/or states representing 65% of the EU’s population must vote in favor in order to pass the ruling. Eight votes against could be enough to force von der Leyen to have to go back to EU taxpayers, already suffering and drifting to the left and right, to seek lining for Ukraine’s donated war chest. Should the reparations loan option be defeated or removed from the table, the joint debt option, whereby EU member countries must borrow money for Ukraine, to be repaid by the countries themselves, will arise, requiring unanimity to pass. Either way, it looks like Brussels could lose. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

Title: Binance’s US Return Strategy: CZ’s Stake At Risk In Potential Recapitalization

Amid significant regulatory shifts under President Trump’s administration, Binance is gearing up to relaunch in the United States, potentially reducing the stakes held by its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Following years of legal hurdles that culminated in Zhao serving time in prison, his recent presidential pardon has revitalized the exchange’s prospects within the US crypto landscape. According to a recent Bloomberg report, Binance has been exploring options to restart operations for its American affiliate, Binance.US. This includes discussions of a recapitalization that could dilute Zhao’s majority stake, which has complicated the company’s efforts to expand in the country. At a recent Binance Blockchain Week event, Zhao expressed his commitment to transforming the US into a central hub for cryptocurrency, dubbing it “an emerging land for us.” His remarks came in the wake of a challenging period for Binance.US, which has seen its market share plummet from an impressive 35% to virtually zero since US regulatory bodies charged Zhao and the cryptocurrency exchange two years ago. Several states have also rescinded Binance’s licenses, while others, notably New York, never granted one in the first place. Supporters of the exchange believe that a forthcoming market-structure bill could establish a federal licensing regime, potentially altering the operational landscape for companies like Binance. However, Bitcoinist has continuously reported that the bill’s progress has stalled amid political divisions, casting doubt on its future. For now, the anticipated markup has been delayed until January 2026. The report suggests that if Binance were able to buy back some or all of Zhao’s holdings, it might consider new leadership and strategies to drive growth while leveraging political connections in Washington. Sources familiar with the situation emphasize a sense of urgency for the exchange to make critical decisions. In a separate effort to bolster its standing, the exchange is reportedly aiming for a closer partnership with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the largest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. This relationship could involve the utilization of BlackRock’s tokenized money-market fund to support trades on Binance. Discussions regarding enhanced financial ties between the two have included the potential development of additional products and revenue-sharing opportunities. Additionally, Binance is looking to strengthen its relationship with World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto venture co-founded by members of the Trump family. These moves appear to have taken shape following Zhao’s pardon and signify the crypto company’s desire to recalibrate its presence in a more favorable political atmosphere. To facilitate these efforts, Binance has promoted Yi He, Zhao’s partner, as a stabilizing force for the company. Over the past few months, she has assumed a prominent role, leading strategic initiatives and revitalizing Binance’s growth narrative. However, her elevation has sparked questions regarding the dynamics of power between her and Teng, the former regulator who has been instrumental in guiding the exchange’s outreach efforts. At the time of writing, BNB, the exchange’s native token, is trading at $846. This represents a major correction of 38% over the past few months, following the cryptocurrency’s all-time high of $1,369.

Title: EU’s seizure of Russian assets sparks legal showdown as Moscow demands $230 billion

The EU is considering repurposing â¬200 billion ($234 billion) in frozen Russian sovereign assets to fund Ukraine, escalating tensions. Russia has retaliated by suing Euroclear for $230 billion, framing the move as outright "theft" and threatening financial instability. The U.S. has privately warned the EU against confiscation, fearing it could sabotage peace talks. Hungary and Slovakia oppose the plan, forcing Brussels to use emergency powers to maintain the freeze. Belgium fears legal exposure, while Ukraine's worsening debt crisis raises doubts about repayment capacity. Moscow filed a lawsuit against Euroclear in Russian courts, with expected enforcement in friendly jurisdictions like China or the UAE. Russian officials warn that asset seizures will erode trust in Western financial systems and trigger retaliatory seizures of European holdings in Russia. The EU's move would be the first time non-belligerent nations seize a belligerent's assets during an ongoing conflict to aid a third party. Historical seizures (Iran, Venezuela) set a contentious precedent, with Russia accusing the West of a "genetic urge to steal." If Russia reclaims assets via international courts, Euroclear and Western financial institutions could face chaos. Ukraine's looming default and Washington's hesitation highlight strategic fragility, with long-term damage to trust in the euro and Western monetary systems.

The European Union's plan to repurpose â¬200 billion ($234 billion) in frozen Russian sovereign assets to fund Ukraine has escalated into a high-stakes legal and financial battle, with Moscow retaliating by suing Euroclear for $230 billion in damages. Euroclear is a Brussels-based financial depository that holds and manages seized Russian assets in European banks, according to BrightU.AI's Enoch. The move, framed by Russia as outright "theft," risks destabilizing Western financial institutions and undermining international trust in the euro. Meanwhile, the U.S. has reportedly warned the EU against confiscating the funds, fearing it could sabotage peace negotiations with Moscow. Following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western nations froze approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets, with â¬210 billion held in Europeâprimarily by Euroclear. EU leaders, led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, have proposed using these funds to back a "reparations loan" for Ukraine, arguing that Kyiv urgently needs financial support as the war drags on. However, the plan has met fierce resistanceânot just from Russia but also within the EU itself. Hungary and Slovakia opposed the measure, forcing Brussels to invoke emergency powers to keep the assets frozen indefinitely. Belgium, home to Euroclear, has expressed concerns about being left vulnerable to Russian lawsuits. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk revealed that Washington has privately urged Brussels to "leave these Russian assets alone," fearing Moscow would harden its stance in peace talks. Russia's legal counterattack Russia has launched a multi-pronged legal offensive, with the Bank of Russia filing a $230 billion lawsuit against Euroclear in Moscow's Commercial Court. Legal experts anticipate a swift ruling in Russia's favor, which could then be enforced in jurisdictions deemed friendly to Moscow, such as China, Hong Kong or the UAE, where Euroclear operates. Kirill Dmitriev, Russian President Vladimir Putin's investment envoy, warned that seizing sovereign assets would erode trust in Western financial systems: "What rational investor will hold its securities in Euroclear, in euro or in the EU, if they understand that their property rights are not respected?" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went further, accusing the West of a "genetic urge to steal," citing past seizures of Iranian and Venezuelan assets. Moscow has vowed to retaliate by targeting European investors' holdings in Russia, potentially escalating into a tit-for-tat financial war. Historical precedent and financial fallout The EU's move marks an unprecedented step in modern financial warfare. A 2024 study by Sweden's Riksbank noted that this would be the first time non-belligerent nations seize a belligerent country's assets during an ongoing conflict to aid a third party. The U.S. has floated an alternative proposalâsplitting the frozen funds between Ukrainian reconstruction and a U.S.-Russia investment vehicleâbut Brussels appears determined to proceed. However, Ukraine's worsening financial crisis complicates matters. Reuters recently reported that Kyiv is nearing default on $20 billion in debt to investors like BlackRock, raising doubts about its ability to repay any new loansâeven those backed by Russian assets. The EU's gamble on Russian assets risks backfiring spectacularly. If Moscow succeeds in reclaiming its funds through international courts, Western financial institutions could face chaos, with Euroclear at the center of the storm.

Title: From Cycles To Continuity: Why Bitcoin’s 4-Year Pattern May Be Breaking
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/from-cycles-to-continuity-why-bitcoins-4-year-pattern-may-be-breaking/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin has lost more than 30% of its value since early October, triggering a sharp shift in market psychology. What was once viewed as a routine correction is increasingly being interpreted by analysts as a potential cycle top. Sentiment has deteriorated quickly, with fear and apathy replacing the optimism that dominated earlier in the year. Many investors are now positioning defensively, preparing for what they believe could be a prolonged bear market phase similar to past post-peak cycles. However, a recent CryptoQuant report challenges this increasingly popular narrative. According to the analysis, Bitcoin may no longer be following the traditional four-year boom-and-bust cycle that has defined its historical price behavior. Instead, the report introduces the Bitcoin Supercycle thesis, which argues that the classic halving-driven cycle structure could be breaking down in favor of a more extended, structurally supported bull market. The core idea behind the supercycle framework is that Bitcoin’s market dynamics have fundamentally changed. Unlike previous cycles driven largely by speculative retail flows, the current environment is shaped by new forces that did not exist in earlier eras. These structural shifts may be altering how drawdowns, tops, and recoveries unfold, potentially smoothing volatility over longer time horizons. According to the CryptoQuant report, the case for a potential Bitcoin supercycle is built on structural forces that were absent in previous market cycles. The most significant shift comes from institutional adoption. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by issuers such as BlackRock, have introduced a persistent and regulated source of demand from traditional finance. Unlike speculative retail flows, these vehicles treat Bitcoin as a strategic asset allocation, creating steady absorption rather than short-lived hype. On-chain data further reinforces this narrative. Exchange reserves continue to trend lower, signaling long-term accumulation and reduced sell-side pressure. At the same time, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) remains relatively rational. Profit-taking is occurring, but without the euphoric spikes historically associated with cycle tops, suggesting a more mature and disciplined market structure. Infrastructure readiness is another critical pillar. While Bitcoin remains the core asset, scalability improvements across the broader crypto ecosystem—such as Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade and the rapid expansion of Layer-2 networks—are enabling faster, cheaper transactions and real-world use cases. This enhances Bitcoin’s role as a settlement and reserve asset within a growing digital economy. Finally, the macro backdrop remains supportive. Geopolitical instability and the prospect of future monetary easing strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal as a neutral, decentralized hard asset. Together, these forces form a credible foundation for an extended supercycle, though the report cautions that external shocks could still disrupt this trajectory. Bitcoin’s short-term structure remains fragile, as shown on the 4-hour chart. Price continues to trade below the $90,000 psychological level, with repeated failures to reclaim key moving averages reinforcing the bearish bias. The 200-period moving average (red) is clearly sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance near the $92,000–$93,000 zone, while the 100- and 50-period averages (green and blue) have compressed and rolled over, signaling fading upside momentum. After the sharp sell-off earlier in the month, Bitcoin attempted a recovery but stalled below descending resistance. Since then, the price has formed a series of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a short-term downtrend. The current consolidation around $86,000–$87,000 suggests indecision, but notably, bounces are becoming weaker, indicating limited demand on relief rallies. From a technical perspective, the $85,000–$86,000 area represents a critical support zone. A sustained break below this range would likely open the door to a deeper correction. Conversely, bulls would need a decisive reclaim of $90,000, followed by acceptance above the descending moving averages, to meaningfully shift momentum. Until then, the chart favors consolidation with downside risk.

Title: ‘Trump Accounts’ for kids get funding boost from Dalio and BlackRock
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/17/trump-accounts-for-kids-get-funding-boost-from-dalio-and-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-12-17T23:25:56Z
Full Content:
A new savings vehicle, dubbed “Trump accounts,” is designed to help the rising generation of American children build wealth into adulthood. Under the multitrillion-dollar tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump in July, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to accounts set up for every American baby born in the next few years. The initiative got a boost on Dec. 2 when billionaires Michael and Susan Dell announced a $6.25 billion gift to seed accounts for millions of older children as well. Other big names in business and finance, including Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio and BlackRock Inc., soon followed with smaller pledges of their own. Lawmakers significantly scaled back the flexibility and tax benefits of the program since the initial proposal. While the accounts could serve as a springboard for long-term savings, there are other investment vehicles, especially 529 plans, that offer greater tax advantages. Here’s how the accounts are supposed to work and how the new infusion of money might affect the program. For each account, annual contributions would be capped at $5,000, an amount that would be adjusted for inflation. The idea is for parents, relatives and even the employers of caregivers to pitch in money over time. The federal government, as well as state, local or tribal governments, could also contribute and aren’t subject to the cap. The accounts would be locked up until the child turns 18. At that point, Trump accounts essentially become individual retirement accounts, which can be used penalty-free for certain expenses such as higher education or first-time home purchases. Only one account is allowed per person. The US Treasury will issue regulations requiring the funds be invested in mutual or exchange-traded index funds (ETFs) that “primarily” hold US stocks. Funds must charge low fees and not use leverage, according to the law signed in July. Another exception to the contribution limit applies to nonprofits, including 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) organizations, which could give to recipients based on where they live. Parents, relatives, employers or philanthropists can contribute to a designated recipient’s Trump account through the year they turn 17. The Internal Revenue Service has said parents will be allowed to start contributing on behalf of children starting on July 4, 2026. Also, through a pilot program, the US government would contribute $1,000 to accounts for babies born from the beginning of 2025 through the end of 2028. Caregivers will be able to sign up children for an account through an online portal administered by the IRS. The commitments from corporations and well-heeled donors demonstrate how companies and business leaders are eager to demonstrate public support for a program that Trump views as part of his presidential legacy. Dalio said his foundation would donate $250 each to roughly 300,000 “Trump accounts” for children in Connecticut. BlackRock said it would match the federal government’s contributions to the accounts for employees’ children, seeding them with $1,000 each. Those pledges follow the Dells’ announcement in early December of a $6.25 billion gift aimed at seeding accounts for 25 million American children age 10 and under who were too old to be eligible for the initial government funding. The donation targets kids living in ZIP Codes with median incomes below $150,000. Each eligible account would receive $250 from the Dells. While that amount is unlikely to grow into a significant nest egg even over a couple decades, Michael Dell, founder of Dell Technologies Inc., said when he disclosed the gift that he hoped to inspire others to give as well. Trump accounts can’t be touched until age 18. At that point, they’re essentially treated like traditional individual retirement accounts. As with IRAs, money can be withdrawn early for certain qualified expenses, including higher education, up to $10,000 toward first-time home purchases and $5,000 per child for birth or adoption expenses. Other distributions trigger a 10% penalty. The accounts grow tax-free, and wouldn’t be taxed until money is withdrawn. Those taxes are complicated, and the US Treasury hasn’t yet issued rules on how exactly they will work. The law says recipients don’t pay taxes on any post-tax contributions to their accounts, such as those from parents and relatives. But any gains or tax-free contributions from government, philanthropists or employers will be taxed like ordinary income upon withdrawal. On top of that, beneficiaries would also face the 10% IRA withdrawal penalty if money is used for non-qualifying expenses. Lawmakers tweaked the Trump accounts so that distributions will be taxed as ordinary income. Early versions of the bill said distributions would be taxed at long-term capital gains rates, which are much lower than those on ordinary income. The accounts also were changed so that they follow IRA withdrawal rules, meaning a recipient’s small business startup costs no longer qualify for penalty-free distributions. Trump accounts have far fewer tax benefits than 529 college savings plans, which also have far higher contribution limits. With a 529 plan, withdrawals are tax-free for qualified educational expenses, and contributions are often eligible for state income tax deductions. Trump account holders would still pay taxes on withdrawals. The Trump accounts program will cost about $15 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a tiny fraction of the overall tax and spending package approved in July. An idea for government-funded “baby bonds” was first proposed by economist Darrick Hamilton, a professor at the New School for Social Research in New York, as a way to help poor Americans build assets and narrow the racial wealth gap. Several states, including Connecticut, have set up baby bond programs or are in the process of doing so. Hamilton has been skeptical of Trump accounts, calling them an idea to “address wealth inequality on the cheap.” One impetus for the overall approach appears to have come from Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, who along with economist Robert Shapiro last year began promoting the idea of accounts seeded with $1,000 for newborns. It’s a “simple solution to help people be connected to financial markets so everybody in the country shares in the wealth,” Hassett said at a presentation to the Aspen Institute in 2024. Greg Leiserson, an economist who served in the Biden and Obama administrations, warned “tax-preferred accounts primarily benefit families that already have spare time and money, not the families that need the most help.”

Coinbase is taking its biggest step yet into the broader financial sector. On Wednesday, the company announced customers will now be able to trade stocks on its platform, and also place bets on a wide range of events through a partnership with prediction market startup Kalshi. The moves signal that Coinbase is moving beyond its longtime roots as a cryptocurrency company, and are likely to intensify its rivalry with fintech firms like Robinhood. The stock trading and prediction markets announcements came at a San Francisco event titled System Upgrade that featured stage presentations by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and other executives, who also announced new trading features and a platform called Coinbase Business aimed at startups and small businesses. The event comes as the company is seeking to brand itself as an “everything exchange.” Notably, the company did not announce a release date for its own cryptocurrency token, which executives have teased in recent months, but without providing additional details beyond saying they want to ensure any token launch takes place in a fair manner. The new stock trading feature is the most significant announcement by far as it will be a crucial test of whether Coinbase can leverage its dominant crypto brand to expand into other sectors. It will also allow it to compete more directly with Robinhood, which made its name as a stock-trading app, but has since made significant inroads into crypto.Coinbase will initially offer only a curated list of major stocks and ETFs, but says it will expand this to thousands of other stocks in coming months. The company says stock trading will be available 24 hours a day on five days of the week, and that there will be no fee to trade. Early next year, Coinbase plans to roll out perpetual futures for stocks—a type of derivative pioneered by the crypto industry that lets traders hold options that do not expire. The perpetual futures offering will only be available outside the U.S. Coinbase’s new stock offerings come at a time when the financial market is beginning to embrace tokenization. The term describes turning a variety of assets into tokens that can be traded on a blockchain, a process that results in near-instant settlement and allows traders to more efficiently deploy collateral. Currently, firms like BlackRock are offering tokenized versions of Treasury bill and money-market funds. Tokenized stock offerings are still at a preliminary stage, but are expected to gain traction rapidly, which could play to Coinbase’s strengths given the firm’s longtime crypto expertise. For its prediction markets offering, Coinbase will source its order flow from Kalshi, which is the same model used by Robinhood. In practical terms, this entails acting as a distribution platform for the startup, which has grown exponentially this year by offering a new form of betting that invites users to wager against one another on the outcome of events ranging from elections to interest rate cuts to sports games. The Kalshi partnership will likely entail a revenue split of the small fee the platform collects on wagers. Stocks and prediction markets have the potential to offer Coinbase significant new revenue streams, and further the company’s long-stated goal of diversifying its business beyond crypto trading. Coinbase’s stock is roughly flat from the start of the year, having given up big gains in recent months as crypto markets have sagged and the price of Bitcoin has fallen around 30% from its October highs. Coinbase also used the San Francisco event to announce that its Base App is now available in 140 countries. The app, which debuted this summer, aims to let ordinary people launch financial and creative products on the company’s blockchain and earn a share of the revenue they create. Other services unveiled by Coinbase on Wednesday included expanded access to the Solana blockchain via a decentralized exchange, and an AI-powered wealth management tool called Coinbase Advisor.

Title: Ray Dalio donates $75 million to ‘Trump Accounts’ as Scott Bessent leads ‘50 State Challenge’ to invest in America’s kids

The U.S. Treasury asked major philanthropic donors to contribute to new investment accounts for children Wednesday as part of what Secretary Scott Bessent called a “50 State Challenge” to raise funds for the Trump Accounts program. “The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said in an address. The billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio, along with his wife Barbara, announced they would commit $250 to 300,000 children under 10 in Connecticut who live in ZIP codes where the median income is less than $150,000. Dalio founded the investment firm Bridgewater Associates and lives in Connecticut. “I have been fortunate to live the American Dream. At an early age I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life,” Ray Dalio said in a statement, adding that he sees the accounts as putting children on a path toward financial independence. The Dalios’ $75 million commitment follows the $6.25 billion pledge from billionaires Michael and Susan Dell earlier in December. The Dells promised to invest $250 in the accounts of 25 million children 10 and under who live in ZIP codes across the country that also have that median income. The new investment accounts were created as part of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending legislation, passed over the summer. Under the new law, the U.S. Department of the Treasury will deposit $1,000 into the investment accounts of children born during Trump’s second term. The Treasury has not yet launched the new accounts. “Starting on July 4th, our nation’s 250th anniversary, parents, family members, employers and friends will be able to contribute up to $5,000 to each Trump Account each year,” Bessent said Wednesday. Brad Gerstner, a venture capitalist, who championed the accounts, said the Treasury will create an account for every child in the U.S. who has a Social Security number but private companies will eventually administer the accounts. Parents or guardians will have to claim the accounts on behalf of their children. For children born before Trump came to office and who don’t qualify for the funds from the Dells and the Dalios, their families can open and fund their own Trump Account if they choose. Money in the accounts must be invested in an index fund that tracks the overall stock market. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business. Bessent said employers, family members and philanthropists can put funds into the accounts and that the administration hopes states will also eventually set up programs to invest in the accounts. Companies including Visa and BlackRock have also pledged to contribute in some way to the accounts of their employees’ children. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

BlackRock U.S. head of equity ETFs Jay Jacobs explains why more investors should activate active investing and analyzes market performance as stocks slip to kick off December on 'The Claman Countdown.' The exchange-traded fund industry is having a record year, with assets already hitting over $1 trillion, and active managers are driving a big part of that growth. "Third-quarter activity confirmed what we’ve seen building over the past several years: Active ETFs continue to drive innovation and flows," wrote Dan Aronson, managing director, ETF client product specialist group, in Janus Henderson’s "ETF Pulse" through the third quarter. Active managers can be part of the decision-making regarding which stocks to include using the convenience of an ETF. Active ETFs account for 80% of year-to-date launches, with assets under management growing 38% compared to 6% for passive ETFs, he noted. New launches are balanced between fixed income and equities. Janus Henderson reports strong activity among active ETFs (Janus Henderson Investors ) However, not all funds are created equal. Average assets under management are around $120 million for funds between two and three years old, compared to just $40 million for newer funds.

Title: Binance mulls new US strategy, CZ potentially reducing stake: Report
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-us-strategy-cz-reduce-stake
Time Published: 2025-12-17T18:50:29Z
Full Content:
Binance exited the United States in 2019, and a separate company, Binance.US, has been serving US customers since that time. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is considering a strategic reshuffling to strengthen its presence in the US market, a move that could see Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s majority stake in the company reduced. Zhao’s controlling stake in Binance has been a “major hurdle” to the company expanding to strategically critical US states, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. Although no concrete plans have been announced, the conversation surrounding any potential action remains reportedly “fluid.” The company is also considering partnerships with US-based companies, including asset manager BlackRock and decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which is linked to US President Donald Trump, to strengthen its footprint in the country. Rumors of Binance’s return to the US began to circulate in October after Trump pardoned Zhao, fueled by speculation from crypto industry executives and comments that Zhao made on social media. “Will do everything we can to help make America the capital of crypto and advance Web3 worldwide,” Zhao said in October after the pardon. In June 2019, Binance announced that it would stop serving US customers, and a separate company, called Binance.US and operated by BAM Trading Services, was formed to provide regulatory-compliant services to US users. In 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Binance Holdings Ltd. operated both Binance.com and BAM Trading Services. Binance.US does not feature crypto derivatives or access to the global Binance exchange’s liquidity and operates as a completely separate crypto exchange. Cointelegraph reached out to Binance and Binance.US but did not receive a response by the time of publication. The US is considered a key market for crypto exchanges and is ranked as the number two for global crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis’ 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index. Expanding to the US would open up US liquidity to the world’s largest crypto exchange. Related: Binance names co-founder Yi He co-CEO alongside Richard Teng Trump’s pardon of Zhao in October drew backlash from several Democratic Party lawmakers in the US, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and California Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Waters said the pardon was a form of pay-to-play and accused Trump of doing political favors for the crypto industry that “helped line his pockets.”Warren, who is one of the most vocal critics of the crypto industry, also criticized the pardon, characterizing it as “corruption.” The comments reflect pockets of resistance among some Democratic lawmakers to the crypto industry’s continued expansion in the US and could signal potential opposition to Binance returning to the US.

Hedge fund manager Ray Dalio has joined the list of billionaires backing President Donald Trump's new plan to give $1,000 to every child born in the next three years. Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, and his wife, Barbara, will donate $250 to about 300,000 children in Connecticut who live in zip codes where the median family income is $150,000 or less, Dalio Philanthropies said in a press release. "Barbara and I believe strongly in the importance of equal opportunity and believe this initiative is an important step in that direction," Ray Dalio said in the release. "I have lived the American dream. At an early age, I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life. By providing children with savings accounts that compound over time, we are providing them with early insights into financial literacy and a path towards financial independence." BlackRock, too, announced on Wednesday that it would "offer an employee match to the US government contribution of $1,000 for all eligible US employees to Trump Accounts." Several other business leaders, including Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have also committed to contributing funds to the accounts of their employees' children, according to Invest America, the federal program spearheaded by Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner that is now commonly known as "Trump Accounts." BNY, a financial services company, also announced last week that it would match Trump Account funds for its employees.

Since June, some of the country's wealthiest individuals have been lining up behind Trump's plan to provide a one-time, tax-free federal grant of $1,000 to every American child born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. The accounts will be in the child's name, but their parent will remain the sole custodian until the child turns 18. Others can contribute up to an additional $5,000 tax-free to those accounts every year. The program will officially launch on July 4, 2026. The Dalios' donation follows a substantial commitment from Michael and Susan Dell, who pledged to deposit $250 into the accounts of 25 million American kids — about $6.25 billion — earlier this month. The payments will be automatically deposited into the account of any child who fits the criteria and opens a Trump Account. However, not all billionaires are rushing to contribute to the Trump Accounts. The world's richest man, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, shared his thoughts on the Trump Accounts in a response on X to Ray Dalio, who had posted his praise for the program and Dells' contribution. "It is certainly a nice gesture of the Dells, but there will be no poverty in the future and so no need to save money. There will be universal high income," Musk wrote. Musk once said that Tesla's Optimus robot would "eliminate poverty." Dalio Philanthropies and BlackRock did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to
