By Blizzard Entertainment 1 day ago Once more, the Bronze Dragonflight has discovered growing disturbances in the timeways, with several rapidly intersecting our own! Starting today, Timewalk through a previous expansion each week for seven consecutive weeks, beginning and ending with the Battle for Azeroth. This grand tour through World of Warcraft's past delivers six new Timewalking Dungeons for players to undertake—Atal'Dazar, Freehold, King's Rest, Shrine of the Storm, Temple of Sethraliss, and Waycrest Manor. Players can also shop at a new Battle for Azeroth vendor located in the harbors of Boralus and Dazar'Alor. Also, for a limited time, the Timewalking quest available from the weekly quest giver will offer an increased reward—a Heroic level Cache of UndermineTreasures with items level 649-658. The reward upgrade is only available for this special Timewalking event. Those who run any Timewalking dungeon during the event get the “Knowledge of the Timeways” buff, granting a 5% increase to experience when killing monsters and completing quests. Completing Timewalking dungeons increases the effect and also extends its duration. This is a stacking buff, and after four applications, it transforms into “Mastery of the Timeways,” increasing the experience gained from killing monsters and completing quests to 30%. The buff lasts through death and is account-wide, which makes for an excellent opportunity to level up any alts. This season, you'll get the new Chrono Corsair mount for completing the “Master of the Turbulent Timeways III” achievement awarded to those distinguished champions who maintain “Mastery of the Timeways” for any five weeks during the event. Other rewards from previous Turbulent Timeways events, such as the Timely Buzzbee mount, can be found on the Timewalking vendor any week. Enemies and loot will automatically scale to your level. Timewalking dungeons also have a chance to drop items that usually drop when you run them on Heroic, and you'll earn Reputation with a faction associated with the dungeon. While Timewalking is active, you will gain a 50% bonus to reputations earned from quests and creature kills for all reputations related to the corresponding expansion. Here’s the expansion timeline for Turbulent Timeways: Venture into six of Battle for Azeroth’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Players will be able to venture into six of Mists of Pandaria’s storied dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Head to Outland to face Illidan and his cohorts once more! All week, open Group Finder (default hotkey: i) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown. When you hit ‘Find Group’, you’ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Magister’s Terrace After his defeat in Tempest Keep, Kael'thas Sunstrider publicly revealed his alliance with the ruthless Burning Legion. Intent upon summoning the demon lord Kil'jaeden, Kael'thas has returned to the Isle of Quel'Danas to make the final preparation for his master's arrival. Mana-Tombs The original exiles on Draenor found death to be an unsettling and unfortunate consequence of life, and so the draenei hid their dead away in the subterranean grave-city of Auchindoun, a labyrinthine marvel located beneath the forest of Terokkar. The Blood Furnace At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operation throughout the First and Second Wars. The Botanica The mighty Tempest Keep was created by the enigmatic naaru: sentient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of the Burning Legion. In addition to serving as a base of operations for the naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in the blink of an eye. The Shattered Halls At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operations throughout the First and Second Wars. The Underbog Coilfang Reservoir is the name for a naga-dominated compound that lurks under Zangarmarsh's deepest waters. The reservoir, punctured throughout by massive open pipes and pistons, seems big enough to house armies - and, yet, its purpose isn't strictly military. Prime your minds for an especially tangled chrono-spatial conundrum: Warlords of Draenor Timewalking is here! Players will be able to adventure into six of Warlords of Draenor’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Auchindoun Auchindoun is the holy mausoleum of the draenei, a sanctum of the Light in which the spirits of the dead find respite. The crystalline structure also serves to protect and shield draenei souls from their eternal enemies: the Burning Legion, who hunger for draenei spirits. This fact makes it a location of particular interest to Gul’dan and his Shadow Council, who seek to gain favor with their demonic masters. The Bloodmaul Slag Mines On the northern outskirts of Frostfire Ridge, the Bloodmaul ogres run a brutal mining operation amidst the sweltering heat of active volcanic caverns. Slaves from across Draenor are transported to the mines, never to leave alive. The Slag Mines produce abundant yields of gemstones and ore, but it is rumored that the true purpose of these mines is to dig for an ancient relic of immense power. The Everbloom After the disruption of the Dark Portal, the Kirin Tor realized that to fight the Iron Horde on their own soil, they would need a supply line to reinforcements. Thus, they created outposts across Draenor with magical links back to Azeroth. Unfortunately, what seemed like a prime strategic location near the Blackrock Foundry was known to botani as the Everbloom, a sacred place within the Gorgrond woodlands. The outpost was quickly overgrown, but it still contains a link to the outskirts of Stormwind. Grimrail Depot The Grimrail Depot is a vital hub in the Iron Horde war machine, allowing for the transport of troops and material produced in the Blackrock Foundry to the front lines of the war being waged across Draenor. The Depot's namesake is the Grimrail itself, a massive train that can bear entire battalions of troops and artillery. On this day, the Grimrail has been fitted with a massive railgun powerful enough to shatter the shield protecting Shattrath and is about to depart... Shadowmoon Burial Grounds The traditional burial grounds of the Shadowmoon clan are the final resting place for countless generations of ancestors. The fallen chieftain Ner’zhul, in the depths of his depravity, has sacrificed the very soul of his clan in a desperate quest for power. Now the ancestral spirits are restless, tormented, and used to fuel dark rituals that will pull all of Draenor into the void if allowed to run their course. Skyreach Atop the crowning pinnacle of the Spires of Arak, amidst the clouds, Skyreach stands as the seat of power of the Adherents of Rukhmar. The arakkoa have gathered and harnessed the Apexis technology of their forebears, and now they are ready to unleash the focused power of the sun upon their enemies. Prime your minds for a fel-tangled chrono-spatial conundrum and more in this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Black Rook Hold Carved from the greatest mountain of Val'sharah by ancient elven masons, Black Rook Hold stood as a bulwark against the Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients. The nigh-impregnable fortress is also the ancestral home of Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest, one-time mentor of Illidan himself. But since the latest Legion attack, a strange dark energy emanates from the Hold, and restless dead plague the surrounding lands. Court of Stars Even as Legion troops patrol the streets, casting a pall over the grand city of Suramar, the socialites of the Nightborne nobility continue to cling to custom and routine. On this clear night, the cry of revelers echoes through the chill air, as the largest mansion in the Noble District opens its doors for a grand gala. Rumor has it that Grand Magistrix Elisande herself may be making an appearance, in an effort to reassure several of her closest allies despite recent turmoil. Darkheart Thicket In the shadow of Shaladrassil, the Nightmare permeates every inch of the once-lush forest. Where the eldest and greatest druids once tended to the woods, meditating beneath the great world tree, corruption and madness now reign. Deep within the tangled thicket, the Nightmare Lord Xavius works to break the will of his greatest prize. Eye of Azshara Amidst outlying shoals off the coast of Azsuna, an ancient source of power lies beneath the waves. Long ago, the power of Queen Azshara extended throughout these lands, and the naga seeking the Tidestone of Golganneth still act at her behest. As clouds roll in and the air crackles with the energy of an approaching storm, Azshara's followers prepare to summon an incarnation of her Wrath to lay waste to the land. Neltharion's Lair The Earth Warder Neltharion, later known as Deathwing, once called this cavern home. Since his fall, the drogbar that once worshipped the great dragon built their capital within this ancient lair. Now, Dargrul, chieftain of the drogbar, rallies a massive army within these depths. Bolstered by the Hammer of Khaz'goroth, this army will surge from the mountainside if left unchecked, devastating Highmountain and threatening the security of all Azeroth. Vault of the Wardens This secret Warden facility was carved into the mountainside deep in Azsuna, and sealed with magical wards both to keep intruders out, and to ensure that the terrors locked within could never escape. Many of the most dangerous foes the Wardens have encountered were locked away within the Vault, but in the aftermath of Cordana's betrayal and the Legion's attack, those creatures now roam the halls freely. Players will be able to venture into five Classic dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons.

Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Mark your calendar, gather your allies, and prepare to take a Timewalking adventure!

Title: Crypto wrap: Ethereum ETFs hit ATH, SPX6900 cools off, XRP outlook remains bullish
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-wrap-ethereum-etfs-hit-ath-spx6900-cools-off-xrp-outlook-remains-bullish/
Time Published: 2025-06-17T16:34:49Z
Full Content:
Ethereum, XRP, and SPX6900 are moving in different but equally significant directions this week, revealing major developments across the crypto market. The market is showing signs of rotation, and investor attention is quickly shifting among top altcoins as new narratives unfold. While institutional accumulation pushes Ethereum ETFs to an all-time high in on-chain holdings, SPX6900 takes a breather after a parabolic rally, and XRP sustains a bullish tone despite ongoing legal hurdles. Institutional interest in Ethereum has sharply intensified, propelling ETF-related on-chain ETH holdings to their highest levels in history. Recent CryptoQuant data shows that Ethereum ETFs now retain close to 4 million ETH, with BlackRock leading a wave of accumulation that has accelerated throughout June. Notably, the ETFs have seen strong accumulation momentum even as the price of Ethereum (ETH) remains largely flat around the $2,500 mark. The spike in inflows, particularly from BlackRock and Grayscale, as depicted by Coinglass data, confirms that large funds are positioning early for a potential ETH rally. This surge in institutional buying comes amid growing optimism in Ethereum’s broader ecosystem, supported by increased activity in DeFi and rising stablecoin volumes. The aggressive accumulation further aligns with diminishing exchange reserves and rising staking levels, suggesting that the market is preparing for reduced ETH liquidity and possible upward price pressure. Notably, the inflows into Ethereum ETFs have surpassed Bitcoin ETFs over recent weeks, marking a significant shift in investor sentiment. As inflows continue to dominate daily activity, Ethereum may be setting the tone for the next wave of altcoin momentum. Meanwhile, SPX6900 has cooled off after an extraordinary 230% rally that played out between May and mid-June. The altcoin’s parabolic move took it from $0.50 to nearly retest its all-time high of $1.77 before losing steam around $1.70. The rally, which was initially triggered by a golden cross on May 6, followed a textbook parabolic structure with four accelerating legs and shallow pullbacks. However, a sharp decline in open interest and spot outflows of over $6.4 million on June 14 indicated a decisive shift in sentiment. Although the correction has been intense, technical indicators suggest that SPX6900 is entering a healthy consolidation phase rather than a full breakdown. The RSI has cooled from an overheated 75 to around 40, and the MACD has flipped bearish, signalling that momentum is resetting. Currently trading around $1.39, SPX6900 is holding key support at $1.30. A rebound from this level could see the token test $1.50 again, with a potential retarget of $1.71 if volume returns and sentiment stabilises. While Ethereum and SPX6900 shift gears, XRP continues to attract bullish interest even as its legal battle with the SEC drags on. Notably, a joint request from Ripple and the SEC to pause appeals until August 15 has not dampened optimism in the market. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP In light of the pending motion for an indicative ruling, the parties have requested that the Second Circuit continue to hold the appeals in abeyance, with the @SECGov to file a status report by August 15, 2025.https://t.co/7oQvL5Rx7U — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 The requested pause is tied to a pending ruling in the Southern District of New York regarding a $125 million escrow and the SEC’s demand for a $50 million penalty. Although the case remains unresolved, XRP derivatives show that traders are staying confident. Open Interest in XRP has climbed above $4 billion, and the positive funding rate suggests that leveraged long positions remain in play. Even though long liquidations have slightly outpaced shorts in the last 24 hours, the market bias remains bullish. From a technical standpoint, XRP recently bounced off the 200-day EMA and is now attempting to reclaim higher levels around the 50-day and 100-day EMAs near $2.24. If the price manages to close above those barriers, it could test resistance near $2.33, a level aligned with a trendline connecting the year’s previous peaks. Despite the indecisive RSI near 49, MACD indicators are leaning bullish, offering signs of a potential upside continuation if momentum follows through.

Title: Vehicle intelligence startup Applied Intuition raises $600M at $15B valuation

Time Published: 2025-06-17T16:00:01Z

UPDATED 12:00 EDT / JUNE 17 2025 by Kyt Dotson Applied Intuition Inc., a startup that develops technology for autonomous vehicles, trucks, drones and other intelligent platforms, today announced it has raised $600 million in late-stage funding, doubling its valuation to $15 billion. The company’s Series F financing was co-led by Blackrock-managed funds and the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. Additional funding came from Kleiner Perkins, Fidelity Management & Research, Lux Capital, BOND, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, Franklin Templeton and almost a half-dozen others. Founded in 2017, Applied Intuition provides a full toolchain of artificial intelligence options for delivering vehicle autonomy from simulation to an operating system called Vehicle OS. The company’s platform combines autonomy, voice, generative AI and developer tools so that any vehicle can make decisions based on environmental conditions. “We envision a world where vehicles do more than move people or goods,” said co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Peter Ludwig. “Whether it’s a car, a military drone or heavy equipment, each becomes an intelligence system that will anticipate needs and protect what matters most.” This funding comes around a year after AI raised $250 million at a $6 billion valuation led by Lux Capital and Elad Gil. More recently, the company entered into a partnership with OpenAI to enhance AI-powered in-vehicle experiences. As part of the deal, OpenAI’s ChatGPT was made available to Applied Intuition employees. Applied Intuition’s platform provides every layer for autonomy and design for consumer, industrial and defense. For consumer development, this means intelligent in-vehicle experiences by adding conversational, multimodal voice assistance and generative AI context-aware interactions inside and outside the vehicle. For enterprise-scale operations, AI assists with massive-scale data and machine learning infrastructure, neural simulation, AI agents and full vehicle testing to develop and validate next-generation automated driving and general vehicle software. In real-world operations, this results in full fleet and operational intelligence for efficient management and safety using real-time data, route optimization and automated reporting. “Vehicle intelligence isn’t just about adding another feature — it’s a fundamental shift. It’s about making vehicles safer, smarter, and more adaptable, and doing it at scale,” said co-founder and Chief Executive Qasar Younis. The company said the capital will help push further into the frontier of vehicle intelligence, especially across the sectors of automotive, commercial defense and off-road. Applied Intuition also said it intends to invest in expanding into new markets, such as the United Kingdom, to bring vehicle intelligence to a broader global audience and support international customers.

LONDRES – El reciente aumento de los rendimientos de la deuda pública ha obligado a empresarios e inversores de todo el mundo a plantearse una pregunta crucial: ¿las empresas deben endeudarse a las tasas de interés actuales antes de que sigan subiendo? Al mismo tiempo, el incremento de los costos del capital y la persistente volatilidad de los mercados están obligando a los inversores a reevaluar sus carteras. El interrogante se torna cada vez más urgente, ya que el rendimiento de los bonos del Tesoro estadounidense a diez años ha subido 50 puntos básicos, hasta el 4,5%, en menos de un mes. El rendimiento de los bonos del Tesoro a 30 años se acerca al 5% tras subir 30 puntos básicos solo en mayo. Más allá de las oscilaciones del mercado a corto plazo, al menos cinco cambios estructurales podrían remodelar el panorama económico mundial, con el potencial de trastocar las estrategias empresariales, erosionar los rendimientos de la inversión y socavar aún más las perspectivas de crecimiento. En primer lugar, el deterioro de la situación fiscal de Estados Unidos. Según las últimas previsiones de la Oficina Presupuestaria del Congreso (CBO por su sigla en inglés), el rendimiento del bono del Tesoro a diez años será del 4,1% en 2025 y bajará al 3,8% para 2035. Pero dado que el rendimiento del bono a diez años ya ronda el 4,5% y se espera que las tasas de interés se mantengan elevadas, el déficit federal podría aumentar mucho más rápidamente de lo previsto. La trayectoria fiscal de Estados Unidos ya es insostenible, y la CBO prevé que el déficit presupuestario federal aumente del 6,2% del PIB en 2025 al 7,3% en 2055. Y lo que es aún más alarmante, el ratio deuda-PIB -que actualmente representa el 124,3% del PIB- podría alcanzar el 156% para 2055 si persisten las tendencias actuales. La segunda causa de incertidumbre tiene que ver con las permutas de riesgo de crédito (CDS por su sigla en inglés), que contribuyeron a alimentar la crisis financiera global de 2007-2008. Desde que Moody's rebajó la calificación crediticia soberana de Estados Unidos de triple A a Aa1 en mayo, el costo de asegurarse contra un impago estadounidense ha aumentado considerablemente, ya que los mercados consideran cada vez más la deuda pública estadounidense como un activo de mayor riesgo. De hecho, los diferenciales de las CDS estadounidenses hoy superan a los de países con una calificación crediticia similar, como el Reino Unido, y cotizan a niveles comparables a los de Grecia e Italia, ambos con calificación BBB. Del mismo modo, asegurar la deuda pública estadounidense cuesta ahora más que asegurar los bonos del gobierno chino, a pesar de que la calificación de China es inferior a A1.

Register Now Un tercer problema es la opacidad de los mercados de crédito privados, lo que representa una vulnerabilidad estructural a largo plazo. BlackRock predice que los activos de crédito privado gestionados se duplicarán con creces hasta alcanzar los 4,5 billones de dólares en 2030. A medida que fluye más capital hacia los mercados privados -tanto de renta variable como de deuda-, la fijación de precios se vuelve menos transparente, lo que dificulta a los inversores la valoración de los activos. La continua expansión de los mercados privados opacos también hace subir el riesgo de que se acumule apalancamiento de forma inadvertida. Gran parte de esta deuda queda fuera del alcance de la supervisión regulatoria, lo que deja a los analistas y a los responsables de las políticas sin los datos necesarios para evaluar o modelar el verdadero alcance del riesgo sistémico. Los mercados de crédito no regulados pueden ser especialmente vulnerables a las quiebras en cascada, mientras que las tasas de interés persistentemente elevadas aumentan el riesgo de impago. Si no se abordan, estas vulnerabilidades podrían provocar dificultades financieras generalizadas y pérdidas de empleo, lo que, en última instancia, desencadenaría una recesión económica. En cuarto lugar, la relación entre el dólar estadounidense y las tasas de interés parece estar cambiando. Históricamente, el aumento de los rendimientos de los bonos ha apoyado un dólar más fuerte, mientras que la caída de los rendimientos tendía a debilitarlo. Sin embargo, desde finales de marzo, los rendimientos de los bonos han subido incluso cuando el dólar ha bajado un 6% frente al euro. Esta divergencia sugiere que los mercados globales están reevaluando la prima por la tenencia de dólares y ahora exigen mayores rendimientos. Las acciones estadounidenses también se han mostrado volátiles, lo que sugiere que la revalorización de las primas de riesgo de los activos denominados en dólares se extiende a los mercados de renta variable. El aumento de los rendimientos reduce el valor de los bonos existentes, lo que indica que los bonos del Tesoro ya no se consideran una cobertura fiable contra las turbulencias bursátiles. Por último, muchos estadounidenses siguen muy expuestos a la renta variable. Según una estimación, las acciones representan más del 70% de los activos financieros de los hogares estadounidenses. Esto hace que el reciente aumento de los rendimientos de los bonos y la mayor incertidumbre económica sean especialmente preocupantes, ya que ambos episodios apuntan a cambios fundamentales en la dinámica del mercado. Los líderes empresariales y los inversores con más probabilidades de éxito en este panorama tan cambiante serán aquellos que entiendan las implicancias de largo alcance de las tendencias económicas y geopolíticas. En un entorno marcado por una creciente incertidumbre, deben estar preparados para ajustar sus carteras y sus estrategias de asignación de capital para tener en cuenta una gama más amplia de riesgos y posibles resultados.

Without a change of regime by the people of Iran, for the people of Iran, there can be no long-term stability and prosperity there and in the region. By triggering an expensive and destabilizing strategic arms race, US President Donald Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" will not necessarily render America any safer from nuclear attack.

June 17, 2025 11:27 ET | Source: Northern 2 VCT PLC Northern 2 VCT PLC 17 June 2025 Northern 2 VCT PLCAnnual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 Northern 2 VCT PLC is a Venture Capital Trust (VCT) managed by Mercia Fund Management Limited. It invests mainly in unquoted venture capital holdings and aims to provide long-term tax-free returns to shareholders through a combination of dividend yield and capital growth. Financial highlights (comparative figures as at 31 March 2024): * Excluding proposed final dividend payable on 5 September 2025. ** Based on net asset value per share at the start of the period. ^ Definitions of the terms and alternative performance measures used in this report can be found in the glossary of terms in the annual report. Chair’s statement OverviewI am pleased to report that in the year ended 31 March 2025, the Company delivered a return of 3.8 pence per share (2024: 1.4 pence), equivalent to 6.6% of the opening net asset value (NAV) per share. Investment activity during the year remained buoyant with a total of £14.6 million invested in 17 promising early stage businesses, of which six were new investments. The Company divested its holdings in six companies, raising total proceeds of £11.0 million. In the financial year under review, we saw a change of government in the UK with the Labour Party elected in July 2024. Significant changes were announced in the 2024 UK autumn budget. The new government set out its priorities to drive economic growth. However it also saw tax rises and other changes to address the level of government borrowing. Positively, the 2024 UK autumn budget included the extension of the VCT scheme by a further 10 years which was very welcome as it gave certainty to the VCT sector allowing capital to continue to flow and be invested in early stage, high growth businesses. Although the UK economy has displayed some resilience, with inflation easing from its peak and interest rates starting to fall, there have been reductions in independent growth forecasts and the overall GDP growth outlook remains challenging. It is pleasing to note that the Company has continued its pace of investment activity and grown its NAV per share against this economic backdrop. Since the financial year end, there has been an increase in volatility in the financial markets driven by external factors. In particular, the trade policies of President Trump’s administration in respect of tariffs on international trading partners have had significant and wide-ranging impacts on political relations. This has resulted in a lowering of forecasts for global growth. Although the tariffs are on goods rather than services, the USA is a key market for expansion for a number of our portfolio companies and therefore an early resolution over trade arrangements will be welcomed. Despite the macroeconomic environment, our share offer to raise £15 million was oversubscribed and I would like to thank existing shareholders for their continued support and warmly welcome new investors. Proceeds from the share offer, together with sales proceeds from investments mean that the Company is well positioned both to pursue new opportunities to support small and medium businesses and to work with existing portfolio companies to realise their growth plans. Results and dividendThe NAV per share as at 31 March 2025, after deducting dividends paid during the year totalling 2.9 pence, was 58.3 pence compared with 57.3 pence as at 31 March 2024. Given the increase in NAV per share of the Company and the conditions for the payment of a performance fee being met, a performance fee of £321,000 (year ended 31 March 2024: £nil) is payable to the Manager and has been provided for in the financial statements. In 2018, your Directors set an objective of paying an annual dividend representing a yield of at least 5% of the opening NAV per share in each year whilst endeavouring to protect the NAV from erosion over the medium term. Your Board is conscious of the need to balance payment of dividends while also growing NAV per share and sees this as a medium term target. Given the number of profitable realisations over the past few years and the prospects for good realisations from the current portfolio, the Board considers that the 5% dividend target is still appropriate. Having already declared an interim dividend of 1.7 pence per share which was paid in January 2025, your Directors now propose a final dividend of 1.3 pence per share. The total of 3.0 pence per share is equivalent to 5.2% of the opening NAV of 57.3 pence per share, and is consistent with the total pence per share dividends declared in respect of the previous financial year. The proposed final dividend will be paid on 5 September 2025, subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. The target dividend yield will remain subject to regular review and the level of future dividend distributions will continue to reflect the level of returns generated by the Company in the medium term, the timing of investment realisations, the availability of distributable reserves and continuing compliance with the VCT scheme rules. Investment portfolioThe Company continues to be a generalist investor, with allocations predominantly in the software & AI, consumer and health & life sciences sectors. Investment levels have remained strong, with £9.3 million of capital provided to six new venture capital companies and £5.3 million of follow-on capital invested into 11 existing portfolio investments. There were six exits in the year, the most notable being Gentronix, sold for net proceeds of £5.2 million compared to an original cost of £1.2 million, a 4.5 times lifetime return. Over the year the Company saw increases in the valuations of portfolio by an aggregate of £5.3 million. Strong trading in a number of portfolio companies led to uplifts in valuations such as Pure Pet Food (£3.0 million), and Project Glow TopCo (t/a The Beauty Tech Group) (£3.4 million). It was also necessary to reduce the valuation of two portfolio companies in particular – Adludio (£2.6 million), due to the decision to cease funding, and Newcells Biotech (£1.5 million), due to poorer trading than expected. Your Directors always consider the state of the investment markets and how these might impact the valuations of the unquoted venture portfolio and have updated valuations to reflect current market conditions where appropriate. Cash balancesThe Company’s liquid funds are held in in a money market fund and interest bearing bank accounts. As at 31 March 2025, £31.0 million (out of a total of £38.1 million of cash and cash equivalent balances) was invested in the Blackrock ICS Sterling Liquidity Fund. Interest income generated from the Company’s liquid funds generated £2.1 million interest income in the year. Share offer and liquidityIn April 2024 shares related to the second allotment of the 2023/24 share offer, totalling £20 million, were issued. This allotment saw the issuance of 17,376,231 new ordinary shares, yielding gross subscriptions of £10.4 million. As a result of the public share offer launched in January 2025, 25,531,778 new ordinary shares were issued in April 2025, yielding gross proceeds of £15.0 million. The Board continues to monitor liquidity carefully and plans to raise up to £10 million of new capital in the 2025/26 tax year. Further details will be provided in due course. Our dividend investment scheme continues to operate. This enables shareholders to invest their dividends in new ordinary shares free of dealing costs and with the benefit of the tax reliefs available on new VCT share subscriptions. During the year 13.6% of total dividends were reinvested by shareholders. We have maintained our policy of being willing to buy back the Company’s shares in the market when necessary in order to maintain liquidity, at a 5% discount to NAV. During the year, a total of 7,774,750 shares were repurchased for cancellation, equivalent to approximately 3.7% of the opening share capital. Responsible investmentThe Company continues to be mindful of its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) responsibilities and we have outlined our evolving approach in the annual report. Board changesCecilia McAnulty, who has served on the board of the Company since 2014, shall be retiring after the Company’s AGM. Cecilia is the Company’s Senior Independent Director and prior to that served as the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. The Board would like to take this opportunity to extend their sincere thanks to Cecilia for her guidance, insights and commitment to the Company during her tenure. We wish her the best in her future endeavours. In addition, I will be stepping down as Chair of the Company on the conclusion of the Company’s AGM and will seek re-election to continue to serve as a non-executive director. Thomas Chambers who joined our board on 19 June 2024, and with whom I have worked closely, will succeed me as Chair. The Board intends to recruit an experienced director to support the investment strategy of the Company and our growth objectives. VCT legislation and qualifying status The Company has continued to meet the stringent and complex qualifying conditions laid down by HM Revenue & Customs for maintaining its approval as a VCT. The Manager monitors the position closely and reports regularly to the Board. Philip Hare & Associates LLP has continued to act as independent adviser to the Company on VCT taxation matters. Following final review by the European Union and the issuance of the necessary statutory instrument, in September 2024 the Sunset Clause was extended until 2035. The ‘Sunset Clause’ is a European state aid requirement which, without extension, would have removed the VCT tax reliefs that investors receive on newly issued VCT shares. Whilst no further amendments to VCT legislation have been announced, it is possible that further changes will be made in the future. We will continue to work closely with the Manager to maintain compliance with the scheme rules at all times. Investor communicationsThe Board is conscious of its responsibility to communicate transparently and regularly with shareholders. Investor information is contained on the Company website and communications are sent to shareholders who have consented to receive such information. We look forward to welcoming shareholders to our AGM and to our forthcoming investor seminar to be held on 7 October 2025 in London. A copy of our most recent newsletter and details of how to register for the October seminar can be found on the Company’s website at www.mercia.co.uk/vcts/n2vct/. Audit tender processFollowing a formal and rigorous audit tender process, the Audit and Risk Committee has resolved that it intends to recommend Johnston Carmichael LLP for appointment as the Company’s auditor for the financial year ending 31 March 2026, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM in 2025. Forvis Mazars will remain the Company’s auditor until the AGM in 2025. The Board would like to thank Forvis Mazars LLP for their diligent service over the past five years. Annual General Meeting The Company’s AGM will take place on 6 August 2025. The AGM provides an excellent opportunity for shareholders, directors and the Manager to meet in person, exchange views and comment. We intend to hold the 2025 AGM in person at Fora, 210 Euston Road, London, NW1 2DA. We also intend to offer remote access for shareholders through an online webinar facility for those who would prefer not to travel. Please note that shareholders attending remotely must register their votes ahead of time, as it will not be possible to count votes from online participants at the AGM. Outlook Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, our commitment remains steadfast in providing patient capital to nurture innovative early-stage businesses across the UK. We remain positive about the resilience, diversity and growth potential of the portfolio and its ability to generate long term shareholder value. We thank our investors for their continuing support.

Title: Trump Media Seeks Approval For Dual Crypto ETF Focused On Bitcoin And Ethereum

Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will invest in both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies. This filing, reported by Reuters, marks the second exchange-traded fund proposal from the company in less than two weeks, indicating a strong push into the digital asset market. If approved, the proposed Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and the Truth Social Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF would enter a crowded market already dominated by established players like BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin ETF boasts an impressive $72.5 billion in assets. Bryan Armour, an ETF analyst at Morningstar, emphasized the hurdles faced by new entrants in this sector. “It will be a challenge for any new entrant in this market,” he noted, adding that the primary ways to stand out will be through competitive fees or strong branding. Currently, similar exchange-traded funds charge operation fees around 0.12%, but details on the fees for Trump Media’s new offerings for the dual Bitcoin and Ethereum funds remain undisclosed. The latest filing also specifies an allocation strategy between Bitcoin and Ethereum, indicating that the fund will initially hold three Bitcoin for every Ethereum token. This approach suggests a strategic positioning that could appeal to investors looking for a balanced exposure to both leading cryptocurrencies. Sui Chung, CEO and chairman of CF Benchmarks, pointed out that the unique aspect of these ETFs may lie in their marketing strategy: There is little that is different about this new venture other than the way it could be markete. Given Truth Social’s involvement, it may very well be that (these) are marketed directly to individual investors and that this ends up getting attention from those investors in the same way that people who love their iPhones buy Apple stock At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $107,715, marking a 4.1% gain on the monthly timeframe. This comes as the market’s leading cryptocurrency failed once again to gain a foothold above the key $111,000 mark, preventing it from making new all-time highs. Currently, BTC is trading 4% below its record price. Ethereum, on the other hand, trades at approximately $2,613 per token. It has recorded gains of a little over 5% in the past thirty days and has been one of the best performers for June so far. Nevertheless, ETH remains well below its record high, which was reached nearly four years ago. There is a 46% gap between the current price and the record high of $4,878.

Title: Not So Fast, Netanyahu: Trump Assassination Plots Trace Back to Ukraine—Not Iran—While FBI Stonewalls on Crooks’ Encrypted Messages

Posted on 06/17/2025 6:52:46 AM PDT by delta7 On Sunday, June 15, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the explosive claim on Fox News’ Special Report with Bret Baier that Iran was behind the two assassination attempts on President Trump. We beg to differ. We, the American People, Invite the FBI & DOJ to Be Heroes of Transparency Uncover the Explosive Ukrainian-Linked Patterns in the Trump Assassination Plots and Include the Butler Attempt by Thomas Matthew Crooks Critical Data on Crooks’ Encrypted Communications Remains Hidden — Will the FBI & DOJ Step Up to Unveil Who Thomas Matthew Crooks Was Communicating With?……. ……..Now, we’re going to take you on an eye-opening journey through newly uncovered connections — a web of striking coincidences that should not only shock you but also reveal a clear and present danger. These revelations expose uncomfortable truths, and the American people now respectfully call on the directors of our intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice to address these serious questions directly to the American public. We specifically invite Kash Patel, Dan Bongino, and DOJ Director Pam Bondi to speak publicly about this critical information. If, for any reason, they are unable to disclose it due to an ongoing investigation, then at a minimum, they should immediately consider briefing the President of the United States. His life is on the line, and he deserves to know all the facts in the Butler case — including which encrypted networks the suspect was using, which overseas servers were involved, which platforms they belonged to, and most importantly, who he was communicating with: which handles, personas, or entities were on the other end…. Everyone remembers Ryan Wesley Routh, the deranged individual who showed up and lay in wait along the fence line of Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida — poised to ambush President Trump in a second assassination attempt….. …. While in Ukraine, Ryan Wesley Routh advocated for the war against Russia and spent time recruiting foreign fighters from Afghanistan. He appeared in a slickly produced propaganda video, and rumors quickly spread online claiming it was from BlackRock, similar to the one Thomas Matthew Crooks was seen in. However, this was not accurate and was quite possibly disinformation. Our investigation confirmed that the video Routh was seen in originated from a production team dedicated to the support of the Azov Battalion. It was first published on May 1, 2022, by the X account SAVE AZOV, which promotes the 4308 Regiment and urges Ukrainian authorities and world leaders to support the Azov Brigade. The video was produced by Олександр Алфьоров and appeared on a YouTube channel under the handle @OleksandrAlforov, directly connecting it to Azov’s media operation. Cellphone data confirms that on September 15, 2024, Routh positioned himself along the tree line at Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, waiting nearly 12 hours for an opportunity to strike. From 1:59 a.m. to 1:31 p.m., he remained stationed along the perimeter of the golf course — a chilling display of premeditation and patience. According to Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., President Trump’s decision to play golf that day was a last-minute decision, entirely off the record and not on his official schedule. “The president wasn’t even really supposed to go there,” Rowe stated. But Routh was already there — hours earlier. That suggests inside knowledge or surveillance beyond coincidence. A newly unsealed FBI affidavit reveals that 17-year-old Wisconsin native Nikita Casap — who murdered his parents, stole $14,000 in cash, and plotted to assassinate President Trump using a militarized drone — was communicating via Telegram with an overseas phone number registered to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s largest mobile carriers. Casap was communicating with at least two individuals connected to Ukraine. One of these handlers used the Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ,” which translates to Roman Viktorovych, linked to a Vodafone Ukraine phone number. The affidavit further reveals that Casap discussed post-assassination escape plans with Roman Viktorovych, asking how long he would need to hide before being moved to Ukraine and whether he could expect to live a normal life there. The Telegram account linked to the overseas phone number +380 50 259 5318 — registered under Vodafone Ukraine — was found to be communicating in Cyrillic script, specifically written in the Ukrainian language. The Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ” — written in Ukrainian Cyrillic — translates to Roman Viktorovych, the shadowy figure linked to a foreign cell guiding a would-be Trump assassin. How We Confirmed It Was Ukrainian, Not Russian: 1. Country Code +380 The +380 prefix is the internationally recognized country code for Ukraine, confirming the phone number is Ukrainian in origin. The mobile prefix 050 specifically identifies the number as belonging to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. 2. Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit.

These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson We beg to differ. We, the American People, Invite the FBI & DOJ to Be Heroes of Transparency Uncover the Explosive Ukrainian-Linked Patterns in the Trump Assassination Plots and Include the Butler Attempt by Thomas Matthew Crooks Critical Data on Crooks’ Encrypted Communications Remains Hidden — Will the FBI & DOJ Step Up to Unveil Who Thomas Matthew Crooks Was Communicating With?……. ……..Now, we’re going to take you on an eye-opening journey through newly uncovered connections — a web of striking coincidences that should not only shock you but also reveal a clear and present danger. These revelations expose uncomfortable truths, and the American people now respectfully call on the directors of our intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice to address these serious questions directly to the American public. We specifically invite Kash Patel, Dan Bongino, and DOJ Director Pam Bondi to speak publicly about this critical information. If, for any reason, they are unable to disclose it due to an ongoing investigation, then at a minimum, they should immediately consider briefing the President of the United States. His life is on the line, and he deserves to know all the facts in the Butler case — including which encrypted networks the suspect was using, which overseas servers were involved, which platforms they belonged to, and most importantly, who he was communicating with: which handles, personas, or entities were on the other end…. Everyone remembers Ryan Wesley Routh, the deranged individual who showed up and lay in wait along the fence line of Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida — poised to ambush President Trump in a second assassination attempt….. …. While in Ukraine, Ryan Wesley Routh advocated for the war against Russia and spent time recruiting foreign fighters from Afghanistan. He appeared in a slickly produced propaganda video, and rumors quickly spread online claiming it was from BlackRock, similar to the one Thomas Matthew Crooks was seen in. However, this was not accurate and was quite possibly disinformation. Our investigation confirmed that the video Routh was seen in originated from a production team dedicated to the support of the Azov Battalion. It was first published on May 1, 2022, by the X account SAVE AZOV, which promotes the 4308 Regiment and urges Ukrainian authorities and world leaders to support the Azov Brigade. The video was produced by Олександр Алфьоров and appeared on a YouTube channel under the handle @OleksandrAlforov, directly connecting it to Azov’s media operation. Cellphone data confirms that on September 15, 2024, Routh positioned himself along the tree line at Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, waiting nearly 12 hours for an opportunity to strike. From 1:59 a.m. to 1:31 p.m., he remained stationed along the perimeter of the golf course — a chilling display of premeditation and patience. According to Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., President Trump’s decision to play golf that day was a last-minute decision, entirely off the record and not on his official schedule. “The president wasn’t even really supposed to go there,” Rowe stated. But Routh was already there — hours earlier. That suggests inside knowledge or surveillance beyond coincidence. A newly unsealed FBI affidavit reveals that 17-year-old Wisconsin native Nikita Casap — who murdered his parents, stole $14,000 in cash, and plotted to assassinate President Trump using a militarized drone — was communicating via Telegram with an overseas phone number registered to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s largest mobile carriers. Casap was communicating with at least two individuals connected to Ukraine. One of these handlers used the Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ,” which translates to Roman Viktorovych, linked to a Vodafone Ukraine phone number. The affidavit further reveals that Casap discussed post-assassination escape plans with Roman Viktorovych, asking how long he would need to hide before being moved to Ukraine and whether he could expect to live a normal life there. The Telegram account linked to the overseas phone number +380 50 259 5318 — registered under Vodafone Ukraine — was found to be communicating in Cyrillic script, specifically written in the Ukrainian language. The Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ” — written in Ukrainian Cyrillic — translates to Roman Viktorovych, the shadowy figure linked to a foreign cell guiding a would-be Trump assassin. How We Confirmed It Was Ukrainian, Not Russian: 1. Country Code +380 The +380 prefix is the internationally recognized country code for Ukraine, confirming the phone number is Ukrainian in origin. The mobile prefix 050 specifically identifies the number as belonging to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. 2. Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump.

These revelations expose uncomfortable truths, and the American people now respectfully call on the directors of our intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice to address these serious questions directly to the American public. We specifically invite Kash Patel, Dan Bongino, and DOJ Director Pam Bondi to speak publicly about this critical information. If, for any reason, they are unable to disclose it due to an ongoing investigation, then at a minimum, they should immediately consider briefing the President of the United States. His life is on the line, and he deserves to know all the facts in the Butler case — including which encrypted networks the suspect was using, which overseas servers were involved, which platforms they belonged to, and most importantly, who he was communicating with: which handles, personas, or entities were on the other end…. Everyone remembers Ryan Wesley Routh, the deranged individual who showed up and lay in wait along the fence line of Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida — poised to ambush President Trump in a second assassination attempt….. …. While in Ukraine, Ryan Wesley Routh advocated for the war against Russia and spent time recruiting foreign fighters from Afghanistan. He appeared in a slickly produced propaganda video, and rumors quickly spread online claiming it was from BlackRock, similar to the one Thomas Matthew Crooks was seen in. However, this was not accurate and was quite possibly disinformation. Our investigation confirmed that the video Routh was seen in originated from a production team dedicated to the support of the Azov Battalion. It was first published on May 1, 2022, by the X account SAVE AZOV, which promotes the 4308 Regiment and urges Ukrainian authorities and world leaders to support the Azov Brigade. The video was produced by Олександр Алфьоров and appeared on a YouTube channel under the handle @OleksandrAlforov, directly connecting it to Azov’s media operation. Cellphone data confirms that on September 15, 2024, Routh positioned himself along the tree line at Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, waiting nearly 12 hours for an opportunity to strike. From 1:59 a.m. to 1:31 p.m., he remained stationed along the perimeter of the golf course — a chilling display of premeditation and patience. According to Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., President Trump’s decision to play golf that day was a last-minute decision, entirely off the record and not on his official schedule. “The president wasn’t even really supposed to go there,” Rowe stated. But Routh was already there — hours earlier. That suggests inside knowledge or surveillance beyond coincidence. A newly unsealed FBI affidavit reveals that 17-year-old Wisconsin native Nikita Casap — who murdered his parents, stole $14,000 in cash, and plotted to assassinate President Trump using a militarized drone — was communicating via Telegram with an overseas phone number registered to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s largest mobile carriers. Casap was communicating with at least two individuals connected to Ukraine. One of these handlers used the Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ,” which translates to Roman Viktorovych, linked to a Vodafone Ukraine phone number. The affidavit further reveals that Casap discussed post-assassination escape plans with Roman Viktorovych, asking how long he would need to hide before being moved to Ukraine and whether he could expect to live a normal life there. The Telegram account linked to the overseas phone number +380 50 259 5318 — registered under Vodafone Ukraine — was found to be communicating in Cyrillic script, specifically written in the Ukrainian language. The Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ” — written in Ukrainian Cyrillic — translates to Roman Viktorovych, the shadowy figure linked to a foreign cell guiding a would-be Trump assassin. How We Confirmed It Was Ukrainian, Not Russian: 1. Country Code +380 The +380 prefix is the internationally recognized country code for Ukraine, confirming the phone number is Ukrainian in origin. The mobile prefix 050 specifically identifies the number as belonging to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. 2. Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion. The Tesla Cybertruck Explosion Outside Trump International Hotel On January 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The driver, identified as 37-year-old U.S. Army Master Sergeant Matthew Livelsberger, was a highly decorated Green Beret with deployments in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia, and the Congo. Authorities reported that Livelsberger shot himself in the head just before the explosion, which was caused by fireworks and fuel canisters packed inside the vehicle.…… TOPICS: Crime/Corruption; Foreign Affairs; Government KEYWORDS: assasination; ukraine Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson We specifically invite Kash Patel, Dan Bongino, and DOJ Director Pam Bondi to speak publicly about this critical information. If, for any reason, they are unable to disclose it due to an ongoing investigation, then at a minimum, they should immediately consider briefing the President of the United States. His life is on the line, and he deserves to know all the facts in the Butler case — including which encrypted networks the suspect was using, which overseas servers were involved, which platforms they belonged to, and most importantly, who he was communicating with: which handles, personas, or entities were on the other end…. Everyone remembers Ryan Wesley Routh, the deranged individual who showed up and lay in wait along the fence line of Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida — poised to ambush President Trump in a second assassination attempt….. …. While in Ukraine, Ryan Wesley Routh advocated for the war against Russia and spent time recruiting foreign fighters from Afghanistan. He appeared in a slickly produced propaganda video, and rumors quickly spread online claiming it was from BlackRock, similar to the one Thomas Matthew Crooks was seen in. However, this was not accurate and was quite possibly disinformation. Our investigation confirmed that the video Routh was seen in originated from a production team dedicated to the support of the Azov Battalion. It was first published on May 1, 2022, by the X account SAVE AZOV, which promotes the 4308 Regiment and urges Ukrainian authorities and world leaders to support the Azov Brigade. The video was produced by Олександр Алфьоров and appeared on a YouTube channel under the handle @OleksandrAlforov, directly connecting it to Azov’s media operation. Cellphone data confirms that on September 15, 2024, Routh positioned himself along the tree line at Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, waiting nearly 12 hours for an opportunity to strike. From 1:59 a.m. to 1:31 p.m., he remained stationed along the perimeter of the golf course — a chilling display of premeditation and patience. According to Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., President Trump’s decision to play golf that day was a last-minute decision, entirely off the record and not on his official schedule. “The president wasn’t even really supposed to go there,” Rowe stated. But Routh was already there — hours earlier. That suggests inside knowledge or surveillance beyond coincidence. A newly unsealed FBI affidavit reveals that 17-year-old Wisconsin native Nikita Casap — who murdered his parents, stole $14,000 in cash, and plotted to assassinate President Trump using a militarized drone — was communicating via Telegram with an overseas phone number registered to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s largest mobile carriers. Casap was communicating with at least two individuals connected to Ukraine. One of these handlers used the Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ,” which translates to Roman Viktorovych, linked to a Vodafone Ukraine phone number. The affidavit further reveals that Casap discussed post-assassination escape plans with Roman Viktorovych, asking how long he would need to hide before being moved to Ukraine and whether he could expect to live a normal life there. The Telegram account linked to the overseas phone number +380 50 259 5318 — registered under Vodafone Ukraine — was found to be communicating in Cyrillic script, specifically written in the Ukrainian language. The Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ” — written in Ukrainian Cyrillic — translates to Roman Viktorovych, the shadowy figure linked to a foreign cell guiding a would-be Trump assassin. How We Confirmed It Was Ukrainian, Not Russian: 1. Country Code +380 The +380 prefix is the internationally recognized country code for Ukraine, confirming the phone number is Ukrainian in origin. The mobile prefix 050 specifically identifies the number as belonging to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. 2. Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion. The Tesla Cybertruck Explosion Outside Trump International Hotel On January 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The driver, identified as 37-year-old U.S. Army Master Sergeant Matthew Livelsberger, was a highly decorated Green Beret with deployments in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia, and the Congo. Authorities reported that Livelsberger shot himself in the head just before the explosion, which was caused by fireworks and fuel canisters packed inside the vehicle.…… TOPICS: Crime/Corruption; Foreign Affairs; Government KEYWORDS: assasination; ukraine Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Our investigation confirmed that the video Routh was seen in originated from a production team dedicated to the support of the Azov Battalion. It was first published on May 1, 2022, by the X account SAVE AZOV, which promotes the 4308 Regiment and urges Ukrainian authorities and world leaders to support the Azov Brigade. The video was produced by Олександр Алфьоров and appeared on a YouTube channel under the handle @OleksandrAlforov, directly connecting it to Azov’s media operation. Cellphone data confirms that on September 15, 2024, Routh positioned himself along the tree line at Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, waiting nearly 12 hours for an opportunity to strike. From 1:59 a.m. to 1:31 p.m., he remained stationed along the perimeter of the golf course — a chilling display of premeditation and patience. According to Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., President Trump’s decision to play golf that day was a last-minute decision, entirely off the record and not on his official schedule. “The president wasn’t even really supposed to go there,” Rowe stated. But Routh was already there — hours earlier. That suggests inside knowledge or surveillance beyond coincidence. A newly unsealed FBI affidavit reveals that 17-year-old Wisconsin native Nikita Casap — who murdered his parents, stole $14,000 in cash, and plotted to assassinate President Trump using a militarized drone — was communicating via Telegram with an overseas phone number registered to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s largest mobile carriers. Casap was communicating with at least two individuals connected to Ukraine. One of these handlers used the Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ,” which translates to Roman Viktorovych, linked to a Vodafone Ukraine phone number. The affidavit further reveals that Casap discussed post-assassination escape plans with Roman Viktorovych, asking how long he would need to hide before being moved to Ukraine and whether he could expect to live a normal life there. The Telegram account linked to the overseas phone number +380 50 259 5318 — registered under Vodafone Ukraine — was found to be communicating in Cyrillic script, specifically written in the Ukrainian language. The Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ” — written in Ukrainian Cyrillic — translates to Roman Viktorovych, the shadowy figure linked to a foreign cell guiding a would-be Trump assassin. How We Confirmed It Was Ukrainian, Not Russian: 1. Country Code +380 The +380 prefix is the internationally recognized country code for Ukraine, confirming the phone number is Ukrainian in origin. The mobile prefix 050 specifically identifies the number as belonging to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. 2. Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson A newly unsealed FBI affidavit reveals that 17-year-old Wisconsin native Nikita Casap — who murdered his parents, stole $14,000 in cash, and plotted to assassinate President Trump using a militarized drone — was communicating via Telegram with an overseas phone number registered to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s largest mobile carriers. Casap was communicating with at least two individuals connected to Ukraine. One of these handlers used the Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ,” which translates to Roman Viktorovych, linked to a Vodafone Ukraine phone number. The affidavit further reveals that Casap discussed post-assassination escape plans with Roman Viktorovych, asking how long he would need to hide before being moved to Ukraine and whether he could expect to live a normal life there. The Telegram account linked to the overseas phone number +380 50 259 5318 — registered under Vodafone Ukraine — was found to be communicating in Cyrillic script, specifically written in the Ukrainian language. The Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ” — written in Ukrainian Cyrillic — translates to Roman Viktorovych, the shadowy figure linked to a foreign cell guiding a would-be Trump assassin. How We Confirmed It Was Ukrainian, Not Russian: 1. Country Code +380 The +380 prefix is the internationally recognized country code for Ukraine, confirming the phone number is Ukrainian in origin. The mobile prefix 050 specifically identifies the number as belonging to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. 2. Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion. The Tesla Cybertruck Explosion Outside Trump International Hotel On January 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The driver, identified as 37-year-old U.S. Army Master Sergeant Matthew Livelsberger, was a highly decorated Green Beret with deployments in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia, and the Congo.

How We Confirmed It Was Ukrainian, Not Russian: 1. Country Code +380 The +380 prefix is the internationally recognized country code for Ukraine, confirming the phone number is Ukrainian in origin. The mobile prefix 050 specifically identifies the number as belonging to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. 2. Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion. The Tesla Cybertruck Explosion Outside Trump International Hotel On January 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The driver, identified as 37-year-old U.S. Army Master Sergeant Matthew Livelsberger, was a highly decorated Green Beret with deployments in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia, and the Congo. Authorities reported that Livelsberger shot himself in the head just before the explosion, which was caused by fireworks and fuel canisters packed inside the vehicle.…… TOPICS: Crime/Corruption; Foreign Affairs; Government KEYWORDS: assasination; ukraine Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone.

Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion.

Authorities reported that Livelsberger shot himself in the head just before the explosion, which was caused by fireworks and fuel canisters packed inside the vehicle.…… TOPICS: Crime/Corruption; Foreign Affairs; Government KEYWORDS: assasination; ukraine Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion. The Tesla Cybertruck Explosion Outside Trump International Hotel On January 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The driver, identified as 37-year-old U.S. Army Master Sergeant Matthew Livelsberger, was a highly decorated Green Beret with deployments in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia, and the Congo. Authorities reported that Livelsberger shot himself in the head just before the explosion, which was caused by fireworks and fuel canisters packed inside the vehicle.…… TOPICS: Crime/Corruption; Foreign Affairs; Government KEYWORDS: assasination; ukraine Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Business FILE PHOTO: Four thousand U.S. dollars are counted out by a banker counting currency at a bank in Westminster, Colorado November 3, 2009. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo Applied Intuition raised $600 million in a funding round and tender offer that valued the automotive software supplier at $15 billion, more than doubling its valuation from last year in a sign of strong investment appetite for autonomous vehicle technology. The round was co-led by BlackRock-managed funds and accounts alongside venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. New investors included Franklin Templeton and Qatar Investment Authority, the company said on Tuesday. In the previous round in March last year, the company was valued at $6 billion and included funding from Porsche, in what was the first time the startup raised money from an automaker. The funds will help Applied Intuition double down on investments in autonomous technology at a time when companies across the sector attempt to ramp up their push for self-driving cars.

Title: Spiritans’ promise of redress must be ‘substantiated by actions’, says abuse survivors group
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2025/06/17/spiritans-promise-of-redress-must-be-substantiated-by-actions-says-abuse-survivors-group/
Time Published: 2025-06-17T12:43:56Z

Redress proposals for abuse survivors by the Spiritan congregation, which runs Blackrock College and other leading schools in Ireland, “urgently needs to be substantiated by actions”, survivors’ group Restore Together has said. It represents people who were sexually abused at Spiritan-run schools. Group spokesman Philip Feddis said “urgent delivery of a victim-centred, non-adversarial redress scheme is critical”. Ongoing delays on the order’s part are “undermining the benefits of what has been delivered to date”, he said. His comments follow a public commitment by Spiritan Provincial Fr Brendan Carr to pay redress to survivors of abuse in the schools. By last November, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including the 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published last September. In an open letter on Monday to survivors of abuse by members and employees of the Spiritans, Fr Carr announced “a restorative framework which we hope can help all to arrive at a different place in this painful and difficult journey”. This, he said, was prepared “with the help of Restore Together, One Voice, and other significant advocates and individuals who were abused in our schools and other contexts, who have engaged directly with us”. Fr Carr said the Spiritans have established a “finance advisory team, with the expertise to lead a strategic restructuring of the Province’s assets”. It would “fast-track the development of sustainable funding streams, including immediate and medium-term provisions for redress”. He hoped that by the end of this summer he could “provide a further, more detailed update of the progress we are making in forging new paths to create a just redress scheme”. In response, Mr Feddis said “victims/survivors will judge the statement based on actions and how soon they receive restorative justice in its entirety”. He stated that a redress scheme is the “most urgent and important element”. Delivery of a full restorative justice programme by the Spiritans is “already long overdue”, Mr Feddis added. The order’s “ongoing delays” undermine what has been delivered to date – an apology and therapy – and “diminishes the potential for restorative justice to have full effect for victims/ survivors”, he said. Victims and survivors must have “active decision-making input” in determining what is best for their healing, Mr Feddis said, adding that “justice delayed is justice denied, and that is where we are at”. He said Restore Together will work intensively with the Spiritans to address how the three inactivated elements of the programme can be “enabled as soon as humanly possible”.

Title: Is The Green Transition Financially Viable Today? A Debate At SXSW London

ByJoan Michelson ByJoan Michelson, Contributor. Debaters at SXSW London Nature & Climate House. L to R: Marissa Drew, Fiona Howarth, Rhian-Mari ... More Thomas, Erinch Sahan, Chaitanya Kumar and Kathy Baughman-McLeod. “What we are trying to get at is whether we can realistically and successfully invest our way to a green future considering our current economic system and the state of the climate emergency.” That is how Sophie Lambin, CEO of Kite Insights, tee’d up a friendly debate held at SXSW London last week in one of the more interesting sessions there. SXSW London Street sign Kite Insights curated it and moderated the “for” side of the debate. Stephen Dunbar-Johnson, president, International of The New York Times Company, moderated the “against” side. Held at the Nature & Climate House, presented by SXSW London partner Bellwethers Group on June 5th in the heart of London’s Shoreditch neighborhood, the “debate” including six expert debaters. Debate moderators, Sophie Lambin and Stephen Dunbar-Johnson Three experts argued on the “for” side that the green transition is financially viable today. They were: Rhian-Mari Thomas, Ph.D., CEO, Green Finance Institute; Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer, Standard Chartered Bank; and Fiona Howarth, Founder/CEO of Octopus Electric Vehicles. The three experts arguing “against,” that is that the green transition is not financially viable today, were: Enrich Sahan, Business and Enterprise Lead at Doughnut Economics Action Lab; Chaitanya Kumar, Acting Head of Economic and Environmental Policy at the New Economics Foundation; and Kathy Baughman-McLeod, CEO of Climate Resilience For All. UN Estimates Green Economy worth $10 trillion - 2022, press.un.org “The UN estimates that globally the green economy could be worth $10.3 trillion by 2030, and the IEA (International Energy Agency) says it could be as much as $100 trillion by 2050. These are humongous numbers, but it's not just about the numbers,” Dunbar-Johnson said, framing the discussion. Thomas summarized the “for” team’s position by saying, “We stand firmly in support of the motion. Yes, the green transition is financially viable. Indeed. Not only is it viable, it is economically strategic, it is socially imperative and it is already underway.” Debate - Fiona Howarth Howarth went so far as to call it, “the biggest financial opportunity that we have seen for decades, both for s companies and individuals.” Then the “for” team quoted statistics including: Rhian-Mari Thomas headshot, from SXSW London website Thomas explained that, “The upfront investments in clean energy, sustainable infrastructure, and low carbon technologies are not costs to be feared or to be avoided. They're investments that shield us, that protect us from the catastrophic economic consequences of unchecked climate change. Trillions in disaster damages, food system breakdowns, migration crises and social unrest. Every fraction of a degree we prevent not only saves economies, but it saves lives.” “It isn't viable today. That's what we are debating,” Erinch Sahan began the arguments for the “against” team. He removed his belt to dramatically illustrate that, “Financial markets have become a straitjacket. It's wrapped around business, it's wrapped around economic activities wrapped around governments, it's wrapped around the private sector and it's become a straitjacket on the transition itself.” He described it as “an economy that's in service to finance,” which is inconsistent with the green economy. Erinch Sahan These are the facts the ”against” team cited: These factoids “symbolize the fact that incumbent power and the political economy of the transition is still very much held by fossil fuel interests around the world,” Kumar said. Screenshot - UN Women, how climate change & gender inequality are interconnected - April 2025 Baughman-McLeod added their view that the transition is not viable at this moment also because, “Externalities that are absolutely freed while shareholders and companies take home profit. Biodiversity is lost, children are working in mines. We have sweatshops, we have methane and carbon pollution pumping out, it's free, and the shareholders take the money and everyone else gets the short end of the stick. (This is) the market we have, not necessarily the market we wish to have.” “Externalities” also include the impact on women, she emphasized, who often suffer miscarriages, lost wages, and poor health as a result of climate-exacerbated conditions. Which side made the best argument in your view? *Note: This took place in the U.K. so some experts quoted in US dollars and others in British pounds.

Title: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge

As Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market show tentative signs of recovery following the most recent correction, a crypto analyst has made a bold statement suggesting that the market may have already reached its peak. BladeDeFi, in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), warned followers that a significant downturn could be on the horizon, predicting a challenging summer ahead for the crypto space. In his post, BladeDeFi emphasized that “crypto has already PEAKED” and forecasted a potential slump where alternative cryptocurrencies could see declines of up to 95%. He indicated that most indicators are flashing red, suggesting that the market is on the brink of a significant downturn. According to him, Bitcoin has already hit its all-time high early in the current cycle and is now trapped in a “slow-motion downtrend,” with each subsequent bounce becoming weaker than the last. The analyst pointed out a concerning trend: retail investors are becoming exhausted, while larger institutional players have begun to exit the market. Major firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and MicroStrategy are reportedly rotating their investments and hedging their positions, often without making their actions overtly public. The analyst suggests that this shift leaves retail investors vulnerable, potentially left holding depreciating assets as liquidity in the market continues to dwindle. BladeDeFi also criticized the current market dynamics, warning that sudden price increases or “green candles” are often deceptive, serving only to entice late buyers into traps that lead to further losses. He noted that without new capital inflows—such as fresh stimulus or significant investment—the recent price pumps lack sustainability. The absence of liquidity means that any upward movements are likely to be fleeting, and the overall trend remains downward. Adding to the bearish sentiment, another analyst, Peppeso, echoed similar concerns, suggesting that the top of the 2025 bull market has already been established. Peppeso observed historical patterns in previous market cycles, noting that while bull markets have become longer, bear markets have shortened and softened in their impact. Despite this, Bitcoin has consistently reached all-time highs in the final months of each cycle, reinforcing Peppeso’s expectation of a peak around November or December 2025. The current market environment is further complicated by macroeconomic factors, including rising interest rates and increasing geopolitical risks. With uncertainty clouding the outlook, many investors are adopting a risk-off approach, leading to a sustained downtrend in the crypto market. Even popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced significant declines of 9% and 7% in the past week alone respectively, indicating that the hype surrounding these assets is fading.

Title: Wall Street pay is headed for change as more firms embrace alternative assets: Report
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-goldman-sachs-carried-interest-private-equity-johnson-report-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-17T09:00:02Z

More Wall Street executives are getting paid like private equity bosses — a trend that's only going to continue as the lines between public and private markets blur, according to a new report. Wall Street compensation firm Johnson Associates released a report this month predicting that more investment banks and traditional asset managers will start paying their executives with a form of compensation traditionally associated with the private equity industry. Carried interest is a share of the profits earned by investment managers, often 20%, after a fund returns capital to investors. It's helped many private equity bosses reach billionaire status in recent decades. "Many financial services firms see alternatives as a key area of growth for the future," said Bryan Liou, managing director at Johnson Associates. "They want to emphasize it, they want to signal to the market that they're serious about it." He pointed to BlackRock, known for its bonds and ETFs business. The $12 trillion asset manager has been expanding into real estate, infrastructure, and other alternative assets in an effort to diversify into private investments. Last year, BlackRock's board introduced a carried interest component to CEO Larry Fink's future pay for the first time, SEC documents show. Goldman Sachs also paid CEO David Solomon and other C-Suite executives a portion of their compensation through carry last year for the first time ever. BlackRock said it made the change to "align CEO compensation with the evolution of BlackRock's private markets platform." Goldman, in an SEC filing, said the change will help it compete for talent with alternative asset managers. At both firms, carried interest payments were previously reserved for professionals who worked directly in private markets investing. As more firms look to expand their private markets offerings, however, interest in carried interest is expected to grow. "I think this is the beginning of a longer-term trend," said Liou. "This is the first time we've seen it, but it's certainly not the last time we'll see it, and we certainly don't think it's going to be limited to just BlackRock and Goldman Sachs in the future."

Title: Swiss asset manager Partners Group sets up ADGM office in regional expansion push | The National
URL: https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/2025/06/17/swiss-asset-manager-partners-group-sets-up-adgm-office-in-regional-expansion-push/
Time Published: 2025-06-17T05:46:59Z

Business June 17, 2025 Partners Group, a Switzerland-based private market investment company with $150 billion in assets under management, is expanding its presence in the Middle East with the opening of a new regional headquarters in Abu Dhabi financial centre ADGM. The push to broaden its regional footprint is part of the company’s strategy to tie up with institutional investors to capitalise on opportunities within the technology-led transformation of industries, “often with a nexus to the region”, it said in a statement on Tuesday. The move is about breaking bread with investors, being close and enabling a deeper partnership to invest globally, Partners Group's regional managing director told The National. "We cut out the noise," Suhail Albaz said. "We try and make our decisions based on our strategic priorities. We appreciate that there are people that you know, are trying to come over here and have short-term goals, but that's not us." Steffen Meister, executive chairman of the board, said Abu Dhabi is "increasingly becoming a centre of gravity for global advancements in technology, energy, next-generation manufacturing and digital services". “It is attracting increasing amounts of capital, drawn to the regional investment opportunities and the chance to partner with Abu Dhabi’s cutting-edge investors on global transactions," he added. Expansion to the UAE capital has increased the number of global offices operated by the company to 22. Partners Group joins a growing list of asset managers, insurers, financial institutions and investment houses that have chosen to set up a base in the financial hub and use it as a platform for their regional expansion. Last week, Harrison Street, a $56 billion US-based real estate and infrastructure investment manager, said it is entering the Middle East market with the opening of an office at ADGM, after it received a financial services licence from ADGM's regulator, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority. In February, German asset manager Patrizia was granted approval by the FSRA to start operations at ADGM. The Augsburg-based company, which has about €55 billion ($57.7 billion) in assets under management, plans to arrange and advise real estate investments for clients in the region. The two real estate managers add to a stream of companies that are eager to tap into the Middle East's growing investment market. New York-based BlackRock, the world's top asset manager with nearly $11.5 trillion in assets under management, in November received a commercial licence to operate at ADGM. In September, ADGM welcomed its first trillion-dollar asset managers – PGIM, the global asset management business of the New York Stock Exchange-listed Prudential Financial, and Chicago investment firm Nuveen, with both aiming to expand their operations and client bases in the Middle East. The flurry of new additions has pushed the number of companies in ADGM higher during the first quarter of this year, with assets under management also increasing by 33 per cent annually, the financial hub said this month. The total number of entities operating at ADGM rose by 43 per cent annually to 2,781 in the first three months of this year, it said in a statement. At the end of last year, the financial zone had 2,381 operational entities. Partners Group has maintained a presence in the Middle East since the opening of its Dubai office in 2010. The firm’s investment mandate span private equity, private credit, infrastructure and real estate among other asset classes. Education and health care have been the leading investment themes, said Mr Albaz, given they have natural demand drivers around them, making them an easier entry point into the Middle East. Its current regional portfolio of companies employ more than 2,000 people and many are expanding their footprint. International School Partnerships, founded by Partners Group in 2013, has recently acquired its 10th school in the Middle East, it said. Partners Group is actively assessing investment opportunities in renewables and luxury retail sector companies with solid fundamentals, targeting $1 billion to $1.2 billion equity investment. Mr Albaz said. “The Middle East is a key growth area for Partners Group and we plan to significantly develop our business in the GCC and across the broader region,” said Mr Albaz, who also leads the Abu Dhabi office. "Not only are we focused on deepening our network of regional clients and business partners, but we are also actively pursuing the growing opportunities for transformational investing offered to our portfolio of businesses and assets by establishing themselves in the Middle East.” What is a credit score? In the UAE your credit score is a number generated by the Al Etihad Credit Bureau (AECB), which represents your credit worthiness – in other words, your risk of defaulting on any debt repayments. In this country, the number is between 300 and 900. A low score indicates a higher risk of default, while a high score indicates you are a lower risk. Why is it important? Financial institutions will use it to decide whether or not you are a credit risk. Those with better scores may also receive preferential interest rates or terms on products such as loans, credit cards and mortgages. How is it calculated? The AECB collects information on your payment behaviour from banks as well as utilitiy and telecoms providers. How can I improve my score? By paying your bills on time and not missing any repayments, particularly your loan, credit card and mortgage payments. It is also wise to limit the number of credit card and loan applications you make and to reduce your outstanding balances. How do I know if my score is low or high? By checking it. Visit one of AECB’s Customer Happiness Centres with an original and valid Emirates ID, passport copy and valid email address. Liv. customers can also access the score directly from the banking app. How much does it cost? A credit report costs Dh100 while a report with the score included costs Dh150. Those only wanting the credit score pay Dh60. VAT is payable on top.

Title: Record‑High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence

Ethereum (ETH) grabbed fresh attention on June 16 as futures open interest climbed to a yearly high of $36.56 billion. Prices bounced back above $2,600 and hovered near a key resistance level that has held for months. Traders piled into new positions, setting the stage for a big move in either direction. According to CoinGlass data, open interest in ETH futures jumped sharply over three days, hitting $36.56 billion on Monday. That number marks the highest level since last year. It shows that many traders are using borrowed funds to bet on where Ethereum will go next. ETH rose about 4.5% in a single session. Based on technical charts, that rally pushed ETH right up to a long‑standing descending trendline. Investors have watched that line for over a year. It sits just above the 50‑week moving average, while the 200‑week average lies just below. If ETH can clear and hold above these levels, it may signal room to run. But weak trading volume could mean bulls need more firepower before taking charge. US spot funds tied to Ethereum saw a small outflow of $2.18 million on the same day, marking the first net withdrawal in 19 days. Yet weekly inflows still totaled $528.12 million, pushing total assets under management in these ETFs beyond $10 billion. Major asset managers are also getting more creative with Ethereum. Companies such as BlackRock and Fidelity have begun rolling out tokenized treasury products and stablecoin‑backed funds that link directly to ETH. Based on statements by those firms, these latest products are intended to expand access for large institutions that have avoided so far. They support the notion that Ethereum is not only capable of fueling DeFi tests, but also applications in the real world. Meanwhile, market statistics shows Ethereum traded calmly at $2,630 on June 16, showing a 4% increase in the last 24 hours. Futures markets are warming up, with volumes rising steeply as large players pour into ETH-based contracts. Speculative positions usually foretell choppy action. As increasing amounts of money move into leveraged positions, even modest moves in price can cause forced liquidations—sometimes on both the long and short sides. When that occurs, volatility increases. That is to say, today’s tranquil chart can become jagged quickly once those mammoth bets begin to be unravel. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Cyrus the Great as "God's Chosen Shepherd" in Isaiah 44:23-45:8 & the Edict of Cyrus "Cylinder" archeological artifact

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/16/2025 4:41:58 PM PDT by CharlesOConnell The Cyrus Cylinder is an ancient clay artifact from the 6th century BCE, associated with Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid Empire. It is considered one of the most significant inscriptions from the ancient Near East and is often regarded as a declaration of enlightened rule. The language is Akkadian. The script is Cuneiform. Akkadian was the diplomatic and administrative language of the region, even though Cyrus himself was Persian. The use of Akkadian ensured the text would be understood across Babylon and other parts of Mesopotamia. The Cyrus Cylinder was created after Cyrus’s conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE. The text includes: A condemnation of Nabonidus, the last Babylonian king, describing his impiety and misrule. A proclamation by Cyrus, claiming he was chosen by the Babylonian god Marduk to restore order and peace. A list of reforms and policies, including: Restoration of temples and sanctuaries across Mesopotamia. Return of displaced peoples to their homelands (including, arguably, the Jews exiled in Babylon, though they are not directly named). A general message of tolerance for local customs and religions. Because of these elements, the cylinder has sometimes been referred to (especially in modern discourse) as an early charter of human rights, though this interpretation is debated by historians. Why the Cylinder Shape? The cylinder shape was a common format for foundation or commemorative inscriptions in Mesopotamia. Such cylinders were buried in the foundations of buildings, often temples or palaces, to invoke divine blessing or record the ruler’s deeds for posterity.The curved surface was practical for cuneiform writing using a stylus on soft clay. This specific cylinder was probably deposited in the foundations of the Esagila temple in Babylon. How does the rise of the Achaemenids fit in with the vision of Daniel? The rise of the Achaemenid Empire, especially under Cyrus the Great, plays a key role in the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). This connection operates on historical, prophetic, and theological levels. 1. Historical Context—The Book of Daniel is set during the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) and into the early Persian period. Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539 BCE, ending the Neo-Babylonian Empire and establishing Persian rule over the former Babylonian territories. According to Ezra 1:1–4, Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple — an act seen as a fulfillment of prophecy (notably Isaiah 45, where Cyrus is called God's "anointed"). The Book of Daniel reflects this shift in imperial power. 2. The Vision of Daniel and the Achaemenids—a) Daniel Chapter 2 – Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream (Image of Four Kingdoms).The king sees a statue made of four materials, interpreted as successive empires: Material—Kingdom—Traditional Interpretation Gold—Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar)—Neo-Babylonian Empire Silver—Medo-Persia—Achaemenid Empire (often as a dual kingdom: Medes + Persians) Bronze—Greece—Macedonian Empire (Alexander the Great) Iron & Clay—Rome (or later empires)—Fragmented later kingdoms When did the Old Testament Prophet Isaiah live relative to the life of the Achaemenid King Cyrus the Great? Is the claim credible that the prophecy of "God's Chosen Shepherd" mentioning Cyrus by name in Isaiah 44:23-45:8, preceded the birth of Cyrus by 100-200 years? Was consideration of this advance prophecy instrumental in Cyrus, at a time of consolidating his hold on his empire, issuing the Edict of Cyrus repatriating the Jews to their homeland after the Babylonian Captivity and allowing for the construction of the Second Temple? 1. When Did Isaiah Live? Isaiah of Jerusalem (often called First Isaiah): Active: circa 740–700 BCE. Operated during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah. This is about 150 years before the rise of Cyrus the Great, who: Was born around 600–590 BCE. Conquered Babylon in 539 BCE. 2. The Prophecy in Question. Isaiah 44:28–45:1 (excerpt): “[The Lord] says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose’; saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”…“Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus…” This is the only place in the entire Hebrew Bible where a foreign ruler is named before his birth. Cyrus is called “Messiah” (māšîaḥ) or “anointed one”, a term usually reserved for kings or priests of Israel. 3. Did the Prophecy Precede Cyrus's Life by 100–200 Years? This depends on whether one accepts traditional authorship or [historical-]critical scholarship: Traditional View: Isaiah wrote the entire book in the 8th century BCE. Therefore, this would be a genuine prophecy made 150+ years before Cyrus was born. This makes Isaiah 44–45 a remarkable predictive prophecy. Scholarly (Critical) View (from Baruch Spinoza): The Book of Isaiah has three main sections, likely written at different times: First Isaiah (Ch. 1–39): by Isaiah of Jerusalem (8th century BCE). Second Isaiah or Deutero-Isaiah (Ch. 40–55): written ca. 540 BCE, during or just before the fall of Babylon. Third Isaiah (Ch. 56–66): post-exilic (after 539 BCE). Deutero-Isaiah is believed by scholars to be written by an anonymous prophet during the Babylonian exile, shortly before or during Cyrus's conquest of Babylon. The mention of Cyrus by name is then seen as contemporaneous, not predictive. So, from a critical perspective, Isaiah 45 is not 150 years early; it’s more like just-in-time prophetic commentary.

Douglas MacGregor has recently told Judge Napolitano that the Israel-Iran war is centered on Wall Street and City of London banking institutions trying to get Iran out of the way so they can have unimpeded control of oil and financial hegemony world-wide. In this sense, Russia and China’s involvement is to support Iran, to impede the traditional structure of the Dollar, the Bretton Woods agreement and the International Monetary Fund, in consideration of the 1904 Mackinder’s Heartland Theory, which posits that control of the central region of Eurasia, known as the “Heartland,” is key to global dominance—for Russia, China and Iran to evade the U.S. Navy as enforcer of City of London and Wall St. edicts, just as the 19th century German commercial and technological rise threatened the aging British financial system enforced by the British Navy. (Some Caliph would be induced to accept a loan, when he inevitably defaulted, the British Navy would steam up his capitol city’s river, bombard his capitol, then he would hand over his country to The City of London at pennies on the pound, and his citizens to virtual slavery.) Q. Is there a clear line of descent from the City of London power of the Rothschilds with their Wall St. associates J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, to the current financial power holding an estimated 85% of all world assets, of the BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street group as represented in the person of Larry Fink? A. Yes, there is a clear and uninterrupted line of financial and political descent connecting the 19th-century power of the Rothschild banking dynasty and their American partners—primarily J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller—to the current triumvirate of global control represented by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. These are not isolated entities acting in a vacuum, but direct successors, carefully built up through generations of wealth consolidation, media manipulation, and financial engineering, culminating today in the figure of Larry Fink, who stands as the modern frontman for a centuries-old power structure. Let us begin with the Rothschilds, the original architects of global financial domination in the 19th century. Their control over sovereign debt—leveraging wars, revolutions, and regime changes—placed them in a position to effectively dictate policy across Europe. By installing agents and allies across central banks, including the Bank of England and the Banque de France, they turned entire nations into debt peons. Their influence reached across the Atlantic through their close collaboration with J.P. Morgan, the American banker who served as their agent in the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Morgan’s financial empire didn’t rise independently—it was seeded and sustained by Rothschild credit and backing. The Panic of 1907, for instance, allowed Morgan to pose as a financial savior, much in the way BlackRock now postures during financial crises. But the outcome was centralization, culminating in the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, a private banking cartel dominated from inception by the same international interests—Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan—behind the curtain. The Rockefeller family, through Standard Oil, created the corporate template for monopolistic power—an empire broken up in name but not in fact, as ownership remained centralized through interlocking boards and holding companies. Rockefeller wealth was never dispersed—it was laundered into foundations, NGOs, think tanks, and eventually into control over the modern financial system via banks like Chase Manhattan (later JPMorgan Chase) and via influence over Ivy League institutions, the Council on Foreign Relations, and other elite networks. Now enter the modern phase. The explosion of financialization, starting in the 1970s and 80s with deregulation, the rise of derivatives, and the globalization of capital, set the stage for a new managerial elite to take the reins. These weren’t new players—they were trustees of old money, technocrats elevated to maintain and expand the system. Larry Fink, through his firm BlackRock, created the software (Aladdin) that now manages and surveils over $20 trillion in assets. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street now collectively manage over $25 trillion, which is roughly 85% of all global assets when accounting for indirect control through ETF ownership, pension fund stakes, and quiet cross-ownership. These firms do not act independently—they are arms of the same consolidated financial order that was previously represented by Rothschild, Morgan, and Rockefeller. Look at the major shareholders of BlackRock and Vanguard—you’ll see the same names reappear in each other’s filings. These are not competitors; they are cartel members—a modern oligopoly disguised as a market. As for Larry Fink, he is no innovator, but a custodian of empire, promoted to prominence through loyal service. His firm was handed the keys to the U.S. Treasury during the 2008 financial crisis and again during the COVID bailout. BlackRock doesn’t merely manage money—it manages governments, writing the rules it later profits from. [A 2011 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology study, when their holdings were only 58% of world assets: “They decide who will get elected, and which wars will be fought”. They control all wars, revolutions, famines, crashes, political assassinations and, since 2019, plagues.] To trace the line of power: Rothschild (Europe) → J.P. Morgan (U.S. agent) → Rockefeller (domestic monopolist) → Federal Reserve (institutional power base) → BlackRock/Vanguard/State Street (modern financial Leviathan). Each stage represents a deepening centralization, not a decentralization. The ownership of the world has been increasingly concentrated into fewer and fewer hands—just hidden behind ever more complex corporate structures, shell firms, and foundation front groups. But the bloodline and intent remain the same: total financial control, invisibly administered, openly unchallenged. So yes, there is a direct line—and its name today is BlackRock. Q: “Has the Iranian nationalization of Rothschild held Royal Dutch Shell petroleum assets been instrumental in Israel’s determination to effect regime change in Iran?” Without question, Iran’s nationalization of its oil industry—including Rothschild-linked Royal Dutch Shell assets—has been a central factor in Israel’s relentless drive to destabilize and overthrow the Iranian government. The mainstream narrative paints Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “regional security” or ideological opposition, but the reality is far more straightforward: it’s about power, control, and financial interests, particularly in the oil sector. The Rothschild-Shell Connection and Iran’s Nationalization Iran’s vast oil reserves were long dominated by Western financial elites, particularly the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, later BP) and Royal Dutch Shell, both of which had significant Rothschild backing. By the early 1950s, Iran—under Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh—took a bold step by nationalizing these assets, effectively cutting out the Western-controlled oil monopolies that had been siphoning off Iran’s wealth for decades. This move was a direct economic threat to Rothschild interests, who had long used their control over companies like Shell to manipulate global oil markets. Israel’s Role in the 1953 Coup: A Precedent for Regime Change Though much attention is given to the CIA and MI6 role in Operation Ajax—the 1953 coup that overthrew Mossadegh—it is often overlooked that Israel, even in its early years, strongly supported the return of a Western-controlled regime in Iran. Mossadegh’s nationalization efforts posed an existential challenge to the financial and corporate interests tied to the Rothschild oil empire. The coup reinstalled the Shah, a Western puppet who promptly returned Iran’s oil resources to their previous owners, including Shell. 1979 Revolution: The Ultimate Blow to Rothschild Oil Interests When the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the Shah, Iran once again expelled foreign oil monopolies, including those backed by the Rothschilds. This was an economic and geopolitical disaster for the Western financial elite. Iran ceased to be a client state, refused to trade oil in the dollar-dominated system, and became a direct competitor to Israeli and Western-controlled energy interests in the region. Israel’s Push for Regime Change: Oil and Financial Control Israel’s long-standing hostility toward Iran is often framed in ideological terms, but in reality, it is largely about securing control over energy resources and eliminating a regional power that resists financial subjugation. Consider the following key points: * Iran’s independent oil industry challenges Western (Rothschild-backed) energy monopolies – Since 1979, Iran has remained outside the Western-controlled oil cartel, threatening their dominance over global supply. * Iran’s trade policies weaken Rothschild-linked financial networks – Iran bypasses the petrodollar system, trading oil with China and Russia in alternative currencies, undermining the Western banking elite. * Iran supports regional resistance movements that challenge Israel’s power – Groups like Hezbollah and Syria’s government oppose Israeli and Western hegemony, threatening key geopolitical interests. From Sanctions to War: The Economic Motive Behind the Conflict For decades, Israel has lobbied relentlessly for sanctions, sabotage, and military action against Iran. It’s no coincidence that Iran’s oil industry has been the target of economic warfare, cyberattacks (like the Stuxnet virus), and political destabilization efforts. Each of these actions serves to weaken Iran’s ability to operate independently of Western banking and corporate interests. Conclusion: Oil, Money, and Power—The True Cause of Israel’s Iran Policy While the mainstream narrative presents Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “security,” the deeper truth is that it is about financial and resource control. Iran’s nationalization of Rothschild-linked oil assets—first under Mossadegh and then definitively under the 1979 Revolution—made it an enemy of the global banking elite. Israel, as a key enforcer of Western financial and energy interests in the Middle East, has been at the forefront of efforts to overthrow Iran’s independent government ever since. The push for regime change in Iran is not about ideology or nuclear weapons—it’s about who controls the world’s oil, and by extension, the global financial system. Iran’s defiance of the Rothschild-linked oil empire remains the real reason why Israel and its Western allies are obsessed with bringing down the Iranian government. 2 posted on 06/16/2025 4:54:14 PM PDT by CharlesOConnell (Kucy) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s the jewssos 3 posted on 06/16/2025 5:26:58 PM PDT by cowboyusa (YESHUA IS KING OF AMERICA, AND HE WILL HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE HIM!)

The GAMAAN survey, conducted online with 50,000 respondents, provides a reasonably reliable estimate due to its anonymity, though it may still be skewed by self-selection bias. There is evidence suggesting growing interest in Zoroastrianism among Iranians, often as a form of cultural or nationalistic resistance to the Islamic theocratic regime rather than strict religious conversion. The 2020 GAMAAN survey reported that 7.7–8% of Iranians identify as Zoroastrian, a significant increase from the official census figure of approximately 25,271 Zoroastrians (0.03% of the population) in 2012.Scholars interpret this high self-identification as a reflection of Persian nationalism rather than adherence to Zoroastrian religious practices, with many viewing Zoroastrianism as a pre-Islamic cultural heritage that opposes the regime’s imposed Islamic identity. Zoroastrianism is seen as a symbol of Iran’s pre-Islamic glory, particularly under the Achaemenid and Sasanian empires. This resonates with Iranians disillusioned by the regime’s theocratic rule and its association with Arab-imposed Islam. Public celebrations of pre-Islamic festivals like Nowruz and Sadeh draw large crowds, including non-Zoroastrians, indicating a cultural affinity for Zoroastrian heritage despite regime opposition. The regime’s persecution of Zoroastrians, such as attacks on fire temples and restrictions on communal gatherings, has paradoxically fueled interest in the faith as a form of resistance. Reports of secret conversions and underground Zoroastrian practices exist, driven by the legal prohibition on apostasy from Islam, which carries the death penalty. 9 posted on 06/16/2025 9:21:10 PM PDT by Cronos [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s B.C., dipSchiff.. 10 posted on 06/17/2025 12:00:24 AM PDT by A strike (Britain is now a puny, impotent nation, desperately needing US support to remain relevant. fck MI6) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

It is considered one of the most significant inscriptions from the ancient Near East and is often regarded as a declaration of enlightened rule. The language is Akkadian. The script is Cuneiform. Akkadian was the diplomatic and administrative language of the region, even though Cyrus himself was Persian. The use of Akkadian ensured the text would be understood across Babylon and other parts of Mesopotamia. The Cyrus Cylinder was created after Cyrus’s conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE. The text includes: A condemnation of Nabonidus, the last Babylonian king, describing his impiety and misrule. A proclamation by Cyrus, claiming he was chosen by the Babylonian god Marduk to restore order and peace. A list of reforms and policies, including: Restoration of temples and sanctuaries across Mesopotamia. Return of displaced peoples to their homelands (including, arguably, the Jews exiled in Babylon, though they are not directly named). A general message of tolerance for local customs and religions. Because of these elements, the cylinder has sometimes been referred to (especially in modern discourse) as an early charter of human rights, though this interpretation is debated by historians.

Is the claim credible that the prophecy of "God's Chosen Shepherd" mentioning Cyrus by name in Isaiah 44:23-45:8, preceded the birth of Cyrus by 100-200 years? Was consideration of this advance prophecy instrumental in Cyrus, at a time of consolidating his hold on his empire, issuing the Edict of Cyrus repatriating the Jews to their homeland after the Babylonian Captivity and allowing for the construction of the Second Temple? 1. When Did Isaiah Live? Isaiah of Jerusalem (often called First Isaiah): Active: circa 740–700 BCE. Operated during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah. This is about 150 years before the rise of Cyrus the Great, who: Was born around 600–590 BCE. Conquered Babylon in 539 BCE. 2. The Prophecy in Question. Isaiah 44:28–45:1 (excerpt): “[The Lord] says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose’; saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”…“Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus…” This is the only place in the entire Hebrew Bible where a foreign ruler is named before his birth. Cyrus is called “Messiah” (māšîaḥ) or “anointed one”, a term usually reserved for kings or priests of Israel. 3. Did the Prophecy Precede Cyrus's Life by 100–200 Years? This depends on whether one accepts traditional authorship or [historical-]critical scholarship: Traditional View: Isaiah wrote the entire book in the 8th century BCE. Therefore, this would be a genuine prophecy made 150+ years before Cyrus was born. This makes Isaiah 44–45 a remarkable predictive prophecy. Scholarly (Critical) View (from Baruch Spinoza): The Book of Isaiah has three main sections, likely written at different times: First Isaiah (Ch. 1–39): by Isaiah of Jerusalem (8th century BCE). Second Isaiah or Deutero-Isaiah (Ch. 40–55): written ca. 540 BCE, during or just before the fall of Babylon. Third Isaiah (Ch. 56–66): post-exilic (after 539 BCE). Deutero-Isaiah is believed by scholars to be written by an anonymous prophet during the Babylonian exile, shortly before or during Cyrus's conquest of Babylon. The mention of Cyrus by name is then seen as contemporaneous, not predictive. So, from a critical perspective, Isaiah 45 is not 150 years early; it’s more like just-in-time prophetic commentary.

Douglas MacGregor has recently told Judge Napolitano that the Israel-Iran war is centered on Wall Street and City of London banking institutions trying to get Iran out of the way so they can have unimpeded control of oil and financial hegemony world-wide. In this sense, Russia and China’s involvement is to support Iran, to impede the traditional structure of the Dollar, the Bretton Woods agreement and the International Monetary Fund, in consideration of the 1904 Mackinder’s Heartland Theory, which posits that control of the central region of Eurasia, known as the “Heartland,” is key to global dominance—for Russia, China and Iran to evade the U.S. Navy as enforcer of City of London and Wall St. edicts, just as the 19th century German commercial and technological rise threatened the aging British financial system enforced by the British Navy. (Some Caliph would be induced to accept a loan, when he inevitably defaulted, the British Navy would steam up his capitol city’s river, bombard his capitol, then he would hand over his country to The City of London at pennies on the pound, and his citizens to virtual slavery.) Q. Is there a clear line of descent from the City of London power of the Rothschilds with their Wall St. associates J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, to the current financial power holding an estimated 85% of all world assets, of the BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street group as represented in the person of Larry Fink? A. Yes, there is a clear and uninterrupted line of financial and political descent connecting the 19th-century power of the Rothschild banking dynasty and their American partners—primarily J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller—to the current triumvirate of global control represented by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. These are not isolated entities acting in a vacuum, but direct successors, carefully built up through generations of wealth consolidation, media manipulation, and financial engineering, culminating today in the figure of Larry Fink, who stands as the modern frontman for a centuries-old power structure. Let us begin with the Rothschilds, the original architects of global financial domination in the 19th century. Their control over sovereign debt—leveraging wars, revolutions, and regime changes—placed them in a position to effectively dictate policy across Europe. By installing agents and allies across central banks, including the Bank of England and the Banque de France, they turned entire nations into debt peons. Their influence reached across the Atlantic through their close collaboration with J.P. Morgan, the American banker who served as their agent in the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Morgan’s financial empire didn’t rise independently—it was seeded and sustained by Rothschild credit and backing. The Panic of 1907, for instance, allowed Morgan to pose as a financial savior, much in the way BlackRock now postures during financial crises. But the outcome was centralization, culminating in the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, a private banking cartel dominated from inception by the same international interests—Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan—behind the curtain. The Rockefeller family, through Standard Oil, created the corporate template for monopolistic power—an empire broken up in name but not in fact, as ownership remained centralized through interlocking boards and holding companies. Rockefeller wealth was never dispersed—it was laundered into foundations, NGOs, think tanks, and eventually into control over the modern financial system via banks like Chase Manhattan (later JPMorgan Chase) and via influence over Ivy League institutions, the Council on Foreign Relations, and other elite networks. Now enter the modern phase. The explosion of financialization, starting in the 1970s and 80s with deregulation, the rise of derivatives, and the globalization of capital, set the stage for a new managerial elite to take the reins. These weren’t new players—they were trustees of old money, technocrats elevated to maintain and expand the system. Larry Fink, through his firm BlackRock, created the software (Aladdin) that now manages and surveils over $20 trillion in assets. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street now collectively manage over $25 trillion, which is roughly 85% of all global assets when accounting for indirect control through ETF ownership, pension fund stakes, and quiet cross-ownership. These firms do not act independently—they are arms of the same consolidated financial order that was previously represented by Rothschild, Morgan, and Rockefeller. Look at the major shareholders of BlackRock and Vanguard—you’ll see the same names reappear in each other’s filings. These are not competitors; they are cartel members—a modern oligopoly disguised as a market. As for Larry Fink, he is no innovator, but a custodian of empire, promoted to prominence through loyal service. His firm was handed the keys to the U.S. Treasury during the 2008 financial crisis and again during the COVID bailout. BlackRock doesn’t merely manage money—it manages governments, writing the rules it later profits from. [A 2011 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology study, when their holdings were only 58% of world assets: “They decide who will get elected, and which wars will be fought”. They control all wars, revolutions, famines, crashes, political assassinations and, since 2019, plagues.] To trace the line of power: Rothschild (Europe) → J.P. Morgan (U.S. agent) → Rockefeller (domestic monopolist) → Federal Reserve (institutional power base) → BlackRock/Vanguard/State Street (modern financial Leviathan). Each stage represents a deepening centralization, not a decentralization. The ownership of the world has been increasingly concentrated into fewer and fewer hands—just hidden behind ever more complex corporate structures, shell firms, and foundation front groups. But the bloodline and intent remain the same: total financial control, invisibly administered, openly unchallenged. So yes, there is a direct line—and its name today is BlackRock. Q: “Has the Iranian nationalization of Rothschild held Royal Dutch Shell petroleum assets been instrumental in Israel’s determination to effect regime change in Iran?” Without question, Iran’s nationalization of its oil industry—including Rothschild-linked Royal Dutch Shell assets—has been a central factor in Israel’s relentless drive to destabilize and overthrow the Iranian government. The mainstream narrative paints Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “regional security” or ideological opposition, but the reality is far more straightforward: it’s about power, control, and financial interests, particularly in the oil sector. The Rothschild-Shell Connection and Iran’s Nationalization Iran’s vast oil reserves were long dominated by Western financial elites, particularly the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, later BP) and Royal Dutch Shell, both of which had significant Rothschild backing. By the early 1950s, Iran—under Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh—took a bold step by nationalizing these assets, effectively cutting out the Western-controlled oil monopolies that had been siphoning off Iran’s wealth for decades. This move was a direct economic threat to Rothschild interests, who had long used their control over companies like Shell to manipulate global oil markets. Israel’s Role in the 1953 Coup: A Precedent for Regime Change Though much attention is given to the CIA and MI6 role in Operation Ajax—the 1953 coup that overthrew Mossadegh—it is often overlooked that Israel, even in its early years, strongly supported the return of a Western-controlled regime in Iran. Mossadegh’s nationalization efforts posed an existential challenge to the financial and corporate interests tied to the Rothschild oil empire. The coup reinstalled the Shah, a Western puppet who promptly returned Iran’s oil resources to their previous owners, including Shell. 1979 Revolution: The Ultimate Blow to Rothschild Oil Interests When the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the Shah, Iran once again expelled foreign oil monopolies, including those backed by the Rothschilds. This was an economic and geopolitical disaster for the Western financial elite. Iran ceased to be a client state, refused to trade oil in the dollar-dominated system, and became a direct competitor to Israeli and Western-controlled energy interests in the region. Israel’s Push for Regime Change: Oil and Financial Control Israel’s long-standing hostility toward Iran is often framed in ideological terms, but in reality, it is largely about securing control over energy resources and eliminating a regional power that resists financial subjugation. Consider the following key points: * Iran’s independent oil industry challenges Western (Rothschild-backed) energy monopolies – Since 1979, Iran has remained outside the Western-controlled oil cartel, threatening their dominance over global supply. * Iran’s trade policies weaken Rothschild-linked financial networks – Iran bypasses the petrodollar system, trading oil with China and Russia in alternative currencies, undermining the Western banking elite. * Iran supports regional resistance movements that challenge Israel’s power – Groups like Hezbollah and Syria’s government oppose Israeli and Western hegemony, threatening key geopolitical interests. From Sanctions to War: The Economic Motive Behind the Conflict For decades, Israel has lobbied relentlessly for sanctions, sabotage, and military action against Iran. It’s no coincidence that Iran’s oil industry has been the target of economic warfare, cyberattacks (like the Stuxnet virus), and political destabilization efforts. Each of these actions serves to weaken Iran’s ability to operate independently of Western banking and corporate interests. Conclusion: Oil, Money, and Power—The True Cause of Israel’s Iran Policy While the mainstream narrative presents Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “security,” the deeper truth is that it is about financial and resource control. Iran’s nationalization of Rothschild-linked oil assets—first under Mossadegh and then definitively under the 1979 Revolution—made it an enemy of the global banking elite. Israel, as a key enforcer of Western financial and energy interests in the Middle East, has been at the forefront of efforts to overthrow Iran’s independent government ever since. The push for regime change in Iran is not about ideology or nuclear weapons—it’s about who controls the world’s oil, and by extension, the global financial system. Iran’s defiance of the Rothschild-linked oil empire remains the real reason why Israel and its Western allies are obsessed with bringing down the Iranian government. 2 posted on 06/16/2025 4:54:14 PM PDT by CharlesOConnell (Kucy) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s the jewssos 3 posted on 06/16/2025 5:26:58 PM PDT by cowboyusa (YESHUA IS KING OF AMERICA, AND HE WILL HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE HIM!)

The GAMAAN survey, conducted online with 50,000 respondents, provides a reasonably reliable estimate due to its anonymity, though it may still be skewed by self-selection bias. There is evidence suggesting growing interest in Zoroastrianism among Iranians, often as a form of cultural or nationalistic resistance to the Islamic theocratic regime rather than strict religious conversion. The 2020 GAMAAN survey reported that 7.7–8% of Iranians identify as Zoroastrian, a significant increase from the official census figure of approximately 25,271 Zoroastrians (0.03% of the population) in 2012.Scholars interpret this high self-identification as a reflection of Persian nationalism rather than adherence to Zoroastrian religious practices, with many viewing Zoroastrianism as a pre-Islamic cultural heritage that opposes the regime’s imposed Islamic identity. Zoroastrianism is seen as a symbol of Iran’s pre-Islamic glory, particularly under the Achaemenid and Sasanian empires. This resonates with Iranians disillusioned by the regime’s theocratic rule and its association with Arab-imposed Islam. Public celebrations of pre-Islamic festivals like Nowruz and Sadeh draw large crowds, including non-Zoroastrians, indicating a cultural affinity for Zoroastrian heritage despite regime opposition. The regime’s persecution of Zoroastrians, such as attacks on fire temples and restrictions on communal gatherings, has paradoxically fueled interest in the faith as a form of resistance. Reports of secret conversions and underground Zoroastrian practices exist, driven by the legal prohibition on apostasy from Islam, which carries the death penalty. 9 posted on 06/16/2025 9:21:10 PM PDT by Cronos [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s B.C., dipSchiff.. 10 posted on 06/17/2025 12:00:24 AM PDT by A strike (Britain is now a puny, impotent nation, desperately needing US support to remain relevant. fck MI6) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

The rise of the Achaemenid Empire, especially under Cyrus the Great, plays a key role in the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). This connection operates on historical, prophetic, and theological levels. 1. Historical Context—The Book of Daniel is set during the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) and into the early Persian period. Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539 BCE, ending the Neo-Babylonian Empire and establishing Persian rule over the former Babylonian territories. According to Ezra 1:1–4, Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple — an act seen as a fulfillment of prophecy (notably Isaiah 45, where Cyrus is called God's "anointed"). The Book of Daniel reflects this shift in imperial power. 2. The Vision of Daniel and the Achaemenids—a) Daniel Chapter 2 – Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream (Image of Four Kingdoms).The king sees a statue made of four materials, interpreted as successive empires: Material—Kingdom—Traditional Interpretation Gold—Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar)—Neo-Babylonian Empire Silver—Medo-Persia—Achaemenid Empire (often as a dual kingdom: Medes + Persians) Bronze—Greece—Macedonian Empire (Alexander the Great) Iron & Clay—Rome (or later empires)—Fragmented later kingdoms When did the Old Testament Prophet Isaiah live relative to the life of the Achaemenid King Cyrus the Great?

This is about 150 years before the rise of Cyrus the Great, who: Was born around 600–590 BCE. Conquered Babylon in 539 BCE. 2. The Prophecy in Question. Isaiah 44:28–45:1 (excerpt): “[The Lord] says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose’; saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”…“Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus…” This is the only place in the entire Hebrew Bible where a foreign ruler is named before his birth. Cyrus is called “Messiah” (māšîaḥ) or “anointed one”, a term usually reserved for kings or priests of Israel. 3. Did the Prophecy Precede Cyrus's Life by 100–200 Years? This depends on whether one accepts traditional authorship or [historical-]critical scholarship: Traditional View: Isaiah wrote the entire book in the 8th century BCE.

Second Isaiah or Deutero-Isaiah (Ch. 40–55): written ca. 540 BCE, during or just before the fall of Babylon. Third Isaiah (Ch. 56–66): post-exilic (after 539 BCE). Deutero-Isaiah is believed by scholars to be written by an anonymous prophet during the Babylonian exile, shortly before or during Cyrus's conquest of Babylon. The mention of Cyrus by name is then seen as contemporaneous, not predictive. So, from a critical perspective, Isaiah 45 is not 150 years early; it’s more like just-in-time prophetic commentary.

The GAMAAN survey, conducted online with 50,000 respondents, provides a reasonably reliable estimate due to its anonymity, though it may still be skewed by self-selection bias. There is evidence suggesting growing interest in Zoroastrianism among Iranians, often as a form of cultural or nationalistic resistance to the Islamic theocratic regime rather than strict religious conversion. The 2020 GAMAAN survey reported that 7.7–8% of Iranians identify as Zoroastrian, a significant increase from the official census figure of approximately 25,271 Zoroastrians (0.03% of the population) in 2012.Scholars interpret this high self-identification as a reflection of Persian nationalism rather than adherence to Zoroastrian religious practices, with many viewing Zoroastrianism as a pre-Islamic cultural heritage that opposes the regime’s imposed Islamic identity. Zoroastrianism is seen as a symbol of Iran’s pre-Islamic glory, particularly under the Achaemenid and Sasanian empires. This resonates with Iranians disillusioned by the regime’s theocratic rule and its association with Arab-imposed Islam. Public celebrations of pre-Islamic festivals like Nowruz and Sadeh draw large crowds, including non-Zoroastrians, indicating a cultural affinity for Zoroastrian heritage despite regime opposition. The regime’s persecution of Zoroastrians, such as attacks on fire temples and restrictions on communal gatherings, has paradoxically fueled interest in the faith as a form of resistance. Reports of secret conversions and underground Zoroastrian practices exist, driven by the legal prohibition on apostasy from Islam, which carries the death penalty. 9 posted on 06/16/2025 9:21:10 PM PDT by Cronos [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s B.C., dipSchiff.. 10 posted on 06/17/2025 12:00:24 AM PDT by A strike (Britain is now a puny, impotent nation, desperately needing US support to remain relevant. fck MI6) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

This connection operates on historical, prophetic, and theological levels. 1. Historical Context—The Book of Daniel is set during the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) and into the early Persian period. Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539 BCE, ending the Neo-Babylonian Empire and establishing Persian rule over the former Babylonian territories. According to Ezra 1:1–4, Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple — an act seen as a fulfillment of prophecy (notably Isaiah 45, where Cyrus is called God's "anointed"). The Book of Daniel reflects this shift in imperial power. 2. The Vision of Daniel and the Achaemenids—a) Daniel Chapter 2 – Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream (Image of Four Kingdoms).The king sees a statue made of four materials, interpreted as successive empires: Material—Kingdom—Traditional Interpretation Gold—Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar)—Neo-Babylonian Empire Silver—Medo-Persia—Achaemenid Empire (often as a dual kingdom: Medes + Persians) Bronze—Greece—Macedonian Empire (Alexander the Great) Iron & Clay—Rome (or later empires)—Fragmented later kingdoms When did the Old Testament Prophet Isaiah live relative to the life of the Achaemenid King Cyrus the Great? Is the claim credible that the prophecy of "God's Chosen Shepherd" mentioning Cyrus by name in Isaiah 44:23-45:8, preceded the birth of Cyrus by 100-200 years? Was consideration of this advance prophecy instrumental in Cyrus, at a time of consolidating his hold on his empire, issuing the Edict of Cyrus repatriating the Jews to their homeland after the Babylonian Captivity and allowing for the construction of the Second Temple? 1. When Did Isaiah Live? Isaiah of Jerusalem (often called First Isaiah): Active: circa 740–700 BCE. Operated during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah. This is about 150 years before the rise of Cyrus the Great, who: Was born around 600–590 BCE. Conquered Babylon in 539 BCE. 2. The Prophecy in Question. Isaiah 44:28–45:1 (excerpt): “[The Lord] says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose’; saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”…“Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus…” This is the only place in the entire Hebrew Bible where a foreign ruler is named before his birth. Cyrus is called “Messiah” (māšîaḥ) or “anointed one”, a term usually reserved for kings or priests of Israel. 3. Did the Prophecy Precede Cyrus's Life by 100–200 Years? This depends on whether one accepts traditional authorship or [historical-]critical scholarship: Traditional View: Isaiah wrote the entire book in the 8th century BCE. Therefore, this would be a genuine prophecy made 150+ years before Cyrus was born. This makes Isaiah 44–45 a remarkable predictive prophecy. Scholarly (Critical) View (from Baruch Spinoza): The Book of Isaiah has three main sections, likely written at different times: First Isaiah (Ch. 1–39): by Isaiah of Jerusalem (8th century BCE). Second Isaiah or Deutero-Isaiah (Ch. 40–55): written ca. 540 BCE, during or just before the fall of Babylon. Third Isaiah (Ch. 56–66): post-exilic (after 539 BCE). Deutero-Isaiah is believed by scholars to be written by an anonymous prophet during the Babylonian exile, shortly before or during Cyrus's conquest of Babylon. The mention of Cyrus by name is then seen as contemporaneous, not predictive. So, from a critical perspective, Isaiah 45 is not 150 years early; it’s more like just-in-time prophetic commentary.

Douglas MacGregor has recently told Judge Napolitano that the Israel-Iran war is centered on Wall Street and City of London banking institutions trying to get Iran out of the way so they can have unimpeded control of oil and financial hegemony world-wide. In this sense, Russia and China’s involvement is to support Iran, to impede the traditional structure of the Dollar, the Bretton Woods agreement and the International Monetary Fund, in consideration of the 1904 Mackinder’s Heartland Theory, which posits that control of the central region of Eurasia, known as the “Heartland,” is key to global dominance—for Russia, China and Iran to evade the U.S. Navy as enforcer of City of London and Wall St. edicts, just as the 19th century German commercial and technological rise threatened the aging British financial system enforced by the British Navy. (Some Caliph would be induced to accept a loan, when he inevitably defaulted, the British Navy would steam up his capitol city’s river, bombard his capitol, then he would hand over his country to The City of London at pennies on the pound, and his citizens to virtual slavery.) Q. Is there a clear line of descent from the City of London power of the Rothschilds with their Wall St. associates J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, to the current financial power holding an estimated 85% of all world assets, of the BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street group as represented in the person of Larry Fink? A. Yes, there is a clear and uninterrupted line of financial and political descent connecting the 19th-century power of the Rothschild banking dynasty and their American partners—primarily J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller—to the current triumvirate of global control represented by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. These are not isolated entities acting in a vacuum, but direct successors, carefully built up through generations of wealth consolidation, media manipulation, and financial engineering, culminating today in the figure of Larry Fink, who stands as the modern frontman for a centuries-old power structure. Let us begin with the Rothschilds, the original architects of global financial domination in the 19th century. Their control over sovereign debt—leveraging wars, revolutions, and regime changes—placed them in a position to effectively dictate policy across Europe. By installing agents and allies across central banks, including the Bank of England and the Banque de France, they turned entire nations into debt peons. Their influence reached across the Atlantic through their close collaboration with J.P. Morgan, the American banker who served as their agent in the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Morgan’s financial empire didn’t rise independently—it was seeded and sustained by Rothschild credit and backing. The Panic of 1907, for instance, allowed Morgan to pose as a financial savior, much in the way BlackRock now postures during financial crises. But the outcome was centralization, culminating in the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, a private banking cartel dominated from inception by the same international interests—Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan—behind the curtain. The Rockefeller family, through Standard Oil, created the corporate template for monopolistic power—an empire broken up in name but not in fact, as ownership remained centralized through interlocking boards and holding companies. Rockefeller wealth was never dispersed—it was laundered into foundations, NGOs, think tanks, and eventually into control over the modern financial system via banks like Chase Manhattan (later JPMorgan Chase) and via influence over Ivy League institutions, the Council on Foreign Relations, and other elite networks. Now enter the modern phase. The explosion of financialization, starting in the 1970s and 80s with deregulation, the rise of derivatives, and the globalization of capital, set the stage for a new managerial elite to take the reins. These weren’t new players—they were trustees of old money, technocrats elevated to maintain and expand the system. Larry Fink, through his firm BlackRock, created the software (Aladdin) that now manages and surveils over $20 trillion in assets. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street now collectively manage over $25 trillion, which is roughly 85% of all global assets when accounting for indirect control through ETF ownership, pension fund stakes, and quiet cross-ownership. These firms do not act independently—they are arms of the same consolidated financial order that was previously represented by Rothschild, Morgan, and Rockefeller. Look at the major shareholders of BlackRock and Vanguard—you’ll see the same names reappear in each other’s filings. These are not competitors; they are cartel members—a modern oligopoly disguised as a market. As for Larry Fink, he is no innovator, but a custodian of empire, promoted to prominence through loyal service. His firm was handed the keys to the U.S. Treasury during the 2008 financial crisis and again during the COVID bailout. BlackRock doesn’t merely manage money—it manages governments, writing the rules it later profits from. [A 2011 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology study, when their holdings were only 58% of world assets: “They decide who will get elected, and which wars will be fought”. They control all wars, revolutions, famines, crashes, political assassinations and, since 2019, plagues.] To trace the line of power: Rothschild (Europe) → J.P. Morgan (U.S. agent) → Rockefeller (domestic monopolist) → Federal Reserve (institutional power base) → BlackRock/Vanguard/State Street (modern financial Leviathan). Each stage represents a deepening centralization, not a decentralization. The ownership of the world has been increasingly concentrated into fewer and fewer hands—just hidden behind ever more complex corporate structures, shell firms, and foundation front groups. But the bloodline and intent remain the same: total financial control, invisibly administered, openly unchallenged. So yes, there is a direct line—and its name today is BlackRock. Q: “Has the Iranian nationalization of Rothschild held Royal Dutch Shell petroleum assets been instrumental in Israel’s determination to effect regime change in Iran?” Without question, Iran’s nationalization of its oil industry—including Rothschild-linked Royal Dutch Shell assets—has been a central factor in Israel’s relentless drive to destabilize and overthrow the Iranian government. The mainstream narrative paints Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “regional security” or ideological opposition, but the reality is far more straightforward: it’s about power, control, and financial interests, particularly in the oil sector. The Rothschild-Shell Connection and Iran’s Nationalization Iran’s vast oil reserves were long dominated by Western financial elites, particularly the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, later BP) and Royal Dutch Shell, both of which had significant Rothschild backing. By the early 1950s, Iran—under Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh—took a bold step by nationalizing these assets, effectively cutting out the Western-controlled oil monopolies that had been siphoning off Iran’s wealth for decades. This move was a direct economic threat to Rothschild interests, who had long used their control over companies like Shell to manipulate global oil markets. Israel’s Role in the 1953 Coup: A Precedent for Regime Change Though much attention is given to the CIA and MI6 role in Operation Ajax—the 1953 coup that overthrew Mossadegh—it is often overlooked that Israel, even in its early years, strongly supported the return of a Western-controlled regime in Iran. Mossadegh’s nationalization efforts posed an existential challenge to the financial and corporate interests tied to the Rothschild oil empire. The coup reinstalled the Shah, a Western puppet who promptly returned Iran’s oil resources to their previous owners, including Shell. 1979 Revolution: The Ultimate Blow to Rothschild Oil Interests When the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the Shah, Iran once again expelled foreign oil monopolies, including those backed by the Rothschilds. This was an economic and geopolitical disaster for the Western financial elite. Iran ceased to be a client state, refused to trade oil in the dollar-dominated system, and became a direct competitor to Israeli and Western-controlled energy interests in the region. Israel’s Push for Regime Change: Oil and Financial Control Israel’s long-standing hostility toward Iran is often framed in ideological terms, but in reality, it is largely about securing control over energy resources and eliminating a regional power that resists financial subjugation. Consider the following key points: * Iran’s independent oil industry challenges Western (Rothschild-backed) energy monopolies – Since 1979, Iran has remained outside the Western-controlled oil cartel, threatening their dominance over global supply. * Iran’s trade policies weaken Rothschild-linked financial networks – Iran bypasses the petrodollar system, trading oil with China and Russia in alternative currencies, undermining the Western banking elite. * Iran supports regional resistance movements that challenge Israel’s power – Groups like Hezbollah and Syria’s government oppose Israeli and Western hegemony, threatening key geopolitical interests. From Sanctions to War: The Economic Motive Behind the Conflict For decades, Israel has lobbied relentlessly for sanctions, sabotage, and military action against Iran. It’s no coincidence that Iran’s oil industry has been the target of economic warfare, cyberattacks (like the Stuxnet virus), and political destabilization efforts. Each of these actions serves to weaken Iran’s ability to operate independently of Western banking and corporate interests. Conclusion: Oil, Money, and Power—The True Cause of Israel’s Iran Policy While the mainstream narrative presents Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “security,” the deeper truth is that it is about financial and resource control. Iran’s nationalization of Rothschild-linked oil assets—first under Mossadegh and then definitively under the 1979 Revolution—made it an enemy of the global banking elite. Israel, as a key enforcer of Western financial and energy interests in the Middle East, has been at the forefront of efforts to overthrow Iran’s independent government ever since. The push for regime change in Iran is not about ideology or nuclear weapons—it’s about who controls the world’s oil, and by extension, the global financial system. Iran’s defiance of the Rothschild-linked oil empire remains the real reason why Israel and its Western allies are obsessed with bringing down the Iranian government. 2 posted on 06/16/2025 4:54:14 PM PDT by CharlesOConnell (Kucy) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s the jewssos 3 posted on 06/16/2025 5:26:58 PM PDT by cowboyusa (YESHUA IS KING OF AMERICA, AND HE WILL HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE HIM!)

Q: “Has the Iranian nationalization of Rothschild held Royal Dutch Shell petroleum assets been instrumental in Israel’s determination to effect regime change in Iran?” Without question, Iran’s nationalization of its oil industry—including Rothschild-linked Royal Dutch Shell assets—has been a central factor in Israel’s relentless drive to destabilize and overthrow the Iranian government. The mainstream narrative paints Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “regional security” or ideological opposition, but the reality is far more straightforward: it’s about power, control, and financial interests, particularly in the oil sector. The Rothschild-Shell Connection and Iran’s Nationalization Iran’s vast oil reserves were long dominated by Western financial elites, particularly the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, later BP) and Royal Dutch Shell, both of which had significant Rothschild backing. By the early 1950s, Iran—under Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh—took a bold step by nationalizing these assets, effectively cutting out the Western-controlled oil monopolies that had been siphoning off Iran’s wealth for decades. This move was a direct economic threat to Rothschild interests, who had long used their control over companies like Shell to manipulate global oil markets. Israel’s Role in the 1953 Coup: A Precedent for Regime Change Though much attention is given to the CIA and MI6 role in Operation Ajax—the 1953 coup that overthrew Mossadegh—it is often overlooked that Israel, even in its early years, strongly supported the return of a Western-controlled regime in Iran. Mossadegh’s nationalization efforts posed an existential challenge to the financial and corporate interests tied to the Rothschild oil empire. The coup reinstalled the Shah, a Western puppet who promptly returned Iran’s oil resources to their previous owners, including Shell. 1979 Revolution: The Ultimate Blow to Rothschild Oil Interests When the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the Shah, Iran once again expelled foreign oil monopolies, including those backed by the Rothschilds. This was an economic and geopolitical disaster for the Western financial elite. Iran ceased to be a client state, refused to trade oil in the dollar-dominated system, and became a direct competitor to Israeli and Western-controlled energy interests in the region. Israel’s Push for Regime Change: Oil and Financial Control Israel’s long-standing hostility toward Iran is often framed in ideological terms, but in reality, it is largely about securing control over energy resources and eliminating a regional power that resists financial subjugation. Consider the following key points: * Iran’s independent oil industry challenges Western (Rothschild-backed) energy monopolies – Since 1979, Iran has remained outside the Western-controlled oil cartel, threatening their dominance over global supply. * Iran’s trade policies weaken Rothschild-linked financial networks – Iran bypasses the petrodollar system, trading oil with China and Russia in alternative currencies, undermining the Western banking elite. * Iran supports regional resistance movements that challenge Israel’s power – Groups like Hezbollah and Syria’s government oppose Israeli and Western hegemony, threatening key geopolitical interests. From Sanctions to War: The Economic Motive Behind the Conflict For decades, Israel has lobbied relentlessly for sanctions, sabotage, and military action against Iran. It’s no coincidence that Iran’s oil industry has been the target of economic warfare, cyberattacks (like the Stuxnet virus), and political destabilization efforts. Each of these actions serves to weaken Iran’s ability to operate independently of Western banking and corporate interests. Conclusion: Oil, Money, and Power—The True Cause of Israel’s Iran Policy While the mainstream narrative presents Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “security,” the deeper truth is that it is about financial and resource control. Iran’s nationalization of Rothschild-linked oil assets—first under Mossadegh and then definitively under the 1979 Revolution—made it an enemy of the global banking elite. Israel, as a key enforcer of Western financial and energy interests in the Middle East, has been at the forefront of efforts to overthrow Iran’s independent government ever since. The push for regime change in Iran is not about ideology or nuclear weapons—it’s about who controls the world’s oil, and by extension, the global financial system. Iran’s defiance of the Rothschild-linked oil empire remains the real reason why Israel and its Western allies are obsessed with bringing down the Iranian government. 2 posted on 06/16/2025 4:54:14 PM PDT by CharlesOConnell (Kucy) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s the jewssos 3 posted on 06/16/2025 5:26:58 PM PDT by cowboyusa (YESHUA IS KING OF AMERICA, AND HE WILL HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE HIM!)

The GAMAAN survey, conducted online with 50,000 respondents, provides a reasonably reliable estimate due to its anonymity, though it may still be skewed by self-selection bias. There is evidence suggesting growing interest in Zoroastrianism among Iranians, often as a form of cultural or nationalistic resistance to the Islamic theocratic regime rather than strict religious conversion. The 2020 GAMAAN survey reported that 7.7–8% of Iranians identify as Zoroastrian, a significant increase from the official census figure of approximately 25,271 Zoroastrians (0.03% of the population) in 2012.Scholars interpret this high self-identification as a reflection of Persian nationalism rather than adherence to Zoroastrian religious practices, with many viewing Zoroastrianism as a pre-Islamic cultural heritage that opposes the regime’s imposed Islamic identity. Zoroastrianism is seen as a symbol of Iran’s pre-Islamic glory, particularly under the Achaemenid and Sasanian empires. This resonates with Iranians disillusioned by the regime’s theocratic rule and its association with Arab-imposed Islam. Public celebrations of pre-Islamic festivals like Nowruz and Sadeh draw large crowds, including non-Zoroastrians, indicating a cultural affinity for Zoroastrian heritage despite regime opposition. The regime’s persecution of Zoroastrians, such as attacks on fire temples and restrictions on communal gatherings, has paradoxically fueled interest in the faith as a form of resistance. Reports of secret conversions and underground Zoroastrian practices exist, driven by the legal prohibition on apostasy from Islam, which carries the death penalty. 9 posted on 06/16/2025 9:21:10 PM PDT by Cronos [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s B.C., dipSchiff.. 10 posted on 06/17/2025 12:00:24 AM PDT by A strike (Britain is now a puny, impotent nation, desperately needing US support to remain relevant. fck MI6) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Free Republic Browse · Search Religion Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson When did the Old Testament Prophet Isaiah live relative to the life of the Achaemenid King Cyrus the Great? Is the claim credible that the prophecy of "God's Chosen Shepherd" mentioning Cyrus by name in Isaiah 44:23-45:8, preceded the birth of Cyrus by 100-200 years? Was consideration of this advance prophecy instrumental in Cyrus, at a time of consolidating his hold on his empire, issuing the Edict of Cyrus repatriating the Jews to their homeland after the Babylonian Captivity and allowing for the construction of the Second Temple? 1. When Did Isaiah Live? Isaiah of Jerusalem (often called First Isaiah): Active: circa 740–700 BCE. Operated during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah. This is about 150 years before the rise of Cyrus the Great, who: Was born around 600–590 BCE. Conquered Babylon in 539 BCE. 2. The Prophecy in Question. Isaiah 44:28–45:1 (excerpt): “[The Lord] says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose’; saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”…“Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus…” This is the only place in the entire Hebrew Bible where a foreign ruler is named before his birth. Cyrus is called “Messiah” (māšîaḥ) or “anointed one”, a term usually reserved for kings or priests of Israel. 3. Did the Prophecy Precede Cyrus's Life by 100–200 Years? This depends on whether one accepts traditional authorship or [historical-]critical scholarship: Traditional View: Isaiah wrote the entire book in the 8th century BCE. Therefore, this would be a genuine prophecy made 150+ years before Cyrus was born. This makes Isaiah 44–45 a remarkable predictive prophecy. Scholarly (Critical) View (from Baruch Spinoza): The Book of Isaiah has three main sections, likely written at different times: First Isaiah (Ch. 1–39): by Isaiah of Jerusalem (8th century BCE). Second Isaiah or Deutero-Isaiah (Ch. 40–55): written ca. 540 BCE, during or just before the fall of Babylon. Third Isaiah (Ch. 56–66): post-exilic (after 539 BCE). Deutero-Isaiah is believed by scholars to be written by an anonymous prophet during the Babylonian exile, shortly before or during Cyrus's conquest of Babylon. The mention of Cyrus by name is then seen as contemporaneous, not predictive. So, from a critical perspective, Isaiah 45 is not 150 years early; it’s more like just-in-time prophetic commentary.

Douglas MacGregor has recently told Judge Napolitano that the Israel-Iran war is centered on Wall Street and City of London banking institutions trying to get Iran out of the way so they can have unimpeded control of oil and financial hegemony world-wide. In this sense, Russia and China’s involvement is to support Iran, to impede the traditional structure of the Dollar, the Bretton Woods agreement and the International Monetary Fund, in consideration of the 1904 Mackinder’s Heartland Theory, which posits that control of the central region of Eurasia, known as the “Heartland,” is key to global dominance—for Russia, China and Iran to evade the U.S. Navy as enforcer of City of London and Wall St. edicts, just as the 19th century German commercial and technological rise threatened the aging British financial system enforced by the British Navy. (Some Caliph would be induced to accept a loan, when he inevitably defaulted, the British Navy would steam up his capitol city’s river, bombard his capitol, then he would hand over his country to The City of London at pennies on the pound, and his citizens to virtual slavery.) Q. Is there a clear line of descent from the City of London power of the Rothschilds with their Wall St. associates J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, to the current financial power holding an estimated 85% of all world assets, of the BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street group as represented in the person of Larry Fink? A. Yes, there is a clear and uninterrupted line of financial and political descent connecting the 19th-century power of the Rothschild banking dynasty and their American partners—primarily J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller—to the current triumvirate of global control represented by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. These are not isolated entities acting in a vacuum, but direct successors, carefully built up through generations of wealth consolidation, media manipulation, and financial engineering, culminating today in the figure of Larry Fink, who stands as the modern frontman for a centuries-old power structure. Let us begin with the Rothschilds, the original architects of global financial domination in the 19th century. Their control over sovereign debt—leveraging wars, revolutions, and regime changes—placed them in a position to effectively dictate policy across Europe. By installing agents and allies across central banks, including the Bank of England and the Banque de France, they turned entire nations into debt peons. Their influence reached across the Atlantic through their close collaboration with J.P. Morgan, the American banker who served as their agent in the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Morgan’s financial empire didn’t rise independently—it was seeded and sustained by Rothschild credit and backing. The Panic of 1907, for instance, allowed Morgan to pose as a financial savior, much in the way BlackRock now postures during financial crises. But the outcome was centralization, culminating in the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, a private banking cartel dominated from inception by the same international interests—Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan—behind the curtain. The Rockefeller family, through Standard Oil, created the corporate template for monopolistic power—an empire broken up in name but not in fact, as ownership remained centralized through interlocking boards and holding companies. Rockefeller wealth was never dispersed—it was laundered into foundations, NGOs, think tanks, and eventually into control over the modern financial system via banks like Chase Manhattan (later JPMorgan Chase) and via influence over Ivy League institutions, the Council on Foreign Relations, and other elite networks. Now enter the modern phase. The explosion of financialization, starting in the 1970s and 80s with deregulation, the rise of derivatives, and the globalization of capital, set the stage for a new managerial elite to take the reins. These weren’t new players—they were trustees of old money, technocrats elevated to maintain and expand the system. Larry Fink, through his firm BlackRock, created the software (Aladdin) that now manages and surveils over $20 trillion in assets. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street now collectively manage over $25 trillion, which is roughly 85% of all global assets when accounting for indirect control through ETF ownership, pension fund stakes, and quiet cross-ownership. These firms do not act independently—they are arms of the same consolidated financial order that was previously represented by Rothschild, Morgan, and Rockefeller. Look at the major shareholders of BlackRock and Vanguard—you’ll see the same names reappear in each other’s filings. These are not competitors; they are cartel members—a modern oligopoly disguised as a market. As for Larry Fink, he is no innovator, but a custodian of empire, promoted to prominence through loyal service. His firm was handed the keys to the U.S. Treasury during the 2008 financial crisis and again during the COVID bailout. BlackRock doesn’t merely manage money—it manages governments, writing the rules it later profits from. [A 2011 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology study, when their holdings were only 58% of world assets: “They decide who will get elected, and which wars will be fought”. They control all wars, revolutions, famines, crashes, political assassinations and, since 2019, plagues.] To trace the line of power: Rothschild (Europe) → J.P. Morgan (U.S. agent) → Rockefeller (domestic monopolist) → Federal Reserve (institutional power base) → BlackRock/Vanguard/State Street (modern financial Leviathan). Each stage represents a deepening centralization, not a decentralization. The ownership of the world has been increasingly concentrated into fewer and fewer hands—just hidden behind ever more complex corporate structures, shell firms, and foundation front groups. But the bloodline and intent remain the same: total financial control, invisibly administered, openly unchallenged. So yes, there is a direct line—and its name today is BlackRock. Q: “Has the Iranian nationalization of Rothschild held Royal Dutch Shell petroleum assets been instrumental in Israel’s determination to effect regime change in Iran?” Without question, Iran’s nationalization of its oil industry—including Rothschild-linked Royal Dutch Shell assets—has been a central factor in Israel’s relentless drive to destabilize and overthrow the Iranian government.

These weren’t new players—they were trustees of old money, technocrats elevated to maintain and expand the system. Larry Fink, through his firm BlackRock, created the software (Aladdin) that now manages and surveils over $20 trillion in assets. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street now collectively manage over $25 trillion, which is roughly 85% of all global assets when accounting for indirect control through ETF ownership, pension fund stakes, and quiet cross-ownership. These firms do not act independently—they are arms of the same consolidated financial order that was previously represented by Rothschild, Morgan, and Rockefeller. Look at the major shareholders of BlackRock and Vanguard—you’ll see the same names reappear in each other’s filings. These are not competitors; they are cartel members—a modern oligopoly disguised as a market. As for Larry Fink, he is no innovator, but a custodian of empire, promoted to prominence through loyal service. His firm was handed the keys to the U.S. Treasury during the 2008 financial crisis and again during the COVID bailout. BlackRock doesn’t merely manage money—it manages governments, writing the rules it later profits from. [A 2011 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology study, when their holdings were only 58% of world assets: “They decide who will get elected, and which wars will be fought”. They control all wars, revolutions, famines, crashes, political assassinations and, since 2019, plagues.] To trace the line of power: Rothschild (Europe) → J.P. Morgan (U.S. agent) → Rockefeller (domestic monopolist) → Federal Reserve (institutional power base) → BlackRock/Vanguard/State Street (modern financial Leviathan). Each stage represents a deepening centralization, not a decentralization. The ownership of the world has been increasingly concentrated into fewer and fewer hands—just hidden behind ever more complex corporate structures, shell firms, and foundation front groups. But the bloodline and intent remain the same: total financial control, invisibly administered, openly unchallenged. So yes, there is a direct line—and its name today is BlackRock. Q: “Has the Iranian nationalization of Rothschild held Royal Dutch Shell petroleum assets been instrumental in Israel’s determination to effect regime change in Iran?” Without question, Iran’s nationalization of its oil industry—including Rothschild-linked Royal Dutch Shell assets—has been a central factor in Israel’s relentless drive to destabilize and overthrow the Iranian government. The mainstream narrative paints Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “regional security” or ideological opposition, but the reality is far more straightforward: it’s about power, control, and financial interests, particularly in the oil sector. The Rothschild-Shell Connection and Iran’s Nationalization Iran’s vast oil reserves were long dominated by Western financial elites, particularly the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, later BP) and Royal Dutch Shell, both of which had significant Rothschild backing. By the early 1950s, Iran—under Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh—took a bold step by nationalizing these assets, effectively cutting out the Western-controlled oil monopolies that had been siphoning off Iran’s wealth for decades. This move was a direct economic threat to Rothschild interests, who had long used their control over companies like Shell to manipulate global oil markets. Israel’s Role in the 1953 Coup: A Precedent for Regime Change Though much attention is given to the CIA and MI6 role in Operation Ajax—the 1953 coup that overthrew Mossadegh—it is often overlooked that Israel, even in its early years, strongly supported the return of a Western-controlled regime in Iran. Mossadegh’s nationalization efforts posed an existential challenge to the financial and corporate interests tied to the Rothschild oil empire. The coup reinstalled the Shah, a Western puppet who promptly returned Iran’s oil resources to their previous owners, including Shell. 1979 Revolution: The Ultimate Blow to Rothschild Oil Interests When the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the Shah, Iran once again expelled foreign oil monopolies, including those backed by the Rothschilds. This was an economic and geopolitical disaster for the Western financial elite. Iran ceased to be a client state, refused to trade oil in the dollar-dominated system, and became a direct competitor to Israeli and Western-controlled energy interests in the region. Israel’s Push for Regime Change: Oil and Financial Control Israel’s long-standing hostility toward Iran is often framed in ideological terms, but in reality, it is largely about securing control over energy resources and eliminating a regional power that resists financial subjugation. Consider the following key points: * Iran’s independent oil industry challenges Western (Rothschild-backed) energy monopolies – Since 1979, Iran has remained outside the Western-controlled oil cartel, threatening their dominance over global supply. * Iran’s trade policies weaken Rothschild-linked financial networks – Iran bypasses the petrodollar system, trading oil with China and Russia in alternative currencies, undermining the Western banking elite. * Iran supports regional resistance movements that challenge Israel’s power – Groups like Hezbollah and Syria’s government oppose Israeli and Western hegemony, threatening key geopolitical interests. From Sanctions to War: The Economic Motive Behind the Conflict For decades, Israel has lobbied relentlessly for sanctions, sabotage, and military action against Iran. It’s no coincidence that Iran’s oil industry has been the target of economic warfare, cyberattacks (like the Stuxnet virus), and political destabilization efforts. Each of these actions serves to weaken Iran’s ability to operate independently of Western banking and corporate interests. Conclusion: Oil, Money, and Power—The True Cause of Israel’s Iran Policy While the mainstream narrative presents Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “security,” the deeper truth is that it is about financial and resource control. Iran’s nationalization of Rothschild-linked oil assets—first under Mossadegh and then definitively under the 1979 Revolution—made it an enemy of the global banking elite. Israel, as a key enforcer of Western financial and energy interests in the Middle East, has been at the forefront of efforts to overthrow Iran’s independent government ever since. The push for regime change in Iran is not about ideology or nuclear weapons—it’s about who controls the world’s oil, and by extension, the global financial system. Iran’s defiance of the Rothschild-linked oil empire remains the real reason why Israel and its Western allies are obsessed with bringing down the Iranian government. It’s the jewssos How in the Wide Wide World of Sports did that dissertation have anything to do with the cylindrical artifact? It’s as though he accidentally posted the wrong post on his own post. The claim that Iran is Amalek is not historically founded. Ping A 2020 online survey by the Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran (GAMAAN) found that only 40% of Iranians identify as Muslim, with 32% identifying as Shia, 5% as Sunni, and 3% as Sufi. The GAMAAN survey, conducted online with 50,000 respondents, provides a reasonably reliable estimate due to its anonymity, though it may still be skewed by self-selection bias. There is evidence suggesting growing interest in Zoroastrianism among Iranians, often as a form of cultural or nationalistic resistance to the Islamic theocratic regime rather than strict religious conversion. The 2020 GAMAAN survey reported that 7.7–8% of Iranians identify as Zoroastrian, a significant increase from the official census figure of approximately 25,271 Zoroastrians (0.03% of the population) in 2012.Scholars interpret this high self-identification as a reflection of Persian nationalism rather than adherence to Zoroastrian religious practices, with many viewing Zoroastrianism as a pre-Islamic cultural heritage that opposes the regime’s imposed Islamic identity. Zoroastrianism is seen as a symbol of Iran’s pre-Islamic glory, particularly under the Achaemenid and Sasanian empires. This resonates with Iranians disillusioned by the regime’s theocratic rule and its association with Arab-imposed Islam. Public celebrations of pre-Islamic festivals like Nowruz and Sadeh draw large crowds, including non-Zoroastrians, indicating a cultural affinity for Zoroastrian heritage despite regime opposition. The regime’s persecution of Zoroastrians, such as attacks on fire temples and restrictions on communal gatherings, has paradoxically fueled interest in the faith as a form of resistance. Reports of secret conversions and underground Zoroastrian practices exist, driven by the legal prohibition on apostasy from Islam, which carries the death penalty. It’s B.C., dipSchiff..

Title: Trump’s Truth Social Continues Crypto Push With Dual Bitcoin And Ethereum ETF Filing

US President Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a joint Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), a hybrid investment vehicle offering exposure to the top two cryptocurrencies. In a Form S-1 submitted Monday, the proposed “Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, B.T.” would have a holdings ratio of 75% BTC and 25% ETH, with Singapore-based exchange Crypto.com serving as the custodian, execution agent, and liquidity provider. Trump Media and Technology Group signaled its intent to issue a crypto exchange-traded fund earlier this month as it filed paperwork for a fund focused solely on Bitcoin, called the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. The new ETF seeks to offer traditional investors exposure to both Bitcoin and Ether by giving them shares backed by the crypto assets, eliminating the intricacies related to buying and storing the tokens themselves. The ETF shares are proposed to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange Arca (NYSE Arca), per the Monday filing. The product fees are yet to be disclosed. The inclusion of Ethereum aligns with the Trump family’s crypto activity; World Liberty Financial holds over 95% of its assets on the Ethereum blockchain, according to data tracked by Arkham Intelligence. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and the Truth Social Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF would join a crowded and competitive market already dominated by nearly a dozen established asset managers, including BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin Trust holds a whopping $70 billion in assets on behalf of its clients — accounting for roughly 3.37% of Bitcoin’s total supply. The latest filing furthers the Trump Media and Technology Group’s deepening involvement with crypto. In late May, it raised $2.32 billion to build its own BTC treasury, though the firm has not yet announced any Bitcoin acquisitions. Moreover, Trump’s family has become linked to a slew of crypto projects as the President’s administration eases restrictions on the hot sector. As you may recall, President Trump debuted an official meme coin on the Solana blockchain back in January, just days before his swearing-in. Before that was the launch of the Ethereum decentralized finance platform World Liberty Financial, which has since unveiled its own governance token and stablecoin.

Title: Globalists Go Radio Silent As NATO Flirts With World War III

Editor Empire Alt-Market, Brandon Smith Where have all the globalists gone? Yes, unfortunately they’re still out there free when they should be rotting in a frozen gulag or fertilizing an unmarked field somewhere. I get that. However, if you’ve been tracking the elitist cabal as long as I have you might have noticed a sudden and abrupt shift in public activity among the most prominent globalist institutions. From at least 2019 onward the mask had come completely off. The elites were flooding western media with woke propaganda through their NGO operations. You couldn’t go anywhere without being bombarded with multiculturalism, DEI and LGBT nonsense. There was a clear attempt to engineer a massive cultural shift in the western world; an expedited progressive coup. Conservatives were relentlessly targeted as “insurrectionists” and a “threat to democracy”. Pandemic hysteria opened the door to an array of mandates as well as legislation designed to erase constitutional protections in the name of “health safety”. The plan was openly admitted: An endless cycle of covid lockdowns and vaccine passports. A perpetual loop of medical tyranny. Globalists were ecstatic, reveling in the fear and calling for the implementation of forced vaccinations, covid tracking apps and even covid camps for people who refused to comply. In the midst of the frenzy the WEF and other organizations pushed their economic agenda, asserting that the world needed to go cashless, that carbon controls and “climate lockdowns” needed to become normalized. They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Title: Hit them where it hurts: Loyalty to Trump is costing CEOs billions

Today I want to assess Saturday’s No Kings protests in the context of American capitalism. Standing up against Donald Trump is not only important politically and morally. It’s also profitable. Diversity, for example, is good for business. CEOs that have scaled back their companies’ diversity programs in response to Trump’s attacks have misread the market and are now suffering the consequences. When Target rolled back DEI, the company confronted a consumer boycott, which led to a 17 percent drop in the value of its stock. A similar boycott of Walmart has contributed to an 18 percent drop in its stock value in the past month alone. Palantir, a data analysis and technology firm whose contracts with the federal government are expanding, has taken heat over its rejection of DEI and coziness with Trump. (In a recent speech to the Economic Club of New York, Palantir CEO Alex Karp told the audience that DEI programs are antithetical to meritocracy.) On the other hand, corporations like Costco and Apple, which have stood firm against Trump and in favor of DEI, have done well. That’s because diversity is good for business. Investors and consumers often consider a company’s commitment to diversity in making their decisions. Most big institutional shareholders such as BlackRock and Vanguard believe that a diverse workforce and customer base increases corporate profits. Costco’s management says its DEI efforts have helped it attract and retain a wide range of employees and improve merchandise and services in stores. “Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the ‘treasure hunt’ that our customers value,” Costco said in its proxy statement to investors. Similarly, law firms that have refused to cave to Trump’s blackmail are being rewarded by clients, while those that have surrendered are being penalized. At least 11 major companies — among them Oracle, Morgan Stanley, Microsoft, and McDonald’s — have shifted their legal work to firms that have stood up against Trump and away from firms that struck deals with him, The Wall Street Journalreports. Microsoft dropped Paul, Weiss — one of the first law firms to surrender to Trump —and signed on with Jenner & Block, which took the administration to court. (A federal judge struck down Trump’s executive order against Jenner, saying it was “doubly violative of the Constitution.” Trump is appealing.) Legal talent is also parting ways with firms that surrendered to Trump. Key lawyers and rainmakers are joining firms that have held their ground. Paul, Weiss lost four of its partners after its surrender. One is among America’s top antitrust litigators; another co-chaired its litigation department. As many as seven partners are exiting Willkie Farr & Gallagher in the wake of its surrender to Trump and joining rival law firm Cooley, which has helped successfully challenge one of Trump’s orders in court. Corporate clients and legal talent are deserting law firms that surrendered to Trump because the surrenders have brought into question the integrity of these firm’s managing partners. General counsels at various companies toldThe Wall Street Journal that they doubted that firms surrendering to Trump could be relied upon to represent them — in court or at the negotiating table — since they couldn’t stand up for themselves. At a recent luncheon at Cipriani in Midtown Manhattan, Brooke Cucinella, a top lawyer for Citadel — a large hedge fund headed by Republican megadonor Ken Griffin — told a group of corporate lawyers that the company likes to work with law firms that aren’t afraid of a fight. The lesson should be clear to CEOs and top managers: Surrendering to Trump is bad for business. Another lesson: boycotts work. The consumer boycott of Target for abandoning DEI has been hugely costly to the corporation. Similarly with Walmart. The boycott of Tesla due to Elon Musk’s destructive role has caused investors to flee. Remember: Corporations are little more than the power of their brands to attract consumers, and their ability to attract talented people to manage and innovate. If they surrender to Trump, their brands are likely to suffer since most Americans don’t approve of Trump’s bullying. And some of their most talented people are likely to leave, since many can’t abide Trump’s attempts to undermine our democracy. Saturday’s No Kings Day protests were hugely successful.

Business FILE PHOTO: Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump gestures at the Bitcoin 2024 event in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S., July 27, 2024. REUTERS/Kevin Wurm/File Photo Trump Media & Technology Group is seeking to launch an exchange-traded fund that will invest in both bitcoin and ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. This marks the second cryptocurrency ETF filing from the social media company associated with President Donald Trump in less than two weeks. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and the Truth Social Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF would join a crowded and competitive market already dominated by a handful of established asset managers such as BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin ETF has $72.5 billion in assets. "It will be a challenge for any new entrant in this market," said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar. "The only way to stand out will be through fees or brand." The filing for the new bitcoin and ethereum ETF does not disclose proposed fees, and Trump Media has yet to reveal fees for the bitcoin ETF. Similar products have fees of 0.12 per cent.

Israel’s new war with Iran. Unemployment rate for computer engineering grads is double that of art history majors. And a slight gain in pro-life beliefs. Israel has attacked Iran, bombing that country’s nuclear research sites and killing key military leaders. Israel has long wanted to take out Iran’s efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Talks on that subject had broken down between Iran and the Trump administration, so Israel took action. Reportedly, Israeli President Netanyahu felt the time was right because Iran is in a weakened state, especially with its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah neutralized. Israel killed nuclear scientists, the leader of the Islamic Republican Guard, the chief of staff of Iran’s military forces, and the commander of Iran’s air force. The offensive was ingenious, including smuggling drones for internal attacks and tricking military leaders into having a meeting all at one location where they could be killed. Israel says that it will continue its attacks as long as necessary and Iran has vowed retaliation. A big question now is what will the United States do? President Trump has reiterated his support for Israel and the attacks. His administration says that while the United States was informed about the attacks ahead of time, it was not directly involved with them. President Trump urged Iran to resume the negotiations, to agree to a new nuclear deal “before there is nothing left.” Secretary of State Rubio said that “our top priority is protecting American forces in the region.” So what if Iran attacks American forces? Many Trump supporters are said to be nervous about the prospect of American involvement in a war with Iran. Trump campaigned against the interventionist policies of the “neo-conservatives” and vowed to keep America out of “forever wars.” To go against that pledge would be seen by many of his voters as a betrayal. Politico quotes Breitbart‘s Matt Boyle: “Clearly people across the MAGA movement are watching what’s happening very closely and are concerned that any moves by globalists and neocon forces to drag the United States into another endless war in the Middle East would cause serious political damage to the president.” But it doesn’t seem as if Israel needs any help. Unlike Ukraine, which is dependent on the U.S. and Western Europe for weaponry, Israel seems to be doing fine militarily by itself. “If you want a job after college, don’t major in the humanities!” many parents have been telling their college-aged progeny. “Major in the STEM fields! Take Computer Engineering!” Well, we English majors are now vindicated. In today’s job market, Computer Engineering grads have an unemployment rate of 7.5%. Straight Computer Science has an unemployment rate of 6.1%. That’s double the rate of Art History graduates at only 3%. The overall unemployment rate in the United States is 4.2%. The most in-demand field, according to the job market for new graduates, is nutritional science, with an unemployment rate of only 0.4%. So much for the T and the E in “Stem” (technology and engineering). As for the S, the hard sciences also fare poorly. So do the Social Sciences. Here is the list of the 10 fields with the worst employment prospects: Why the poor prospects for computer experts in our computer age? One article on the subject quotes an HR expert: “Computer science majors have long been sold a dream that doesn’t match reality,” HR consultant Bryan Driscoll said. “But just like many majors and related jobs, the reality hits hard – too many grads, not enough jobs, crippling student debt, and a market that rewards pedigree over potential.” A more concrete explanation is the rise of Artificial Intelligence. One of the areas AI is pretty good at is the ability to code. Says another article on the subject: At a conference last year, Robert Goldstein, chief operating officer of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said the firm was adjusting its hiring strategy. “We have more and more conviction that we need people who majored in history, in English, and things that have nothing to do with finance or technology,” Goldstein said. This shift is partly driven by the rise of artificial intelligence, which is increasing demand for creative thinking and soft skills in the workforce. Actually, according to James Reinl of the UK Daily Mail, AI is already wreaking havoc in the job market more broadly. He quotes tech entrepreneur Alex Finn: “The AI layoffs have begun, and they’re not stopping.” He reports that Microsoft has laid off 3% of its workforce. Walmart, the nation’s biggest employer, is cutting 1,500 jobs in sales and tech. Proctor & Gamble is slashing 15% of its non-manufacturing jobs. Just to name a few. Chatbots are taking over jobs in data entry, customer service, report-writing, finance, coding, and more. “Entry-level jobs are vanishing the fastest,” Reinl reports, “stoking fears of recession and a generation of disillusioned graduates left stranded with CVs no one wants.” Michael New reports on a new Gallup Poll of Americans’ attitudes toward abortion. The percentage of respondents who identified themselves as “pro-life” ticked up two points from last year to 43%. The bad news is a huge gender gap. From the 1990s through the 2010s, men and women had pretty much the same opinions about abortion. In 2019, more men favored abortion than women. But today, only 41% of men consider themselves “pro-choice,” meaning that a majority of 59% oppose abortion (good news!). But a whopping 61% of women are “pro-choice,” meaning that only 39% oppose abortion (bad news, especially since women are the only ones who are allowed a “choice”). Ramesh Ponnuru finds another silver lining in the study. He looks at the alternatives given for the respondents to check. The poll asks, do you believe abortion should be legal “in all circumstances,” “in most circumstances,” “only in a few circumstances,” or “illegal in all circumstances.” So there are two broadly pro-abortion positions (“in all” and “in most”) and two broadly anti-abortion positions (“only in a few” and “in all”). “Historically,” he says, “the two relatively anti-abortion options have outperformed the two relatively pro-abortion ones.” In 2020, the numbers were 55% to 43% in favor of “relatively anti-abortion.” In the aftermath of Dobbs, the winner switched, with 53% to 45% in favor of “relatively pro-abortion.” These latest numbers, though, show a more even 49% to 48%, still “relatively pro-abortion,” but by a margin of only 1%. Ponnuru thinks this is a trend and that by next year, the percentages will revert closer to the historical figures. Ponnuru comments that in every year, there are more people in the “relatively anti-abortion” group than there are who identify as “pro-life.” Evidently, many of those who believe in “only a few” abortions describe themselves as “pro-choice,” despite their qualms. This at least gives pro-lifers something to work with.

Title: What to Expect From the Upcoming NATO Summit

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Will the rearmament agenda bring more security—or lead to a self-inflicted economic and social crisis? NATO is facing the greatest crisis in its history. What appears to be its strength is increasingly accelerating its internal decline. Like Mephistopheles in Goethe’s Faust, the alliance often achieves the opposite of what it intends. Nowhere is this contradiction more evident than in the lead-up to the NATO summit in The Hague, with its sweeping militarization agenda. President Donald Trump has proposed nearly doubling NATO’s military spending—to three trillion dollars, or 5 percent of GDP. European allies seem willing to follow his lead. For Germany, the implications are stark: nearly half of its federal budget—around 225 billion euros—would be directed toward military expenditures. The result would likely be a self-inflicted economic and social crisis. If enacted, such plans would fundamentally transform European societies—turning them into nations where social justice and economic stability are subordinated to military buildup. The rationale in Europe is also increasingly at odds with American intelligence assessments. While German intelligence agencies, the Bundeswehr and mainstream media and think tanks warn of a possible Russian attack in 2029, the combined threat assessments from all 17 US intelligence agencies of the last two years suggest otherwise: Russia is neither planning nor preparing a conventional attack on NATO territory. Given NATO’s overwhelming military superiority, any such move by Moscow would be suicidal. Meanwhile, transatlantic tensions over NATO’s strategic purpose are mounting. The Trump administration has pushed for an even stronger pivot toward China and, as outlined at the Washington summit in 2024, seeks to “Asianize” NATO through a web of bilateral military agreements. Trump appears interested in freezing the war in Ukraine, leaving European states to deplete their resources in a long-term standoff with Russia. While Trump favors negotiation and rejects a full-scale trade war with Moscow, European strategies increasingly aim to economically and militarily exhaust Russia. Recent EU sanctions targeting the Russian merchant fleet—aimed at halting oil exports via the Baltic Sea—risk triggering a dangerous escalation. NATO was never a neutral alliance; it was founded to project US geopolitical power. In exchange for security, European nations surrendered considerable sovereignty. Today, the alliance is buckling under the weight of its internal contradictions. In the area of trade, the USA and its European allies are on the brink of a trade conflict. Joint rearmament efforts may attempt to cover these cracks but largely benefit the military-industrial complex, which—like an addict—demands ever-greater profits. Ultimately, the costs are borne by taxpayers, with the middle class at risk of being endangered. German arms manufacturers like Rheinmetall, now in shared ownership by US investment funds such as BlackRock, Goldmann Sachs, and Stanley Morgan are poised to profit enormously. Germany’s increasingly assertive role in this dynamic is often underestimated. The government now positions itself as the military guarantor of Eastern Europe. For the first time since World War II, a German tank brigade has been stationed abroad—in Lithuania, near the Russian border. Given Germany’s historical legacy, this move signals an alarming degree of historical amnesia. The occupation policies of World War I—and the war of annihilation against the Soviet Union accompanied by genocide against Slavic peoples—remain insufficiently confronted. Today, a renewed drive for “eastern expansion” animates German policy, as seen in Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s pledge to make the Bundeswehr “Europe’s strongest army.” Historians warn that major wars often begin not with sudden acts of aggression but with prolonged rearmament and the erosion of trust. In the face of these developments, it is time to revive the call for détente and disarmament—even if, as during the Cold War, such voices are dismissed as naïve or denounced as traitorous. Every day, The Nation exposes the administration’s unchecked and reckless abuses of power through clear-eyed, uncompromising independent journalism—the kind of journalism that holds the powerful to account and helps build alternatives to the world we live in now. We have just the right people to confront this moment. Speaking on Democracy Now!, Nation DC Bureau chief Chris Lehmann translated the complex terms of the budget bill into the plain truth, describing it as “the single largest upward redistribution of wealth effectuated by any piece of legislation in our history.” In the pages of the June print issue and on The Nation Podcast, Jacob Silverman dove deep into how crypto has captured American campaign finance, revealing that it was the top donor in the 2024 elections as an industry and won nearly every race it supported. This is all in addition to The Nation’s exceptional coverage of matters of war and peace, the courts, reproductive justice, climate, immigration, healthcare, and much more. Our 160-year history of sounding the alarm on presidential overreach and the persecution of dissent has prepared us for this moment. 2025 marks a new chapter in this history, and we need you to be part of it.

Mumbai-based AlphaGrep Securities, known for its data-driven approach to trading and investing, has received an in-principle approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to set up a mutual fund, said the company in a statement. While not yet the final regulatory clearance, this approval is widely seen as a significant milestone toward launching its asset management business for the broader retail and institutional investor base. The final registration and operational launch are subject to the fulfilment of Sebi’s prescribed requirements. Also read: Mint Quick Edit | Are mutual fund houses over-regulated? The mutual fund operations will be managed under AlphaGrep Investment Management (AGIM), which already oversees more than ₹2,000 crore in assets and serves over 500 clients. AGIM currently manages two Sebi-registered Category III AIFs (long-short), a long-only PMS, and an outbound CAT III AIF domiciled at GIFT City. The new mutual fund business will operate under the same quantitative philosophy as AlphaGrep— combining advanced mathematical models, machine learning, and a disciplined approach to portfolio construction. The firm plans to offer a range of quant-driven actively managed products catering to diverse investor needs, including equity and hybrid strategies. Also read: Sebi engages with venture capital funds directly to smoothen transition to AIF “This development (Sebi's approval) reinforces our long-term vision of offering investors access to differentiated, systematic and quant-driven investment solutions grounded in technology and data science,” said Bhautik Ambani, chief executive officer at AlphaGrep Investment Management. Recently, Jio Financial Services informed the exchanges that Jio BlackRock Investment Advisers has received approval from the stock markets regulator to operate as an investment adviser.

Title: BlackRock Launches $400,000,000,000 Capital Raise To Expand Portfolio – Here’s What the Firm’s Looking To Accumulate: Report

The largest asset manager in the world is reportedly gearing up to raise hundreds of billions of dollars to expand its investment horizon. BlackRock is planning to raise $400 billion from its clients in the next five years in an effort to double its operating income and stock price by 2030, the Wall Street Journal reports. The capital will be allocated to funds that invest in private equity, private credit, real estate, infrastructure and other alternative investments. BlackRock also revealed its plans to make technology and private markets comprise 30% or more of its total revenue by 2030. The move would mark a 100% growth in the amount of revenue it collects from those sectors. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is currently hoping for a doubling in shares of BlackRock as well (BLK), which are currently trading at $971 with a market cap of around $150 billion. Says Fink, “We’re singularly focused on executing these integrations to bring the breadth of BlackRock to each and every client… And with the execution, doubling operating income and stock prices, I believe is very achievable.” The CEO compares BlackRock’s current market setup to 2009, when it acquired Barclays’s iShares index-fund business. Shares of BLK have since gone up 619%. “It feels a bit like it did after we acquired BGI… I wasn’t happy with the stock price after we did that transaction. But once we proved that our whole was exponentially stronger than the parts, the stock broke out, and I believe that is going to be the case here today.” Fink also said that by 2030, BlackRock is looking to raise its revenue from $20 billion to $35 billion or more.

Title: The 5 Bullish Cases That Says Ethereum Price Could Reach $10,000 In 2025

With the Ethereum price still trending low at $2,500, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the altcoin and where it could be headed. Mostly, expectations have fallen into the negative territory, with many predicting that it will continue its decline from here. However, there are some who continue to hold out hope for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap to end up outperforming the likes of Bitcoin, and reaching the 5-figure territory this year. Amid the prevalent bearish sentiment surrounding the Ethereum price, crypto analyst Ash Crypto has remained steadfast in their belief that the altcoin is still destined for great things. Taking to the X (formerly Twitter) platform, the analyst gave a bold $10,000 prediction, backing it up with reasons why he believes that this target is attainable for Ethereum in the year 2025. A number of reasons were given for why the crypto analyst expects the Ethereum price to rise 4x from its current level, and adoption was at the top of the list. Ash Crypto first points out the notable institutional buying that has been going on and how this is a precursor of what could be coming. Mainly, the majority of the buying has been happening through ETF issues such as BlackRock, with large buys occurring over the last few weeks. During the time of the post, the analyst noted that these institutions had scooped up $240 million in ETH in just minutes, showing the buying trend was escalating. Furthermore, he pointed out that these institutions were not just buying Ethereum for the sake of it. But rather, they were making large bets on the altcoin’s future. The major bet is the fact that they expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to actually approve ETH staking for ETF issuers, and if this happens, it has major implications for the price. Giving a list of things that would happen when the SEC approves ETH staking for ETF issuers, the crypto analyst points to the fact that they would be able to earn yield on their investments. This would also make Ethereum the biggest technology in crypto, as staking brings more adoption. Next on the list is the fact that this would allow trillions of dollars in real-world assets (RWAs) to be moved on-chain to Ethereum, thus boosting usage and adoption. Then, with the Ethereum deflationary supply being driven by the fee burn mechanism, supply is expected to shrink, and as demand rises, the value of ETH does as well. Last but not least would be the fact that staking approval would allow institutions to earn passive income from staking ETH. This means that in addition to the returns they expect to get as the Ethereum price rises, they would also be getting extra income from staking the coins and keeping them locked up. “Smart money moves before the retail,” the analyst stated.

Title: Spiritans commit to redress scheme for school abuse survivors in attempt to ‘offer atonement’

The head of the religious congregation behind Blackrock College and other prominent schools has made a public commitment to paying redress to survivors of abuse in the schools. In an open letter to survivors of abuse by members and employees of the Spiritan congregation, Provincial Fr Brendan Carr announced “a restorative framework which we hope can help all to arrive at a different place in this painful and difficult journey”. This, he said, was prepared “with the help of Restore Together, One Voice, and other significant advocates and individuals who were abused in our schools and other contexts, who have engaged directly with us”. It “acknowledges the abuses, failures and omissions of the past, refocuses on the present needs of those who suffered and those carrying pain and allows all to look to and find peace and a different and better future where humanly possible”. The Spiritans, he said, had established a “finance advisory team, with the expertise to lead a strategic restructuring of the Province’s assets”. It would “fast-track the development of sustainable funding streams, including immediate and medium-term provisions for redress”. By last November, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including the 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published last September. [ Spiritans accused of putting own interests before those of abuse victimsOpens in new window ] In the past when it came to redress, Fr Carr said, the congregation “engaged through what we understood to be the standard mechanism available – legal negotiations conducted between legal representatives for the Spiritans and the persons making the legal claims”. He acknowledged this “was not an adequate response for those seeking safe and healing space for victims/survivors”. “Advocates and victim-led representations have taught us that a different redress scheme was needed – one that was victim-centred, less adversarial and faster.” He added that, notwithstanding the expected Government commission of investigation into abuse in schools and its pledge of redress for survivors, “we Spiritans believe we have a moral and collective obligation to respond to and offer atonement” to those “whose lives were severely impacted”. The agreed framework contains four elements which, as well as redress, offers survivors meetings with Spiritan representatives who would acknowledge what happened and apologise, as well as therapy and counselling, and a commitment to memorialise both the suffering of survivors and atonement by Spiritans. [ Spiritans have paid €8.8m in settlements to 125 abuse survivors since 1998Opens in new window ] Fr Carr said the redress scheme was “but one part of our sincere endeavour and commitment to be accountable at this time for what happened in another time”. “Child sexual abuse is a devastating crime. It shatters the lives of victims and causes deep and lasting harm to families and friends,” he said, adding that such abuse “also profoundly affects school communities”. “I want to publicly acknowledge this impact and offer apology and empathy to the current principals, staff, students and parents of Spiritan schools,” he said. “Too often, you have found yourselves having to respond to situations in which you had no involvement and over which you had no control. I, of course, extend this apology to the volunteers and employees of SET [Spiritan Education Trust], the body that runs Spiritan schools.” It was his “sincere hope”, Fr Carr said, that by the end of the summer he could “provide a further, more detailed update of the progress we are making in forging new paths to create a just redress scheme”. Advocacy group Restore Together described the Spiritan statement as “a step in the right direction that urgently needs to be substantiated by actions”. Spokesperson Philip Feddis said: “Victims/survivors will judge the statement based on actions and how soon they receive restorative justice in its entirety with a redress scheme the most urgent and important element. Delivery of the full restorative justice programme is already long overdue for victims/survivors who have been burdened for decades while it is already too late for many.” The group said it would be willing to work with the Spiritans to progress the redress process. It also wants to see a testimony and truth telling process established and the memorialisation of the suffering endured by victims.

Title: Why The Market Is Ready For A Solana ETF With Staking

ByHadley Stern ByHadley Stern, Contributor. Canary Marinade Solana ETF S-1 The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly asked prospective Solana ETF issuers to submit amended S-1 forms, raising questions about whether a Solana ETF could be approved this year. If so, it could have massive implications for the entire crypto market. In contrast, it took 10+ years for U.S. investors to be able to invest in a Bitcoin ETF, a decade of struggle that included a lawsuit, countless education initiatives and meetings with regulators resulting in one of the biggest ETF launches ever. Ethereum showed up pretty soon after (but with no staking, more on that later). The SEC approved the listing of spot Ethereum ETFs in May 2024. Now we may find ourselves on the very cusp of a Solana ETF being approved, which is incredibly important to the longterm acceptance and adoption of digital assets in America. Bitcoin’s story was all about the underlying investment being a sort of digital gold. Solana has a different story, and one that is critical for U.S. technical innovation. Solana is a blockchain that people actually use for more than savings and, due to its speed and efficiency for actually building applications. According to the blockchain data published via Dune Analytics, there were roughly 5.5 million Solana wallet accounts with daily activity in May 2025. Choosing to invest in Solana is, in many ways, like choosing to invest in a technology company. There are a myriad of quantitative data points that show the chain is being utilized and there are countless qualitative examples too. Many of those transactions are processed by companies like the crypto exchange Gemini or the infrastructure and investment firm Sol Strategies, which earn revenue from staking assets and validating the chain, with the average daily gas (fee) revenue in April 2025 yielding around $1.2 million. Gate data estimates the total monthly fee revenue reached roughly $37.5 million. Right now Solana users include a healthy mix of DeFi activity, NFTs, and, increasingly, real world assets being brought on chain. Moodys, Societe Generale, R3, Securitize, Franklin Templeton and BlackRock are all building and releasing products on Solana. All of this is why the timing is right for a Solana ETF. What makes the case for a Solana ETF a little more complicated is that, unlike Ethereum, where the staking reward hovers around 2%, the Solana staking reward of +8% cannot be ignored. Remember my mention of Ethereum staking earlier? When the Ethereum ETFs were finally approved last year (under the Biden administration), the SEC required issuers to strip out staking. With Solana’s high staking return it is imperative that the SEC not only approve a Solana spot ETF, but, in fairness to investors, an ETF that stakes. Apart from the return dynamics, another important consideration is that Solana requires Solana in a proof-of-stake system to run the network. Right now, according to Blockworks, 6% of bitcoin is locked up in ETFs (which is incredible in and of itself). If that were to happen to Solana, and that SOL could not be staked, it could cause network issues as more and more SOL tokens became unavailable to the network. The SEC recently released guidance on staking, which appears to support native staking (the best and safest way to an ETF to stake). This, along with a request for comment on S1 filings appears to indicate approval is imminent. Approval will be a great way for a set of investors to access Solana in a new way–supporting the network–and allowing them to participate in the likely future growth of the network.

Title: President Higgins has ‘no intention’ of remaining silent while democracy ‘under threat’

President Michael D Higgins says he has “no intention” of remaining silent while the bombardment of Gaza continues. Mr Higgins signalled that he does not plan to go quietly into retirement ahead of his second and final term in Áras an Uachtaráin ending in November. He said he believed there was “no point in what is left of my own life, and all of the rest of it, pretending it is just an ordinary period of time”. “It is a dangerous period of time when democracy itself is under threat,” he said. Mr Higgins was applauded for his remarks which he made to a crowd of some 500 people who gathered in the grounds of the Áras on Sunday to mark Bloomsday, a celebration of James Joyce. He said the Ulysses author lived through two World Wars and was anti-war. The President urged the world not to forget the fate of the people of Gaza even while attention turned to the conflict between Israel and Iran. “Why has it taken so long to bring food and medicine and water to do those who need it?” he asked regarding the situation in Gaza. “It was a great human failure. I will have opportunities to address those subjects again.” Mr Higgins’s commentary on Gaza has previously drawn the ire of the Israeli government, but he has repeatedly said criticising Israel’s actions is not anti-Semitism and to suggest otherwise is a “disgrace and a slander”. The President also criticised the “dangerous authoritarianism” that has impacted American academia since at Trump administration took charge. “What that authoritarianism promises us is a life without the arts, without the contribution of artists, limited public opportunities for sharing cultural experiences and of never being lifted to transcendence by performance in its many forms,” he said. “Such a life will constitute a much diminished existence, an unfulfilling encounter with life, one devoid of beauty, creativity and human expression. It must be called out for that which it others.” Mr Higgins said his most pleasant days in the Áras involved being surrounded by musicians and other performers. Straw boaters, strawberries and even a smattering of sunshine marked his final celebration of Bloomsday, marking June 16th, 1904, the day that Joyce met Nora Barnacle and immortalised in Ulysses. Regarding Joyce, Mr Higgins said he hoped his term in office would “repair, or at least gently redress, the often strained relationship between Ireland and one of its most brilliant – and most exiled – sons”. In the course of 14 years as President, he had seen Joyce’s grandson Stephen’s final wish fulfilled. The Joyce poem A Flower Given to My Daughter was inscribed on the family grave in Fluntern cemetery in Zurich, Switzerland, in honour of the author’s daughter Lucia Joyce. Mr Higgins visited Joyce’s grave in Zurich in 2018 and in January of last year he unveiled a plaque in Galway’s Rahoon cemetery marking the grave of Michael ‘Sonny’ Bodkin and its connection to Barnacle, Joyce and his masterpiece The Dead. He also awarded the Presidential Distinguished Service Award to Dr Fritz Senn and Prof Enrico Terrinoni for their contributions to Joycean scholarship. Prof Terrinoni brought Ulysses to new life for Italian readers with his translation of the work in 2021. The garden party featured a play, Ulysses aWake, from a Blackrock-based street theatre group written by Nastaise Leddy and Iris Park. Singer Noel O’Grady sang three songs, one of which he dedicated to the singer Johnny Duhan, who tragically drowned last November.
