December 16, 2025 11:27 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Carbon-Smart Investment Portfolio Global Market Report 2025" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The carbon-smart investment portfolio market is witnessing significant expansion, projected to rise from $28.18 billion in 2024 to $33.35 billion by 2025, with a robust CAGR of 18.4%. This growth is propelled by heightened focus on climate-related financial risks, the surge in green bond issuance, and the enhanced performance of renewable energy assets. Contributing factors include the expanding use of climate stress testing and the increasing availability of carbon-offset projects. Looking ahead, the market is set to escalate to $64.67 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 18%. Driving this momentum are factors such as the escalating demand for sustainable investments, rising awareness of climate change repercussions, government incentives favoring low-carbon projects, and a growing interest in net-zero aligned portfolios. Increased transparency in carbon reporting and the integration of blockchain technology are significant trends alongside advancements in carbon accounting, offset verification, and climate risk models. The surge in green building certifications is a pivotal growth driver for carbon-smart investment portfolios. As governments, businesses, and occupiers aim for energy-efficient and sustainable construction, the role of such portfolios becomes increasingly crucial. They provide capital for projects meeting sustainability standards, incentivize energy-efficient practices, and support certified green developments. Notably, in July 2024, the U.S. Green Building Council reported over 46,000 residential projects certified under the LEED rating system, exemplifying this upward trajectory. Key market players are developing innovative strategies to enhance carbon sequestration and biodiversity, attracting environmentally conscious investors. For instance, the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec partnered with Clean Energy Finance Corporation to launch Meldora, a $165 million sustainable agriculture platform promoting climate-smart farming and renewable energy, resulting in high-quality Australian carbon credits. Similarly, in April 2025, Meta Platforms Inc. collaborated with EFM Investments & Advisory LLC to foster climate-smart forestry in Washington State. The alliance aims to generate 676,000 forest carbon credits by 2035, transitioning 68,000 acres to management practices that enhance carbon storage and biodiversity, aligning with Meta's goal to attain net-zero emissions by 2030. Prominent players shaping the carbon-smart investment landscape include Allianz Global Investors GmbH, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., Legal & General Investment Management Ltd., UBS Asset Management AG, and Fidelity Investments, among others. The carbon-smart investment portfolio market analysis indicates that Europe was the largest region in 2024, with Asia-Pacific anticipated to witness the fastest growth rate.

Title: Altcoins update: XRP ETFs hit $1B in inflows; whales offload Ethereum
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/altcoins-update-xrp-etfs-hit-1b-in-inflows-whales-offload-ethereum/
Time Published: 2025-12-16T15:48:14Z
Full Content:
Cryptocurrencies extended their weakness on Tuesday, with Bitcoin sliding toward $85K. The value of all digital assets has declined by 3% over the past day to $2.96 trillion. Sentiments are deteriorating daily due to thin liquidity, as even fundamentally healthy projects are failing to sustain prolonged upsides. Amidst the gloomy outlook, investors are becoming more defensive, with institutional players reducing exposure as they rotate to narratives dominating the current landscape. This divergence is visible in leading altcoins, XRP and Ethereum, in this case. Let us explore further. Ripple’s token is recording a rare enterprise win amid broad market declines. According to SoSoValue data, XRP-linked exchange-traded funds have hot $1 billion in cumulative inflows. That marks a crucial milestone for a product that launched on November 13. Notably, XRP ETFs have recorded consistent daily inflows since their debut. The substantial inflows, within a short timeframe, indicate that expert investors are narrowing their focus and not exiting crypto altogether. XRP’s compliant ETF structure makes it appealing for institutions seeking cryptocurrency exposure without handling operational risks or custody. Most importantly, the inflows suggest a long-term positioning strategy, rather than chasing near-term price fluctuations. XRP’s institutional attractiveness lies in its improved regulatory clarity and clear use cases. Narratives matter the most during bearish sessions. Indeed, traditional investors will justify a payment-focused blockchain ecosystem faster than highly speculative or experimental narratives. Moreover, ETFs are crucial for enterprises looking to manage risk as they offer transparency, compliance, and liquidity. These features are valuable during unstable markets and have helped XRP-related products absorb pressure as rivals endure outflows. Meanwhile, XRP is trading at $1.92 after losing 7% the previous week. While the XRP community cheered staggering inflows, Ethereum is encountering immense selling pressure as large-scale holders reduce their exposure. According to Lookonchain, BlackRock has deposited 47,463 ETH, valued at approximately $140 million, to Coinbase Prime. Markets have interpreted the transaction as a preparation to sell. At the same time, the Konstantin Lomashuk-linked wallet sold 14,585 tokens, worth roughly $42.71 million, today, when ETH changed hands at $2,928. Also, Lookonchain revealed two whales that dumped Ethereum worth around $40.82 million, 14,000 tokens early today. The magnitude and timing of these transfers have intensified bearish sentiments around the largest altcoin. These transactions coincide with an already fragile market, amplifying downward momentum for ETH prices. Ethereum is trading at $2,928 after losing 3% and 6% the past day and week.

Title: Data and AI firm Databricks valued at $134 billion in latest funding round

Title: Databricks raises $4B at $134B valuation as its AI business heats up | TechCrunch

Makes sense, in a way: IPOs were traditionally a way to raise money, and if you can manage to raise ungodly amounts without having to put your company through public scrutiny, why do it? Databricks is proving that point: The data intelligence company has just raised more than $4 billion in a Series L funding round at a $134 billion valuation — up 34% from the $100 billion valuation that it achieved just three months ago. This is Databricks’ third major venture fundraise in less than a year, and it comes as the company focuses on building products that address the needs of the AI revolution: a database for AI agents, an AI agent platform, and apps that let companies build and deploy data and AI applications. The company is investing heavily in its database for AI agents, known as Lakebase, which is based on the open source database Postgres (enabled by the $1 billion acquisition of a startup called Neon), and is aimed at corporate developers’ vibe-coding projects. Meanwhile, its AI agent platform, Agent Bricks, is aimed at helping businesses build and deploy AI agents that can tap into their data. The company has also struck hefty deals worth hundreds of millions with AI labs Anthropic and OpenAI to offer their models within its enterprise products. Series L rounds aren’t really common, but the fact that Databricks has managed to raise venture funding at ever-increasing valuations (it was valued at $60 billion around this time last year) indicates how strongly investors believe in the power of helping companies use data to fuel their AI efforts. Indeed, Databricks on Tuesday said it now generates run-rate revenue of more than $4.8 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, of which more than $1 billion came from its AI products. “The parallel rise of vibe coding and generative AI is accelerating the development of data-intelligent applications in the enterprise. Databricks will use this new capital to help customers build AI apps and agents on their proprietary data, leveraging Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user experience layer, and Agent Bricks to power multi-agent systems,” the company said in a press release. The Wall Street Journal reports that the company will also use the new money to add thousands of new jobs in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, as well as bring on more AI researchers. “Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads,” Databricks’ co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi said in a statement. The round was led by Insight Partners, Fidelity, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Andreessen Horowitz, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, GIC, MGX, NEA, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Robinhood Ventures, T. Rowe Price Associates, Temasek, Thrive Capital, and Winslow Capital also participated. Topics Editor Ram is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

Title: Visa launches USDC settlement for US banks on Solana blockchain
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/visa-usdc-settlement-us-banks-solana-2026
Time Published: 2025-12-16T14:01:04Z

Visa launched USDC settlement for US financial institutions, starting with Cross River and Lead Bank on Solana, with a wider rollout planned for 2026. Payment processing giant Visa has launched USDC settlement services for some United States-based financial institutions. Visa said Tuesday that its USDC (USDC) settlement service is available for US financial institutions, with Cross River Bank and Lead Bank as the first participants; they have already begun settling with Visa in USDC on the Solana blockchain, and a broader rollout is expected in 2026. The report follows USDC issuer Circle’s launch of the public testnet for its layer-1 blockchain Arc, with over 100 major partners, including Visa, Mastercard, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, in late October. Visa noted that it is a design partner for the network, which “offers the performance and scalability needed to help support Visa’s global commercial activity.” Visa said it plans to use Arc for USDC settlements within its network and operate a network node. The payment giant’s global head of growth products and strategic partnerships, Rubail Birwadker, said “financial institutions are looking for faster, programmable settlement options that integrate seamlessly with their existing treasury operations.” Visa said the US launch is part of a larger effort to modernize its settlement infrastructure. Birwadker’s comments suggest that adopting stablecoins is a way for the company to ensure it remains relevant when stablecoins gain a more substantial foothold. He said, “Visa is expanding stablecoin settlement because [its] banking partners are not only asking about it — they’re preparing to use it.” Visa appears to be taking an active role in helping financial institutions adopt stablecoins for their operations. On Monday, the company launched a global Stablecoins Advisory Practice, a unit tasked explicitly with helping banks, merchants and fintechs design, roll out and manage stablecoin products. Related: YouTube enables PYUSD stablecoin payouts for US creators: Report On Nov. 27, Visa announced it had expanded its use of stablecoins for settlement in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa by partnering with crypto infrastructure company Aquanow. The partnership aims “to settle transactions using approved stablecoins such as USDC, reducing costs, operational friction, and settlement times.” Visa cited strong demand from banks and payment companies as the reason behind the initiative. Still, not all Visa stablecoin products are institution-facing services. On Nov. 12, Visa launched a pilot in the US, allowing US dollar-pegged stablecoin payouts to user wallets to be sent from business accounts funded using fiat currency. Visa said it is in the process of onboarding “select partners,” and broader access to the service will be rolled out in 2026.

Business FILE PHOTO: Databricks logo is seen in this illustration taken December 17, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Dec 16 : Databricks said on Tuesday that it has raised more than $4 billion at a valuation of $134 billion, the latest example of investors betting big on companies benefiting from the broader adoption of artificial intelligence. The Series L funding round for Databricks, which provides a software platform that helps firms manage large amounts of data and build their own AI models, came less than six months after its previous round at a valuation of $100 billion. It has given the San Francisco-based company a war chest to maintain investment momentum against competitors. "It's a race, and everybody's investing," Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi said in an interview.

Share this article BlackRock transferred 47,500 Ethereum worth around $140 million to Coinbase Prime early today, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. Ethereum was trading at $2,954 at press time, down over 6% in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko. The digital asset dipped below $3,000 on Monday amid a market-wide selloff that saw Bitcoin sink under $86,000. BlackRock’s latest ETH deposit follows weeks of choppy flows in BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA). Data from Farside Investors shows the fund recorded a net outflow of $139 million yesterday, accounting for most of the $225 million pulled from US Ethereum ETFs. As of December 12, ETHA held about 3.7 million Ethereum worth more than $11 billion. BlackRock’s fund now trails Tom Lee’s BitMine Immersion, which has expanded its holdings to nearly 4 million ETH in the past week. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: America’s $38 trillion national debt ‘exacerbates generational imbalances’ with Gen Z and Millennials paying the price, warns think tank
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/16/us-national-debt-generationa-imbalances-research-think-tank/
Time Published: 2025-12-16T11:32:02Z
Full Content:
The United States’ current borrowing trajectory will place an “undue burden on future generations,” an economic think tank has warned, with younger generations facing a higher interest rate environment, slower economic growth, and stalling wage increases.The latest research from the American Action Forum chimes with concerns across both the public and private sectors. JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell are among those nervously eyeing the nation’s $38 trillion debt burden. The government has paid $10 billion a week to service the debt for the first few months of the 2026 fiscal year.Economists are concerned that at some point, the growth of the American economy will become so disconnected from the borrowing of its government that bond buyers will demand higher premiums on their loans. The worry is that the central bank will intervene by increasing the money supply—kick-starting an inflationary cycle—but that ultimately the government may have to cut back on spending. Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio has described this scenario as an economic “heart attack,” with government investment squeezed out by the need for the country to maintain its debt obligations. Younger people will face the sharpest end of that outcome, warned Jordan Haring, director of fiscal policy at the American Action Forum. Haring, formerly a senior policy analyst at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), wrote in a note this week: “The United States’ high debt load exacerbates generational imbalances. These imbalances will ultimately burden younger and future generations with higher interest payments, slower economic growth, slower income growth, and a greater burden to bear for future tax or spending changes.” She continued: “Without significant policy changes to reduce debt growth, future generations will inherit a budget where significant resources are locked into servicing past borrowing. “As interest costs rise, the federal government will have less money available for education, infrastructure, or scientific research—areas that directly support long-term prosperity. Future taxpayers will face higher tax burdens or reduced government services simply to cover the costs created by previous budget deficits.” Haring pointed to the discrepancies in budgets between education and health services, for example. Already the gap is large: In 2025, the Department of Education requested $82.4 billion for its budget, while in 2024 Medicaid spending totaled more than $900 billion, per the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission. With an aging population, it is likely that spending on social care will increase over the coming decades. Lower birth rates will mean fewer entrants into the ranks of the economically active to maintain the revenues gathered by the government. While the accuracy of the conservative think tank’s research has been criticized in the past, Haring’s stance has been echoed by the likes of BlackRock’s Larry Fink. Last year, Fink urged corporate leaders and politicians to pursue “an organized, high-level effort” to rethink the retirement system. In a letter to BlackRock investors, Fink wrote: “The federal government has prioritized maintaining entitlement benefits for people my age (I’m 71) even though it might mean that Social Security will struggle to meet its full obligations when younger workers retire.” He added: “It’s no wonder younger generations, millennials and Gen Z, are so economically anxious. They believe my generation—the baby boomers—have focused on their own financial well-being to the detriment of who comes next. And in the case of retirement, they’re right.” With a shift in economic activity from one generation to the next comes new flows of wealth, and this is something governments around the world will be looking to leverage, according to experts. Studies have found that over the next 20 to 30 years as much as $124 trillion will be passed down from older generations to their younger counterparts, though UBS puts the figure of the so-called Great Wealth Transfer at $80 trillion. Baby boomers—people born between 1946 and 1964—are the wealthiest generation in history, and as these individuals begin passing on their assets, sums will go immediately to their Gen X, millennial, and Gen Z successors, and some cash will go to spouses. “The change in wealth comes at a time when many governments around the world have high debt and deficits. It seems unrealistic to suppose that governments will just sit idly by as this wealth moves around. We would expect governments to attempt to mobilize that wealth to help fund their debt, but in doing so that denies private sector investment access to some of those funds.”

Title: November 2025: The new priorities of European tech investing
URL: https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/comment/november-2025-new-priorities-european-tech-investing/
Time Published: 2025-12-16T11:16:36Z

European technology investing can no longer be relegated to the continent’s economic sideline. New movement in the sector and regular activity over the past few years have made it one of the primary infrastructures on which other industries and services are built. Every month, I publish a brief look at how this European tech sector is evolving, not just to summarise, but to better understand what the market is building towards.In this edition, the evidence further shows that tracing capital concentration is shaping Europe’s next phase of tech development. November was a particularly useful snapshot of activity, marking a shift from chasing the “next big theme” to backing essential parts of the sector’s infrastructure and disciplined scaling. Capital flows towards technologies that grow when risk is managed, production is planned, and execution outweighs narrative. One of the core signals of growth in the European tech industry in 2025 has been the rise in strategic investing, spanning defence, dual-use systems, and energy hardware. Capital is flowing towards tech that builds sovereignty as much as long-term resilience – as first signalled in my Summer 2025 analysis. By this fall, a pattern emerged not as a spike, but as a clear sign of market stability. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more What shifted in November was the focus from the tech itself to the capacity to produce it. Investors financed strategic solutions as well as their supply chains, fabrication, and manufacturing. The evidence of this investment shift is unmistakable in examples like Quantum Systems in Germany raising €180M to push dual-use aerial systems at an industrial scale, or Lithuania’s development bank backing MNP Technologijos/Monopulse to expand manufacturing of NATO-grade drone components. Over in Dresden, Ferroelectric Memory Company raised €100M (mixing €77M in private capital with IPCEI/EIC support) to further expand semiconductor fabrication for efficient AI computing, and France added depth with Hummink, bringing the total to €15M in microfabrication processes. Even Holosolis committed to a PV gigafactory at €220M or more. All these signs underscore that sovereignty has shifted from a theme to a production agenda. The space industry is growing faster globally. In Europe, what had looked in September and October like a series of strong individual rounds began to consolidate in November, marking a shift towards an industry with its own financial architecture, supporting repeatable deals. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The first of these signals was the emergence of institutional capital, when the European Investment Bank offered Space TechEU a €500M programme of dedicated funding rather than a one-off initiative. The second was the shift from isolated rounds to production-focused scaling across Europe. For example, Toulouse U-Space raised €24M for an industrial target of one satellite per week. In Germany, Reflex Aerospace closed a €50M Series A (the largest in European New Space) tied to sovereign space-based intelligence needs. Both rounds were based on manufacturing and production, not focused solely on R&D. Then the market matured to the orbital services layer of space. In France, Infinite Orbits secured €40M to scale in-orbit inspection and life-extension services (mixing private capital and EIC funding). That maturity is crucial, as it means financing focuses on infrastructure rather than just project creation. AI is everywhere, especially in 2025, but primarily as software systems with horizontal capabilities in workflows, data tools, and automation. What changed in November was the shift from software-only AI towards embodied systems and robotics. A scalable set of robotics deals across Europe appears less as isolated bets and more as shaping the physical AI stack in early stages. The first layer is the intelligence stack that trains, coordinates, and controls AI robotics. In Zurich, Flexion Robotics raised nearly €50M for a “brain stack” powering humanoid robotics. In London, Neuracore raised €2.5M in pre-seed funding to build a unified robot-centric infrastructure. Another layer came in deployment across industries. This was evident in Switzerland’s Gravis Robotics, which raised €19.9M to bring construction robots into operation through its “Excavator-as-a-Service” model. The Netherlands saw Saia Agrobotics raise €10M to steadily scale robotic greenhouse automation over clear productivity metrics. Taken together, these deals signal that robotics are getting out of the lab and into revenue-generating settings. Dexterity in robotics came next, as Zurich-based mimic raised €13.8M in Seed to focus on manipulation for complex physical tasks, and Forgis raised €3.8M pre-seed to develop industrial automation modules that extend AI into machinery. Beneath all of this, a components layer formed with Italy’s adaptronics raising €3.15M to scale electro-adhesive grippers, hardware crucial to the rest of the stack. When exploring the entire sector, these deals tell a story: robotics is shifting from prototyping and new product development to layered, investable solutions with AI-backed systems. While AI is making waves in robotics, it is also crucial in embedded workflows, analytics, and automation through industries like banking and healthcare. That activity leading up to November has led to the growth of a parallel market for controlling, securing, and governing AI integrations. Such investment is no longer a one-off, but an essential budget line, driven by rising demands in compliance, fraud prevention, identity and security. In the governance layer, London’s AI Score raised just under $1M to centralise oversight of AI use, ensuring visibility, auditability, and policy in one place. Vigilant AI.ai in the UK added “AI teammates” designed for regulated environments, supporting operational and governance needs. Fraud prevention is just as crucial, especially as AI makes it easier for scammers, fraudsters, and hackers to operate. The UK’s Falkin raised €1.7M in pre-seed funding to focus on blocking fraud before payments are made. Romania’s TMT ID secured €34M for identity intelligence and cybercrime prevention, one of the biggest European checks this month in anything related to trust or security. November also marked brand and misinformation defence, with the Netherlands’ Social Links raising €2.6M for tools that help companies defend against identity abuse, scam campaigns, and AI-driven misinformation (a category that barely existed only two years ago). Beneath all these layers is an emphasis on security, with Norway’s Bsure raising €1.8M to target identity, access, and licence risk across Microsoft environments. The pattern is clear: AI drives innovation, but also requires new mandatory spending on oversight, compliance, and trust. November marks the emergence of early architecture for the “AI risk stack,” sure to scale in parallel with AI across other applications. Earlier in 2025, debt slowly entered venture rounds as an add-on, then as blended structures. In November, that shift grew, with companies scaling through financial structures rather than solely through equity rounds. That took the form in multiple ways. Instead of raising larger Series A or B rounds, several companies focused on opening credit lines aligned with their business models. A clear example came from the UK’s BKN301 Group, which paired its €32M Series B with an institutional facility backed by BlackRock-managed funds. Zilch followed a similar pattern: its latest financing blended debt and equity with a securitisation expansion arranged alongside Deutsche Bank, using credit capacity as the engine for commercial scaling. Together, these cases show how credit capability, rather than dilution, increasingly fuels growth. November saw securitisation solidify its role as a meaningful scaling tool, something that used to live in banking and structured credit more than in venture-backed firms. For instance, London’s Zilch raised over €150M across debt and equity while expanding its securitisation programme with Deutsche Bank (using receivables as an asset for growth). This marked financing expansion through structured instruments rather than repeated equity rounds. November also saw companies scale with capital tied to managed assets rather than their latest valuation. In the UK, Keyzy expanded using asset-backed funding to finance property purchases, with more than €147M having already flowed through its model over 18 months. The company continues to grow as more homes move through the platform, without having to reset valuation every time it adds capacity. Hybrid stacks began appearing in early funding stages. In Spain, Devengo raised €2M in pre-Series A funding, combining equity and debt. While small, this signals that mixed financing structures are no longer limited to later-stage companies. Altogether, November highlighted the need for companies to focus on growth through smarter financing tools, not bigger venture checks. It shows that scaling is increasingly possible without constant dilution, and that venture is gradually absorbing capital-markets logic. Europe’s tech industry and exit market are active, but not in a way that generates broad liquidity. November saw small, focused acquisitions over massive or complex headline deals. Across the region, the pattern was visible in volume: the DACH markets alone saw 69 tech M&A transactions, with smaller, tuck-in deals outweighing larger, valuation-defining exits. POM’s acquisition of FarPay pulled invoicing, payments, and AR automation into a singular workflow. Integral bought CleverLohn in Berlin, folding payroll into its HR suite. Latvia’s TestDevLab was absorbed by Xoriant, adding delivery capacity. What links these deals is that they are not built around liquidity. They are driven by functionality. Buyers are acquiring capabilities they need immediately, while teams are joining larger platforms so their work can be used at scale. As the tech market becomes more industrial and execution-focused, exit activity looks smaller and is based on transactions that boost system strength. November’s patterns point in the same direction. European tech is moving out of the exploratory phase. What is visible now is greater discipline around production, supply chains, real-world deployment, and financing built for scale. That trend is reflected in defence, space, robotics, and AI, shifting towards things that can be manufactured, integrated, or operated. For investors, the market represents progress being measured by what can actually be built. For companies, the environment has shifted to one that rewards readiness — the ability to ship, deliver, and become part of the industrial stack. As Europe moves into the next cycle, this is the emerging shape — not one of narrative, but of a new, clearer sense of what the continent chooses to develop at scale. It outlines the trajectory along which the tech sector will continue to evolve. Oleg Khuaenov is CEO & Founder of Zubr Capital

Title: Jio Financial Services aims to be a constructive disruptor in India's financial services sector
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/jio-financial-services-constructive-disruptor-india-11765858049983.html
Time Published: 2025-12-16T10:05:38Z

MUMBAI: Jio Financial Services is not letting its late entry into the financial services space deter it from aiming for the top. Backed by the Jio brand, data support from parent companies, and learnings from peers, the non-banking financial company (NBFC) hopes to become a “constructive disruptor”. “For us, in financial services, we hope to be what I call ‘constructively disruptive’,” managing director and chief executive officer Hitesh Sethia said at the Mint BFSI Conclave 2025 on 12 December. “One has to be price competitive because that is true value for the customer. We will have to play on the advantage of cost and scale.” Jio Financial Services is the holding company for several businesses: NBFC Jio Credit Ltd, Jio Payments Bank Ltd, wealth management joint venture Jio BlackRock Investment Advisers Pvt Ltd, and asset management joint venture Jio BlackRock Asset Management Pvt Ltd, among others. Sethia said pricing competitiveness will come not through a price war but via cost engineering at scale, underpinned by technology. “We have the advantage to set everything from a zero base. If we are able to do that with today's modern technology, with the brand and capital that we have, there is a good chance we have in creating value for customers and capturing value for shareholders,” Sethia said. “That is an equation that can be solved.” He highlighted that Jio Financial’s late entry allows it to incorporate lessons from decades of industry data across timing the market, product segments, customer segments, and distribution channels. “Technology can certainly make a lot of products DIY (do-it-yourself). It can also digitize the distribution channel, make that intelligent and far more efficient. That is happening as we see.” The NBFC had assets under management (AUM) worth ₹14,712 crore as of end of September, while the AUM of the AMC business was at ₹15,980 crore across nine funds. The wealth management, broking and insurance businesses are still in the incubation phase. Demerged from Reliance Industries and listed in 2023, Jio Financial underwent a management and business overhaul to grow its loan book across home loans, loans against property, loans against mutual funds, loans against shares, and supply chain finance. Sethia, appointed CEO in November 2023, considers Jio Financial both a startup and a late entrant, but one blessed with two things most startups take years to build: brand and capital. “We were born with two things, which most startups take many years to build,” Sethia said, adding that the goal now is to build a “stable, steady” financial institution which is able to “last decades and weather the cycles that come with lending”. The plan is to start with secured loan products and later look at other loan products that “may be needed”, he said. Partnerships form a cornerstone of Jio Financial’s strategy. The company has 50:50 joint ventures (JVs) with BlackRock for asset management, wealth management, and broking. It has another 50:50 JV with Allianz Insurance for reinsurance, and has signed non-binding agreements with Allianz to enter life and general insurance. The company is also leveraging the Jio ecosystem. “We are present in MyJio, which is a part of the Jio telecom company. The MyJio app has a few hundred million monthly active users. That gives us a funnel for Jio Finance as well. There is clearly a case for collaboration between industries,” he said, citing the example of telecom and e-commerce with financial services. “In an eventual scale, we expect to be a full-scale service firm. We will span across the entire length and breadth of the country,” Sethia said. With Jio Payments Bank’s banking correspondent network, Jio Financial already has over 200,000 touchpoints nationwide and 18 million mobile app users. “The game has to be expanding the market rather than trying to eat up just the existing market share,” said Sethia, who sees opportunity in taking wealth management services to people in the ‘the middle of the pyramid’ as well as offering better services to people at the 'top of the pyramid'. Sethia emphasized simplifying financial services, meeting evolving customer expectations, and moving from a “digital first to intelligent always” approach. “Simply put, financial services has to work like Wi-Fi. When you need it, it is available and when you don't, it's quiet in the background.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: XRP ETFs Log One Month of Inflows as BTC, ETH Funds Bleed $4.6B

Time Published: 2025-12-16T00:53:47Z

Written & Edited byOihyun Kim US-listed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded one month of consecutive net inflows since their November 13 debut, setting them apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs that experienced billions in outflows over the same period. The milestone marks a turning point for XRP, which was excluded from traditional investment vehicles for years due to regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ripple’s legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, with spot ETFs lifting that barrier, institutional capital is flowing into the asset at a pace that has surprised even bullish observers. According to SoSoValue data, XRP spot ETFs have attracted fresh capital every trading session since launch, lifting cumulative net inflows to approximately $990.9 million as of December 12. Total net assets across the five products climbed to about $1.18 billion, with no single day of net redemptions recorded. The consistency stands out in a market where even the largest crypto ETFs have struggled to maintain steady momentum. Over the same 30-day window, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $3.39 billion in net outflows, including a single-day withdrawal of roughly $903 million on November 20. Ethereum ETFs followed a similar pattern, posting about $1.26 billion in net outflows. The divergence was most pronounced on December 1. On that day, XRP ETFs brought in $89.65 million while Bitcoin ETFs gained just $8.48 million—roughly one-tenth of XRP’s figure. Ethereum ETFs, meanwhile, recorded more than $79 million in net outflows. December trading has further highlighted the contrast. Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded four negative flow days compared to eight positive days, while Ethereum ETFs displayed similar volatility with five negative days and seven positive days through December 12. XRP ETFs maintained positive flows throughout. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that XRP has become one of the fastest spot crypto ETFs to reach $1 billion in assets under management in the US, trailing only Ethereum. “There’s pent-up demand for regulated crypto products,” Garlinghouse stated. He highlighted Vanguard’s recent decision to offer access to crypto ETFs through traditional retirement and investment accounts, noting that crypto is now “accessible to millions more people who don’t need to be experts in the technology.” Garlinghouse also emphasized that longevity, stability, and community strength are increasingly essential themes for these new “off-chain crypto investors.” 👀<4 weeks, and XRP is now the fastest crypto Spot ETF to reach $1B in AUM (since ETH) in the US.With over 40 crypto ETFs launched this year in the US alone, a few points are obvious to me:1/ there’s pent up demand for regulated crypto products, and with Vanguard opening up… CME Group announced the launch of Spot-Quoted XRP and SOL futures on December 15, further expanding institutional access to XRP. “We’ve seen strong demand for our current Spot-Quoted Bitcoin and Ether futures, with more than 1.3 million contracts traded since launched in June, and we are pleased to add XRP and SOL to our offering,” said Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products at CME Group. The existing Spot-Quoted Bitcoin and Ether futures have experienced substantial growth, with December average daily volume reaching 35,300 contracts and a record trade day of 60,700 combined contracts on November 24. Market analysts suggest that the uninterrupted inflow pattern indicates that XRP ETFs are being used as structural allocations rather than as tactical trading instruments. “This is just 5 spot ETFs. No BlackRock, no 10-15 ETFs exposure yet, but they are coming,” one analyst noted, projecting that if weekly inflows remain near $200 million, cumulative inflows could surpass $10 billion by 2026. Despite strong ETF inflows, XRP’s price performance has remained subdued. The token has declined nearly 15% over the past month and was trading at $1.89 at press time. The disconnect between inflows and price may reflect the mechanics of ETF markets. ETF creation and redemption involve complex arbitrage processes that delay price effects. Market makers hedging their positions may also blunt some of the immediate impact from inflows.

Title: Warner Bros. is blockbuster finale to $4.5 trillion M&A haul
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/15/mergers-acquisitions-4-5-trillion-warner-bros-second-highest-year-ever/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T23:27:32Z
Full Content:
Dealmakers are heading into the final weeks of 2025 on a $100 billion cliffhanger. Paramount Skydance Corp.’s hostile bid to snatch Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. from under the nose of Netflix Inc. encapsulates the themes that have shaped a banner year for mergers and acquisitions: renewed desire for transformative tie-ups, massive checks from Wall Street, the flow of Middle East money and US President Donald Trump’s role as both disruptor and dealmaker. Global transaction values have risen around 40% to about $4.5 trillion this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show, as companies chase ultra-ambitious combinations, emboldened by friendlier regulators. That’s the second-highest tally on record and includes the biggest haul of deals valued at $30 billion or more. “There’s a sentiment in boardrooms and among CEOs that this is a potential multi-year window where it’s possible to dream big,” said Ben Wallace, co-head of Americas M&A at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “We’re at the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle so there’s anticipation that there will be more liquidity.” Beyond Netflix’s purchase of Warner Bros., this year’s blockbusters include Union Pacific Corp.’s acquisition of rival railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corp. for more than $80 billion including debt, the record leveraged buyout of video game maker Electronic Arts Inc., and Anglo American Plc’s takeover of Teck Resources Ltd. to reshape global mining. “When you look around and you see your peers doing these big deals and taking advantage of the tailwinds, you don’t want to be left out,” said Maggie Flores, partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP in New York. “The regulatory environment is in a position that is very conducive to dealmaking and people are taking advantage of it.” The tally also shows a level of exuberance in certain pockets that some advisers and analysts worry is unsustainable. Global trade tensions are ongoing, and market observers are increasingly warning of a selloff in the white-hot equity markets that have underpinned the M&A resurgence. Top executives at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley have all flagged the risk of a correction in the months ahead, in part tied to concerns about an overheated artificial intelligence ecosystem, where huge amounts of investment have juiced technology stocks. “These equity returns are really coming out of AI, and AI spend is not sustainable,” said Charlie Dupree, global chair of investment banking at JPMorgan. “If that pulls back, then you are going to see a broader market that isn’t really advancing.” The AI buzz led to some the year’s standout transactions. Sam Altman’s OpenAI took in major investments from the likes of SoftBank Group Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Walt Disney Co., and a consortium led by BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners agreed to pay $40 billion for Aligned Data Centers. In March, Google parent Alphabet Inc. framed its $32 billion acquisition of cybersecurity startup Wiz Inc. as a way to provide customers with new safeguards in the AI era. “Everyone needs to be an AI banker now,” said Wally Cheng, head of global technology M&A at Morgan Stanley. “Just as software began eating the world 15 years ago, AI is now eating software. You have to be conversant in AI and understand how it will affect every company.” The technology sector more broadly has already notched a record year for deals, thanks to a series of big-ticket takeovers across public and private markets. The trend extended to the White House over the summer, when the US government took a roughly 10% stake in Intel Corp. in an unconventional move aimed at reinvigorating the company and boosting domestic chip manufacturing. It was one of the clearest indications of Trump’s willingness to blur the lines between state and industry and insert himself into M&A situations during his second term, particularly in sectors deemed mission critical. His administration also acquired a stake in rare-earth producer MP Materials Corp. and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has hinted at similar deals in the defense sector. Trump has separately been positioning himself as kingmaker on high-profile transactions. The government secured a so-called golden share in United States Steel Corp. as a condition for approving its takeover by Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp., and the president recently signaled he’ll oppose any acquisition of Warner Bros. that doesn’t include new ownership of CNN. “The Trump administration’s approach to merger regulation today is markedly different compared to the first time around,” said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. Quinn said he couldn’t think of a member of the Republican Party from 15 to 20 years ago who would now believe the US government “is involved in the business of picking winners.” To be sure, bankers will be wondering if they could have achieved more in 2025 had it not been for the chaotic period earlier in the year, when deals were put on hold after Trump’s trade war hobbled markets. And in a sign that persistent economic challenges are still impacting some parts of M&A, the number of deals being announced globally remains flat. Many small and mid-cap companies have lagged the broader stock market and are opting to pursue their own strategic plans instead of weighing inorganic options, according to Jake Henry, global co-leader of the M&A practice at consultancy McKinsey & Co. “They’re thinking ‘I’m better off just operating my business and getting there.’ It has to be an explosive offer for them to come to the table,” he said. Meanwhile, private equity firms, whose buying and selling is a key barometer for M&A, are still having a harder time offloading certain assets because of valuation gaps with buyers. This has had a knock-on effect on their ability to raise funds and spend on new acquisitions. But bankers are starting to see a recovery here too as interest rates come down and bring more potential acquirers to the table. “What’s motivating sponsors more than anything is their need to return cash to investors,” said Saba Nazar, chair of global financial sponsors at Bank of America Corp. “We have been in bake-off frenzy for the last couple of months.” Dealmakers began the year whispering of M&A records under Trump’s pro-business administration. While they will just miss out on the milestone in 2025, there is a strong sense on Wall Street that those early bumps only delayed the inevitable. Brian Link, co-head of North America M&A at Citigroup Inc., said that after ‘Liberation Day’ in April, he expected to spend more time figuring out the impact of tariffs on different business and how to adjust around that. “That has not been the case,” he said. “Unless fear creeps back into the market, there doesn’t seem to be anything in the near term that’s going to change the dynamic here.”

Title: PME Pensioenfonds Terminates $5.9B BlackRock Mandate
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/pme-pensioenfonds-terminates-5-9b-blackrock-mandate/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T21:19:51Z
Full Content:
PME Pensioenfonds, a Dutch pension fund with $70 billion in assets, has terminated a $5.9 billion equity mandate with BlackRock due to the manager’s misalignment with the fund’s environmental, social and governance framework, the fund announced on Monday. According to the release, PME began reviewing its relationship with BlackRock as early as January, following the firm’s departure from the Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a collective of asset managers who sought to achieve net-zero portfolio emissions by 2050. The initiative paused operations following the departure of BlackRock, which was among the most prominent asset managers to leave. “As part of our strategy to invest for a good pension, we make deliberate choices about the companies included in our equity portfolio,” PME’s announcement stated. “We aim for a portfolio with a limited number of stocks, enabling us to better understand our investments and pursue an improved balance between risk, return, and sustainability. Implementing this strategy also means we carefully select and evaluate our external asset managers.” In 2022, PME began defining its ESG goals, evolving the goals into an ESG framework and later an ESG index portfolio it called the portfolio of tomorrow, in which “every company is selected based on deliberate choices aimed at achieving solid returns and supporting a living world,” PME stated. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  Following PME’s evaluation of BlackRock, the pension fund decided to end its relationship with the $11.5 trillion asset manager. “BlackRock has provided PME with high-quality services for many years in managing part of our equity portfolio,” PME stated. “We value that collaboration and the contribution they have made in managing our investments. However, PME also considers which external managers best align with our vision and the principles of the Portfolio of Tomorrow.” Going forward, PME will only rely on two asset managers to manage its equity investments—UBS Global Asset Management and MN, an investment manager based in The Hague, Netherlands. The move to two managers for the equity portfolio also will lower the pension fund’s costs, according to PME. “BlackRock has been entrusted by clients in the Netherlands and around the world to manage more sustainable and transition assets than any other asset manager. These clients see us as their partner of choice for achieving their investment goals, including their net zero objectives,” a BlackRock spokesperson wrote via email. “We manage more than €350 billion in total for our Dutch clients and are proud of our continued growth in the country. We are grateful for the opportunity to have served PME and its members for more than a decade.” PME is the latest European allocator to terminate a mandate due to ESG misalignment. PFZW, the Dutch pension fund for the care and welfare sector, terminated BlackRock—as well as AQR Capital Management LLC and Legal & General Investment Management—in September. In March, AkademikerPension, the Danish pension for academics, terminated a 3.2-billion-Danish-Krone ($503 million) mandate with State Street due to ESG misalignment, and U.K.-based defined contribution master trust The People’s Pension terminated a 28-billion-pound ($37.42 billion) mandate, also with State Street, due to misalignment with the pension fund’s sustainable investing policy, awarding the business to Invesco and Amundi. The termination of these European mandates showcases the tightrope that asset managers like BlackRock must walk regarding ESG factors—some investors and lawmakers deem BlackRock to be uncommitted to ESG goals, while others have criticized the firm for the opposite reason. In the U.S., the manager has lost mandates, including a fixed-income mandate from the Indiana Public Retirement System, due to its ESG commitment. “PME’s decision reinforces a clear shift in how asset owners are responding to climate risk,” said Alasdair Docherty, a sustainable finance and data analyst at the Norway-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, in a statement. “Large pension funds increasingly see climate change not as a moral issue but as a systemic financial threat to long-term portfolio values, and they expect their managers to act accordingly.” In November, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander called for the city’s $308.3 billion pension system to drop BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora Asset Management for failing to meet the system’s climate expectations from its managers. “Stewardship failures are now being treated as a material mandate risk,” Docherty continued in his statement. “For asset managers, particularly in the U.S., retreating from climate stewardship may once have felt like the path of least resistance, offering short-term relief from political and commercial pressure. Increasingly, that looks less like pragmatism and more like a strategic miscalculation.” Related Stories: Dutch Pension PZFW Terminates BlackRock, AQR, L&G Mandates Amidst Portfolio Reshuffle NYC Comptroller Calls for City Pensions to Drop BlackRock, Fidelity, PanAgora BlackRock AUM Surges Past $13T, Alts Investments Double Tags: BlackRock, PME Pensioenfonds « Trump Issues Executive Order Seeking to Curb Proxy Advisers’ Influence

The deal folds adviser-facing tools into Anchorage’s platform while allowing Securitize to remain focused on tokenizing real-world assets. Anchorage Digital, a federally chartered digital asset bank, acquired Securitize’s investment adviser platform as it seeks to expand its reach among institutional investors amid the growing adoption of digital assets. Anchorage announced on Monday that it has completed the acquisition of Securitize For Advisors (SFA), a lesser-known unit of Securitize, a company best known for tokenizing real-world assets. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. SFA is designed for registered investment advisers (RIAs); before the acquisition, it already relied on Anchorage for custody of client assets. By bringing the adviser platform in-house, Anchorage consolidates custody, trading and adviser-facing tools within a single platform, rather than operating across separate systems. Anchorage is an institutional crypto platform that operates a federally chartered digital asset bank in the United States. In March, it was selected by Cantor Fitzgerald as a custody partner for Bitcoin (BTC). For Securitize, the sale enables the company to focus more on its core tokenization business, according to Carlos Domingo, the company’s CEO. Securitize has been accelerating its real-world asset strategy and is moving forward with plans to go public through a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald. In May of last year, it raised $47 million in a funding round led by BlackRock. Securitize is behind BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, known as BUIDL. Related: Anchorage Digital adds HYPE staking support through Figment partnership Nathan McCauley, co-founder and chief executive of Anchorage Digital, said registered investment advisers are “driving one of the most important waves of crypto adoption,” likely referring to growing institutional adoption of digital assets through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) RIA involvement has been building for several years. Momentum began to shift in 2020, when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency allowed federally chartered banks to custody digital assets, giving advisers a compliant pathway to gain exposure. Broader participation followed the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, which lowered operational and regulatory hurdles for advisers and accelerated mainstream access. The funds align with existing RIA infrastructure, including broker-dealers and custodians, making allocation easier for institutional investors. Even after early adoption, RIAs still control access to sizable portions of the market that have yet to enter the digital assets space. “The reason that we’re here today is because of the retail channels adopting crypto ETFs and crypto more broadly,” Federico Brokate, an executive at crypto issuer 21Shares, told Cointelegraph. “The next category is RIAs, and this is where we need to see the majority of ETF flow over the next five years.” Related: SEC staff gives guidance on how securities laws could apply to crypto Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: Anchorage Digital Acquires Securitize Platform in Major Crypto Wealth Management Consolidation

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Anchorage Digital has acquired the Securitize For Advisors platform, strengthening its position in crypto wealth management for registered investment advisors as both firms pursue distinct institutional strategies. The first federally chartered crypto bank in the US, Anchorage Digital, has acquired the Securitize For Advisors (SFA) platform from tokenization specialist Securitize, tightening its grip on the growing market for crypto wealth management tools aimed at registered investment advisors (RIAs). The move comes as Anchorage ramps up its regulated stablecoin and custody business, while Securitize doubles down on large-scale tokenization and public-market plans. The company is taking over SFA, a crypto wealth management platform built for RIAs that has grown deposits and assets under management more than 4,500% over the past 12 months, according to their announcement. The business already had 99% of client assets custodied at Anchorage Digital Bank, making the acquisition a consolidation of an existing relationship rather than a new strategic bet. More details about the terms were not disclosed. A meaningful expansion of Anchorage Digital’s wealth management offering: Anchorage Digital has acquired the Securitize for Advisors business unit from @Securitize, expanding our wealth management capabilities with SFA’s platform, vision, and team. pic.twitter.com/q3cQHMpzir — Anchorage Digital (@Anchorage) December 15, 2025 The SFA acquisition comes in a year when Anchorage has stepped up activity around regulated stablecoins, such as USDtb and USDGO, additional asset support, and infrastructure partnerships. The firm recently moved to expand its custody universe by adding support for 25 additional digital assets for institutional clients, while maintaining a valuation above $3 billion from its last round. On the product side, Anchorage is building out stablecoin operations and institutional DeFi access, including work on Genius Act-compliant stablecoins and integrations that enable clients to tap on-chain liquidity in a regulated environment. The firm is also launching Anchorage Digital Ventures, a new venture arm targeting Bitcoin BTC $86 562 24h volatility: 0.6% Market cap: $1.73 T Vol. 24h: $43.12 B DeFi, real-world assets (RWAs), and decentralized identity projects that fit its institutional client base. All of this sits on top of its status as the only crypto-native firm with a federal banking charter and key licenses, including New York’s BitLicense. For Securitize, selling SFA allows management to refocus on its core business of bringing real-world assets on-chain. The company reports more than $4 billion in tokenized assets under management and works with managers including Apollo, BlackRock, Hamilton Lane, and KKR to issue tokenized funds and private credit products. In January, Securitize and Apollo rolled out the ACRED tokenized private credit fund across multiple chains, using Wormhole as an interoperability layer to move assets between networks. Regulatory expansion has become central to Securitize’s strategy. The firm recently secured full regulatory approval to operate a tokenized securities trading and settlement platform in the European Union, positioning it as the only player running licensed tokenization infrastructure in both the US and EU. Securitize now plans to go public via a SPAC deal at a $1.25 billion valuation and has indicated it will tokenize its own equity as part of the process. The Anchorage-SFA combination gives RIAs a more direct, regulated path into digital assets, with one provider covering custody, execution, and front-end tools under a federal banking charter. This move could simplify compliance and operational risk management for advisory firms that have so far relied on fragmented service providers or avoided crypto allocations altogether.

President Donald Trump weighs in on foreign relations during a presser at the White House. President Donald Trump has directed U.S. officials to help to facilitate a "lasting and durable peace" between Ukraine and Russia, with officials touting the "very, very strong" package presented for negotiations in Berlin over the weekend. Fox News Digital participated in a briefing with U.S. officials Monday morning to discuss ongoing discussions in Berlin with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his team, and European security officials. ZELENSKYY VISITS FRONTLINE UKRAINIAN CITY WEEKS AFTER RUSSIA CLAIMED IT TOOK CONTROL U.S. officials met with Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian delegation Sunday for nearly six hours, and spent more than two hours with them Monday.

(Pavlo Bahmut/Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Officials said Trump’s goal is to "stop the Russians from moving west." "President Trump's very focused on reaching a conclusion to this conflict that really stops the Russians from from moving west," one official said. "Under President Bush, Russia moved west. Under President Obama, Russia moved west. Under President Biden, Russia move west. President Trump really wants to see this as an agreement that ends that, for good." Officials also discussed the economic situation for Ukraine, noting that asset manager BlackRock has assembled a team, pro bono, to begin working on the matter, in coordination with the World Bank. "We went extensively through all the different financial borders that Ukraine currently faces," an official said. "What President Trump is trying to do is to save Ukraine as a country and make sure that they then have the ability to be, from a military perspective, security perspective, and then make sure that they can become viable." The official said the Europeans involved in discussions expressed "several times that they see Ukraine as critical for their security," and that they "need Ukraine to be financially viable and strong in order for it to be a good partner."

(Vyacheslav Prokofyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) But the officials said that "security guarantees were the major focus of the discussions." "It was a very specific, palpable conversation around how to deter any further incursions and to punish — or address — any further incursions," an official said. "I think Ukrainians would tell you, as will the Europeans, that this is the most robust set of security protocols they have ever seen." EUROPEAN TALKS RESHAPE UKRAINE’S PEACE PLAN AS ZELENSKYY REFUSES TERRITORIAL CONCESSIONS The official touted the current package as "very, very strong." "Hopefully the Russians are going to look at it and say to themselves, that’s okay, because we have no intention of violating it," the official continued. "But violations are going to be addressed with this security package." The official added: "The Europeans now know that we mean business, and the Ukrainians know it too." The package will ensure "oversight" and "deconfliction," along with "anything that will make the Ukrainian people feel safe." "It’s just that strong," the official said. Officials said that the basis of the agreement is to have "really, really strong Article Five guarantees." Officials said that President Donald Trump has been "very, very clear" that he is "not looking to put pressure on Ukraine." (Al Drago/Reuters) "We believe the Russians, in a final deal, will accept all these things which will allow for a strong and free Ukraine," an official said. "Russia has indicated they would be open to Ukraine joining the E.U., which would be, I think, the biggest expansion of the Euro-free zone since the Berlin Wall — this would be two huge wins for them." Officials said that Trump has been "very, very clear" that he is "not looking to put pressure on Ukraine." "He has done his best to help define these issues and whatever decision they ultimately make on their territorial issues around these other outstanding issues will be up to them," the official said. UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY YET TO READ PEACE PLAN, TRUMP SAYS Meanwhile, the officials touted the conversations with the European community, specifically the Germans, the English, and the French. "I can’t say enough good things about them," one official said. "Everyone has been dug in to end this conflict. Hopefully we are on the path to peace." Another official said this is a "full U.S.-European effort to try to come up with the strongest package possible in order to see if we can go back to Russia with something that can close this out." The official added that President Donald Trump’s focus on the deal has been to ensure "robust security so that this war really ends and that this will not happen again." (Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The official added that Trump’s focus on the deal has been to ensure "robust security so that this war really ends and that this will not happen again" and to reach an agreement to deal with "all of the economic issues for Ukraine so that they have a bright and prosperous future." The official also said Trump hopes that Russia can "get back into the global economy so that they have incentive not to go back to war in the future." The U.S. officials said Monday conversations are ongoing, but touted the "multiple different solutions" they have presented that can "bridge the gap between the parties." CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP "We have moved considerably closer in narrowing the issues between the Ukrainians and the Russians," one official said. "It is a really good faith effort." "Are we prepared to go to Russia if needed? Absolutely. Are we prepared to go to Ukraine if needed? Absolutely," the official said. "We are under instructions to do what it takes to help facilitate, on behalf of President Trump, a lasting and durable peace between Ukraine and the Russian Federation," the official continued.

Title: MSC Emerges as ‘Leading Contender’ to Acquire ZIM, Report Says
URL: https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/logistics/msc-zim-leading-contender-bid-hapag-lloyd-acquisition-takeover-israel-mediterranean-shipping-company-1234794026/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T19:22:43Z
Full Content:
By Glenn Taylor Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) is reportedly in the mix to be the new owner of container shipping competitor ZIM. According to a report from Israeli business publication Calcalist, the world’s largest ocean carrier submitted a bid to ZIM’s board of directors to acquire the fellow shipping company. A previous report from another Israeli publication, Globes, said MSC had expressed interest in an acquisition while indicating that another major carrier, Hapag-Lloyd, had put in its own bid. Hapag-Lloyd has never confirmed the report. The Calcalist called MSC, the “leading contender” for the bid. Last month, ZIM’s board of directors confirmed that it put the company under strategic review after rejecting a prior takeover over from a group co-led by CEO Eli Glickman. The board is currently undergoing a proxy fight, with a minority investor group aiming to replace three board directors. Sourcing Journal reached out to MSC. MSC and ZIM already have a slot-swapping and vessel-sharing partnership, launching their own trans-Pacific cooperation in February. Under that three-year partnership, the carriers share vessels across six weekly services between Asia and the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts, with some stops at select Mexican and Caribbean ports. ZIM also had a prior arrangement with MSC from Asia to the Pacific Northwest. The ZIM North Pacific line stops at Yantian, Shanghai and Qingdao in China, and then South Korea’s Port of Busan, before crossing the Pacific Ocean to reach Canada’s Port of Vancouver. Related Stories Topics EU Scrutinizes MSC's Planned Stake in Barcelona Port Terminal Topics US Navy Taps Palantir to Speed Up Shipbuilding With AI 'Ship OS' ZIM’s shares increased nearly 6 percent in Monday morning trading on the report. MSC has more container-carrying capacity than any other ocean carrier, with its estimated 967 vessels able to transport nearly 7.1 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs), according to container shipping research database Alphaliner. That makes up a 21.3 percent of total market share by TEU. ZIM, on the other hand, carries the 10th most capacity at 704,000 TEUs, a 2.1 percent share of the fleet. Neither of the companies are part of the three major vessel-sharing alliances—the Ocean Alliance, the Premier Alliance and the Gemini Cooperation. A sale of ZIM is likely to have some barriers despite the board’s strategic review. ZIM’s workers’ committee clamored for Israel’s Transportation Minister Miri Regev to block the Hapag-Lloyd sale after the Globes report came out. The employees argue that foreign control could endanger Israel’s supply chain and potential national security in the event of another war. The committee’s main concern is that 98 percent of Israel’s trade goes by sea, with the workers harping that ZIM was the only ocean carrier that stopped at the country’s ports regularly throughout its war with Hamas. Selling to Hapag-Lloyd set off bells and whistles for the committee, given that the state investment wings of the Qatari and Saudi Arabian governments collectively own more than 20 percent of the German shipping company. MSC is privately owned, with the majority of shares held by the Italy-based Aponte family. While the ownership group doesn’t have ties to countries with tenuous relationships with Israel, any potential foreign buyer is still going to generate scrutiny. Israel’s government has a “golden share” in ZIM, which is likely to play a role in any potential transaction to a foreign entity. This mechanism is designed to protect the country’s interests in private companies deemed essential for national security and transportation. The provision gives the government veto powers over potential acquisitions if more than 24 percent of the company is sold. With its golden share, the government requires ZIM to have a majority-Israeli board, an Israeli chairman and a fleet of 11 ships available for state use in emergencies. According to the Calcalist report, ZIM employees are also concerned about potential layoffs should a foreign buyer acquire the company and consider relocating its headquarters abroad. The rumors also come as MSC is seeking to push through a $23 billion proposed acquisition of 43 ports worldwide from Hong Kong-based port operator CK Hutchison. The shipping company is partnering with BlackRock in the deal, but it is still hanging in regulatory limbo due to various contentions from China and Panama. That deal would shift two critical ports on the opposite sides of the Panama Canal under MSC’s ownership, which Panama Canal officials argue could put its operating neutrality at risk due to heavy concentration under one carrier. China has held the deal up under antitrust review, and has held gripes with a U.S. entity having control over the Panama Ports.

BlackRock is ramping up its digital asset strategy with a wave of new hires aimed at expanding its crypto and blockchain-related products globally, amid growing institutional interest in tokenized and onchain assets. In a job posting board, the $10 trillion asset manager said it is hiring for seven digital asset positions, six based in the United States and one in Singapore. The move follows BlackRock's head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, posting about the open roles on LinkedIn last week. One of the positions in the U.S. focuses on expanding BlackRock’s iShares digital asset ETF lineup. The "Vice President/Director, Digital Assets Product Strategist" job listing seeks a candidate to scale existing products, including its crypto ETFs, and help extend them to institutional and wealth management clients. Currently, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has $70 billion in assets under management. The same role also mentions building “next generation products with strong commercial appeal,” pointing to the firm's ambition to go beyond traditional investment wrappers. The Singapore-based role is more expansive. There, BlackRock is looking for a leader to shape its digital asset strategy across Asia, where regulatory clarity and demand from institutional investors are accelerating. The job involves setting commercial targets and identifying “first-mover big bets” in the region that align with global priorities. A multi-year business plan is part of the brief. The hiring push adds to BlackRock’s growing presence in crypto markets. The firm made headlines last year with the launch of its spot bitcoin ETF, which helped drive record flows into crypto investment vehicles. Beyond ETFs, the firm is also expanding its asset tokenization strategy. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has spoken publicly about the potential of tokenized assets to modernize capital markets by increasing transparency and settlement efficiency. Last year, it launched a tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain and has invested in infrastructure providers, such as Securitize, to explore how public blockchains can support regulated financial products. A representative for BlackRock could not be reached for comment. CORRECTION (Dec. 15, 20:48 UTC): Corrects headline and story throughout to clarify details of BlackRock's search for candidates in crypto roles. UPDATE (Dec 15, 20:06 UTC): Adds that BlackRock couldn't be reached for comment. More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security What to know: More For You Most Influential: Carlos Domingo The Securitize CEO ground through the uncool years of tokenization while NFTs, FTX and memecoins soaked up the hype. With billions in tokenized assets, a SPAC listing in the works and BlackRock as a flagship client and backer, Carlos Domingo’s early bet is finally paying off.

Title: JPMorgan launches new crypto fund for wealthy investors — after Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a ‘fraud’ and ‘Ponzi scheme’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/12/15/business/jpmorgan-launches-new-crypto-fund-for-wealthy-investors/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T17:23:08Z
Full Content:
JPMorgan Chase — whose CEO Jamie Dimon once dismissed bitcoin as a “fraud” and likened cryptocurrencies to a “Ponzi scheme” — is diving further into crypto with a money-market fund that’s based on blockchain. The bank’s asset-management division, which handles $4 trillion, will start the Wall Street giant’s first tokenized money-market fund — this one on the Ethereum network — with $100 million of its own money, the Wall Street Journal reported. The fund — called the My OnChain Net Yield Fund, or MONY — will be opened to outside investors on Tuesday, but it’s not aimed at the masses: The minimum investment is $1 million, and individuals need at least $5 million in investments to qualify. Institutions need at least $25 million. A money-market fund is like a safe savings option that invests in short-term debts from governments or companies, earning a bit more interest than a regular bank account. A fund is referred to as “tokenized” when those assets are turned into digital tokens on a blockchain, a giant online record-keeping system that does not need a central bank or company to manage it. Ethereum is one of the main blockchain networks. Investors can buy into the fund through JPMorgan’s online portal and get digital tokens in their crypto wallets, which are like digital storage for online money. They can use cash or USDC, a stablecoin that holds a steady value tied to the US dollar, issued by Circle Internet Group. The fund pays interest and dividends daily, just like traditional ones. This move comes after the Genius Act passed earlier this year, setting rules for stablecoins and sparking more tokenization of stocks, bonds, funds, and real estate. “There is a massive amount of interest from clients around tokenization,” John Donohue, head of global liquidity at JPMorgan Asset Management, told the Journal. “And we expect to be a leader in this space and work with clients to make sure that we have a product lineup that allows them to have the choices that we have in traditional money-market funds on blockchain.” Money-market funds have grown popular, with total assets at about $7.7 trillion now, up from $6.9 trillion at the start of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute. Stablecoins have a market value of over $300 billion, according to data compiled by CoinGecko. Tokenized funds appeal to crypto users because they earn yields while staying fully on the blockchain, avoiding idle cash in stablecoins that do not pay interest. For managers, it reduces costs and speeds up deals. Some funds serve as collateral on crypto exchanges, helping to attract new clients to digital assets. JPMorgan’s move highlights a shift in its approach to digital assets, despite past criticisms from Dimon, its long-serving chief executive.

In January 2023, he called bitcoin “a hyped-up fraud, it’s a pet rock,” and once branded crypto tokens “decentralized Ponzi schemes.” The veteran banker has said blockchain technology itself is real and useful, separate from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Other firms are doing similar things. BlackRock runs the biggest tokenized money fund with over $1.8 billion. In July, Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon teamed up to create tokens for funds from BlackRock, Fidelity, and others. JPMorgan recently tokenized a private-equity fund for rich clients. Companies like Robinhood, Kraken, and Gemini launched tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds for investors outside the U.S. earlier this year. Advertisement

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. JPMorgan is set to offer clients access to a tokenized money market fund as part of Wall Street's latest crypto push. The bank announced that its asset management arm will launch a tokenized money-market fund that will run on the ethereum blockchain. My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY) will be supported by Kinexys Digital Assets, the bank's tokenization platform. MONY will hold short-term debt and issue daily interest payouts in the same way traditional money market funds do. The key difference lies in the fact that its shares will exist on the ethereum blockchain network, and investors can redeem them using either cash or the USDC stablecoin. The new fund, which The Wall Street Journal reported will be offered to wealthy clients and institutions, will have a minimum investment of $1 million. Its launch is the latest crypto move from the bank, which also recently tokenized some private equity investments in October. It's also the latest crypto push from Wall Street broadly. Asset management titans, including Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and BlackRock, have also been offering crypto investments and blockchain solutions for clients. JPMorgan will commit $100 million of its own capital to the fund before officially opening it up to investors on December 16. Despite some skepticism from CEO Jamie Dimon over the years, the bank has made inroads into crypto and has been recently bullish on the price of bitcoin. JPMorgan analysts said recently that bitcoin could buck its latest downtrend and reach $170,000 in 2026. Asset tokenization has been in focus in 2025, with platforms like Robinhood framing it as a means of trading more efficiently or potentially gaining exposure to private investments. The passing of the GENIUS Act, meanwhile, has offered support for stablecoins, a key component for tokenized funds like MONY. Jump to

Title: Trump could announce a new Fed chair before Christmas: Here’s what you need to know about the leading candidates

The White House has run a very public campaign for the nomination of the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been open about how swiftly he would like to see a name chosen and shared with the public, while President Trump has been transparent about the individuals in contention. One motivation for the candor is a bid to shift focus away from current chairman Jerome Powell, who has grated on the Oval Office by refusing to cut rates as fast as Trump might have liked.With this in mind, Bessent in particular has lobbied to announce the Fed nomination sooner rather than later, even saying the announcement could be made before Christmas. With 10 days to go, that now seems unlikely, and the president has indicated the decision will instead be made in early 2026.Even over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported Trump is eyeing two candidates in particular—Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh—for the job. Here’s what you need to know about the top contenders, and what their on-record opinions have been about the running of the Fed. Kevin Hassett has been seen broadly as the frontrunner in this race. As director of the White House National Economic Council (NEC), Hassett claims he speaks with President Trump daily, and his appointment to the NEC suggests that Trump already values his outlook. Hassett knows how to work with politicians, particularly Trump. From 2017 to 2019 he served as chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisors, and then was enlisted by the White House to serve as a senior advisor on the coronavirus pandemic. He has also worked with a roster of Republican politicians, serving as John McCain’s chief economic advisor in 2000, adviser to George W. Bush in 2004, and to Mitt Romney in 2012. The conservative economist has also worked within the Fed before, in the 1990s, though not in decision-making or senior positions, unlike some of his rivals. Hassett’s allegiance to the White House raises questions for investors, who generally prefer central banks that are firmly independent of politics. Like his peers, Hassett has expressed a dovish outlook on rates, which aligns with President Trump’s way of thinking. The economist has also said he would take the views of the Oval Office directly to the Fed, while maintaining that it won’t sway the internal due diligence of the institution. Speaking on Face the Nation yesterday, Hassett said: “I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. “But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be … with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it’s a committee that votes. “And I’d be happy to talk to the president every day … until both of us are dead because it’s so much fun to talk.” Previously, Hassett led polls by a significant margin according to odds site Kalshi. However, in recent days, he has lost some of that steam and now sits at a 50% likelihood. Picking up steam is Kevin Warsh, who now sits at odds of 40% on Kalshi. Warsh has experience that spans the private sector, Capitol Hill, and senior roles within the Federal Reserve. The Stanford alumnus began his professional career at Morgan Stanley in 1995, before leaving in 2002 to serve in the administration of President George W. Bush. Bush then nominated Warsh to the Fed’s Board of Governors in 2006. During this term, the Harvard alumnus served as the Board’s representative to the Group of Twenty (G-20) and as an emissary to the emerging and advanced economies in Asia. Warsh left the Fed in 2011 and since then has served as a board member to UPS and Coupang, as well as acting as economic advisor to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). He is also a partner at Duquesne Family Office, the family office of legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller. Warsh is, like Hassett, dovish—but does not have the perception of being so closely linked with the White House. He made his differences with the Fed clear before his name was touted chairman. Explaining his position in a WSJ op-ed last month, Warsh argued that “AI will be a significant disinflationary force” and that “inflation is a choice, and the Fed’s track record under Chairman Jerome Powell is one of unwise choices. The Fed should re-examine its great mistakes that led to the great inflation. It should abandon the dogma that inflation is caused when the economy grows too much and workers get paid too much.” He added: “The Fed is an institution whose reach has extended far beyond its grasp. Fundamental reform of monetary and regulatory policy would unlock the benefits of AI to all Americans. The economy would be stronger. Living standards would be higher. Inflation would fall further. And the Fed will have contributed to a new golden age.” With the above in mind, Warsh wants to pull the Fed toward the “backseat” role that Treasury Secretary Bessent has recently begun lobbying for. On the sidelines of the IMF earlier this year, Warsh reportedly said: “The central bank should find new comfort in working without applause and without the audience at the edge of its seats.” Chris Waller is a familiar face to markets as he is a current member of the Fed’s board, beginning in December 2020 and ending in 2030. Governor Waller’s name began circulating as a candidate given his departure from consensus voting on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) earlier this year, advocating the more dovish route, which Trump said would be necessary to secure a nomination. Waller has also been optimistic about Trump’s policies, which may impact monetary policy, for example, saying the effect of tariffs has been “small so far.” While Waller is a distinguished academic analysts have questioned whether the White House’s attention to Waller stems largely from his dissent from the wait-and-see stance of the Fed more broadly. Back in July, when Waller and fellow Governor Michelle Bowman (also briefly seen by some as a potential chair) dissented from a decision to hold the base rate, UBS’s Paul Donovan observed: “Fed Chair Powell tried to present the two dissenting views as being rationally based, but investors are bound to suspect that the rationale amounted to little more than an excited jumping up and down and shouting ‘pick me, pick me’ in the general direction of the White House.” Waller currently has Kalshi odds of 6%. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of Global Fixed Income at BlackRock, is an outsider also on the list of candidates. Rieder has had a successful career in the private sector, including a stint at Lehman Brothers between 1987 and 2008, as R3 Capital Partners’ CEO and President, and is now responsible for managing $2.4 trillion at BlackRock. Rieder has gained exposure to public sector bodies, having served as vice chairman of the Borrowing Committee for the U.S. Treasury and as a member of the Fed’s Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets. The exec’s odds aren’t great, sitting at 2%—that’s behind even Scott Bessent, who has repeatedly said he doesn’t want the job, both publicly and to President Trump himself. Of course, investors have been surprised by President Trump before, so the odds must be taken with a pinch of salt. Rieder has been saying what the Oval Office wants to hear, continually advocating for rate cuts this year and arguing the economy is approaching normalcy. Rieder hasn’t been as outspoken in his criticism of the Fed—or its leadership and past decisions—as some of the other candidates vying for the job, but has shared a bullish view on the economy, which coincides with Trump’s calls for cuts. What may have piqued the attention of Fed supporters is that Reider has previously warned analysts against viewing the Fed as a safety net, which purists will appreciate, given the argument that the Fed should focus on its mandate rather than financial markets. Back in 2020, Rieder told the Long View podcast: “I think [the Fed has] been amazingly thoughtful about how they’ve addressed these markets, and being thoughtful and innovative about how they do it. But I don’t believe in the thesis away from Treasuries and mortgages that you just follow the Fed willy-nilly, because the Fed is not trying to move prices in a certain area, certainly not in credit.” He continued: “I hear it all the time, where people say, “You know, I’m buying (for example) investment-grade credit”–which by the way, we’re buying as well but in a slightly different way. But people say, “Gosh, if the Fed is in that, they are going to make sure that market holds up well.” I’m not sure I really believe that … I think there is too much overzealousness that, gosh, I’m going to be okay as long as the Fed is there without doing the credit work. I hear it all the time.”

Title: Dame Dash FULLY Broke … They’re Auctioning Off His ‘Media Empire’!

Damon Dash’s long, painful financial unraveling just hit another brutal chapter. Media Take Out has learned that Dash is set to watch his film catalog go up for auction in New York City on December 30, 2025, as two states line up to grab whatever money they can from his massive bankruptcy case. A federal judge has authorized the U.S. Marshals Service to auction off copyrights tied to Poppington LLC, Damon Dash’s media company. That means films like Honor Up, Too Honorable, and Welcome to Blackrock are officially headed to the chopping block. The order comes after years of legal drama, unpaid judgments, and mounting debt that finally caught up with the Roc-A-Fella cofounder. The auction will start with a minimum bid of $300,000, though the final price could climb depending on interest. One of the most notable titles is Honor Up, which was executive produced by Kanye West and starred Dash himself alongside Cam’ron and Stacy Dash. Once seen as a passion project, the film is now just another asset being liquidated. Dash filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September, listing more than $25 million in liabilities and a jaw dropping $4,350 in assets. His debts include roughly $19 million in unpaid taxes, nearly $400,000 in back child and spousal support, and multiple civil judgments that have followed him for more than a decade. While bankruptcy is usually meant to pause collections, the court ruled that assets already seized by the Marshals were fair game. That cleared the way for the auction to move forward. Both New York and New Jersey are now aggressively trying to collect. New Jersey filed a secured claim for nearly $4 million, backed by a statutory lien on all of Dash’s property and earning over 10 percent interest. New York came in even harder, filing a claim for more than $8.6 million in unpaid income taxes. Both states positioned themselves early so they can get paid first from whatever money the auction brings in. Creditors like filmmaker Josh Webber also hold serious leverage. They can submit a “credit bid,” meaning they could claim the film rights in exchange for the money Dash already owes them. If that happens, other creditors could be left with nothing. Webber already scored big once before. Back in November 2024, Dash lost his one third stake in Roc-A-Fella Records after failing to pay an $823,000 judgment to Webber over the film Dear Frank. That auction ended with a $1 million winning bid from a representative of New York State, which used the purchase to chip away at Dash’s massive tax bill. Once hailed as one of hip hop’s sharpest business minds, Damon Dash is now watching his legacy assets get sold piece by piece to satisfy debts. And with two states and multiple creditors circling, December 30 could mark one of the final dismantlings of what used to be a hip hop empire. Tags ·Dame Dash

The private fund, dubbed My OnChain Net Yield Fund, or “MONY,” will be seeded with $100 million of the bank’s capital before it can be accessed on Tuesday by individuals with at least $5 million in assets or institutions with $25 million or more, the bank said. MONY, which requires an investment of at least $1 million, represents JPMorgan’s continued experimentation with digital assets, following the debut of its Kinexys Digital Assets platform a year ago. JPMorgan said its MONY fund is available on its Morgan Money platform. The bank said investors are able to earn a yield while holding the fund’s associated token on-chain, mirroring the functionality of BlackRock’s “BUIDL” fund. When BlackRock debuted its $1.8 billion fund last March, the Wall Street heavyweight also tapped Ethereum. JPMorgan said that the debut of its MONY fund underscores “the industry’s growing shift toward tokenization of assets on public networks,” noting that money-market funds have historically provided investors with liquidity and stability, in addition to yield. In a statement, John Donohue, head of global liquidity at JPMorgan Asset Management, said that the bank expects other Globally Systemically Important Banks (or G-SIBs) “to follow our lead in providing clients with greater optionality in how they invest in money market funds.” BlackRock’s BUIDL fund is available on eight different networks, including Solana, according to data provider RWA.xyz. The fund’s ability to operate across multiple blockchains is enabled by tokenization specialist Securitize and interoperability protocol Wormhole. Franklin Templeton debuted the first mutual fund on-chain in 2021, which is called the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund. In addition to Ethereum and some layer-2 scaling networks, Franklin Templeton’s fund is available on Avalanche, Stellar, and Aptos. JPMorgan has made a series of announcements with regards to an expanding line on crypto-focused products in recent weeks. Last month, it proposed structured notes tied to Bitcoin’s price, while reportedly debuting a deposit token on Coinbase’s Base. Although the bank’s latest was aimed at Ethereum’s ecosystem, the JPMorgan recent activity suggests a multi-chain approach. For example, the bank recently arranged the issuance of commercial paper on Solana on behalf of institutional crypto firm Galaxy Digital.

Title: Most Influential: Pavel Durov
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/12/15/most-influential-pavel-durov
Time Published: 2025-12-15T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
As CEO of billion-user messaging app Telegram, Pavel Durov may stand as the most pivotal figure in bona fide mass adoption of cryptocurrency for many observers. This feature is a part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2025 list. By embedding the wallet for the TON blockchain into its popular messaging app, Telegram aims to remove some of the most cumbersome elements of interacting with crypto, such as remembering seed phrases and registering on an exchange. In short, Durov wants to make Telegram the biggest mass-market crypto on-ramp, offering digital asset services through an interface that's as simple as sending a message. In 2025, Telegram garnered attention from no less a prospective investor than the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock. Telegram raised $1.7 billion via convertible bonds in a tender offer, which closed in late May, that drew the interest of investors including BlackRock, Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and hedge fund Citadel. Durov is known as a staunch advocate of privacy and free speech, which formed part of his motivation for the creation of Telegram in 2014. However, his reputation sometimes precedes him when it comes to law enforcement agencies. In August of 2024, French authorities confiscated his passport and imposed a travel ban on him following preliminary charges related to complicity in drug trafficking, money laundering and fraud through Telegram. When he recovered his passport in March this year, the TON token jumped 20% on the news. While Durov and Telegram, in general, may remain controversial, according to some observers, 2025 also saw the app demonstrate a determination to crack down on unlawful use of its platform, which would otherwise tarnish it with the brush of crime, fraud, and so on. This year, Telegram shut down illicit crypto-centric marketplaces Xinbi and Haowang, formerly Huione, in partnership with blockchain sleuths Elliptic. The two marketplaces were thought to have processed transactions worth over $40 billion combined on Telegram since 2021.

Title: Number of road deaths so far this year passes total figure for 2024

Full Content:
The number of deaths on Irish roads so far this year has passed the total figure for 2024, according to provisional data from An Garda Síochána. There have been 180 road deaths to date as of Monday, 16 more compared with the same period last year. The fatalities include 70 drivers, 30 motorcyclists, 42 pedestrians, 20 passengers, 14 cyclists, two e-scooter drivers or passengers and a pillion passenger. There were 174 road deaths in 2024, including 72 drivers, 17 motorcyclists, 35 passengers, 33 pedestrians, 12 cyclists and three e-scooter drivers or passengers. There has been a 76 per cent increase to date in the number of motorcyclist deaths compared to last year. Three people died in two road crashes in Co Tipperary over the weekend, while a woman driver, aged in her 70s, also died over recent days after she was hospitalised following a single-car crash in Co Kerry last Wednesday. Susan Gray, founder of the Parc road safety and victim support group, said the annual increase in road deaths was “very worrying”. “We’re into the most dangerous time of the year, the festive period. People are being reminded but still the figures are going up and a lot of them are young people,” she said. “To think that families are preparing for Christmas and may even have presents under the tree, will now be visiting their loved ones at graves. I can’t get that out of my head. It’s just heartbreaking and there is just so much more that could be done by the Government and the Road Safety Authority [RSA].” [ PR campaigns are not enough to stop people dying on our roads. Here is what we need to doOpens in new window ] Ms Gray’s husband Steve died after being knocked down by an unaccompanied learner driver on St Stephen’s Day 2004 in Inishowen, Co Donegal. The RSA said the rise in road fatalities underscores the “urgent need” for continued vigilance and collective action. The State agency said it remains “unwavering” in its commitment and efforts to prevent crashes, improve road safety and promote behaviours and measures that can save lives on roads. Seán Canney, Minister of State at the Department of Transport with responsibility for road transport, said he was “devastated that the numbers are so high this year”. “It is important we take stock of what we’re doing individually on the roads and what we’re doing in terms of providing safety, enforcement. We will renew all our efforts to make the roads safer,” he told The Irish Times. Mr Canney also said he had confidence in the RSA but that there was “more to do” around “messaging to people”. [ Concerning rise in Irish road deaths and lack of impactful responseOpens in new window ] An Garda Síochána is conducting an enforcement operation on the roads throughout the Christmas period, which began on December 1st and will continue until January 5th, 2026. Last week, 147 people were arrested for driving under the influence of either alcohol or drugs, with more than 3,265 drivers detected for speeding offences. A driver was found to be travelling 101km/h in a 50km/h zone on Newtownpark Avenue in Blackrock, south Co Dublin. Another motorist was discovered driving 118km/h in a 60km/h zone in Stranorlar, Co Donegal, with a separate driver travelling 201km/h in a 120km/h region in Kinvara, Co Galway. More than 600 vehicles were seized by gardaí for a range of offences under the Road Traffic Act 1961. About 330 fixed-charge notices were issued for using a mobile phone while driving and 85 fines handed out for failing to wear a seat belt. An Garda Síochána said the Christmas period was one of the busiest on Irish roads and when road users are at the highest risk of being involved in a fatal or serious crash. “Members of An Garda Síochána are out day and night across the country as part of our enforcement campaign and will intercept drivers who are putting their lives and the lives of others at risk,” it said. The Department of Transport said 2025 has been a “very difficult year” on Irish roads. It said road safety remains a “core priority” for the Government, with Budget 2026 providing €1.72 billion for “national, regional and local roads, alongside safety-focused measures”.

Venezuela is swiftly becoming ground zero of President Trump’s America First reshaping of US foreign policy. The United States seized the oil tanker Skipper off the country’s coast Wednesday, capping off months of heightened tensions. The sanctioned vessel has carried crude for Iran and had an estimated 1.1 million barrels on board. On the surface, the pressure’s been over ridding Caracas of illegitimate President Nicolás Maduro. Ditto ending government-sponsored narco-terrorists using Venezuela as a transit hub and safe haven to smuggle Colombian cocaine and other illicit drugs to North America and the Caribbean. But confronting Maduro is far more about Team Trump reasserting US dominance in the Western Hemisphere. Trump’s intended recipients? Beijing, Tehran and Moscow. His message? Hands off. Trump signaled his reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine was coming just days before taking office in January. While the mainstream media obsessed about his comments about Greenland and the Panama Canal, they missed his point. He was warning about China’s short- and long-term intentions to create economic and military strangleholds on the Americas. This includes President Xi Jinping’s designs to dominate the Northern Sea Route by declaring China a “Near-Arctic State” in 2018. Nominally, the declaration was about “developing shipping, carrying out scientific research and exploiting the region’s oil, gas, minerals, fisheries and other resources,” as the Wall Street Journal reported. But it’s really about Beijing boxing the United States out of the Arctic, especially as its sea lanes open up due to polar warming. Hence Trump’s emphasis on the importance of Greenland in defending the NSR and his welcomed October announcement that the Coast Guard is purchasing 11 new icebreakers. Xi is playing the same strategic game in the Panama Canal. Chinese companies control the key Pacific and Atlantic ports of Balboa and Cristóbal. Under the Trump administration’s aegis, a memorandum of understanding was signed in March for US-based BlackRock to acquire the ports. Beijing, however, has delayed the closing, citing national security interests. And at the end of the world in South America, Xi is seeking to acquire port facilities in Punta Arenas, Chile, to dominate the Drake Passage. Team Trump essentially seeks to end any great-power competition in the Americas — particularly China’s efforts to militarily dominate sea passages in the Arctic, Panama Canal Zone and Antarctica. Given the National Security Strategy’s proclamation of the “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, we now know how America intends to check and eventually end Chinese, Russian and Iranian malevolent activities in the Western Hemisphere. It aims to preserve freedom of navigation in the Americas; eject crippling Chinese Belt and Road Initiative investment in Latin America and the Caribbean and replace it with American capital; and marginalize malign actors such as Maduro in Venezuela while rewarding US allies. It’s a heavy lift. Through 2024, cumulative direct Chinese foreign investment in Latin America and the Caribbean stood at $8.53 billion, per Enrique Dussel Peters at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. China’s Development Bank and its Export-Import Bank had lent the regions more than $120 billion as of 2023. Notably, Venezuela tops that list at $59.2 billion. Brazil — a founding member of Beijing-dominated BRICS — is next at $32.4 billion, with Jamaica the largest Caribbean recipient of Chinese bank loans at $1.6 billion. Significantly, Jamaica is a major “hot spot” of trafficking illicit drugs from Venezuela to the United States, Mexico and Canada, per the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Team Trump views confronting Venezuela as the best means of countering growing Chinese influence in the Americas. Caracas is Beijing’s crown jewel in South America. Eighty percent of Venezuelan oil exports “went directly and indirectly to China through little-known intermediaries,” Reuters reports. That’s code for shadow oil fleets. Such as Skipper, the oil tanker seized falsely flying Guyana’s flag. The United States sanctioned the vessel in 2022 for transporting oil for Iran to support Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force. Iran is undeterred and doubling down on defying Trump in Venezuela. Petroleos de Venezuela and the National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company signed a deal to improve fuel output at the Paraguaná Refining Center to end Caracas’ “reliance on US refinery technology,” Reuters reports. Russia lurks in Venezuela as well. President Vladimir Putin — hypocritically, given his complaints of NATO aid to Ukraine in his backyard — has supplied the country with military aid, training and investment since the days of Hugo Chávez in the early 2000s. The two countries signed a 10-year Treaty on Strategic Partnership and Cooperation in October. Putin reaffirmed his support for Maduro in a telephone call Thursday. The Kremlin is not ready to capitulate to Trump in Venezuela. Nor is Maduro, who appears to believe he can outlast Trump despite the largest buildup of US forces in the Caribbean since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and new Trump administration sanctions on him, his family and business cronies. Maduro’s obstinance could cause the standoff with Washington to become kinetic. US military strikes on Venezuelan ports, army bases and airports used in staging and trafficking illicit drugs may be in the making. Trump’s newly enshrined Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine hangs in the balance. It’s unlikely the president will stand down. Maduro is overestimating his position and underestimating Trump’s resolve. María Corina Machado, who escaped Venezuela last week to accept her Nobel Peace Prize, stands at the ready to succeed the corrupt Maduro as president. The question is: When do US demonstrations translate into action? Trump cannot allow Maduro to stand in the way of Washington re-establishing strategic security in the Americas. Venezuela is the necessary first step. Diminishing Beijing, Tehran and Moscow throughout the hemisphere is the worthy goal. Mark Toth writes on national security and foreign policy. Col. (Ret.)

Title: JPMorgan expands blockchain push with tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum

JPMorgan Chase is preparing to deepen its push into blockchain-based finance through a tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum, according to a Wall Street Journal report published on Monday. The bank has not formally announced the product, but the report suggests JPMorgan is moving closer to offering onchain versions of traditional cash-management tools as institutional interest in tokenization grows. The reported initiative comes as large investors look for ways to deploy idle cash more efficiently while maintaining regulatory compliance. With about $4 trillion in assets under management, JPMorgan’s reported plans highlight how tokenization is evolving from experimental pilots into investment products associated with major global balance sheets. The proposed fund would enter a fast-growing segment of digital finance where money-market products are increasingly viewed as a bridge between traditional markets and blockchain infrastructure. The fund, known as My OnChain Net Yield Fund, or MONY, has been seeded with $100 million from JPMorgan’s asset management division, the Wall Street Journal stated. The product is expected to open to external, qualified investors this week, although no official confirmation has been issued by the bank. The minimum investment is set at $1 million, keeping the fund focused on institutional participation rather than retail investors. MONY is designed to operate in line with conventional money-market funds, holding short-term debt instruments and paying interest on a daily basis. Investors would be able to redeem their shares either in cash or through Circle’s USDC stablecoin, reflecting the growing use of regulated stablecoins in institutional settlement and liquidity management. JPMorgan has built the reported fund on Kinexys Digital Assets, its in-house tokenization platform, with Ethereum selected as the underlying blockchain, according to the Wall Street Journal. Tokenized funds record ownership onchain, allowing faster settlement, real-time visibility, and continuous trading beyond standard market hours. These features are attracting attention from asset managers, trading firms, and treasury desks seeking operational efficiency while continuing to rely on low-risk instruments. Tokenized money-market funds are also increasingly used within decentralised finance ecosystems as reserve assets and as collateral for trading and asset management. JPMorgan’s reported plans place it alongside other large financial institutions that have already launched tokenized money-market products. Franklin Templeton introduced its BENJI fund in 2021, becoming one of the earliest traditional asset managers to adopt blockchain-based fund infrastructure. BlackRock followed in 2024 with its BUIDL fund, developed with tokenization specialist Securitize, which has since attracted about $2 billion in assets, according to data from RWA.xyz.
