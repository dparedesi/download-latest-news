Stablecoin firm Circle has applied to create a national trust bank, moving further into the mainstream following its blockbuster IPO last month. 3 01 July 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. The company has formally submitted an application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish the new trust institution, which will operate under the name First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A. If the charter is approved, it would enable Circle to act as a custodian for its own reserves and hold crypto assets, such as tokenized stocks and bonds, on behalf of institutional clients. Currently, Circle's reserves are held in custody at BNY and managed by BlackRock.Circle co-founder, chairman and CEO Jeremy Allaire, states: “By applying for a national trust charter, Circle is taking proactive steps to further strengthen our USDC infrastructure. Further, we will align with emerging US regulation for the issuance and operation of dollar-denominated payment stablecoins, which we believe can enhance the reach and resilience of the US dollar, and support the development of crucial, market neutral infrastructure for the world’s leading institutions to build on.”

Title: Circle Moves To Establish National Trust Bank In US Following $18 Billion IPO

Circle (CRCL), issuer of the market’s second largest stablecoin, USDC, is applying to establish a national trust bank in the United States. This announcement follows Circle’s recent Initital Public Offering (IPO), which valued the company at nearly $18 billion. If approved by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the new entity, named First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., will allow Circle to serve as a custodian for its reserves and manage crypto assets on behalf of institutional clients. Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, emphasized the company’s commitment to trust, transparency, and compliance during an interview with Reuters. He stated, “Becoming a publicly traded company is a significant part of that, and becoming a national trust company is again a continuation of that.” Unlike traditional banks, this new charter will not permit the stablecoin issuer to accept cash deposits or issue loans, marking a distinct approach to banking within the digital asset space. Currently, Circle’s reserves are managed at BNY Mellon and BlackRock, backed by a mix of short-term Treasury bills, cash, and other liquid assets. The proposed national trust bank would primarily focus on custody services for tokenized assets, such as stocks and bonds, rather than traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). This initiative comes at a crucial time as Congress moves closer to enacting a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. The recently passed stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, mandates that stablecoins be backed by liquid assets and requires issuers to disclose their reserve compositions monthly. With the House of Representatives poised to vote on the legislation soon, and US President Donald Trump expected to sign it into law, the regulatory environment for stablecoins is on the verge of significant change. Allaire remarked on the transformative potential of this regulatory shift, stating, “We’re going from the early-adopter phase of this technology into the mainstream.” He expressed optimism that securing approval for the national trust charter would provide a solid foundation for institutions to build upon, further legitimizing the role of stablecoins in the financial ecosystem. Per the report, Wall Street’s initial response to Circle’s growth has been largely positive, with several major brokerages, including Barclays and Bernstein, issuing “buy” ratings and setting price targets above $200 for the company’s stock. However, some analysts have expressed caution regarding the stock’s valuation, which has more than doubled since its market debut. As of press time, CRCL closed Monday’s trading session at $180, representing a nearly 40% drop from its $299 record achieved last week. Allaire concluded by highlighting Circle’s approach in aligning with emerging US regulations. He noted that the establishment of a national digital currency trust bank represents a significant milestone in the quest to create a transparent, efficient, and accessible internet financial system.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs add $2.9B in last week of June ending month strong
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/insights/bitcoin-etfs-add-2-9b-in-last-week-of-june-ending-month-strong/
Time Published: 2025-07-01T10:15:55Z
Full Content:
BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark lead ETF inflows, offsetting the outflows from Grayscale's GBTC. Spot Bitcoin ETFs added $2.92 billion in net inflows between June 23 and June 30, capping off the strongest eight-day streak since mid-May. After slowing inflows in early June, the market appears to have re-engaged with ETFs as geopolitical uncertainty flared again in the Middle East and broader risk appetite improved. The bulk of the inflows came on June 24 and June 25, when issuers saw a combined $1.14 billion enter products led by BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Ark’s ARKB. ARKB saw an unusual $70.2 million on June 25, its second-largest daily inflow in June, suggesting revived institutional positioning after three weeks of weak flows. In the last week of June, Bitcoin moved up from $105,415 on June 23 to a closing high of $108,382 on June 29 before retreating slightly to $107,210 on June 30. The price advance was relatively steady, with low volatility and rising support around $107,000. That stability likely encouraged renewed confidence in ETF allocations, especially following the $1.7 billion weekly inflow reported by CoinShares across global crypto funds. US-based spot ETFs appear to have accounted for most of that figure. June 27 also stood out with a nearly $500 million haul, as BlackRock and Fidelity saw daily inflows above $150 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC continued to leak assets, but outflows were limited to $8 million or less per day compared to the hundreds of millions seen in previous months. The diminishing GBTC bleed further supports the narrative that ETF rebalancing may be reaching maturity, with capital now flowing more directly into low-fee issuers rather than migrating from legacy trusts. According to CoinShares, the inflows also came amid a broader 11-week streak of positive inflows across all digital asset investment products. That broader macro context, relatively calm funding rates, and a subdued derivatives market helped steer attention back to ETFs as the more straightforward proxy for directional bets. The combination of stable prices and strong flows reinforces the growing role of spot ETFs as a barometer of investor sentiment and macro positioning. With June now closed, July begins with ETFs holding over $48.9 billion in assets.

Title: How AI is speeding up the slow investing game
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-speeding-up-fundamental-investing-jpmorgan-alliance-bernstein-blackrock-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-07-01T09:28:01Z

It took an AllianceBernstein healthcare analyst just one afternoon to analyze what would have once taken her months: the potential impact of President Donald Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill" on specific drugs and insurance plans across state lines. Andrew Chin, the firm's chief artificial intelligence officer, said the analyst used one of the $790 billion asset manager's in-house tools to quickly interpret the legislation and identify which companies would be affected, allowing her to make a fast, confident investment call. "Because she was able to do that, she was able to make money for our client portfolios a lot faster," said Chin, adding that the analyst "locked in some of the alpha" in a way that was not previously possible. Fundamental investors take a slow and methodical approach to their investment decisions. Whether reviewing financial statements or talking to vendors and company executives, it can take months for a fundamental investor to reach a conclusion about what to invest in and at what price. Not anymore. Artificial intelligence is changing the slow investing game popularized by investors like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Peter Lynch of Fidelity. While asset managers have long used machine learning to crunch spreadsheets and detect trading signals—especially in quant and systematic strategies— these tools can also quickly digest and analyze vast reams of unstructured information, like earnings call transcripts, regulatory filings, and even emails. It's allowing large asset managers to make fundamental investing decisions faster than ever before. Here are three firms that are using AI to transform their investment processes: Two and a half years ago, JPMorgan Asset Management AI strategist Dillon Edwards sat down with upward of 50 portfolio managers to understand what they needed. He asked them about the screens they use, the questions they ask themselves throughout the day, and the common thread was, "Just get our attention to the right data, at the right time, in the right place." That request led to the creation of Smart Monitor, which Edwards described as "Spotify for the investor." It scans mountains of data to surface timely, relevant insights for the firm's portfolio managers and analysts. Smart Monitor is part of JPMorgan's broader AI build-out for its $3.7 trillion asset management arm, which is hosted on a platform called Spectrum. Another tool within this platform is Moneyball, which helps portfolio managers identify and correct potential biases in their investment decisions by analyzing historical data and market behaviors. Rather than building something new for investors to learn, Edwards and his team focused on AI directly into the process that investors have spent years perfecting. The bottom-up approach has helped to minimize AI skeptics: A handful of "champion" PMs worked closely with engineers during development and became in-house unofficial salespeople who market it to their own teams. "No one wants another tool, another thing to do, something that the AI team somehow thinks is going to be helpful for an investor without empathizing with what they're doing today," he said. Kristian West, JPMorgan Asset Management's head of investment platform, said the firm is also developing similar tools with the goal of seeing if they can continue to scale the quantitative process, or data-driven systematic investing. "That's an area where we think it is just pretty obvious, whereas technology and data capabilities improve, those two worlds collide a lot more," he said. For fundamental investors—portfolio managers and analysts who base long-term decisions on a deep understanding of individual companies—this marks a turning point: a chance to move faster and dig deeper, but also a moment to rethink how they work. Chin calls this evolution the rise of the "iron person": a human investor enhanced by AI armor. Not a replacement, but an upgrade. AB has developed an internal chatbot called AB AI, along with several tools to help pull from internal data, prep for company meetings, or conduct research tailored to the manager's investment philosophy. Chin said that many AB analysts often develop their own AI agents using ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot with specific prompts to, for example, run an analysis on the companies in their sector after an earnings call. "They're able to then analyze companies the way they want to, so they get a more tailored or customized version of what the tool can provide them," he said. Chin said about 75% of the firm's over 500 investment professionals are using their tools. People sharing stories like "it takes me a day rather than a month to do something, or I was able to get this insight that I did not get before," have driven others to try it, said Chin. For the remaining 25% who haven't picked up AI, he believes they "will just naturally come when they see the performance of their counterparts has gotten better." A big reveal from BlackRock's investor day last month shows just how fast the field is moving. The $11 trillion investing behemoth has launched Asimov, an agentic AI platform for its fundamental equity business. Agentic AI doesn't just answer questions following prompts — it can take action on its own. "While everyone else is sleeping at night, we have these virtual AI agents, they're scanning research notes, company filings, emails to generate portfolio insights," the firm's chief operating officer, Robert Goldstein, said. He hopes Asimov will be deployed across the firm by the next investor day, offering investors at the world's biggest asset manager a powerful teammate. Raffaele Savi, its global head of systemic investing, underscored how significantly AI is affecting the investing world. The speed and power of having "real-time, millions of stimulations a day happening in the background, developing situational awareness" that helps ensure the portfolio reflects the manager's intentions are "profound." "The world has changed tremendously," he said. Jump to

Title: Banking Comes Full Circle with First National Digital Currency Bank: Best Crypto to Buy?

Circle, the company behind the $USDC stablecoin announced on June 30 that it has applied for a national trust bank charter. With a blockchain banking revolution on the horizon, which altcoins could be poised to benefit? Circle’s trust banking license aspirations follow its landmark IPO that valued the company at approximately $18B. Circle’s USDC reserves, currently held and managed by BNY Mellon and BlackRock, would now benefit from in-house oversight, increasing credibility with institutional players. Compliance with the license demands that it not cross into deposit-taking or lending. This could be subject to change, of course, as the regulatory environment in the US clarifies. So far, meeting compliance standards has led Circle to prioritize seeking licenses: CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized Circle’s commitment to building ‘an internet financial system that is transparent, efficient, and accessible.’ The timing of the move isn’t just about the IPO; it also aligns well with US regulatory currents, including the GENIUS stablecoin bill now advancing through Congress. That bill mandates clear reserve structures and full transparency to help normalize stablecoin use within legacy financial institutions. TradFi is increasingly exploring blockchain as a remedy to its woes. Aave founder Stani Kulechov highlighted the benefits blockchain brings to TradFi: unmatched global reach, instant access to digital financial products, and a global customer base. Hurdles remain, of course. Fragmented interoperability between tokens and blockchains hampers liquidity and cross-chain transactions. There are proposed solutions, though, such as Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which aims to knit together disparate blockchains as logically as the internet connects different networks. Kulechov envisions a future where DeFi protocols like Aave serve as global financial utilities, unhindered by siloed systems. Reports that a banking consortium including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo is considering issuing its own stablecoin overlook a salient point: TradFi will also have to overcome an increasingly strong first-mover advantage wielded by Circle and others. As Todd Ruoff, CEO of Autonomys, said, ‘the rules were written by crypto natives.’ Circle is covered by licenses in 46 US states, plus by New York BitLicense, along with a $USDC market cap hovering around $61B. That’s a big hurdle for any new TradFi/crypto banks to overcome. While the banks plan their entry into blockchain, these three altcoins are poised to make big gains. The key to First National Digital Assets Bank could rest in your crypto wallet. That’s why you need the toughest crypto wallet around. Best Wallet provides a simple, secure, and straightforward way to store and use crypto. With MPC and biometric security and the ability to create multiple wallets, you can buy, store, and swap crypto securely, all within a single, powerful Web3 wallet. When you load it up with the native $BEST token, you get even more utility from your wallet, including: Select crypto presales are available directly within the Best Wallet app, making researching and purchasing the hottest crypto presales easier than ever. Learn how to buy Best Wallet Token and see why our own price prediction sees $BEST moving from its current $0.025265 to a potential $0.62 by 2026. Visit the presale page to buy or learn more. You want meme coins — the frenetic energy, crazy gains, and potential for wild swings that every degen craves. But you won’t find those on your mainstream CEXs – at least, not very often. Most of the time, the best action comes from low-cap tokens trading underground on sites like Telegram. But how do you find them? That’s where Snorter Bot and the $SNORT token come in. What is Snorter? It’s the best way to hunt down the best Solana meme coins, with all the tools you need to trade with confidence. This includes: And with the $SNORT token you’ll get lower trading fees and better access to new tokens. It’s one of the reasons our $SNORT price prediction sees the token climbing to $0.94 from its current $0.0967, delivering 872% gains by the end of 2026. Learn how to buy Snorter Token and visit the presale page. Donald Trump has gone big on crypto, both in his administration and personally. World Liberty Financial, his official crypto project, is one of his biggest moves. There was a World Liberty Financial presale for its governance token, $WLFI, a few months ago, but the biggest offering from the project so far has been $USD1, a dollar-based stablecoin. There’s no room for big gains with $USD1 itself, but the token could anchor a much more significant crypto ecosystem from a US president who already has a stablecoin and his own meme coin. In the meantime, $WLFI recently attracted a $100M investment from the UAE as international investors see the potential benefits of Trump’s global crypto aspirations. Circle’s trust bank charter application is under regulatory review; approval would mark a significant milestone in bridging the TradFi and blockchain worlds. With Circle’s bank charter bid, regulatory advances, DeFi’s global potential, and the rise of institutional stablecoins, all the elements are emerging for an intertwined financial ecosystem. These three altcoins could be in line to benefit, but always do your own research. This isn’t financial advice. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Bitcoin ETP With DeFi Yield Goes Live in Europe
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/01/bitcoin-etp-with-defi-yield-goes-live-in-europe

A bitcoin BTC$107,874.48 exchange-traded product (ETP) that generates yield from decentralized finance (DeFi) markets has debuted on Tuesday, in what issuer Fineqia calls a first of its kind. The Fineqia Bitcoin Yield ETP (YBTC), listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange, targets a 6% annual yield by deploying investor capital into DeFi strategies. It is issued by Fineqia’s Liechtenstein-based subsidiary and advised by Psalion Yield, a digital asset investment firm focused on blockchain-based yield. Unlike existing crypto yield ETPs that rely on derivatives or structured notes, YBTC maintains one-to-one exposure to bitcoin while generating returns directly from DeFi protocols. “It allows investors to earn more BTC while they hold it, combining long-term conviction with compounding returns, all inside a regulated wrapper,” said Fineqia CEO, Bundeep Singh Rangar. The ETP also supports in-kind transfers, meaning that digital asset holders can contribute BTC directly to the product without the need to first convert into cash incurring a taxable event. YBTC arrives at a time when investor interest in crypto-focused investments is growing. These investment products has brought digital assets closer to traditional investors, allowing them to invest in digital assets in a familiar way through brokerage accounts without the need of crypto wallets and blockchain transactions. Bitcoin exchange-traded products enjoyed rapid growth over the past year and have gobbled up $150 billion of assets, Fineqia said.

Title: The Dollar Just Had Its Worst Start to a Year Since 1973

The US dollar has experienced its steepest decline at the start of a year since the early 1970s, sparking concerns about the nation's financial standing and the global economic order. The downward trend comes amid significant policy changes under President Trump, including aggressive tariffs and an increasingly isolationist approach, which have unsettled international investors and affected confidence in the US economy despite the strong stock market, the New York Times reports. The dollar's drop of more 10% against a basket of major international currencies over the past six months marks its worst first-half performance since 1973, and its worst half-year since the second half of 1991. The US dollar has experienced its steepest decline at the start of a year since the early 1970s, sparking concerns about the nation's financial standing and the global economic order. The downward trend comes amid significant policy changes under President Trump, including aggressive tariffs and an increasingly isolationist approach, which have unsettled international investors and affected confidence in the US economy despite the strong stock market, the New York Times reports. The dollar's drop of more 10% against a basket of major international currencies over the past six months marks its worst first-half performance since 1973, and its worst half-year since the second half of 1991. The weakening dollar makes overseas travel more expensive for Americans and discourages foreign investment in the US, while potentially benefiting exporters by making US goods cheaper abroad—though these effects are complicated by ongoing trade tensions, the Times notes. "Trump's tariffs, the fact that many investors view his administration as somewhat chaotic, along with concerns over US national debt have seen the dollar fall out of favor," Trade Nation market analyst David Morrison tells the Guardian. The dollar surged after Trump was re-elected but it peaked just before he took office and started to slide as hopes of a fully pro-business administration faded, the Times reports. Because the decline started when the dollar was at a relatively high level, it isn't especially weak by historical standards, but analysts say the "Big Beautiful Bill," which will add trillions to the deficit over the next decade, is likely to weaken it further. "Full-scale de-dollarization, if it ever comes, is still a long way away," according to Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. "But there is one dynamic playing out that could significantly raise that risk: increasing government debt."

Dear friends, Welcome to the “Midsommar in Scandinavia” issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. Chip and I are enjoying a long-planned holiday in Sweden and Norway. We’re equally delighted that you’re here … and we’re there! Among other things (how would I know for sure? I’m in Gamla Stan), Lynn Bolin addresses the emerging threat of tariff-induced inflation with “Protecting Against Tariff Induced Inflation,” analyzing how widespread tariffs will likely be passed through to consumers and drive inflation to an estimated 3.4% peak next quarter. Drawing on five years of post-pandemic bond performance data, he demonstrates that shorter-duration and inflation-protected securities have significantly outperformed traditional intermediate-term bonds, leading him to rotate into funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index (VTAPX), Fidelity Inflation-Protected Bond Index Fund (FIPDX), and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset Fund (PZRMX). Bolin has reduced his stock allocation from 65% to 50% and now maintains approximately 7% of his bond allocation in inflation-protected securities, with another 40% in shorter-duration bonds, while also incorporating target-maturity TIPS ETFs like iShares iBonds Oct 2030 Term Tips ETF (IBIG) into his bond ladders. America’s premier Asian investment boutique, Matthews Asia, has fallen on hard times. Former CEO and portfolio manager Mark Headley has returned from retirement, intent on fixing that. Our hour-long interview is summarized in “Good Bones There.” Without any doubt, the most successful small-cap value fund in existence is Scott Barbee’s Aegis Value Fund. We last shared a full profile of the fund in 2013, but it has appeared in eight data-driven articles since then. We decided it was high time to catch up with Mr. Barbee and correct our oversight in a profile of Aegis Value Fund (AVALX). Three years ago, in the midst of a market meltdown (do you even recall the ’22 crash now), we offered advice on how to cope with a … ummm “spanked portfolio.” The whimsical accompanying graphic generated a surprising amount of site traffic. This month, we offer a three-year retrospective on our 2022 advice: keep calm and consider small-value funds with high-quality portfolios. The performance numbers seem promising. We also share a Launch Alert for Stewart Investors Worldwide Leaders Fund, the US launch of a successful non-US strategy focusing on a concentrated portfolio of high-quality, sustainable businesses. The launch was seeded by a US foundation, so the initial share class is institution with retail in the pipeline! Hedge funds are shifting to Asia. Goldman Sachs reports that hedge fund trading in Asian markets have a five-year high in June. “Hedge funds bought equities in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India last week, but were short selling onshore Chinese stocks,” Goldman said. Family offices are shifting to infrastructure and private debt. A BlackRock survey of 175 family offices, the investment manager for ultra-wealthy families, reports that one-third were planning to increase exposure to private debt this year and 30% were planning to commit more resources to infrastructure investments. Almost every smart beta (e.g., low volatility or fundamental valuation) strategy has failed to produce, according to new research from Research Affiliates (free registration required). The short version: RA has been tracking the performance of a series of factor-based portfolios since 2018, looking to see whether any provided the promised excess return. They did not. In every case, just investing in “the market” was a better bet. The good news: “the market” – defined by its large / growth / momentum subset, is now so egregiously overpriced that almost everything outside of that niche is dramatically underpriced. Source: Research Affiliates, 06/2025 The way to read that chart is to start by finding the little green diamonds. Those are the more-or-less current valuations of each strategy relative to its historic valuations. Green diamonds below the colored bar, which illustrates the historic range from 10th percentile to 90th, signals that the strategy is now cheaper than it has been 90% or 95% of the time. RA concludes that’s good news since valuation matters: … we believe there may be hope for all smart beta strategies. If markets receive a wake-up call and valuations revert, a multitude of systematic factor-based equity strategies could all have a field day. After eight years of going horribly wrong, smart beta investing may now go horribly right. AI is a lot dumber than we thought. A series of research reports, most recently from Apple, argue that while AI can execute certain tasks exceptionally well, reasoning is not among them. The researchers found that in simple reasoning tasks, including the Towers of Hanoi challenge, AIs underperform 7-year-olds. Their central argument is that even the most advanced LLMs do not think in any way that resembles us. Their conclusion is that AI “thinking” is not just different, it’s horrible. (Gary Marcus, “A Knockout Blow for LLMs? LLM ‘reasoning’ is so cooked, they turned my name into a verb,” Communications of the ACM, 6/16/2025). Source: Amazon.com As the complexity of demands rises, moving AI beyond its comfort zone, so does the frequency of hallucinations. One estimate is that 79% of responses from some of the newer AI contain hallucinated content (“A.I. Is Getting More Powerful, but Its Hallucinations Are Getting Worse,” New York Times, 5/6/2025, subscription required). A coda to that argument: ChatGPT just lost a chess match to an Atari 2600. If you’re, oh, under 50, you can be forgiven for the question “WTF is an Atari?” because the 2600 is a home video game console released in 1977. ChatGPT actually volunteered to play the old game system. Oops. One report of the match contained this summary: In fact, the Atari wiped the floor with ChatGPT when it came to chess. I don’t mean the near-half-century-old game console won. I mean that ChatGPT made blunders that would embarrass the greenest of beginners. On the upside, perhaps it thinks it won? “So I said ‘here, hold ma beer an’ gimme a knight an’ I kicked its little Atari keester all the way to …’”. AI is dirtier than we thought. Not “smutty dirt” (though that’s nice, too) but “energy- and water-gulping dirty.” MIT researchers found two troubling trends: AI data centers use more power and more power derived from fossil fuels than “normal” data centers: … more than half of the electricity going to data centers will be used for AI. At that point, AI alone could consume as much electricity annually as 22% of all US households. Meanwhile, data centers are expected to continue trending toward using dirtier, more carbon-intensive forms of energy (like gas) to fill immediate needs, leaving clouds of emissions in their wake. (“We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard,” MIT Technology Review, 6/2025) Part of the challenge is that AI companies seem desperately concerned with obscuring the magnitude of their energy and water use, which some suspect sounds like a guilty conscience at work. AI users are stupider than we thought. Folks have casually and constantly observed the tendency of people to be lazy, turning to AI to do their work and thoughtlessly passing it along as their own. The underlying phenomenon is called “cognitive offloading.” It’s driven by two biological imperatives: humans have a limited supply of energy each day and thinking requires a lot of energy. Our survival response is to think as little as necessary to get through the day. The polite term for us is “cognitive misers.” We rely on tricks, shortcuts, and habits – none of which require much energy – to muddle through. But we also offload tasks – we delegate – whenever possible. As a quick test, how many telephone numbers can you recite off the top of your head? (No, 9-1-1 doesn’t count.) When I was young, the answer was probably “dozens.” Today, it’s probably two or three (my own, Chip’s, and my son’s). I count on my phone to keep track of the rest. That’s cognitive offloading. A second set of MIT researchers, the Brain on Large Language Models team, has been doing fairly rigorous research on how our brains respond to the availability of AI/LLMs as an offloading option. (Spoiler alert: not well.) Most recently, they gave three groups of students the same task. One group had access to ChatGPT, one had access to Google, and the other had to think for themselves. (Yikes.) The study ran over four months and included both brain activity monitors and direct observation. Their findings: Brain connectivity systematically scaled down with the amount of external support: the Brain‑only group exhibited the strongest, widest‑ranging networks, Search Engine group showed intermediate engagement, and LLM assistance elicited the weakest overall coupling … The reported ownership of LLM group’s essays in the interviews was low. The Search Engine group had strong ownership, but lesser than the Brain-only group. The LLM group also fell behind in their ability to quote from the essays they wrote just minutes prior. (Your Brain on ChatGPT, 6/2025) The short version: the brains of Chat-dependent students literally powered down and while the students nominally completed the work themselves, they had little belief in their own written conclusions and couldn’t quite remember what they’d just said. Rather as we can’t quite remember our sibling’s phone number five minutes after we called them. The White House apparently has an opening for a new Best Billionaire Friend (BBF) after a spectacular fallout between Mr. Trump and the previous holder of the position, Mr. Musk. Mr. Musk, who invested heavily in Mr. Trump’s election campaign, left government service, such as it was, denounced Mr. Trump’s signature legislative package as “a disgusting abomination” and endorsed a call for Mr. Trump’s impeachment. He nonetheless affirmed his “love for the guy.” Two of Mr. Musk’s associates attribute the fallout to Mr. Trump’s failure to give Musk and Tesla favorable treatment under the bill. “Elon was butthurt,” according to one source. Musk threatened to decommission his fleet of Dragon spacecraft. Trump threatened to “terminate Elon’s Government Subsidies and Contracts” and to investigate his business practices. Musk caved. We’ve written a fair amount about the history and enduring psychology of these alliances (“If you’re so rich, why aren’t you smart?” LinkedIn, 4/2025). Two things to remember: Fortunately, the BBF position is likely to be swiftly filled. UBS reports (6/2025) that there are now 31 people with wealth in excess of $50 billion dollars.

Title: Crypto Inflows Hit $2.7B in One Week, What Are Institutions Buying?

Time Published: 2025-07-01T03:00:52Z

Crypto asset investment products saw continued momentum last week, with $2.7 billion in net inflows reported across major funds. According to data from CoinShares, this marks the 11th consecutive week of inflows, bringing the year-to-date total to $16.9 billion. The sustained interest has been led by institutional players such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, ProShares, and 21Shares, all of which have seen growing demand for their crypto-related products. The majority of last week’s inflows originated from the United States, which accounted for $2.65 billion of the global total. Minor contributions also came from Switzerland and Germany, at $23 million and $19.8 million respectively. Meanwhile, other regions, including Canada, Hong Kong, and Brazil, saw modest outflows. Notably, Hong Kong registered total outflows of $132 million for the month of June, despite having previously recorded strong inflow activity during regional price rallies. Bitcoin remained the primary recipient of institutional interest, attracting $2.2 billion, or roughly 83% of the week’s inflows. Short-Bitcoin products, however, experienced $2.9 million in outflows, bringing total year-to-date outflows for bearish bets on BTC to $12 million. This inverse movement highlights a broader market leaning towards long exposure, reflecting positive sentiment around Bitcoin’s current price structure and potential future performance. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noted that the mid-year performance closely tracks that of 2024, which ended June with inflows totaling $18.3 billion. Butterfill attributed the ongoing trend to a combination of macroeconomic factors, including geopolitical instability and shifting expectations around central bank policies. He emphasized that uncertainty surrounding interest rate cuts and broader economic signals has likely driven investors to consider digital assets as part of a diversified strategy. Ethereum also recorded meaningful inflows last week, with $429 million added to institutional products tied to the asset. Year-to-date, Ethereum-focused funds have now accumulated $2.9 billion in net inflows, positioning it as the second-most favored digital asset among institutional investors. The rise in ETH inflows comes amid continued growing activity in Layer 2 networks, which have contributed to the platform’s expanding utility. Solana, by contrast, continues to lag in investor interest, with only $91 million in inflows reported for the year so far. While Solana has gained traction in areas such as DeFi and NFT issuance, it appears to be attracting more speculative capital rather than large-scale institutional flows at this stage. The disparity between Ethereum and Solana suggests that investor confidence is still largely tied to the more established networks when allocating capital to altcoins.

In this edition of Inside RAI, Center for Revitalizing American Institutions Director Brandice Canes-Wrone outlines the continued decline in public trust in higher education and how it threatens universities. She also has produced new research highlighting how political campaign donors versus the voting public view Supreme Court appointments. RAI also sponsored several conferences, entertaining the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and social media applications in shaping democratic practice at home and abroad. Elsewhere, Andrew B. Hall applies the 19th-century concept of “liquid democracy” to modern times, and David L. Leal explores whether the Latino vote will continue to shift rightward during the second administration of President Donald Trump. Threats to Universities and What We Can Do At Princeton’s James Madison Center for Ideals and Institutions, RAI Director Brandice Canes-Wrone spoke about the attacks on the independence of American universities, in the context of the declining levels of trust they hold with the public. How can universities improve the public’s confidence in them and retain their independence? If universities fail, there’s a lot that America stands to lose. Eight of the ten universities with the largest number of Nobel laureates are in the United States. A tremendous amount of innovation emerges from the research performed at US universities. Canes-Wrone reminds us of what universities contribute to society and describes what universities can do to reverse the trend of public distrust. Watch the video here. Mass Versus Donor Attitudes on the Importance of Supreme Court Nominations In the American Political Science Review, Brandice Canes-Wrone and coauthors Jonathan P. Kastellec and Nicolas Studen report on their survey of 7,000 political donors and a sample of the general public, in which they asked members of each constituency how they prioritize Supreme Court justice nominations. They find donors “substantially more likely “than what they call their “general public co-partisans” to prioritize Supreme Court nominations. “Our unique survey data on donors shows that these differences are quite sizable; on average, donors from either [major] party are about 20 percentage points more likely to cite judicial appointments as a top-three priority compared to general population partisans,” Canes-Wrone and her coauthors write.

Scholars Meet at Hoover to Discuss Possibility of Ideologically Neutral AI in a Polarized World Recognizing the rising power of artificial intelligence to shape the public’s opinions and influence how information is created and consumed, scholars gathered at the Hoover Institution on March 21 to discuss ways to create generative AI models all Americans can trust in an increasingly polarized era. Convened by Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Andrew B. Hall, he said the meeting was meant to determine how the AI models and agents of the future would “reflect our values and earn our trust, given concerns that companies and governments might accidentally or intentionally engineer them to adopt some beliefs and preferences over others.” Sponsored by RAI, the conference is one of many efforts underway to push back on the root causes of declining public trust in institutions and the growing distance between the far points on America’s political spectrum. It brought together scholars on AI, free speech, and computer science, along with representatives from social media and AI firms themselves. Research presented during the day suggested developing ideologically neutral large language models will be a difficult task. Read more here. Building on the conference, a new paper from Hall and Hoover Institution fellows Justin Grimmer and Sean Westwood finds that most Americans perceive major large language models (LLMs) as biased and that small changes in how the LLMs are instructed could measurably reduce this sentiment. Exploring Liquid Democracy for the 21st Century On the latest episode of Policy Stories, Hall speaks of resurrecting a 19th-century concept known as liquid democracy and applying it to help make decisions in the 21st century. In liquid democracy, voters retain the option to vote for themselves, but those who feel insufficiently informed can give their vote to someone else to cast on their behalf. It's a hybrid between representative democracy and direct democracy. And digital technology makes it feasible to build this option at scale for the first time. Today, a variety of organizations are actively experimenting with different ways to delegate decision-making power to others. Major investment firms like BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard now allow shareholders to delegate their votes through voting-choice programs using blockchain. Hall is exploring whether systems that delegate decision-making power to randomly sampled citizen assemblies could provide guidance on what AI chatbots should and shouldn't say or what they can and cannot do. The real-world applications for liquid democracy are promising. In California, for example, ballot initiatives, which are chances for voters to make decisions together outside the legislative process, can be so numerous that it's difficult to be informed on each one. Delegating the call to better-informed citizens could be beneficial. Watch the episode here. Hoover’s RAI Asks How Social Media and AI Can Encourage Democratic Practice Some public commentators fear that social media and generative AI drive polarization and misinformation online, while others hope that they might counter polarization and help to restore public trust, according to scholars at a gathering at the Hoover Institution. The Social Media and Democratic Practice conference on March 17, 2025, sought to see how social media platforms and AI both positively and negatively impact public discourse and democracy. Earlier studies of legacy platforms like Facebook, Twitter (now X), and YouTube found little evidence of harmful effects produced by explicitly political content on social media. At the time, filter bubbles were largely nonexistent, and misinformation and disinformation had little or no discernible effect. The prevailing theory was simply that most people paid little attention to politics on social media and thus were immune to potential effects. In recent years, however, new platforms have proliferated. While not explicitly political, many of these might have important indirect political effects, such as the 2024 Joe Rogan podcast of a conversation with Donald Trump that has reportedly been streamed more than 50 million times. In addition, seemingly nonpolitical content on legacy social media (such as posts reflecting vaccine skepticism) can have political implications. Scant research has examined these new dimensions of the social media universe as yet. Senior Fellow Morris P. Fiorina, who organized the event, said the gathering was aimed at encouraging research about the ways new developments in social media and other online applications help and hinder democratic engagement and practice. “Today is a first step in measuring impact and reach of political content on social media, something academics have not paid enough attention to in recent years,” Fiorina said.

He is also a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin. He spoke with Chris Herhalt about how the Latino vote is moving to the right, and the misconceptions both major political parties hold about Hispanic voters. Chris Herhalt: Can you explain what you call the Latino assimilation paradox? David L. Leal: I created this term as a way to explain some of the big-picture dynamics involving the Latino vote, particularly the rumors, misunderstandings, and wishful thinking that have circulated within both Democratic and Republican circles. For many years, the common view of how demographic change would shape politics was the theory of “demography as destiny.” This predicted that as the Latino population grew and the American population more generally diversified, the Democratic Party would be the inevitable beneficiary. All it had to do was sit back and wait for an unstoppable demographic dividend at the ballot box. The flip side was that Republicans would eventually be reduced to permanent minority party status. The logic was that as California went, so would go the nation. This belief was shared by Democrats and Republicans, although it gave confidence—some would say complacency—to the former but heartburn to the latter. There have been good reasons to doubt this rather oversimplified view of how population change would shape politics. And by the Trump era, real-life electoral results and polling data were showing that Latinos—and also many immigrants and other minority groups—were starting to move toward the Republican Party in a slow but sure way. This was contrary to almost everything that activists, academics, journalists, pollsters, politicians, and pundits, Republicans included, were expecting. Many are now trying to understand why Latinos are moving toward the GOP. My answer is that this is just the latest chapter in the great American assimilation story. We do not have time here to review the scholarship, but to take one example, the 2005 book Italians Then, Mexicans Now studied socioeconomic progress among second-generation immigrants in two different historical eras, and the title says it all. Assimilation is complex, of course, but it was real and consequential then, and it is real and consequential now. Politically, across the last century, we find that new waves of immigrant groups often begin as strong Democrats, but over time, they slowly but surely move toward the Republican Party. This was true broadly for all of the White Catholic ethnic groups of the late 19th and early 20th centuries: Italian-Americans, Polish-Americans, Irish-Americans, and others. The White Catholic vote is today majority Republican, but when John F. Kennedy ran in 1960, it would have seemed self-evident that Catholics would overwhelmingly and indefinitely vote Democratic. But assimilation did its work, despite long-standing populist rumors to the contrary. Today, although the evidence for assimilation remains strong, both parties have denied, doubted, and disparaged its effects, although for very different reasons, and this is where we find the paradoxes—one for each party. Read more here. Renewing America’s Civics Education A story in the Stanford Report highlights the Stanford Civics Initiative (SCI), a joint endeavor between the School of Humanities and Sciences and the Hoover Institution that launched in the fall of 2020 and is led by RAI participant and Senior Fellow Josiah Ober. “The goal of civic education in a democracy is learning how to live in a world in which there are people who are very different from yourself,” said Ober. “A core part of teaching citizenship is showing students how to gain an understanding of where other people are coming from and figuring out a way to engage together to make policy and create civic bargains—the compromise and negotiation integral to democracy.” SCI provides Stanford students with advanced courses on democratic citizenship and is about to launch a senior honors program. The initiative builds on a long-standing tradition at Stanford of studying, in the words of the university’s founding grant, “the blessings of liberty regulated by law.” Read more here. Upcoming Events: More Than Red Vs. Blue: Stories, Struggles, and Strengths in Rural America Rural America is often reduced to a political talking point — red states, blue states, culture wars.

Title: Sen. Mike Lee removes public lands provision from Trump's "big, beautiful bill"
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sen-mike-lee-removes-public-lands-provision-from-trumps-big-beautiful-bill/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T21:03:50Z
Full Content:
Watch CBS News June 30, 2025 / 5:03 PM EDT / CBS/AP Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah announced over the weekend he was removing a provision from the Senate's "big, beautiful bill" that would allow the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands for affordable housing and infrastructure. "Because of the strict constraints of the budget reconciliation process, I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families—not to China, not to BlackRock, and not to any foreign interests," Lee said in a statement announcing the withdrawal of the provision. After the Senate parliamentarian ruled that Lee's original proposal, which encompassed millions of acres, would violate budget reconciliation rules, he had reduced the acreage. The bill, which contains President Trump's tax cuts, border and defense initiatives, is being considered under the special rules because it requires only a simple majority to pass, rather than the 60-vote super majority that is required for consideration of most legislation in the Senate. Under Lee's plan, land in 11 Western states from Alaska to New Mexico would have been eligible for sale. Montana was carved out of the proposal after its lawmakers objected. In states like Utah and Nevada, the government controls the vast majority of lands, protecting them from potential exploitation but hindering growth. Lee's revised plan would have excluded all U.S. Forest Service land from possible sale. Sales of sites controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management were to be significantly reduced, Lee said, so that only land within 5 miles of population centers could be sold. But in addition to opposition from Democrats, Republican senators in Idaho and Montana objected to the plan, too. Several House Republicans also said that if the provision were included in the Senate bill, they would vote against it when the bill received a vote in the lower chamber, threatening its passage. Lee said in his statement that he still believes the federal government "owns far too much land—land it is mismanaging and in many cases ruining for the next generation" and he complained that under Democratic presidents, "massive swaths of the West are being locked away from the people who live there, with no meaningful recourse." The House originally had a public land sales provision, too, one which would have allowed sales of acreage in Utah and Nevada. But GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, who served as interior secretary during President Trump's first administration, opposed the idea immediately. "I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands," Zinke said in a statement in May. "Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn't creating more land." Several other Western state Republican House members also rejected the idea, so the provision was stripped out of the budget bill before the House voted on it. Housing advocates have cautioned that federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing. Some of the parcels up for sale in Utah and Nevada under the House proposal were many miles from developed areas. New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, said before Lee withdrew his plan that it would exclude Americans from places where they fish, hunt and camp. "I don't think it's clear that we would even get substantial housing as a result of this," Heinrich said earlier this month. "What I know would happen is people would lose access to places they know and care about and that drive our Western economies." © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Private Lenders Pitch Restructuring for Stressed Pallet Company
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/private-lenders-pitch-restructuring-for-stressed-pallet-company-11751317379486.html

(Bloomberg) -- Private lenders have proposed a potential debt restructuring for 48Forty Solutions, less than a year after Summit Partners acquired a majority stake in the pallet management company, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The company’s debt includes around $1.75 billion of private credit, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The lenders, which include Antares Capital, KKR & Co. and BlackRock Inc. provided the financing in a recapitalization deal in October, the people said. Representatives for Antares, KKR and BlackRock declined to comment, while representatives for 48Forty and Summit didn’t respond to requests for comment. The $1.7 trillion private credit industry has started to see more signs of stress, as companies grapple with persistently high interest rates and a weakening consumer. Investors are eyeing how the asset class would handle a potential downturn, as the market has not yet been tested by one after growing rapidly in recent years. FS KKR Capital Corp., a business development company jointly managed by KKR and FS Investments, marked down the value of the 48Forty loan to 76 cents on the dollar in the first quarter, according to a May regulatory filing. On a call discussing first-quarter earnings, Daniel Pietrzak, the chief investment officer of the BDC, said 48Forty had been affected by “labor costs and excess inventory.” 48Forty has also suffered from a pullback in consumer spending, the people said. 48Forty provides recycled wood pallets and pallet management services across the US and Canada. As of March 31, the company was paying the majority of the interest on its debt, priced at 6 percentage points over the base rate, in kind, according to regulatory filings. Payment-in-kind deals allow borrowers to defer making cash interest payments typically until maturity. The October recapitalization deal also saw Summit Partners, which first invested in the company in 2022, take a majority stake in 48Forty. If the restructuring happens, 48Forty would join a growing list of companies that have restructured their private credit loans over the past year, with others including Alacrity Solutions, Zips Car Wash and Pluralsight Inc. The default rate for US private credit ticked up slightly in May to reach 4.6%, according to a Fitch Ratings report. Fitch cited “weakening North American corporate credit environment and ongoing macroeconomic challenges such as higher interest rates and slowing growth” as a cause of the increase.

Title: Circle applies for national trust bank license to expand USDC reserve custody

Share this article The company’s move follows its June 5 IPO, which gave Circle an initial market cap of around $6 billion. With its stock now trading at $181, the company is currently valued at approximately $44 billion. The proposed entity, First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., would enable Circle to directly custody USDC reserves and provide digital asset custody services to institutional clients, though it would not handle cash deposits or lending. “Establishing a national digital currency trust bank of this kind marks a significant milestone in our goal to build an internet financial system that is transparent, efficient and accessible,” Circle Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO Jeremy Allaire said in a press release. BlackRock and BNY Mellon currently manage and custody Circle’s USDC reserves. While the new trust bank would take over reserve management, Circle intends to maintain relationships with major banks for portions of its holdings. Allaire indicated the bank would concentrate on tokenized stocks and bonds rather than digital assets like Bitcoin or Ether. The expansion comes as lawmakers advance legislation regulating stablecoins. The bill, which passed the Senate and is expected to clear the House this summer, would require stablecoins to maintain liquid asset backing and provide monthly reserve disclosures. President Trump is anticipated to sign the measure into law. Several brokerages initiated coverage of Circle stock this week, with Barclays, Bernstein, and Canaccord issuing bullish ratings and price targets above $200. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs expressed concerns about the company’s valuation following its post-IPO stock price doubling. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Business FILE PHOTO: Circle logo is seen in this illustration taken March 31, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Stablecoin firm Circle is applying to create a national trust bank in the U.S., a major move after its blockbuster IPO valued the company at nearly $18 billion earlier this month. If the charter is granted by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, it would enable Circle to act as a custodian for its own reserves and hold crypto assets on behalf of institutional clients. Unlike traditional banks, the license would not allow Circle to take cash deposits or make loans. "Circle has long sought to seek the highest standards of trust, transparency, governance, compliance," CEO Jeremy Allaire told Reuters in an interview. "Becoming a publicly traded company is a significant part of that, becoming a national trust company is again a continuation of that."

Digital assets should be among the go-to assets in an investor's portfolio, alongside stocks and bonds, he said on CNBC’s Crypto World, reiterating his comments from earlier this month at a Texas conference for wealth management professionals. At one point, Edelman, who co-founded Edelman Financial Engines, a $293 billion asset manager, advocated for a “low single digits” allocations to crypto, but he’s been swayed recently by “dramatically improved regulatory clarity and institutional engagement in crypto.” For conservative portfolios, Edelman recommended that at least 10% of assets be allocated to crypto, with a 25% allocation for moderate portfolios, and 40% for aggressive investors. Edelman, who is also founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, a trade group, cited advancements in technology leading to longer human lives as part of this basis for his recommendation, saying the average investor that’s alive today will live to be 100 years or older, requiring “portfolios to last far longer than most investors anticipate.” In addition, Edelman said that the “continued growth of blockchain technology will propel its levels five or 10 times its current size by 2030.” Whether an investor should only invest in Bitcoin, as opposed to other digital assets as well, should be between them and their advisor, Edelman told Decrypt on Monday. There could be other ways to get exposure to the digital assets industry, too, he added, pointing to stablecoin issuers, custodians, chipmakers, and exchanges. “There is now a very healthy and diverse infrastructure that represents blockchain and digital assets, and some argue that only owning Bitcoin deprives you of engagement in that broader community,” he said. As cryptocurrencies see continued adoption on Wall Street through products like exchange-traded funds, Edelman believes that Bitcoin will be worth $19 trillion by 2030. Today, the leading cryptocurrency is worth $2.1 trillion, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. With U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration reversing Biden-era restrictions on banks’ ability to offer services related to digital assets, the stage has been set “for massive engagement by the banking community,” Edelman added. Although most financial advisors increase investors’ allocation to bonds as they age, Edelman said that professionals should allocate no more than 30% of funds to U.S. debt. In some cases, it makes sense to allocate 100% of a portfolio to stocks and crypto, he said. Even a 90-year-old investor should have some exposure to digital assets, Edelman told Decrypt, saying their decision boils down to risk tolerance, as opposed to their age. The rationale, he said, could be that they’re investing with future generations in mind. “If you're in your 90s, you know that you're not going to spend all of your money. You're going to leave it to your children and grandchildren,” he said. “That means the money is not really yours. You're merely the steward of that money for the benefit of your heirs.” It was reasonable to wonder whether crypto would survive the regulatory headwinds that it faced not long ago, or whether the tech would be adopted by banks, Edelman noted. However, those questions have been settled, setting crypto up for a long-term future, he said. On Monday, Edelman’s recommendation turned heads within the cryptosphere. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on X, formerly Twitter, that Edelman’s remarks could be “the most important full throated endorsement of crypto from [the] TradFi world since Larry Fink.” The BlackRock CEO emerged as a Bitcoin backer last year after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. but touted tokenization’s prospects in 2022. More recently, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, has put his long-run skepticism aside. In May, he said that the bank’s customers would soon allow clients to purchase Bitcoin.

Title: GoFundMe is refurbishing a little-known financial tool in a bid to supercharge everyday giving
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/06/30/gofundme-giving-funds/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T17:30:55Z
Full Content:
By JAMES POLLARD, Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) — GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall. Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived. “It was just a bit of a thing,” he added. “If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.” Giving Funds are GoFundMe’s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company’s DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers — products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts. To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur’s circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site. “We’re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they’re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they’re coming in and they’re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,” Cadogan said. “That connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.” Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit. The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals. There’s since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements. GoFundMe’s Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company’s standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors. Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving — something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn’t occurred because DAFs have been framed as “wealth management products.” “This is a giving product,” Cadogan said. “It’s something for everybody. And you don’t need to know the words ‘donor advised fund.’ It doesn’t show up.” DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes — even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023. Cadogan believes GoFundMe’s culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends’ charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas. That “dynamic, alive community” is very different from the “fairly static, passive” financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan. “It’s essentially inspiring the money to move,” he said. Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning. Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative’s recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the “sweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.” The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it’s a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are “available-to-everyone vehicles” considering that half run balances under $50,000. “Givers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,” Williams said. “Anything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.” But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe’s entrance as “a game changer” that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years. Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a “savings account” for “good works.” “And GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,” she said.

Title: A public lands sell-off is struck from the GOP policy bill
URL: https://www.denverpost.com/2025/06/30/public-lands-sell-off-gop-policy-bill/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T17:21:44Z
Full Content:
By Maxine Joselow, The New York Times WASHINGTON — Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said late Saturday that he had dropped his contentious plan to sell millions of acres of public lands from the sweeping domestic policy package that the Senate will soon begin debating. Lee made the nighttime announcement on social media after it became clear that the plan faced insurmountable opposition from within his own party. At least four Republican senators from Western states had said they planned to vote for an amendment to strike the proposal from the bill. The plan had also triggered intense pushback from conservative hunters and outdoorsmen across the American West, who had warned that it threatened the lands where they hunted and fished. “Over the past several weeks, I’ve spent a lot of time listening to members of the community, local leaders and stakeholders across the country,” Lee wrote on the social platform X on Saturday. “While there has been a tremendous amount of misinformation — and in some cases, outright lies — about my bill, many people brought forward sincere concerns.” The provision would have required the Bureau of Land Management to sell as much as 1.225 million acres of public property in 11 Western states. Proponents had argued that the region has a severe shortage of affordable housing and that developers could build new homes on these tracts. In his post, Lee said that, because of the strict rules governing the budgetary process that Republicans are using to pass the bill, he was “unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families — not to China, not to BlackRock, and not to any foreign interests.” It was not immediately clear whether the budgetary process would have allowed Lee to prohibit certain businesses or foreign countries from purchasing land. The process, known as reconciliation, allows bills that affect government revenues to pass the Senate on a simple majority vote, avoiding a filibuster. A spokesperson for Lee did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The four Republicans who opposed the plan were Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy of Montana and Jim Risch and Mike Crapo of Idaho. While opponents acknowledged the housing shortage as a serious problem, they rejected a public lands sell-off as a solution. “One of the greatest gifts we’ve ever had in America is the public lands that have been passed down generation to generation,” Sheehy said in an interview Saturday before the proposal was struck from the package. “Especially for us in Western states, it’s our way of life for hunting and fishing,” he continued. “I believe Mike Lee knows that, too, and I don’t believe he’s acting in bad faith at all.” A previous version of Lee’s plan had called for the BLM and the U.S. Forest Service to sell between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres of public lands. But the provision was stripped from the bill by the Senate’s parliamentarian, the nonpartisan official who enforces the chamber’s rules. The latest version of the plan would have allowed individuals and companies to buy up to 2 square miles of land at a time, with no limit on how much property they could ultimately purchase. Only land within 5 miles of a population center would have been eligible to be sold. In addition to the four Republican senators who opposed the plan, five House Republicans said Thursday that the land sell-off was a “poison pill” that would cost their votes for the package. The opponents in the House included Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who led the Interior Department during Trump’s first term. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son and an avid hunter and outdoorsman, had been publicly silent on Lee’s plan while it was under consideration. But Sunday morning, he wrote on X that the proposal’s withdrawal was a “huge win for our public lands!” Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., celebrated the plan’s demise while warning other lawmakers not to attempt to resurrect it. “To those already plotting to go after our public lands another way: Don’t. Unless you like losing,” Heinrich said in a statement Saturday. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Title: June 2025 in Review

Full Content:
The Site How about now? Is the site loading performance any better now? I opened up a post about the site’s performance on the WP.com support forum and got a response from the team the next day that was basically, “Works on my machine, get lost,” which is honestly the level of support I have come to expect from WP.com over the years. They are absolutely in a mode to deflect all possible complaints on the first try. Still, I was disappointed. I thought I had them because their own speed test tool, which runs on their servers and not my local machine, was reporting problems. But if you run the test enough times eventually you will hit a good patch and it will work. (I finally got it to run, but its results include AI recommendations that were ludicrously wrong. Badly trained AI is worse than no AI.) So I started building up evidence to support a ticket, because I wasn’t giving up and when profiling the site loading it was always the initial response from the server that was the long pole. That is WP.com being bad, that long line I took measurements at different times of day over a few days and I was seeing time between 653ms (acceptable) and 22.4 seconds (WTF?) always backed up at the waiting for response marker. Every time. And then it stopped happening for a while. For about a week the biggest slow down on the profiles was loading the header image… which are not large images at all. So I suspect the JavaScript which does the random header selection is causing that issue, something they absolutely won’t fix because they don’t support their old themes and, as far as I can tell, none of their new themes support such a feature. That points, once again, to a need to change themes to something currently supported, work I am not thrilled to start. I went with a hosted plan rather than hosting the blog myself because I wanted to avoid all this sort of thing. But WP.com cares not for its customers. Then the delays started up again. Same routine. The problem is that “waiting for response” category is a bucket that could be covering for any number of things. It might just be their server being bad. But it could be something else. So I started down the final list of items I had yet to change, landing on the Blog Roll 8.0 sidebar RSS widget. That particular Rube Goldberg setup started as 3.0 back in 2014 as my second attempt to replace Google Reader as the RSS source. (Again, screw Google for killing that app.) I’ve had to patch it and rework it multiple times over the years, and it still had problems. Pinboard, which creates the RSS feed, has always been balky and goes through periods of unreliability, but WP.com used to load that widget after the first screen load. It seems that WP.com made a change and it looks like they won’t load the site unless all widgets have loaded or timed out. So when Pinboard chokes, the site is slow. Very slow. Or that was my theory. To fix that I am on to a new version of the blog roll, using Inoreader, a Feedly competitor, which does the Google Reader thing and lets you get an RSS feed out of a category group. It doesn’t let me format the output the way my Feedly to IFTTT to Pinboard route did, but it does seem more responsive. So I ask again, is the site loading any better now? Or do I need a new theory of the case? Also, a last minute gripe… I turned ads back on again and WP.com broke something because it shouldn’t be showing ads to people logged into WP.com… but the site was showing outlines of where ads should be… which was just as bad as having ads there, but zero revenue. So I turned them off again. Did you see any of that last week? Dammit WP.com, can you just stop screwing things up already? One Year Ago Playable Worlds announced Stars Reach. We also got a launch date for The War Within. The Janthir Wilds expansion for Guild Wars 2 was announced, promising player housing. In a Friday Bullet Points post I summed up the hot summer happenings including the Equinox expansion for EVE Online, the beta for The War Within, Valheim on MacOS, Pax Dei early access, the Tarisland launch, the coming Steam Summer Sale, and the imminent demise of ICQ. That was followed up by another Friday Bullet Points post where I covered Tarisland launching, the Valheim board game, the Throne & Liberty launch date, and the latest Hearthstone expansion that had something to do with ketchup packets. Then I tried Tarisland and said I hated it… mostly due to its control scheme. This upset a few people, so I gave it a try on the iPad. The Anashti Sul special server opened up in EverQuest II. I created some memes about various CCP projects… which were honestly not as harsh as I billed them. I say that because we got the Equinox expansion which was a whole lot of stuff that wasn’t really done yet… and wouldn’t be done for months. At least we got login rewards again and I made a lime green ship SKIN with SKINR. The May MER didn’t look bad, but would the expansion bump up activity? There was also the road to Alliance Tournament XX to consider. Also, the EVE Online app ecosystem seemed to be in decay. However, we did have Ser Fukalite’s ship spinning medal to celebrate. In WoW Classic it was Cataclysm time, and I was in the fragile submarine quest in Vash’jir. Then it was off to Mount Hyjal, and after that Deepholm. The group was doing its first run at Blackrock Caverns Civilization VII was announced. I was still poking around in Valheim looking for The Queen. I eventually found her after a long voyage and slew her… though I had set the server for easy mode at that point. That unlocked my journey to the Ashlands. In my ongoing telephone tales series I wrote about the great failure of VXML, the ascent of enterprise VoIP, Noted imbecile Lars Wingefors declared you couldn’t raise prices on video games. Amazon Games announced an update to New World by trying to make it sound like a brand new console title as they tried to pretend the PC game didn’t exist. I was leafing through the state of the Twitter alternatives. Over on X Elon decided to hide the ability to see who clicked on the like button so his white nationalist fan boys would stopped getting called out for being literal nazis. I was also vanity searching on AI to see if it knew anything about me. There was also a brief mention at the end of the month in review post of something called Fantasy Critic. Did that ever become something? And, as mentioned at the top of this section, there was a Steam Summer Sale. Five Years Ago Our daughter graduated from high school. It was a pandemic graduation, but we made do. My poll about voice chat indicated that Discord now rules that roost. Pokemon Go gave us remote raid passes since we all had to stay home. I was giving Minecraft Dungeons a try. I finished the main story fairly quickly and found the game to be light and fun, but not very deep or replayable. Other reviews were even less charitable. Daybreak was still having problems with their Aradune progression server. We were getting down to the final days of the Battle for Azeroth expansion in World of Warcraft and I was wondering how it would rank in the pantheon of expansions and how much the previous expansion plays into how people feel about the current or next expansion. WoW Classic was still going strong enough that Blizz had to turn layering back on for several realms. There was also the Summer Bowl and the campaign against bots. The instance group was still working on Zul’Farrak, failing the stairs when Sergeant Bly and his crew died. Then, the next time, Bly and his crew survived, but disappeared as we looted the field. My hunter became my first character to hit level 50 in WoW Classic. In EVE Online I was reminding people about why CCP gave Upwell structures asset safety… because they took it away with the Forsaken Fortress update. Another case of people foolishly believing in company promises. So we went out and shot our own abandoned state structures in Delve just to keep other groups from coming along and doing it. Meanwhile, the CCP mineral starvation plan was driving mineral prices to an all time high. (Which would seem comically low a year, two years, and even five years later.) We did, however, get new ships for the EDENCOM faction as part of the Triglavian invasion event as well as a Project Discovery update that moved its focus onto the coronavirus. And we got character log off! People had only been asking for that since forever. The CSM15 elections kicked off, with the results being announced by mid-month. Also a little something about how opaque the game UI can be. Actually in space the GEF was still up north fighting over various objectives. But that all came to a screeching halt when we we found out that most of null sec was planning to gang up against us and invade. They denied it, but then the evidence was found. Our deployment up north ended and we began consolidating the empire into our core space, pulling down the last Keepstar in Cloud Ring before the month was out. World War Bee was coming. We were playing some Minecraft and seeing how villages had changed. I was getting promotions for an Atari branded online casino complete with its own crypto-currency. I guess, as a brand, Atari still has some value. Ten Years Ago There was a cheer for the NBI class of 2015. I was wondering what Turbine would do after they cancelled Infinite Crisis. I was also looking for a summer game to play. After waffling before a live audience, Blizzard finally caved and said there would be flying in Draenor. Remember that time we killed a Mordus Angels Revenant? It seems like everybody has killed one by now. Also in EVE Online we got the Carnyx expansion, which had some of the initial Fozzie Sov features. So we were out sov-wanding station services, though Dominion sov quirks still ruled the day in our fight at ED-9LT. We then headed back north thinking maybe our friends in Querious would come visit us some day… *cough* The coming of Fozzie Sov also meant further consolidation of holdings to make sure we could defend our space. TNT got pushed out to Tribute to share space with the Circle of Two. Tensions between the two alliances started almost right away. And then there was Burn Amarr. I took some screen shots. And I splurged on ship skins. Over at Daybreak they were talking about special servers for EverQuest II at last. It looked like we might get some sort of progression server, for which there was a poll. And then another poll, looking for a name. Meanwhile, over in EverQuest, they were still working on how to deal with raiding on the Ragefire server, and the Ruins of Kunark unlock vote was upon us. I was playing Neko Atsume on the iPad… back when it was only in Japanese! I was also going on about 64-bit OS requirements finally coming to video games and an old grievance of mine. My daughter suddenly wanted to play The Sims. That lasted for about three days. This is why I make her wait a week on any sudden new fad she want to follow. The Steam Summer sale came and went and I bought nothing. That turned out to be the last sale with the traditional daily specials format. I brought up the F2P business model yet again based on a quote over at Massively OP which, if nothing else, got a long comment from Brad McQuaid on the subject. And, finally, I played Minecraft with my daughter for Father’s Day, which led to a whole new adventure in gaming. Fifteen Years Ago Warhammer Online, whose game tips I previously mocked, was out soliciting user written game tips with the most boring video game related video ever. Really, I was embarrassed for them. Meanwhile, there were comical tips to be found in another game. CCP was telling people that the steep learning curve in EVE Online was just part of the game, and Hulkageddon III was on the way. FrontierVille came along, evoking the whole Oregon Trail thing… for which they recently were sued. And a good thing to, as they are a bunch of lying bastards there at Zynga. They never sent me my FarmVille magnet. There was the big news from Turbine with Lord of the Rings Online going Free to Play. I wondered is Lifetime Subscribers like myself would get the shaft in this transition. But Turbine made me a perm VIP instead and put out one of those charts that seems to accompany these multi-level subscription scams structures. But I was winning LOTRO lotteries, so I was happy for the moment. In Pokemon SoulSilver I had beat all the gym leaders, but we were having Pokewalker problems. Then there was Blizzard. Where to start? They were selling WoW Gold straight from the main page. Really. It just isn’t what you think. They screwed up the parental controls interface… in my opinion… along with compromising the security of it. The whole RealID thing was just getting warmed up. One of the accounts in our guild was compromised and the guild bank was looted. That had happened so many times to so many people that wasn’t even news any more. And during all this, the instance group was working its way through The Burning Crusade content with our Horde alts, but we weren’t really feeling it. Ennui had set in and our only hope was Cataclysm. And there were plenty of offers to get us into the beta. Twenty Years Ago In EverQuest II we got the Splitpaw Saga adventure pack. Those of us with Station Access got it as part of the package, while those without had to pay… ten bucks I think. I actually ended up playing through that quite a bit. As early experiment with content that scaled with your levels, it was good from level 20 to level 50. Unfortunately, it never progressed and now every time I end up in the Thundering Steppes with my newer characters the intro quest pops up. Twenty-Five Years Ago Diablo II launched. It enlarged on its predecessor with more classes and a four act storyline that played out over different environments. A pre-digital distribution title, it was awarded a Guinness Book record as the fastest selling video game ever, having shipped and sold one million boxes over the course of the first month. For comparison its 2012 successor, Diablo III, sold 3.5 million copies in the first 24 hours, also setting a Guinness Book record. Shogun: Total War launched, setting down a template that would become the Total War series that is still getting new titles. Microsoft acquired Bungie… and then later spun them off. Then some years later Sony acquired them. Sony’s SOE acquired Verant Interactive, something that simplified the “who is running EverQuest?” question which, at launch, was possibly some sub-group within Sony, 989 Studios, or Verant, a situation reflected in gaming press coverage of the time, where various companies were named, often in the same article. It was all SOE after that… until Daybreak then EG7.

We haven’t played since early November. Meanwhile, some travel meant I only played Pokemon Go for the last few days of the month. It is the only game I play on my phone. (Balatro is iPad only for me, though you can play it on the iPhone. I just need my glasses to do so.) Enshrouded I meant all month to write something about Enshrouded… but never quite got to it. Part of that is because we’re moving forward a bit slowly and because we’re covering some of the same ground about which I have already written. But the latest big update has changed the game enough that I want to cover how much it has changed. I’ll get there. But we are playing it regularly. EVE Online What happens when you have a war and the other side declines to show up? More move ops! I spent quite a bit of time in the game, but not very much of it in combat. I mean, I got on my share of kill mails… but at last check I went on 17 fleets, most of which were moving things, scooping things, or covering people moving and scooping things. War is logistics I guess. Lord of the Rings Online Onward to Mordor! I left off at the very gates of the black land. Soon I will be there. (Well, I have already been at this point, but that post has gone line. Soon!) I played a lot of LOTRO in June, though not as much as May, largely due to increased activity in EVE Online and there being only so many hours in the day. Still, I did log in daily and use up my blue bar and do my tasks. Pokemon Go Since hitting level 48 my main focus has been on completing the tasks required to unlock level 49. Specifically, the 35 platinum medals. I managed to get one more since I leveled up, but I still need 13 more. I am going to need a plan. Meanwhile, my play time was up because it was Pokemon Go fest and we were at the airport waiting for a delayed flight, so we spent quite a bit of time doing raids and tasks. Coming Up I will undoubtedly make it fully into Mordor in Lord of the Rings Online. That will be kind of a big deal for me. Expect a post or three. Meanwhile, WoW Classic might liven up a bit as we’re running down the clock to the long awaited arrival of the Mists of Pandaria expansion. We stopped playing WoW Classic on November 3, 2024, having grown tired of Cataclysm. Will pandas revive our spirits? Am I still subscribed? Find out in July! In New Eden I expect more move ops and such as the Imperium continues to slide east, nestling up against long time rival and foe PanFam. Could sparks fly? But we’ll also be into the Icelandic summer vacation season, so EVE Online might be otherwise quiet. We’ll also be half way through the year, so that will probably get at least one “the year so far…” sort of post out of me. Otherwise I guess it is just hot hobbit summer. Make sure you get your characters off of the soon to be closing 32-bit servers. Loading times for the site are… inconsistent. When I opened this post first time a few minutes ago it was very quick but after I read the first section I closed and re-opened it a few times and it was never that quick again. It was still quicker than it has been, though. That was in Firefox. I just tried Chrome and that was almost instantaneous first time, then very slightly slower the next two times but still very fast. Bet that helps! LikeLiked by 1 person And as an additional data point, I just clicked on Tuesday’s FCL post and it took as long for the page to load as I’ve seen for a while.

Both platforms cover financial and business news as well as sport and… More Info The City minister has reaffirmed the government’s ambition for a green transition across the financial services sector, despite the industry pivoting on climate priorities. Speaking at City Week on Monday, Emma Reynolds said: “The UK has a world leading financial and related professional services ecosystem and the research that is needed to integrate sustainable finance.” Reynolds said the Treasury’s upcoming Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy – a key pillar in the government’s economic agenda – will help foster the UK’s push to “transition finance” through honing in on skills as one of five key areas. But this comes amid a widespread retreat from the financial services sector. The banking industry has been at the forefront of a green row back, with Barclays and Natwest dropping climate targets from their annual bonus schemes for senior executives. Meanwhile, Europe’s biggest lender HSBC slapped a 20-year delay on its net zero target. Energy secretary Ed Miliband has touted plans to “transform” the UK’s financial services sector “into a global hub for green investment”. Whilst London is a leader in the area, City AM reported earlier this year green finance ratings across financial sectors were dramatically reducing. Despite topping the 15th edition of Z/Yen Global Green Finance Index, London’s rating reduced 36 points to 598. The Treasury has said the financial services growth strategy, set to be published on July 15, will “shape the type of growth being pursued, and support net zero, regional growth, and economic security and resilience”. Reynolds, who is steering the Treasury’s plans, said the upcoming COP30 in Brazil will be crucial to green ambitions following last years agreement where governments pledged to scale up climate finance into developing countries to $1.3 trillion per year by 2035. “We think that in order to make this a success, the road map must ensure that it’s based on several principles. It must be inclusive, it must have stability, and it must have focus,” the City minister added. But top names across the sector have vocalised concerns efforts in green finance have stalled. Sandra Boss, the UK Chair at Blackrock, said during a at City Week panel whilst “the need” for investing in renewable energy was “undeniable,” the energy transition was progressing “slower than hoped”. The waning commitment to green finance is being witnessed on a global scale and many have pointed to President Donald Trump’s return to the White House as a key catalyst. One of Trump’s first executive orders following his inauguration in both 2017 and 2025 was to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. The document encourages global co-operation to limit the causes of global warming. The World Bank – an international development organisation owned by 187 countries – softened its climate approach after the US took a chainsaw to climate programs.

Title: ETF Expert Says Ripple Closing This Chapter Clears The Way For XRP ETF, BlackRock To Join The Race?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-move-strengthens-xrp-etf/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T15:30:19Z
Full Content:
Nate Geraci, the president of the ETF store, has weighed in on what Ripple’s decision to drop its cross appeal could mean for XRP ETFs. He also raised the possibility of BlackRock joining the ETF race now that the lawsuit is ending. In an X post, Nate Geraci stated that a closed chapter on the XRP lawsuit clears the way for a spot XRP ETF. His statement suggested that the SEC could now move to approve the applications for issuers to offer this fund. Geraci was reacting to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement of his firm’s decision to drop its cross-appeal against the SEC. Bitcoinist reported that Garlinghouse stated that Ripple is dropping its cross-appeal and that the SEC is expected to drop its appeal, which will put an end to the XRP lawsuit. He added that they are closing this chapter and focusing on building the Internet of Value. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart had earlier in the year mentioned how the lawsuit impacts an XRP ETF. In an X post, Seyffart opined back then that there is unlikely to be an XRP ETF until the whole XRP lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple is settled. He added that the Commission needed to “untangle that mess” before it possibly proceeds to approve these ETFs. Indeed, the SEC has, up till now, continued to delay its decision on these funds and has yet to provide comments. This is unlike the Solana ETFs, which the Commission had asked issuers to amend, as it prepares to approve these funds. However, once the SEC drops its appeal and formally ends the XRP lawsuit, this could change, with the Commission communicating with XRP ETF issuers on the next steps. Nate Geraci also stated that the end of the XRP lawsuit also clears the way for the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, to file to offer an XRP ETF. Despite already offering Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the asset manager has yet to file for other crypto ETFs, including one for XRP. This is unlike other Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers, such as Bitwise, which has filed to offer ETFs for XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, among others. However, as Geraci predicts, that could change soon enough, with BlackRock filing for an XRP ETF. The asset manager would be the eighth to do so if they file for this fund anytime soon. Bloomberg analysts Seyffart and Eric Blachunas predict a 95% chance that the SEC will approve these funds this year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.19, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Lowe’s CEO warns young workers to stay away from the corner office: ‘AI isn’t going to fix a hole in your roof’
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/06/30/lowes-ceo-marvin-ellison-ai-impact-workforce-gen-z-customers/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T15:06:27Z
Full Content:
Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. Anxiety about an AI job bloodbath is everywhere. As generative-AI tools like ChatGPT advance at lightning speed, even high-skilled roles like software engineering appear to be at risk. But according to Lowe’s CEO Marvin Ellison, the reality of AI’s impact on the workforce is far more grounded. “AI isn’t going to fix a hole in your roof,” Ellison, chief executive of the home-improvement retail giant, said at Business Roundtable’s CEO Workforce Forum earlier this month. “It’s not going to respond to an electrical issue in your home,” he said. “It’s not going to stop your water heater from leaking.” Particularly for Gen Z, who are facing an uphill battle thanks to slowed hiring among recent graduates, Ellison reassures them there are job opportunities—as long as you are willing to give up dreams of the corner office. “When young people come to me and they desire to work in the corporate office, my advice to them is, Stay as close to the cash register as you can,” he said. “Stay close to the customers because you will always have employment opportunities to grow.” And while his words may sound ironic considering how technology is the reason for self-checkout, Ellison is a believer that mastering the skills AI doesn’t have is a wise move. Ellison didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Ellison’s comments come at a time when there’s a fierce debate among business leaders about the impacts of AI, especially on young talent. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned the technology could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs, and Amazon recently announced it will soon cut its corporate workforce thanks to the technology. However, OpenAI chief operating officer Brad Lightcap is more optimistic. “We look at the problem and opportunity of deploying AI into every company on earth, and we have yet to see any evidence that people are kind of wholesale replacing entry-level jobs,” Lightcap said on the Hard Fork podcast. Some business leaders agree one growing pathway to success is the skilled trade industry. After all, construction, utilities, as well as oil, gas, and mining are the fastest-growing industries for new grads, according to LinkedIn’s 2025 Grad Guide. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said earlier this year electricians in particular are so desperately needed the U.S. could run out of them, thanks in part to growing demand and the deportation of skilled workers. “I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians, that we need to build out AI data centers,” Fink told an audience at CERAWeek, an S&P Global energy conference hosted in Houston. “We just don’t have enough.” According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, demand for plumbers (6%), roofers (6%), and electricians (11%) is expected to grow over the next decade—and each rate is faster than the national average of all occupations. However, a McKinsey report suggests the need for young people to pursue critical trade skills is even more dire due to the aging of existing skilled trade workers; in fact, hiring for critical skilled roles could be more than 20 times the projected annual increase in new jobs between 2022 and 2032. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Moonwell’s Founder Calls for Better Crypto UX: “Take the Hippocratic Oath to Your Users” | HackerNoon

One of web3’s biggest challenges today is designing for people who don’t already speak its language, so I was excited to sit down with Luke Youngblood to explore what it takes to build systems that reach beyond the crypto bubble. From AWS to Coinbase and now leading Moonwell, Luke brings deep infrastructure expertise and a sharp focus on making blockchain easier, safer, and more accessible. In the early days of crypto, most people accessed it from a desktop computer on a fast internet connection. If you were early to Bitcoin or Ethereum, you were probably a developer like me—or a gamer—using it on your gaming PC. Either way, at that time, you needed some serious hardware and bandwidth just to run a wallet or interact with DeFi apps. In the last few years, decentralized finance (DeFi) apps have become usable on mobile web. That brought us a step closer to real accessibility; today, you can use most apps on chains like Ethereum or Base directly from your phone in a browser like Safari or Chrome. The next step, and one we’re already starting to see, is the use of native mobile apps. Zora, for example, now has an iOS app on Base. It’s a social and creative platform, and moving to native mobile is a big leap. That’s likely the direction we’ll take with Moonwell, too: building a great native experience on both iOS and Android. Of course, there are still other barriers to adoption—and language is a big one. Most early crypto apps simply assumed users spoke English. That might work in parts of the Americas or Europe, but it doesn’t hold in much of Latin America, Africa, or Asia, where English often isn’t the primary language. That’s why we’ve translated Moonwell into four additional languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, and Chinese. We have to keep making web3 more accessible, not just in terms of devices and apps, but in terms of language and context, too. Reaching beyond the small percentage of people who speak English as a second language is key to global adoption. At the core of an open financial system is self-custody. People should be able to own and control their assets directly—without relying on a third party. That’s always been important to early crypto users like me: being able to hold your own tokens and actually use them. The fundamentals are simple: freedom to custody and freedom to transact. What’s not simple, though, is onboarding the next billion in a way that makes those freedoms real. First come, wallets. If you’ve ever installed one, you know how painful it can be. App store, endless options, weird UX, seed phrase anxiety… For someone new to crypto, it’s a maze. That whole flow needs to go. We think passkey wallets are the answer; they’re built into most phones, secured by biometrics like Face ID, and don’t require downloading anything or managing a seed phrase. Telling someone to store twelve or twenty-four recovery words in a drawer and hope they never lose them really isn’t the way. Passkeys solve this, too. They back up automatically to iCloud or Google Cloud, so if you lose your phone, you can recover your wallet without panic or paperwork. Most people don’t use password managers—another problem—but at least modern browsers and OSs are making that easier. Still, access to the latest hardware isn’t universal. That’s a gap we can’t ignore. And then there’s transaction fees. Most onchain apps still expect users to buy ETH just to make a transaction, which adds unnecessary friction. At Moonwell, we solve this with Paymasters and sponsored transactions. First-time users can create a passkey wallet, enable cloud backup, and start using the app without ever buying ETH or worrying about fees. On Base, we use credits from Coinbase’s Gasless campaign to cover costs; on other networks, we sponsor transactions with USDC. The cost is low—just twenty dollars can cover thousands of transactions, making it easier for users to get started and for developers to scale. This way, we can onboard people without having to ask them to pay just to try an app—and it changes everything! Think about web2 apps like Instagram. It just works, it’s free. You never think about paying to post a photo. DeFi needs to feel that simple, too, if we want people to actually use it. One of the things I’ve noticed—after using the internet for decades since I was a kid—is how much it has evolved when it comes to networks. Back in the early days, if you wanted to connect with someone online, you had to think about which network you were on. I remember using university networks and dial-up bulletin board systems. You couldn’t just go anywhere; you had to log into a specific system to reach specific people. Everything was its own little walled garden. And honestly, that’s how crypto feels today. Ethereum, Base, other layer 1s, and layer 2s—there are bridges between them, but using apps across chains is still a hassle. If your wallet is connected to one network, you can’t easily interact with an app on another. You always have to think about where your tokens are and how to move them. So at Moonwell, we’ve been trying to solve this. We built a feature called Beam, already live in its early version, to make cross-chain UX feel like single-chain UX. Beam shows your total balance across chains—if you’ve got $50 on one chain, $25 on another, and $25 elsewhere, we just show you $100. When you hit “deposit” and sign the transaction, Beam gathers your tokens, bridges them if needed, and deposits them—all behind the scenes. To do that, we use a modular execution environment that picks the fastest and most cost-effective route. In many cases, that’s Across Protocol, which is great for bridging efficiently. The user stays in control the whole time—they’re still signing the transaction—but the complexity is abstracted away. It’s both faster and cheaper. Even when bridging from Ethereum mainnet, the process takes just a few minutes. We bundle transactions using an intents-based system, so your share of the gas might only be a penny or two. It's not like those big onchain operations that cost $15 or more. Under the hood, it's complex, but to the user, it feels simple and seamless. Too much of web3 expects users to think about the underlying infrastructure. What chain they are on, how to bridge assets, or whether an app is even compatible with their wallet. That’s not a good user experience—it’s just extra friction. The “Switch Network” prompt you see in many wallets is a great example. It’s really one of the clearest signs we haven’t abstracted the complexity away. If you look at messaging, be it via SMS or WhatsApp, you send a text, and it delivers. You’re not wondering what carrier the other person uses—it’s invisible to you. That’s what people expect from software. Web3 should be no different. Users shouldn’t be blocked from an app just because it runs on a different chain. With Beam, we’re pushing infrastructure into the background, where it belongs. My hope is that in a few years, no one will care whether they’re on Ethereum, Solana, Base, or BNB Chain. They’ll just open the app—whether it’s Moonwell, a game on Sonium, or something on World Chain—and it’ll just work. Before I went full-time into crypto, I worked in web2 tech—at Amazon Web Services (AWS). And in many ways, the adoption of cloud services mirrors what’s happening now with web3. In the early days, most companies didn’t take the cloud seriously. If you worked in tech back then, you were probably dealing with massive data centers and centralized systems like Oracle. When AWS launched EC2—the Elastic Compute Cloud—in the 2000s, big enterprises saw it as a toy. Something for startups or hobbyists, not real infrastructure. But now, most of the largest businesses in the world use cloud as their default. It’s faster, cheaper, and more flexible because you only pay for what you use. That’s very similar to what’s happening with web3 and financial apps today. Legacy banking infrastructure often takes days to settle transactions, while web3 enables instant cross-border settlements. We’re upgrading the financial system much like engineers upgraded from on-prem data centers to cloud services in the 2010s. By adopting new financial infrastructure—smart contracts and web3—banks, fintechs, and traditional finance companies will be able to offer far better services. Much of this will be powered by protocols like Moonwell, because we’ve spent years building decentralized infrastructure that’s self-custodial, permissionless, and gives people real control over their money. The GENIUS Act recently passed the U.S. Senate, marking the first step toward allowing banks to hold stablecoins on their balance sheets. It still needs to pass the House and be signed by the President, but if it does, the “crypto economy” may soon just be “the economy. Big banks—like Bank of America, Santander in Latin America, and Brazil’s BTG Pactual—will want to integrate stablecoin infrastructure into their core products. That means instant cross-border settlements and cheaper remittances, which is a big deal for people in places like Colombia who currently wait days and pay high fees to services like MoneyGram to receive money from abroad. It’s exciting to see the traditional finance system upgrading to support onchain finance and stablecoins, just like the cloud transformed data centers and opened up new possibilities for services that didn’t exist before. That’s a tough question. Large traditional finance players will always want to centralize control because they want to protect their existing business models. Decentralization threatens that, so there’s a natural tension. Some of these centralized players will build private networks. For example, BlackRock has its BUIDL Fund on Ethereum and Base. It’s a tokenized fund that lets people invest in traditional financial assets. The fund is an ERC-20 token, but it’s permissioned—only licensed broker-dealers, ATS (Alternative Trading Systems), and other regulated market participants can hold it. So, there will be centralized assets—like tokenized stocks—that you can only interact with if you’re a bank, brokerage, or have passed KYB (Know Your Business) checks. However, I think decentralization and permissionless self-custody can still exist through intermediaries. For instance, if the BlackRock BUIDL Fund is only available to institutions, retail investors like me can’t buy it directly. But a bank or fintech could become a licensed participant, join the fund as an institution, and then offer retail banking services to customers like me. They’d do KYC on me, and then I could buy and transact with a wrapped version of the fund. But that’s just an example; you can imagine similar things for tokenized stocks—it would mean only US investors can hold them if they’ve completed KYC through a bank. This setup would look somewhat like the current financial system, but with benefits like instant settlement—you wouldn’t have to wait two days for stock certificates to clear. It’s much more efficient. A concrete example is loan origination. Instead of waiting days or weeks for human loan officers to review credit and approve loans, decentralized apps like Moonwell can originate thousands of loans in a single day automatically using smart contracts. So, as traditional finance adopts web3 tech, you’ll see huge efficiency gains. But ultimately, retail users will still be able to take the self-custodial route. I might buy a fraction of Nvidia stock and hold it in my own wallet—not through BlackRock or a big bank, but via something like E*TRADE or a retail-focused platform offering a faster, cheaper experience powered by blockchain. Put yourself in the user’s shoes. When I build onchain apps, I think of it like a Hippocratic oath. For doctors, that means avoiding harm to the patient. For us, it means protecting the user and their funds, no matter what. Of course, crypto has its share of hacks, so as builders, we must never release anything that isn’t audited, secure, and backed by a solid bug bounty. Malicious actors will always try to steal from your users, so protecting user funds has to be a top priority. The other piece is decentralization. Early on, it’s tempting to keep control centralized—you can move faster. But if your app grows to millions in value, you don’t want all control in one place or one person’s hands. It puts your team and users at risk, making you a target. It’s important to think early about moving control to a DAO or decentralized governance by token holders, and to distribute those tokens widely. Moonwell has over 100,000 WELL token holders who govern the protocol. That setup lets us upgrade contracts and add markets safely without centralized control. It builds resilience and helps us sleep better at night. Start by exploring. Moonwell’s a good place to learn how lending and borrowing work onchain. And if you’ve got questions along the way, Mamo’s there too—it’s a cute little AI companion we built to help people get more comfortable with the basics. The jump from curious to confident takes time, so start small and stay curious!

Title: GoFundMe launches new funds aimed at maximizing charitable donations

Nina Ajemian is the newsletter curation fellow at Fortune and works on the Term Sheet and MPW Daily newsletters. – Funding the future. Even when they are not the breadwinners, women tend to make many of their households’ financial decisions, including charitable giving. And with the impending great wealth transfer, in which women in particular are expected to inherit trillions upon trillions of dollars, that could have profound effects on charitable giving throughout the country in the near future. That’s according to Margaret Richardson, GoFundMe’s chief marketing and corporate affairs officer, who I talked to last week about women and philanthropy and the company’s newest product launch. According to Richardson, women are busier than ever. And while they can and have managed many of these household tasks, many are also looking for ways to make managing their finances more seamless. “Women are often the charitable decision makers already in their families, and we see that that trend just continuing as women have more resources and more responsibilities,” says Richardson. That is one of the reasons GoFundMe is launching its newest product today, one it hopes will make charitable giving easier and more impactful—and attract some of those trillions. Called Giving Funds, it is a type of donor-advised fund that will allow users to contribute to the charitable investment accounts right on GoFundMe’s site. Donor-advised funds, or DAFs, are growing in popularity, as I wrote last year. They are tax-advantaged accounts for charitable giving, in which lump sum or automated recurring contributions can be invested; eventually the contributions and gains will go to charity, and they grow tax-free. It can be helpful to think of DAFs as similar to a 401(k), health savings account, or 529 account. Money contributed to a DAF cannot be taken back, it is effectively a charitable contribution and donors are generally eligible to take an immediate tax deduction. The benefit is that you can donate now, get that tax deduction now (if you itemize), invest the funds, and then have more to give in the future. GoFundMe is partnering with fund managers like BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors, and Vanguard to advise on the investment options, which are a number of exchange-traded funds. Though plenty of financial institutions offer DAFs, Richardson says the benefit of doing it on GoFundMe is that users will have all of their charitable giving centralized, and receive one annual tax document. There are no management fees and no minimum balances, and users can give their funds to any of the 1.4 million charities on the platform. Despite their tax benefits, DAFs are still fairly niche products—only about 1% of Americans use them, says Richardson, though an increasingly larger share of the U.S.’s total annual charitable contributions stem from them with each passing year. But a site like GoFundMe offering them could be the start to broadening their appeal—after all, the site has some 200 million users from all income levels, races, and genders. It could be many peoples’ first exposure to the investment tool. And, she says, it makes it easier for people to plan ahead. Many users come to GoFundMe after a natural disaster or other event to find causes to donate to. If they already have a pot of money waiting there that they previously donated—and that has possibly grown as it was invested—it can make all of their charitable giving more seamless. “This could be a really efficient and effective way for people to…get [funds] out the door quickly when organizations need it most,” she says.

A reversal in disability benefits from the U.K.’s prime minister has eliminated £3 billion ($4.1 billion) in savings, leaving chancellor Rachel Reeves with the question: Where is she going to find the funds to stay on track in meeting her budget rules?

Following the protests in Los Angeles over ICE raids, Kelly Loeffler’s Small Business Administration (SBA) is moving some of its offices out of “sanctuary cities.” Losing these regional offices could have a real impact on the over 1.3 million small businesses in L.A., as founders will now have to travel to other offices for SBA services.

Giving Funds is GoFundMe’s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered NEW YORK -- GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall. Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived. “It was just a bit of a thing,” he added. "If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.” Giving Funds are GoFundMe's latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company's DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers — products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts. To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur's circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site. “We’re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they’re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they’re coming in and they’re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,” Cadogan said. “That connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.” Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit. The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals. There's since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements. GoFundMe's Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company's standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors. Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving — something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as “wealth management products.” “This is a giving product,” Cadogan said. “It’s something for everybody. And you don’t need to know the words ‘donor advised fund.’ It doesn’t show up.” DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes — even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023. Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas. That “dynamic, alive community” is very different from the “fairly static, passive” financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan. “It’s essentially inspiring the money to move,” he said. Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning. Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the “sweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.” The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are “available-to-everyone vehicles" considering that half run balances under $50,000. “Givers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,” Williams said. “Anything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.” But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as “a game changer” that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years. Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a “savings account" for "good works." “And GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,” she said. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have become a $3.4 trillion market this year as U.S. president Donald Trump helps drive the bitcoin price with a wild crypto prediction. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price is nearing its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, bouncing back from April lows of $75,000, with markets braced for a Federal Reserve flip. Now, as a legendary billionaire has said he expects global “de-dollarization" to catapult the bitcoin price higher, traders are eyeing what Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks has said will be a “big” July, while the Federal Reserve is under pressure to cut interest rates and unleash the “trillions and trillions” of dollars that are on the sidelines. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump's second term in the White House has helped the bitcoin price soar. "July will be a big month," Sacks posted to X, adding that he's expecting "a bill signing" for the stablecoin Genius Act, and the crypto market structure Clarity Act “going to the Senate.” "President Trump supports Clarity on market structure as well as Genius on stablecoins," Sacks posted. "Let’s get this done!" The Trump administration has fast-tracked crypto legislation, rushing to pass bills that would legitimise dollar-pegged stablecoins and carve up the bitcoin and crypto market between regulators after companies and developers complained for years they’ve been left in limbo. Earlier this month, the Senate passed the Genius Act that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, legitimizing their use for issuers and custodians. Trump said he expected the the Genius Act to lead to “massive” crypto investment once if it’s passed by the House of Representatives. Trump’s support of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more broadly has flourished since he returned to the White House in January. Last week, Trump said bitcoin is taking "a lot of pressure off the dollar, and it is a great thing for our country," during a press conference, adding bitcoin has “become amazing.” The U.S. dollar index, which measures its performance against six other major currencies, is on track for its biggest drop in the first six months of a year since the era of free-floating currencies began in the early 1970s.

More as a perfect storm of U.S. president Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve hits. Meanwhile, Powell, who Trump has repeatedly attacked for his commitment to holding interest rates steady even as inflation falls toward its 2% target, is under increasing pressure to lower rates. “Jerome Powell is in an increasingly untenable situation because he will be looked at as politicizing the office of the Federal Reserve,” investor Chamath Palihapitiya said during an episode of the All In Podcast, which he hosts alongside crypto czar David Sacks and fellow investors David Friedburn and Jason Calacanis. “Look at how much money is sitting in money market funds … you have trillions and trillions of dollars of dry powder on the sidelines that will need to find a home.” Bitcoin and crypto analysts are generally feeling upbeat about the market’s outlook as policy, macro and funding factors align. “The setup for bitcoin remains compelling,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments. “A clean break above $110,000 could trigger a fast move to $120,000—putting our $138,500 summer target within reach. With policy, macro, and flows aligning, bitcoin may be setting up for a bullish end to the year—where a push toward $200,000 is no longer just a long shot, but a growing probability."

The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq—as well as the bitcoin price and gold—have returned to all-time highs in the first six months of Donald Trump’s second stint in the White House (with traders now braced for a Federal Reserve earthquake). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price is almost double where it was a year ago amid serious fears over the fate of the U.S. dollar, while the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have all rebounded from their Trump tariff-induced slumps. Gold has almost doubled over last two years.

Bitcoin, along with stocks that make up the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq, all sold off sharply this year as investors balked at Trump’s plans for wide-ranging tariffs on countries around the world. Stock and crypto markets have bounced back, however, as fears Trump’s tariffs would immediately drive inflation higher failed to materialise, with the bitcoin price hitting an all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin earlier this month.

"Admittedly, a month is too short a period to make a call on a definite trend, but it’s an area to watch closely.”

Title: Click, speak, move: These brain implants are poised to help people with disabilities

Jon Hamilton Phillip McKenzie, who was paralyzed from the neck down in a fall in 2012, uses a brain-computer interface developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh to navigate complex virtual tasks that simulate everyday activities, UPMC and Pitt Health Sciences hide caption People who have lost the ability to move or speak may soon have a new option: surgically implanted devices that link the brain to a computer. More than two decades after researchers first demonstrated that a person could move a computer cursor with their thoughts, several firms are poised to take the brain-computer interface (BCI) from experimental curiosity to commercial product. "We know it works, we know the enabling technologies are now ready," says Michael Mager, the CEO of Precision Neuroscience. "It's time to turn this academic work into a thriving industry that can make a big impact on people's lives." Already, experimental brain-computer interfaces have been implanted in dozens of people. The latest devices go under the skin and can communicate wirelessly with a smartphone or tablet. Elon Musk's Neuralink is the most visible player in the BCI field. But the first product to reach the market may well come from competitors including Precision, Blackrock Neurotech, Paradromics, or Synchron. Some of these companies, like Blackrock, have much more experience than Neuralink. Others use less invasive, and potentially safer, technology that may make it easier to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The first BCI customers are likely to be people living with paralysis from a spinal injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Early products will allow them to control a computer cursor, or generate artificial speech. Implanted BCIs work by detecting and decoding signals coming from areas of the brain that control movement or speech. These signals indicate when a person is trying to move a limb or speak a word. A BCI system typically includes sensors that detect brain activity, an interface that processes the signals, and an external device that turns thought into action. The result: A cursor moves, a prosthetic hand reaches, a synthetic voice speaks the words a person is trying to articulate. "Imagine the joy of connecting with your loved ones, browsing the web, or even playing games using only your thoughts," says the narrator of a promotional video from Neuralink. The company, which did not respond to requests for an interview, calls this capability "telepathy." Neuralink pushed BCIs into the public imagination in early 2024, thanks to a charismatic and resilient man with paralysis. A diving accident left Noland Arbaugh unable to move from the shoulders down. At 29, he became the first person to get Neuralink's device. A robot threaded more than a thousand electrodes into his brain's motor cortex at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix. Then, human surgeons there installed a wireless interface about the size of a quarter in his skull. A few weeks later, Arbaugh was on stage at Neuralink's headquarters in Fremont, California, describing his experience controlling a computer cursor. "It's freakin' wild," he said. "When I first moved it just by thinking, it blew my mind for like a day. I just could not wrap my head around it." A video featuring Arbaugh's remarks has attracted more than 25 million views on Musk's social media platform, X. But the success was tempered by Neuralink's announcement a few weeks later that some of the threads of electrodes in Arbaugh's brain had "retracted," making the device less sensitive. Since then, Neuralink has reported implanting its BCI in at least six other people. But details about those experiments remain scant. While Neuralink's surgical robots and wireless electronics are new, using thoughts to move a cursor isn't. Dr. Leigh Hochberg — who holds positions at Brown University and Massachusetts General Hospital — was part of a team that pioneered the approach in 2004. Their subject was Matt Nagle, a man who was living with paralysis after being stabbed in the neck. Hochberg's team linked Nagle's brain to a computer using old-fashioned wires that passed through his skull. A research video from 2004 shows Nagle using his thoughts to open an email. "It was exactly what was supposed to happen," Hochberg says. "And even for all of us that were expecting it — there was a little bit of magic there." Nagle died in 2007 of an infection unrelated to the experiment. BrainGate evolved into an academic consortium directed by Hochberg. And in June 2025, a team at the University of California, Davis reported that a BrainGate 2 BCI allowed a man with ALS to speak through a computer. "I. Am. Good," the synthesized voice says in a video accompanying the study. The speech is slightly halting, spoken one word a time. But the voice sounds human — it was constructed from old audio of the man speaking. Experiments like that one show how computer interfaces have improved, Hochberg says. Instead of monitoring a few dozen neurons, they may listen to thousands. Instead of sending information out through wires, they use wireless protocols. And instead of interfacing with a wall of computers, the signals may go to a single laptop or tablet. Another big change is that scientists keep finding ways to decode brain activity "more accurately, more consistently and more reliably," Hochberg says. In the past few years, that has meant employing artificial intelligence to recognize the neural activity patterns that reveal a person's intention to speak, or pick up a bar of chocolate. The field has also become specialized, Hochberg says, with some groups focused on decoding speech while others work on improving control of robotic limbs. There are even groups "focused on putting information back into the brain," Hochberg says, which can add a sense of touch to a robotic arm or hand. The University of Pittsburgh is among the leaders in providing sensory feedback through a brain-computer interface. "You can't have fine and dextrous motor control with visual feedback alone," says Jennifer Collinger, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh. You need that sense of touch to be able to respond in a natural way." With touch feedback, the user can tell when an artificial finger makes contact with an object or when an artificial hand is holding a cup tightly enough to keep it from falling. So Collinger and her colleagues have been working with Blackrock Neurotech, whose brain interface technology has been used experimentally in dozens of people. One of those people is Nathan Copeland, who was paralyzed in a car accident. In 2016, Copeland famously used a robotic arm to bump fists with President Barack Obama. In 2021, Copeland was part of a study that showed how a sense of touch improved his ability to grasp and manipulate objects with his prosthetic hand. "With sensation, I could feel that the hand had made contact," Copeland said in a 2021 interview with NPR. "I could also tell if I had a firm grip on it or not." But advanced features like sensory feedback aren't going to appear in the first implanted devices on the market, Collinger says. Instead, they are likely to offer control of a computer cursor, much like BrainGate did in those lab experiments more than 20 years ago. "There's been enough consistent success that now companies are saying, 'Okay we can offer a first-generation device to people that will offer some kind of benefit to them,'" Collinger says. One of those companies is Precision Neuroscience, which was cofounded by Ben Rapoport, a neurosurgeon and engineer who had previously helped start Neuralink. Precision's other co-founder and CEO, Michael Mager, says the company's short-term goal is a wireless device that allows a person with paralysis to operate a smartphone or computer. "We think about accessing news and entertainment, we think about productivity software like Microsoft Office, Word, Powerpoint, Excel," Mager says. "If you can operate those programs as well as someone who is able-bodied, it's quality-of-life enhancing — and it's also potentially enabling for people to go back to work." Precision's device differs from Neuralink's because it doesn't insert its electrodes into the brain. "We have a very, very thin film that is designed to sit on the surface of the brain without penetrating into or damaging the brain," Mager says. That makes the implant safer and less invasive, Mager says, which could make it easier to get approval from the FDA. Synchron avoids opening the skull entirely. Its electrodes are delivered through blood vessels using technology designed to place stents in blocked arteries. All of these devices face some common challenges, Mager says. "We're sampling from thousands of electrodes, thousands of times a second, and the amount of data that comes off of these systems is just enormous," he says. It is far too much data to transmit through existing wireless links. So companies are working on ways to reduce or compress the data. Another obstacle is the cost to conduct the sort of clinical trials required by the FDA. That will probably be hundreds of millions of dollars, Mager says. Even so, Mager thinks his company and several others, including Neuralink, have the resources and expertise to turn the brain interface concept into a marketable product. That won't take another 20 years, he says. Perhaps another two or three. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Surging inflows catapult IBIT to fourth-largest US ETF with rapid AUM growth, outshining rivals. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is rapidly cementing its status as the most dominant BTC fund among its peers. Bitcoin analyst James Check highlighted the divergence in a June 29 X post, noting that total inflows across all other Bitcoin ETFs have stagnated around $20 billion since December 2024. In contrast, IBIT alone has drawn over $52 billion in cumulative inflows since its launch, solidifying its dominance in the space. He further pointed out that this trend is reflected in weekly inflow data, where IBIT attracts the lion’s share of new investments and shows minimal outflows compared to competitors. Check wrote: “Dominance for all other ETFs in terms of total AUM has been in constant decline, initially dominated by GTBTC outflows, but more recently due to a clear preference for IBIT by investors.” This matches data from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who noted that based on year-to-date inflows, IBIT now ranks as the fourth-largest ETF in the US. According to Balchunas’ data, IBIT has leapfrogged over SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG) and is closing in on heavyweights like Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI). As of June 23, IBIT had recorded $13.7 billion in inflows, which is ahead of SPLG’s $13.4 billion but below VTI’s $19.3 billion. He also highlighted IBIT’s outlier status, noting that the fund is “the fifth in three-year flows (despite only being alive for 1.5 years).” These inflows helped the fund cross $70 billion in assets under management (AUM) in just 341 trading days, the fastest rate for any US ETF. This breakout performance has translated into significant financial gains for BlackRock. Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, pointed out that IBIT generates $186 million annually in fee revenue, surpassing even IVV (BlackRock’s flagship S&P 500 ETF) by $3 million. According to Arkham Intelligence, this milestone is particularly noteworthy given that IVV is nearly ten times larger than IBIT in terms of assets under management. The shift signals a broader change in institutional behavior. BlackRock, long associated with traditional equity markets, is now seeing more fee revenue from its Bitcoin ETF than from legacy stock-based products. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Banks and Stablecoins: a first step towards bridging traditional finance and the crypto world (Carlo R.W. De Meijer)

Stablecoins are attracting considerable attention by traditional financial institutions. Regulatory shifts are paving the way for banks to engage with stablecoins. These are rapidly evolving from a niche vertical in the cryptocurrency ecosystem into a foundational element of the global financial system. Stablecoins are increasingly becoming a preferred choice in modern finance, building a bridge between the traditional financial world and the crypto sector. Their evolution is shaping the future of global finance. In this blog we describe what stablecoins are, explore the current state of the stablecoin landscape, focus on key regulatory developments, the adoption by traditional financial institution, the various real-world use cases, the potential and challenges and the various solutions to these challenges. What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are blockchain-based digital tokens designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged one-to-one to traditional fiat currencies, predominantly the U.S. dollar and the euro, or high-quality liquid assets like commodities such as gold, silver or oil. Stablecoins are designed primarily to function as a stable medium of exchange. While their mechanisms may vary, they all aim to combine the trust and stability of fiat currencies (most commonly the US Dollar) associated with traditional banking infrastructure with the efficiency of blockchain-based transfers, thereby avoiding the volatility inherent in traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This makes stablecoins suitable for commercial transactions, international remittances, and storing value digitally. How stablecoins work? The vast majority of stablecoins are fiat-backed. This means that for every digital token issued, an equivalent amount of fiat currency (or highly liquid, low-risk assets like cash equivalents and short-term government bonds) is held in reserves by the issuer. This 1:1 backing is crucial for maintaining their peg to the underlying fiat currency. Regular attestations and audits are essential to ensure the transparency and integrity of these reserves, building trust among users. These tokens will be listed on various crypto exchanges. Present state: stablecoin market capitalization The current market capitalization of stablecoins was worth around $255 billion early June 2025 according to CoinMarketCap. This record high is driven by a wave of adoption from major global banks. With this market capitalization size and a growing presence in cross-border payments, corporate treasury operations, and emerging market finance, stablecoins are fast becoming a relevant tool in global finance. The market itself has been projected to grow to $2 trillion in the next three years. The growth in stablecoin use is clear when looking at the actual transaction volumes. Over the past year 2024, transaction volumes involving stablecoins rose significantly from $521 billion to $710 billion monthly. A significant milestone occurred in 2024 when the total amount of money transferred using stablecoins reached $27.6 trillion—surpassing the combined total transaction volumes processed by Visa and Mastercard that same year. This trend underscores their growing importance in global commerce and remittances. This however is still a small share of the global M2 money supply, approximately 1%. Dominant stablecoins: USDT and USDC The stablecoin market is dominated by USD-backed variants. The two largest stablecoins out there right now are Tether (USDT: $155 billion) and the USD Coin from Circle (USDC: $62 billion). Together they account over 90% of total stablecoin market capitalization. They have gained traction in both crypto and traditional finance circles due to their ability to combine the stability of fiat currencies with the benefits of blockchain technology. This is however not much in the $36 trillion US Treasury market, but the growth has certainly focused US Treasury’s attention. Regulatory clarity: remove fragmentation The regulatory environment for stablecoins in 2025 has evolved dramatically from the fragmented approach of the early 2020s. The dramatic shift towards stablecoins by large institutions follows recent moves by regulatory bodies in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) to create clear frameworks for stablecoins that define capital requirements, reserve management, and operational standards. These regulations may foster innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. These moves may contribute to the further development of consistent and reliable regulations worldwide for blockchain and crypto-related technologies. EU regulation: MICA The European Union (EU) is at the forefront of stablecoin regulation, having introduced Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation for cryptocurrencies including stablecoins. This regulatory framework is designed to protect investors, promote fair and efficient markets, and foster innovation in the crypto space. The MiCA regulation that came into effect in mid-2024, sets clear rules for stablecoins, significantly reducing regulatory uncertainty. Issuers operating in the EU should adhere to specific financial standards. They must hold full reserves, meet transparency requirements, and be authorized by financial regulators. MiCA does not cover central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), but it allows regulated financial institutions (e.g. banks) to issue or support stablecoins, including acting as custodians or liquidity providers. Banks in the EU now have a legal framework to engage with stablecoins in a compliant way. US regulation: GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act US Congress has recently passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins issuance by banks, aiming to bring stablecoin in the US financial system and creating standards for stablecoin oversight. This should be seen as a step towards creating a more stable and secure environment for their use. They focus on reserve requirements, licensing models and systemic risk considerations. This Act would require stablecoin issuers to hold one-to-one reserves, publish regular audits, and follow clear rules to protect users. Reserves backing stablecoins must be segregated from other corporate assets to reduce risk exposure. Monthly verification of reserves will become standard practice, giving users confidence in the stability of these digital assets. The GENIUS Act allows stablecoin issuers to operate under either federal or qualified state supervision, depending on their size and structure. Together with the STABLE Act that sets rules for the overall crypto market, they are are expected to provide the legal certainty needed for more banks and businesses to participate in the stablecoin market. Banking adoption of stablecoins: gather momentum A notable trend is the increasing involvement of major banks and fintech companies in the stablecoin market. This shift follows years of cautious observation and regulatory scepticism. But improved regular clarity has triggered a growing number of banks now experimenting with stablecoins, recognizing their value for improving operational efficiency, driven by a combination of fiat-like price stability with the speed, efficiency, and programmability of blockchain technology. Bank stablecoin initiatives: some examples This year a growing number of traditional financial institutions and fintechs in both the US, EU and Asia are joining existing financial services giants like Standard Chartered, PayPal, Revolut, and Stripe in adopting stablecoins. These companies are increasingly seeing their potential and have started different stablecoin initiatives, seeking to capitalize on the rapidly growing use of these coins. To give some insight here follows a number of examples of banks entering or planning to enter the stablecoin market, US banks Triggered by the pro-crypto Trump administration and the passing of the Genius Act, a growing number of US banks and fintechs are entering or planning to enter the stablecoin market. Including names like JPMorgan, US Bancorp, Bank of America, BNY Mellon and Paypal. Stripe, a leading fintech company, recently acquisitioned Bridge, a stablecoin orchestration platform. This initiative positions Stripe to enhance its payment processing capabilities, particularly in cross-border transactions. Similar moves are expected from competitors like Goldman Sachs and HSBC EU Banks Also banks in the EU have started to enter the stablecoin market including names like Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank and Banco Santander. The French Bank Societe Generale announced its plans to issue a publicly tradable stablecoin pegged to the US dollar named USD CoinVertible (USDCV) via its digital asset unit, SG-FORGE. This follows the launch of its euro-based stablecoin EUR CoinVertible in 2023. Both stablecoins are classified as electronic money tokens and will be arranged according to MiCA, EU’s crypto regulation. Deutsche Bank is also exploring the use of stablecoins and tokenized deposits, evaluating stablecoin options. Bloomberg reports that Deutsche Bank is actively researching how these technologies could be used within its services. Other banks, such as Banco Santander and Credit Lyonnais are also exploring stablecoins. Banco Santander has early-stage plans to launch its own euro- or dollar-denominated stablecoin or offering access to an existing one. Santander's Openbank unit has applied for MiCA licenses in Europe. Asian Banks Asia is leading the world in real-world stablecoin adoption, aimed to make stablecoins a foundational layer of Asia’s evolving payments infrastructure. Stablecoins are now a strategic lever for financial institutions in countries like Singapore (Standard Chartered’s Hong Kong branch), South Korea and Hong Kong (Ant Group), institutions are moving quickly—not just to explore stablecoins, but to scale them. But also in countries like Japan where the three largest banks (MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho) joined a pilot platform called “Project Pax” to use stablecoins for cross-border payments. In Australia ANZ Bank launched an AUD-pegged stablecoin and executed the first public blockchain transaction by an Australian bank, now expanding use cases including real-time pension payments. These examples illustrate that stablecoins are gradually becoming part of mainstream financial infrastructure, not just for crypto-native firms, but for some of the world’s largest banks Stablecoin use cases While the bulk of stablecoin use is currently still within the crypto capital markets and not for everyday payments, this is fundamentally changing. Growing regulatory clarity is expected to unlock broader use cases. These may include cross-border payments and foreign exchange transactions, crypto trading in DeFi, on-chain settlement as well as cash, liquidity and collateral management. Stablecoins are increasingly seen as practical tools to broad institutional use for everyday financial transactions. Cross border payments Financial institutions are considering using stablecoins to improve its payment systems. Cross-border transactions through traditional banking systems can be slow and expensive due to high fees and currency conversion costs. Stablecoins may fundamentally transform how money moves across borders, addressing long-standing pain points in traditional payment systems, delivering reduced costs, speeding up settlements, and increasing financial inclusion. Stablecoins offer the potential to make international transfers faster and more cost-effective compared to some traditional correspondent banking methods. When supported by appropriate infrastructure (such as wallets and custody providers), these funds can be received and accessed by the counterparty almost immediately. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Another major use case where stablecoins are already thriving is decentralized finance (DeFi). They serve as the foundational currency for DeFi applications, enabling lending, borrowing, swapping, yield farming, and more - all without centralized intermediaries. Their programmable nature allows for automated transactions that traditional banking systems cannot match in efficiency or cost. Stablecoins are becoming the essential bridge connecting traditional finance with cryptocurrency ecosystems through DeFi protocols. Banks can use them to automate financial processes like collateralized lending, borrowing, derivatives trading, and even tokenization. This programmability allows banks to participate in blockchain-based financial markets while streamlining operations like asset management and market making. “Programmable Treasury” A third use case of stablecoins is as a means of payment. Governments generally want citizens to transact in their local currencies, and stablecoins challenge that sovereignty. Stablecoins are increasingly being integrated into payment platforms, enhancing the efficiency of transactions. Stablecoins are making it possible for businesses to automate payments based on real-world conditions. This is known as “programmable treasury”. More Accessible Loan Products Stablecoins could also unlock new lending and borrowing mechanisms within traditional banking by leveraging the transparency and programmability of blockchain technology. This could create more accessible loan products, collateralized by stablecoins themselves, opening up new markets and customer segments currently underserved by traditional lending practices. Attract capital and increase available liquidity Financial institutions could also offer reserve management services for assets backing stablecoins. This involves managing significant deposits and ensuring issuers meet regulatory obligations for transparency and liquidity. By welcoming stablecoin issuers as depositors, offering competitive and secure deposit solutions, providing them with secure, low-risk returns, banks can unlock new liquidity pools and expand their capital base and increase the amount of available liquidity, expanding their base of long-term, dependable clients.

Financial industry executives cited slow transaction speeds and high fees in traditional banking systems as driving factors for stablecoin adoption. Stablecoins offer unique advantages by combining the stability of assets like fiat currencies with the benefits of blockchain technology. Using stablecoins may bring a number of important advantages including price stability, speed and efficiency, lower costs, global accessibility and programmability, making them attractive to international businesses and supply chains. Unlike cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, their value remains relatively steady because they are tied to the value of more stable assets. This makes stablecoins a safer choice for risk-averse traders and investors who want to explore crypto markets without exposing themselves to drastic price fluctuations. Next to that stablecoins enable near-instant settlement of cross-border transactions. By eliminating intermediaries like correspondent banking, they enable domestic and cross-border payments to settle in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems, while offering 24/7 services. Transaction costs may also dramatically decrease. By lowering the transaction costs often associated with traditional banking intermediaries, stablecoins also make financial services more affordable and accessible to a wider audience. Challenges Despite the enthusiasm and their advantages for traditional financial institutions, stablecoins face a number of challenges related to regulatory compliance, interoperability issues and liquidity risks.. Regulatory fragmentation: unclarity and risks Notwithstanding regulation in the EU and upcoming regulations in the US, stablecoins currently still operate under a patchwork of regulations worldwide, leading to unclarity around compliance, especially concerning reserve requirements and licensing. Notably, recent data from Chainalysis reveals that stablecoins are increasingly favoured in illicit activities such as money laundering and sanctions evasion. This underscores the global implications of stablecoin integration and the need for coordinated regulatory approaches. Lack of interoperability Financial institutions also face operational and credit risks inherent in digital currency management. The real challenge will be in the interoperability between stablecoins and existing financial systems. The existence of stablecoins across multiple blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Polygon) introduces challenges in transaction settlements, requiring interoperability solutions. For businesses to fully adopt stablecoin payments, suppliers must be equipped to receive them, necessitating updates to wallets, regulatory clarity, and accounting systems Other risks And here is the liquidity risk. Stablecoins' influence extends beyond yields. The BIS notes that $40 billion in 2024 Treasury purchases by stablecoins outpaced many foreign investors, illustrating their role as de facto market participants. However, their reserve compositions often lack transparency, leaving investors vulnerable to sudden de-pegging events. Managing these risks requires robust compliance frameworks, security measures, and strict adherence to regulatory requirements, complicating their widespread adoption by traditionally cautious banks. Innitiatives by banks Consortium-backed stablecoin A group of big US banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC, met a few weeks ago in a working group to discuss the prospect of offering stablecoins in a collaborative effort. This initiative to develop a consortium-backed stablecoin aims to streamline routine financial transactions, improve transaction speeds whilst managing competition from encroaching crypto firms and counter the growing influence of crypto-native firms and fintech competitors. The potential introduction of a consortium-backed stablecoin by major banks could significantly impact the competitive landscape for community banks and credit unions. Offering familiar, secure interfaces For corporates, accessing stablecoins still involves a lot of manual steps and unfamiliar tools like wallets. Banks can fill this gap by offering familiar, secure interfaces that integrate stablecoin functionality into their existing online banking and treasury services. This include amongst others: helping clients move between fiat currency and stablecoins (and vice versa), or between different stablecoins, holding stablecoins securely on behalf of their clients, streamlining KYC/AML, source-of-funds checks, and transaction screening for blockchain-based payments and guiding clients on how and when to use stablecoins for payments, treasury management or regional risk hedging. Support from blockchain infrastructure providers Companies like Circle at the forefront of transformation Companies like Circle, the global issuer of USDC are at the forefront of this transformation, offering banks cross-chain clearing and other innovative solutions that could reshape the financial landscape. Increased involvement from the traditional financial industry is further supported by the advent of blockchain infrastructure providers like Zero Hash and Fireblocks, which are offering technology geared towards traditional financial institutions looking to integrate stablecoin capabilities. Stripe, which acquired stablecoin orchestration platform Bridge in February 2025, has added payment capabilities for the company’s USDB stablecoin, which generates yield through backing by BlackRock money market funds. Earlier this month, Stripe announced it is rolling out Stablecoin accounts in 101 countries. Matera and Circle join forces: building bridges in payments In a move to accelerate the adoption of stablecoins as a mainstream payment method, Matera, a leading technology provider for the financial system, announced a commercial partnership with Circle, through its regulated dollar-backed stablecoin USDC. This alliance marks the integration between a real-time banking infrastructure and a fully-reserved, transparent stablecoin, at the forefront of interoperability between local currency balances and digital dollars. This partnership unlocks their use in everyday near-instant payments - secure, fast, and accessible - directly from banking and fintech platforms powered by Matera’s real-time ledger, Digital Twin. The collaboration between Matera and Circle advances the concept of a “stablecoin-ready banking platform” building bridges between traditional and digital money. Criticism: BIS and Lagarde Notwithstanding the growing embrace of stablecoins by traditional financial institutions criticism has come recently from the BIS and ECB president Lagarde. BIS report A new report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cast doubt on the long-term role of stablecoins in the global financial system. The authors acknowledged that stablecoins have some benefits, including programmability, pseudonymity, and ease of use. Their structure also offers faster and cheaper transactions, particularly for cross-border payments. But the BIS concluded that these advantages are outweighed by risks, especially when compared to money issued by central banks and regulated financial institutions, arguing that they fall short of three essential criteria for functioning as true money: singleness, elasticity, and integrity. These are the core traits the BIS says are necessary for any instrument that hopes to support a modern monetary system. ECB president Lagarde In a recent statement ECB president Lagarde told stablecoins are privately issued and pose in particular risks to monetary policy and financial stability. Stablecoins must therefore “be governed by sound rules, especially when operating internationally”. According to Lagarde the underlying problem is precisely the lack of uniform rules. This fragmented approach prevents a global level playing field and can open the door to new risks and systemic vulnerabilities. “We must therefore remain alert to developments in other jurisdictions and support globally aligned regulations for stablecoins.” Lagarde. She therefore plaids for a Dital Euro. Forward looking: Market future and Expectations As we move through 2025, the stablecoin landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Upcoming regulation is expected in other regions worldwide including the UK, Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea) Australia and Japan. As stablecoins continue gaining traction globally, the financial industry anticipates further adoption, spurred by increasing regulatory clarity and growing consumer trust. In 2025, stablecoins are increasingly being integrated into the financial services infrastructure, a first step bridging the gap between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world thereby enhancing business banking services. Banks that respond early can shape how this technology fits within their client offerings. As banks and fintech companies intensify their involvement, the stablecoin market stands on the threshold of significant transformation. The momentum behind stablecoins suggests they will play a significant role in reshaping the future of global financial system. The next step will be the worldwide introduction of Digital Euro’s and Digital dollars.
