We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) stands against the other stocks featured in Jim Cramer's Lightning Round. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a market trend that's been generating impressive gains, especially when investors target heavily shorted stocks. He explained the phenomenon as he said that investors find success by betting that these companies are in better shape than short sellers expect. According to Cramer, this approach has led to some significant wins in recent times. He pointed out the behavior of short sellers, noting that when things go wrong for them, they panic. “The shorts always panic when their trades fall apart because, unlike longs, if you're a short seller, you can lose a lot more than a hundred percent of your investment if the stock goes up too much.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer on Nvidia Plus Other Stocks and Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 7 Stocks Cramer also highlighted that while short sellers can profit when a company fails, it’s a risky game with significant asymmetry. He explained that while a stock’s price can only fall to zero, it has the potential to rise indefinitely. Cramer cautioned that although short sellers might be hoping for a stock’s downfall, they are equally vulnerable to the nightmare scenario of infinite losses if the stock price continues to climb. In such situations, when short sellers run out of options, they are forced to buy back shares, which can send the stock price even higher. For shareholders, this scenario can be advantageous. While short sellers may be a threat when predicting a stock’s decline, their need to buy back shares can act like rocket fuel for the stock’s price when good news emerges. “If you're a shareholder, they're your worst enemy when they're talking about a stock going to zero. But once the stock starts soaring on any good news, the shorts are your best friend because their forced buying is like rocket fuel and they can't stop the propulsion while you just get to go along for the ride.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episodes of Mad Money. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Talking about MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), Cramer remarked: “I've gotta tell you, it's a Bitcoin play. I prefer to actually own Bitcoin. I know that Citron put some sort of short on it. All I can tell you is own Bitcoin. That's a winner.” MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) provides AI-powered enterprise analytics software and services. It is also known for its involvement in Bitcoin development. Recently, it faced a setback in its stock performance after Citron Research announced its decision to bet against the company. According to a post made by Citron on X, the company has transitioned into a Bitcoin investment fund, and its business operations are no longer closely tied to its software offerings. The post criticized the company's increasing focus on Bitcoin investment, stating that the company’s market volume had become detached from Bitcoin's underlying fundamentals. While Citron Research expressed continued confidence in Bitcoin's future, the firm revealed that it had hedged its position with a short position on the stock. On November 22, appearing on CNBC's 'Squawk Box', Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), described the company's approach to generating revenue by focusing on its role as a Bitcoin Treasury company. He explained that the company earns money by selling the volatility of Bitcoin and reinvesting the proceeds back into the cryptocurrency. He said that in addition, the company strips the volatility, risk, and performance from fixed-income securities, transferring those factors to common stocks. Saylor noted that critics who short the stock believe that if the premium on the equity disappears, the company won’t be able to make money. However, he argued that they overlook the strategy where, when borrowing money at 6% and investing it in Bitcoin, the company stands to gain significantly. For example, if Bitcoin appreciates by 30% or even 60%, MicroStrategy could realize a 90% spread on Bitcoin, compared to an 80% spread. Overall MSTR ranks 5th on our list of the stocks featured in Jim Cramer's Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of MSTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Ukrainian woman (50s) arrested for allegedly trespassing former State-provided accommodation

A Ukrainian woman in her 50s who was evicted from State-provided accommodation for failing to pay a daily contribution fee has been arrested and remanded in custody for allegedly trespassing her former accommodation. Tetiana Kiselova was evicted from her accommodation in Dublin city on November 15th after failing to pay the €10 fee before then seeking shelter at a site she had lived in prior, in Blackrock, Co Dublin. At Dún Laoghaire District Court last week, Ms Kiselova was charged with trespassing the building in such a manner that caused or was likely to cause fear in another person. She was remanded in custody until November 25th. Since March, social welfare payments for Ukrainians living in State-provided accommodation were cut from €232 per week to €38.80, with the Blackrock Community Alliance believing the cut has resulted in Ukrainians failing to pay the fee. Ms Kiselova received a letter from the Department of Integration on November 12th advising that access to her room would be revoked and her room reallocated as she refused to pay the fee. She was told she would not receive any further offers of accommodation and would have to make her own arrangements. A spokesman for the Department of Integration said those residing in serviced accommodation are informed that failure to pay is considered a refusal of emergency accommodation. “In relation to the case referred to, following non-payment, the individual was supported to engage with their local Intreo office for financial support if required and provided an additional three weeks in which to make payment,” a spokesman said. “Despite this, the individual refused to pay the contribution.” The mandatory daily contribution fee of €10 was introduced in 2022 for those fleeing the war in Ukraine and applies to serviced accommodation such as hotels and B&Bs where self-catering options are not available. The spokesman said the department does not collate data on the number of accommodation refusals linked to non-payment of the charge. As the accommodation site in Blackrock where Ms Kiselova was found trespassing is no longer under contract with the Department of Integration, it said it could not comment on events following her eviction. The building was under contract until it was ended in October as part of the consolidation of the accommodation portfolio for those fleeing the war in Ukraine. Last month, buses arrived to the property in Blackrock to take 29 Ukrainians to alternative accommodation. The majority of the group, who had been living in the building since arriving to Ireland in 2022, refused to board the buses despite being told they would not receive subsequent offers of accommodation. The 20 Ukrainians who refused to board the buses, including six children attending local schools, have been hosted at the property by the owners while they try to seek a solution, according to Blackrock Community Alliance. However, applications for the accommodation recognition payment were refused this week, while rent supplement applications have also been rejected by the Department of Social Protection. A letter issued to local representatives and general election candidates by Blackrock Community Alliance said: “The owners offered in September to host the group for two months until November 28th, allowing three months to get clarity from the departments on how the group of 20 can be accommodated. This arrangement expires next week. The group is seeking support from local representatives to find solutions to the crisis.” Jack White is a reporter for The Irish Times © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘Housing? I have to admit to being comfortable and it’s not affecting me’: Polarised views in south and west Dublin

As voters do their ‘big shop’ on the final Saturday before going to the polls, concerns in divergent parts of Dublin are notably different. The housing crisis is mentioned in both south county and west Dublin, but it and the cost of living preoccupy more minds in the latter. “Getting our own house is not on the cards at all,” says Anna Raymond outside the main supermarket on Neilstown Road. The area, comprised mainly of local authority housing, is classified by the independent agency Pobal, drawing on Census 2022 data, as “very disadvantaged”. Ms Raymond, shopping with her partner Sean Kearney and their baby Leopold, explains they live with his parents in a three-bedroom council house. “Sean’s brother just moved out so the baby is going to have his own bedroom. The cost of living is so much – food, going out, everything.” The working couple are concerned about “the rise” of the far-right. “We will be voting left anyway. We know Gino Kenny [TD, People Before Profit]. He has been really good in the community for years,” says Ms Raymond. “And Sinn Féin. Mark Ward all the way,” adds Mr Kearney, referring to one of the party’s two TDs and candidates in this Dublin Mid West constituency. Housing, the cost of living and immigration concern Paddy Reilly, a truck driver in his 60s. “It seems the Government are looking after immigrants instead of their own first. I am feeling it and seeing it. “I am on a tight budget. Socialising is out the window. You can’t go out, so you lose out on friends. That is lonely of course. The only time I go out is to go to work. The price of groceries is very high, very. “I would have been Sinn Féin but not now,” he continues. “I am voting for the Irish Freedom Party.” Referencing the party’s candidate, councillor Glen Moore, Mr Reilly says: “He’s speaking for the people. He’s good and people are voting for him.” Rob, in his 40s, did not want to give a surname. He has had to move back in with his parents. “It’s virtually impossible for anyone of my age to get on the housing ladder. I don’t want to live in shared accommodation with strangers. My vote won’t be for any of the big parties. I love Gino [Kenny]. I think he’s great.” For Jacqueline Smith too, housing is the number one issue. Her five sons, the oldest in his 40s, live with her in a three-bedroom council house. “It is stressful. They were born in the area and can’t live in it – can’t get anywhere to rent. The cost of living? Don’t even go there. I’ll vote Sinn Féin. I want to see a change.” Thirty kilometres away in a part of South Dublin classified by Pobal as “affluent”, shoppers in Blackrock shopping centre are concerned with wasteful public spending, a lack of long-term planning and taxes. “The local issue for me is the swimming pool in Stillorgan,” says Bernie Collins, retired insurance worker. “It’s closed ten years and nobody is doing anything about it. Housing? I have to admit to being comfortable and it’s not affecting me. It’s a pity people can’t get on the housing [ladder] but people have to get out and work, get off the dole. Money is handed out too handy, in my opinion.” Scott Graham and Ally Mulrooney, both 21, say “mainly housing” is deciding their votes. “I live at home but eventually I will need to move out,” says Mr Graham. His girlfriend is renting a room in a house near Croke Park for €800 a month. “We don’t even have a sittingroom,” she says. “I have looked at rents,” says Mr Graham. “I couldn’t afford to pay more than €1,000 and there’s nothing. I work part-time. I like the policies of the Social Democrats. I feel like they have a chance, I want a different tack to be taken. Sinn Féin? I think my parents would disown me if I voted for them.” A woman in her 60s who did not give her name said: “I’d like to see a party with a plan instead of smarties being given out in the budget. I’d like to see a vision and I don’t see that.” Brendan Nicholson, in his 60s, is “okay financially”. He wants to see more “strategic thinking” and less “giving away money to buy votes . . . It’s coming back to the time of Bertie [Ahern] when they thought they were flush [with stamp duty returns].” Young couple Ger and Roisín Cronin, expecting a baby, “luckily” own their home. “Across the board things are getting more expensive and there doesn’t seem to be much coming back,” says Mr Cronin. “We get taxed quite a lot, the USC is still there, and we don’t really see much in return.” Gavin O’Leary, from Rathcoole owns a marketing business. He “fortunately” has a house and a mortgage he can sustain. “Our children are young – won’t need housing for a while. I work really hard, don’t get days off, so we have enough. Traditionally we’d be a Fine Gael household,” he continues. A Fianna Fáil candidate who helped with speed bumps on his road, however, will get his vote on Friday.

Title: Ireland hockey star Hannah McLoughlin leaves home comforts behind as she bids to realise her potential in Belgium

Dubliner hopes to reach great heights with lessons from the low countries Hannah McLoughlin poses with Irish team-mates Ellen Curran (right) and Sarah Torrans (left) after Gantoise's won 4-1 win against Waterloo Ducks last week Hannah McLoughlin's spot in the dressing room. Hannah McLoughlin is a Davy ambassador. Davy is proud to support young Irish athletes. In her continuing quest to improve, Ireland international hockey star Hannah McLoughlin upped sticks and moved to the professional hockey outfit Gantoise in Ghent, Belgium this past August. Her decision came off the back of a loss in Olympic qualifiers against Spain in a penalty shoot-out. “I went to answer the question, ‘how good can I be?’” McLoughlin says. She knew the infrastructure was world-class in Belgium having introduced equal pay for male and female players two years ago, which would offer the step up her game required. A massive moment for the centre-back was getting her name on the back of the jersey. “The jersey is mine; it has my name on it. In Ireland, I would get a kit for the season and would be expected to return it if I moved club,” she says. “In Gantoise, I have a permanent locker in the female changing rooms with all my stuff in it and that will be there for the two years that I am contracted to play.” Has homesickness affected McLoughlin? “Well, I’ve never been on a J1 as I chose to play hockey during the summers. I was away for six weeks in Bali two years ago but am an only child and very close to my parents. “I think between my parents they have missed two games in the last 12 years. I thought moving would be tougher, but I am quite an independent person, and I love being in control of my day” she said. The Dubliner began playing when she was 12 years old and was earmarked as a natural talent. Now playing centre-back, her skill is clearly on show but matched in equal part by a quiet professionalism. Belgium made it to the semi-finals of the Olympics this year, losing to China and are currently ranked No 3 in the world. The professional league means McLoughlin’s time is no longer divided between work and sport. After studying economics and finance in UCD she went straight on to the Davy internship and got a flexible working agreement. The centre-back noted balancing work and sport is a challenge Irish players face: “it’s hard to approach an employer when you are playing professionally”. For a 24-year-old it’s daunting to move country but the gains proved too tantalising. Club facilities at Gantoise include meeting rooms, performance rehabilitation on site and a water-based pitch (an international-standard pitch, most pitches in Ireland are not water-based). Hannah McLoughlin's spot in the dressing room. Her new club Gantoise have won the past four league titles, so expectations and standards are high. Part of moving country is acclimatising to the culture you land in, and in this regard the Belgians are very different. According to McLoughlin, “relative to Ireland they are a lot more laid-back”. The young hockey star says they express their feelings in a different manner. “They are incredibly direct, but there is no bad feeling about it.” In Ireland, there is a sense of, “God, if I give feedback to a fellow player, they will get upset with me”, she says. In her new club, McLoughlin is expected to speak up if she has an issue, to hold it in is seen as a negative. A new culture, location and team-mates also has its challenges. She moved in August and says: “I’ve settled in really well”. It is a one hour, 15-minute flight from her local airport to Dublin and having six Irish players on the team has made the transition easier. “The club set me up with a car, accommodation support and a salary, so I can focus solely on the game”. Adjusting to a fully professional set-up may be daunting in terms of workload but increased specialisation has advantages. “I do three trainings a week, one extra technical session, two strength sessions, a video session and maybe one individual mobility session,” she adds. Hannah McLoughlin is a Davy ambassador. Davy is proud to support young Irish athletes. The Blackrock native says that being fully pro means you can be more focused. “I have a lot more time to cook so my nutrition is a lot better.” Being on the pitch with world-class players means intense focus on the finer details, one of which is nutrition. “I am still in contact with the Sport Ireland nutritionist, and I have a lot more time to cook from scratch. In Ireland, I used to meal prep a lot more. When asked where she wants to be in five years, McLoughlin says: “I have been to a World Cup, an Olympics and I play week in, week out with some of the world’s best players. I just want to get better, faster, as these are absolutely necessary when I am called back for international duties.” McLoughlin’s overall sense of Belgians is: “people back their strengths a lot more here. In something as simple as fashion, no two people are wearing the same thing, they [Belgians]are less concerned with how they are being perceived”. Gantoise’s newest signing gives a window into how she spends her downtime. “I would often go out for meals on my own, read a book, I’m less self-conscious here about ‘are people looking at me?’ than in Ireland.” McLoughlin’s goal is clear to build skills and bring them back to the Irish team. She is contracted for Gantoise for the next two years, like Irish football players of old seeking tougher competition in the Premier League. Steel sharpens steel and no doubt this move will enrich Ireland’s hockey future.

The world’s largest digital asset is trading just below $98,000 after falling to a three-day low of $95,800, according to CoinGecko data. The dip sent long liquidations soaring to an 11-day high above $344 million while shorts coughed up around 136 million, CoinGlass data shows. Analysts expect much of the same witnessed over the last two weeks, with demand from retail and institutional investors likely unaffected by intraday swings. “As we continue to see strong demand for Bitcoin alongside further easing of monetary policy by global central banks, prices are likely to remain supported as we approach the end of the year,” QCP Capital wrote in a note last week. Investor sentiment continues to be bolstered by favorable tailwinds stemming from the incoming Donald Trump administration, with the President-elect having vowed to drive a crypto agenda. Wall Street’s top cop, the Securities and Exchange Commission, will also have a change of guard following Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Chair Gary Gensler announced his decision to resign from the post last week after years of backlash from the crypto community for what they termed as a heavy-handed approach to regulation through litigation. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to fire Gensler if elected to the Whitehouse, much to the applaud of a packed crowd during the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville in July. Now, Trump will get to choose a new agency head, which has spurned speculation of an industry-favorable pick, perceived by many to take a lighter touch on digital assets. That optimism has spread to other assets, including XRP, which lept to a three-year high at $1.59 on Friday as speculation grew that the SEC would withdraw its case against the asset's steward, Ripple Labs. There’s also soaring demand for U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, particularly from BlackRock, which continues to top the list among 11 other rivals in inflows and trading volume. Options trading on some of those products are also helping to drive price volatility, analysts previously told Decrypt, with much of the activity focused on further upside in coming months.

(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin steadied after a rally toward $100,000 fizzled just shy of the historic level, as traders assess whether optimism stemming from President-elect Donald Trump’s support for crypto is becoming stretched.

The digital asset fell as low as $96,580 on Monday after coming within $300 of the six-figure milestone on Friday. It was changes hands at around $97,000 as of 9:44 a.m. Monday in New York, as Trump’s pick of hedge fund executive Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary helped sentiment in global markets. Investors are worried Bitcoin “will have to take a breather now that it has basically tested the $100,000 level,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, adding that bullishness around Bitcoin “is getting extreme.” Trump’s incoming US administration is viewed as a crypto tailwind across Wall Street and beyond. The overall value of the digital-asset market has surged about $1 trillion since the Republican’s victory on Nov. 5. Trump’s Agenda Trump has promised friendlier regulations and pledged to set up a national Bitcoin stockpile, though the timeline for implementation and the feasibility of the Bitcoin reserve remain open questions. “I’m seeing an increasing skew to the sell side as we near the $100,000 mark,” said David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime broker FalconX. “This suggests we may experience consolidation around this level in the near term before a sustained breakthrough above it.” Traders had seized on the US crypto outlook to push Bitcoin to the verge of $100,000, a symbolic level that for crypto supporters repudiates skeptics who see little intrinsic value in digital assets. Cantor Talks The latest developments included a Bloomberg News report that Cantor Fitzgerald LP is in talks with Tether Holdings Ltd. about receiving support from the stablecoin issuer for Cantor’s planned lending program for clients who put up Bitcoin as collateral. Cantor’s Chief Executive Officer Howard Lutnick is co-chair of Trump’s transition team and the president-elect’s pick to run the Commerce Department. The transition team has also held discussions over whether to create the first-ever White House post dedicated to digital-asset policy. Cash has poured into US exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin since Trump’s win, and the products have now amassed $107 billion in assets. “Bitcoin was extremely overbought since the election, it was bound to stall out,” said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive officer at crypto investment firm FRNT Financial Inc. “That said, this is barely a pullback, we’re just back at levels from mid-last week.” --With assistance from Sidhartha Shukla.

Title: State Based Bitcoin Reserves Could Help Drive Pro-Crypto Policies Forward

LONDON, ENGLAND - OCTOBER 23: A visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin on ... [+] October 23, 2017 in London, England. Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Lightcoin have seen unprecedented growth in 2017, despite remaining extremely volatile. While digital currencies across the board have divided opinion between financial institutions, and now have a market cap of around 175 Billion USD, the crypto sector coninues to grow, as it sees wider mainstreem adoption. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) Corporate buyers and headlines aside, state-based bitcoin acquisitions could play a critical role in the bitcoin market going forward. As bitcoin continues to flirt with the $100,000 level, the discussion and interest in bitcoin and other cryptoassets continues to increase. Building on the momentum built during the campaign of now President-Elect Trump, the buzz around the possibility of positive changes at the federal level for the bitcoin industry has continued to build both on social media and in policy circles. Specifically politicians such as Senator Lummis have continued to advocate for federal legislation that would – in addition to other actions – enable the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve. In addition to policymakers continuing to discuss these issues, the financial market media has also been covering the idea, with media segments focusing on the potential for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund to purchase bitcoin as its primary asset. On top of these developments the TradFi investment into crypto continues to accelerate. Specifical examples include the approval of spot ETF options issued by Blackrock, following the accelerant provided to adoption and prices following the approval of the spot ETFs in January 2024. With these ETFs attracting nearly $34 billion in assets since launch, surpassing gold, these are not an asset class that can be ignored. Additionally, Microstrategy announced a $1.75 billion bond issuance to purchase more bitcoin (maturing in 2029), while using proceeds from a share sale to purchase $4 billion of bitcoin. All of these activities and fund flows are reason for optimism, but another trend could both send prices higher as well as increasing the legitimacy of the asset for more mainstream investment. Let’s take a look at how the possibility of a state-based bitcoin reserve fund might play an outsized role in the bitcoin market as 2025 approaches. Perhaps the most obvious effect of the positive momentum and conversations (at both the state and federal level) will be the positive effect on the price of bitcoin, and potentially other cryptoassets more broadly. In 2024 alone the price of bitcoin has jumped from approximately $43,000 from the beginning of January to the almost $100,000 level in November, reflecting both the increased buying powered by institutional acquisition as well as the positive sentiment in the space at large. If either the U.S. federal government or state governments begin purchasing bitcoin at any significant level this will only serve to push the price higher. This development is celebratory for investors and long-term holders of bitcoin, to be sure, but also solidifies another reality of the crypto space. Bitcoin increasingly does not, despite the original intent of the cryptocurrency, appear to be forming into the currency of the future in the near to medium term. Especially since the conversation around bitcoin continues to focus on its value as an investment, hedge against inflation, or as a strategic reserve tool, the likelihood of its adoption for currency purposes continues to decrease. Price increases might be celebrated, but increasingly shifts bitcoin to an asset class versus a currency option. The pressure that is being brought to bear at the federal level to construct a pro-crypto regulatory regime, including the establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve, cannot be underestimated as the Trump regime prepares to return to Washington. The crypto sector spent approximately $200 million on the most recent election cycle, and with over 200 members of Congress having received funding and support from these lobbyists the likelihood of a pro-crypto Congress is relatively high. In addition to this President-Elect Trump, while on the campaign trail, made substantial overtures and promises to the industry to support and foster innovation and growth in the United States. While individuals such as Senator Lummis continuing to pursue policy objectives such as The BITCOIN Act, which would facilitate the creation of a reserve, and discussion of a strategic bitcoin reserve continuing to grow; advisors and policy wonks would be well served to watch these conversations as they develop. Positive momentum aside, politicizing crypto – which establishing a strategic reserve at the federal level would – also opens the door to crypto being yet another political football for policymakers to debate over moving forward. This could include tweaks and changes to the tax code that become subject to the whims of the executive branch, versus IRS section updates. While the likelihood of federal action might seem virtually guaranteed to crypto proponents the reality is that the crypto sector and investing community still remains small versus TradFi markets. This is both an acknowledgement of the still emerging and developing status of crypto markets and assets, as well as providing an insight into opportunities at the state level for crypto policy leadership. For example, Wyoming is in the midst of minting and issuing the first state-backed stable token in the form WYST. When viewed in conjunction with efforts underway in states like Pennsylvania to create strategic bitcoin reserves on the state level, it looks increasingly likely that crypto policy leadership might emerge from the states alongside – or perhaps before – policy at the federal level.

Posted on 11/24/2024 12:30:04 PM PST by McGruff The Kremlin is allegedly ready to discuss a ceasefire, Reuters reports, citing current and former representatives of the Russian government. According to a secret document of the Russian MOD, the Kremlin intends to divide Ukraine into three parts. 🔺The East of the country (Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson regions), as well as Crimea, should go to Russia. 🔺The second large part of the country (including the regions of Kiev, Sumy and Odessa) is planned to be turned into a "pro-Russian state entity." The power structures in this zone will be staffed with pro-Russian personnel, and Russian troops will be stationed on its territory to provide security. This means that "Ukraine will turn into a puppet state controlled from Moscow." 🔺The rest of the western part of Ukraine is called “disputed territories” in the document. What to do with them is supposed to be decided in the course of negotiations between Russia and neighboring countries — Hungary, Poland and Romania. (Excerpt) Read more at x.com ...

The power structures in this zone will be staffed with pro-Russian personnel, and Russian troops will be stationed on its territory to provide security. This means that "Ukraine will turn into a puppet state controlled from Moscow." 🔺The rest of the western part of Ukraine is called “disputed territories” in the document.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI News Updates You Can’t Miss This Weekend. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against other AI news updates you can’t miss this weekend. The race to get ahead in artificial intelligence is compelling companies to intensify their efforts each day. In latest news, ChatGPT creator OpenAI has been considering developing its own web browser, according to a report by The Information. The report reveals that the company has spoken about the product with websites such as Redfin, Conde Nast, Priceline, and Eventbrite. Having already entered the market with SearchGPT, the move would be placing OpenAI head-to-head with Google, the company that holds the major share of the browser and search market. READ ALSO: 10 AI News Stories You Can’t Miss and 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now However, the company isn’t just delving into search and browsers. According to Tech Crunch, OpenAI is also researching algorithms that can predict human being’s moral judgments. OpenAI gave a grant to Duke University researchers for a project called “Research AI Morality.” When asked for more details, an OpenAI spokesperson referred to a press release stating that the grant is part of a larger $1 million, three-year funding effort for Duke Professors working on creating “moral AI.” As per the press release, the OpenAI-funded project aims to develop algorithms capable of “predicting human moral judgments” when moral conflicts arise in fields like medicine, law, and business. However, it isn’t clear yet whether such kind of an achievement is possible with the current levels of technology. In other news, AI firm Anthropic is getting another funding boost. Amazon is increasing its investment in Anthropic to $8 billion, strengthening its partnership in artificial intelligence, the companies announced Friday, the 22nd. “We’ll keep pushing the boundaries of what customers can achieve with generative AI technologies.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). lassedesignen/Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89 GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) is a global energy company and a soaring AI stock driven by the demand for energy to power artificial intelligence technology. On November 21, Wells Fargo analyst Michael Blum initiated coverage of the power-generation technology company with an “Overweight” rating and a $385 price target. This is the second-highest price target listed by FactSet, as reported by Barrons. According to Blum, GE Vernova can help meet the massive energy demands from artificial intelligence through its power generation and grid products. Blum further states that GE Vernova’s transformers, HVDC, and grid software offerings are well-positioned to benefit from growing power demand. “As power demand grows and more distributed generation is added to the mix, aging grids will require significant investment to manage the increasingly complex and dynamic environment,” Blum said. “GEV’s transformers, HVDC [High-voltage direct current], and grid software offerings are well positioned to benefit from this growing demand”. Overall, GEV ranks 2nd on our list of AI news updates you can’t miss this weekend. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

PEPE stands out from the crowd with its no-tax policy and a refreshingly honest approach, avoiding the pretense of utility that many other coins adopt. It’s all about diving headfirst into the meme culture. During the months of April and May 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge in value, achieving a remarkable market capitalization of $1.6 billion. Initial investors saw their fortunes skyrocket in an instant, sparking a fervent community that rallied around the project. This surge ignited a “memecoin season,” leading to numerous new meme-based coins undergoing dramatic price fluctuations. With its promising potential, PEPE is set to compete with the leading meme coins such as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. The straightforward strategy and clear roadmap resonate with a wide audience. The strategy encompasses securing listings on prominent exchanges and launching a “meme takeover.” As the market buzzes with anticipation for the upcoming Bitcoin halving and the potential for a bullish surge, PEPE is poised to capture the spotlight. Despite its limited utility compared to other cryptocurrencies, the robust community backing it and its viral appeal could ensure it remains a focal point in the digital landscape. Only time will reveal whether PEPE will soar to new peaks or if the excitement will dwindle. Envision a realm where you wield total authority over your data.

However, the investment firm also addressed regulatory and geopolitical challenges that were hampering growth. Per the analysts at the firm, the rise and advancements in AI also added strains to the geopolitical map.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) are leaders of digital innovation that have created massive shareholder wealth over the past decade. Through distinct strategies and different areas of market focus, the core business for both tech giants is centered on online advertising. Let's discuss whether Alphabet or Meta Platforms is the better buy right now. The Observer made a profit of more than £3m last year, according to internal figures which raise questions over claims it must be offloaded to protect The Guardian. After flying high during the first half of the year, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has lost some momentum; the company's shares are down by 11% since June 1. Millennium Management's stake in Eli Lilly increased by 86% in the third quarter. Should you follow Englander's lead and increase your stake (or initiate a position) in Eli Lilly? The market rally is hot, but keep a cool head. Nvidia is the giant, but Astera Labs is the new AI chip leader. The hedge fund manager takes a piece of a popular consumer brand.

On the surface, Boeing (NYSE: BA) looks as though it has all the ingredients of a potential millionaire-maker investment. The aircraft market is growing, competition is minimal, and government contracts are plentiful.

Title: Morgan Stanley joins US peers putting Mideast HQ in Riyadh

Morgan Stanley got regulatory approval to locate its Middle East headquarters in Saudi Arabia, joining Wall Street rivals including Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in expanding their presence in the kingdom. “Establishing a regional HQ in Riyadh reflects the growth and development of Saudi Arabia and is a natural progression of our long history in the region,” said Abdulaziz Alajaji, the chief executive officer for Saudi Arabia and the bank’s co-head of the Middle East and North Africa region said in a statement on Sunday. Under new rules that came into force this year, firms must have a regional base in Saudi Arabia with at least 15 employees, including executives overseeing other countries, or risk losing business with the kingdom’s vast network of government entities. The move is part of a plan by the Saudi government to cut down on what it calls “economic leakage,” a term it uses for state spending that can benefit firms in neighboring business hubs, most prominently Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Morgan Stanley has been present in Saudi Arabia since 2007, when it set up an equity trading business in Riyadh, and became one of the first international asset managers to launch a Saudi equity fund two years later. CEO Ted Pick was among a host of executives and investors to speak at Saudi Arabia’s flagship Future Investment Initiative last month. In recent months, BlackRock Inc. and Lazard Inc. have joined the ranks of firms granted HQ licenses in the kingdom, while State Street Corp has said it will apply for one. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Why photographers should understand bitcoin

Time Published: 2024-11-24T14:36:51Z

Do you remember Kodak brownies and the light? Obviously digital photograph absolutely crushed Kodak, even though ironically Kodak I think made the first digital camera? Also, the very foolish and shortsighted thing that conducted; she almost self sabotage herself by kind of trying to kill off her own digital camera, concerned that we would eat into the profits of her film business. A similar insight; Steve Jobs, upon unleashing the iPhone, obviously he knew that it was going to eat into the iPod iPod touch market, but obviously it was the right step forward. This is a book that apparently Steve Jobs recommended everyone to read. The general idea is that the paradox and difficulty that innovator’s face is that in order to innovate something new, you kind of need to kill your own business, even have the courage to self cannibalize if necessary. So for example, I think Ford has done a decent job at this semi trying to get into the electric car market, instead of just hoarding her gas guzzler cars. But the difficulty of a Ford or any other car company is that because they did not start off 100% carte blanche electric, they’re never going to catch up to Tesla, Do you remember in the early days of Tesla, in which the evaluation was far greater than that of any major car company and everyone thought that it was insanely overvalued? Who is laughing now? So a book that nobody knows about is the mobile wave by Michael Saylor; in which he accurately predicts that mobile phones, mobile technology, all the big magnificent seven companies to take over the world. He predicted the success of Amazon Facebook Twitter Google and Apple before anyone really took notice. In fact I recommend everyone to read them all way, because it shows the inside that Michael Saylor is not new to the game; he’s been in the game for a long time, over 30 years. Apparently he has seen his stock drop to an ALL TIME LOW of $.20, And now it is currently in the mid 400s. So I guess I was right all along about bitcoin, ever since I bought like 2.2 bitcoins or 2.4 bitcoins for about 20,000 or $25,000, back in 2018 when bitcoin was only around $6000-$7000 a coin. ￼ sing that we’re about to have the hundred K party, I’ve almost I guess like 12 or 13 X ‘d my initial prediction? Anyways, if you’re right about bitcoin and was right about bitcoin… And no no no bitcoin is not gonna drop down to like 60,000 or 30,000, that does not how engineering works. For people who think that bitcoin is risky, ask people… Is it risky to cross the bridge or go on a flight? No. Why? Things were engineered that way! With bitcoin, you’re not gonna have all these people who you’re trying to proselytize turn around and tell you that you were right, and shower you with good news. No no no, they might either feel low-key envious or jealous of you, and won’t probably really say much. This is also why I don’t really tell people about bitcoin too much if they don’t seem like they have a strong need for it; for example my uncle who’s worked in the jewelry business for like over 30 years, he wants to retire, and I’m kind of in the process of helping him Sell his gold and his other reserves and stuff, in order to buy bitcoin. Even he at the age of 64, being a gold jeweler for like over 30 years know that bitcoin is the future. But his issues that he cannot stomach the volatility, he says it is like drugs, “mah-yyak”– when I was with him last I just set him up with Coinbase, and just bought the daily maximum for his account which was $3500, I think we bought windows around $65,000 a coin, and already it’s like $99,000 a coin. But once again, I think the difficult thing with bitcoin is that like is probably the most addictive crack cocaine on the planet, because it is being traded 24 7, it is extremely volatile because volatility is vitality. Anything that is allowed to trade every single waking moment, on weekends as well as the evenings, and also bank holidays, is going to have more volatility because people are just bored at home, they cannot play the traditional market so they’re going to just try to buy and sell bitcoin, do some sort of weird options trading to try to squeeze a few bucks here and there.￼ I was randomly think about Peter Thiel and his zero to one book; I think if you thought about bitcoin like a year or two ago, you might’ve seen that are artificial intelligence in AI was the right bet. But no, it is most certainly bitcoin. Why? Assuming that the world runs on money, and bitcoin is perfect money, it is like maybe 80 to 90% the solution to the problems of humanity. For example, what are the greatest bad things that happened to humans? It mostly has to deal with financial distress. I almost wonder people who get addicted to gambling, drugs, cycles of poverty is because the money right now the fiat currency is toxic. You cannot blame somebody for remaining sick if they only have a sewer water to drink, and they have kids and are also forced to feed their kids sewer water. It doesn’t matter how smart hard-working or intelligent you are, as long as you’re drinking sore water, you’re going to perpetually be sick, throwing up, permanently infected with cholera. So you know you have all these Crusades on the Internet and charity is talking about providing clean water to like poor kids in Africa? I think the same thing with bitcoin– it is like the chance to give clean water to 8 billion people on the planet. Except instead of water, it is clean money. Nontoxic money. It matters if you’re at church a nonprofit a charity, mother Teresa Gandhi etc. Matters if you’re at school, a parent organization, if you have kids you’re single own a dog whatever. Ultimately you’re going to have to pay the rent, pay your mortgage, or pay property taxes. I don’t think there is anyone spot on the planet in which you cannot live or survive without money a banking account or Notes. Even all these weirdos who try to buy a $200,000 AMG sprinter van and live off the grid with star Link or whatever, you still need money, and sooner or later you’re going to have to need some sort of semi permanent address, ideally your mom‘s house or your wife’s family‘s house or something. Because for the most part if you’re American, at this point you cannot really survive without having a single address for doing taxes and stuff. And I also think that now, unfortunately you also need a cell phone number, or else you cannot even apply for basic stuff, because you’re going to have to get the one time password authentication code codes texted to your phone. Anyways, it’s gonna be a big deal once Apple integrate bitcoin into her iCloud ecosystem. This is actually a very very big opportunity for Apple; the head of security, on the planet and privacy… If Apple were able to provide security to your bitcoin or your keys or whatever, Wooden apple being in some way is the best custodian? Even better yet… We already have our bank of counseling to Apple Pay. Wouldn’t it just makes sense for you to buy bitcoin directly on an iPhone using Apple Pay, and store it on your iPhone and or iCloud Apple ID account? For people who don’t trust the cloud I get it, but still… For all practical purposes I think the cloud is like 1 trillion times safer than cold storage options. For example even me, all my photos are backed up to dropbox, Google Drive and Apple photos. Even worst case scenario all my photos get deleted, it’s OK I could start again! I think especially with Apple Apple ID Face ID touch print thumb ID, it’s almost the most logical way to feel secure with your bitcoin. Larry Fink, CEO Blackrock, even Michael Saylor. ￼ even Donald Trump!￼ When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: Kraft Heinz (KHC): Navigating Challenges and Strategic Shifts in Warren Buffett’s Portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Warren Buffett’s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) stands against other Warren Buffett’s longest-held stocks. Warren Buffett has cemented his legacy as Wall Street’s most successful investor. During the high-flying stock market of the 1960s, he leveraged his investment partnership to acquire Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling New England textile company at the time. Today, the firm is a vastly different entity, boasting a diverse range of businesses from Geico insurance to BNSF Railway, an equity portfolio exceeding $266 billion, and an enormous cash reserve of $325.2 billion. Decades of strong returns have built Buffett’s unmatched track record. Since he took over in 1965, the company’s shares have delivered an annualized gain of 19.8%. Buffett has famously stated that his ideal holding period for a stock is “forever”. True to his word, the Oracle of Omaha has held onto some of his favorite stocks for the long haul, allowing them to deliver steady share performance and generate passive income for his portfolio over time. Moreover, market analysts and investors alike have consistently praised Buffett’s disciplined, long-term approach to investing, more so now that his firm has become the latest non-tech firm to surpass a $1 trillion market cap, highlighting Buffett’s stock-picking abilities. However, despite strong market performance through much of 2024, Buffett seems to have adopted a more defensive stance. Concerned about inflated valuations amid high interest rates and worsening economic conditions, he has offloaded significant holdings in companies whose valuations have surged too high. Billionaire investor David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital echoed this in his hedge fund’s quarterly letter, noting Buffett’s cautious approach: “One could argue that sitting out bear markets has been the underappreciated reason for his outstanding long-term returns. It is therefore noteworthy to observe that Mr. Buffett is again selling large swaths of his stock portfolio and building enormous cash reserves.” Over the past two years, Buffett has been an active net seller of stocks. His firm offloaded a total of $36.1 billion in stocks during the third quarter, marking the eighth consecutive quarter in which Berkshire was a net seller of equities. At the company’s annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett mentioned the possibility of a future rise in the corporate tax rate. Moreover, in his 2023 letter, Buffett also addresses common questions about Berkshire, including whether the company can continue to achieve the same level of outperformance as in the past: “There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can value; some we can’t. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U.S., there are essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance. Nevertheless, managing Berkshire is mostly fun and always interesting. On the positive side, after 59 years of assemblage, the company now owns either a portion or 100% of various businesses that, on a weighted basis, have somewhat better prospects than exist at most large American companies.” Our Methodology To create our list of Warren Buffett’s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A closeup of an assembly line worker inspecting a newly produced jar of condiments and sauces. Warren Buffett’s First Major Purchase: 2015 Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Q3 2024: $11.43 billion The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), a global food and beverage leader formed by the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods and Heinz, produces a wide range of products including condiments, dairy, meat, beverages, and other grocery items. On October 25, Stifel analysts downgraded The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) from Buy to Hold, pointing to sluggish volume recovery and increased reinvestment needs. Stifel also voiced caution about the overall food sector, keeping a Neutral weighting despite food stocks trading at a significant 30% discount to the S&P 500, putting the sector in the 6th relative percentile. Additionally, in its Q3 2024 earnings report, The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) revealed a larger-than-expected quarterly revenue decline, with net sales down 2.8% to $6.38 billion. The company also revised its 2024 earnings per share outlook to the lower end of its prior $3.01–$3.07 range. A Deutsche Bank report indicates that The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) may need to make deeper capability improvements to achieve its long-term financial goals, underscoring the challenges and operational complexities the company faces on its growth path. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) has also strategically sold off its underperforming brands to raise capital, acquired brands with stronger growth potential, and strengthened its traditional brands through product innovation and marketing efforts. This approach also helped the company navigate inflationary pressures in 2022 and 2023 by gradually increasing its prices. Overall, KHC ranks 8th on our list of Warren Buffett’s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of KHC, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KHC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A close-up view of an engineer deploying a new piece of internet infrastructure. Warren Buffett’s First Major Purchase: 2012 Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Q3 2024: $2.43 billion VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN), based in Reston, Virginia, is a global provider of network infrastructure and domain name registry services, acting as the exclusive registry for the .com and .net domains. It also serves as one of the tech-sector stocks in Warren Buffett’s diversified portfolio. In its Q3 2024 earnings call, VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) reported a 3.8% year-over-year revenue increase to $391 million. Despite this growth, the company saw a dip in its total domain name base and forecasted lower renewal rates. On the other hand, earnings per share rose by 13.1% to $2.07, and the company announced plans to launch new marketing programs aimed at boosting growth in its domain name base. VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) is also in discussions with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) about .com domain pricing and the overall ecosystem health, while preparing for the renewal of the .com registry and the introduction of the new Top-Level Domain (TLD) .web. Baron Asset Fund stated the following regarding VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN), a global provider of internet infrastructure and domain name registry services, manages the .com and .net domains. Shares of VeriSign declined because of continued weakness in new domain registrations, stemming largely from weaker demand in China. We believe that VeriSign maintains an exceptional competitive position and the contractual ability to raise prices. Longer term, we are encouraged by VeriSign’s opportunity to win the rights to administer the “.web” domain, produce substantial free cash flow, and generate attractive capital returns as it continues to prioritize share buybacks. Overall, VRSN ranks 7th on our list of Warren Buffett’s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of VRSN, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VRSN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks on the list. With the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least. Naturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled ‘Global Strategy Paper No. 71, the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This ‘concentration’ refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence. Since the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street’s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos’ eCommerce company, and the world’s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns. As per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index “by an annualized 200 bp-800 bp” over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today’s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang’s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade. GS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market’s performance of the two indexes before the bubble’s ‘pop’ to point out that “the trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).” This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall “has been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.” Linking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this “extreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.” Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then “this would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.” While stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk’s car company record stunning gains. Goldman’s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that “the biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.” He shared that “any sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.” These include “energy, traditional energy versus renewables” with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%. Tuteja added that “the resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election” was a standout from the market’s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that “what I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.” This is because “it takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.” According to him, in 2016, “regional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.” Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that “under the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime’s policies.” For some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now. Within this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024’s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings “growth alone can explain 40% of next quarter’s cash spending growth.” Just like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the “typical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.” Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects “cash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,” but cautions that “the potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ top growth investment stocks, we used the bank’s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm’s cash flow from operations. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A financial analyst in their office, monitoring the daily performance of the stock market. Growth Investment Ratio: 92% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor designer that designs and sells CPUs and GPUs. Its products are used by consumers and businesses. In today’s AI era, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the few companies capable of offering both CPUs and GPUs for AI computing. This places it well to capitalize on any cost constraints that NVIDIA’s GPU customers might face or for firms looking to switch away from Intel’s CPUs. Yet, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s limited resources also mean that the firm struggles to compete at scale with its larger rivals. As a result, it is the perpetual underdog in an industry where high volumes often determine brand and pricing power. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s third-quarter results led to the firm’s Gaming business seeing a strong 90%+ operating income drop, and soon afterward, the firm announced that it would lay off 4% of its workforce. Sustained revenue from AI customers is key to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s hypothesis. During the Q3 2024 earnings call, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s management commented on its AI business: “Turning to our Data Center AI business, Data Center GPU revenue ramped as MI300X adoption expanded with cloud, OEM and AI customers. Microsoft and Meta expanded their use of MI 300X accelerators to power their internal workloads in the quarter. Microsoft is now using MI 300X broadly for multiple co-pilot services powered by the family of GPT 4 models. Overall, AMD ranks 22nd on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Mizuho Raises NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Price Target to $175, Reaffirms Outperform Rating Amid Strong AI Market Leadership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. Data centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe’s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 21, Mizuho raised the price target on the stock to $175 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after the company reported a strong October-end quarter sales result of $35.1 billion and guided January-end quarter revenue to $37.5 billion, which the advisory notes was in line with consensus at $37 billion, but below buy-side estimates of $39 billion-plus. The advisory, which says Nvidia remains a Mizuho 2024 Top Pick and is leading the AI accelerator market, recommends investors buy the pullback. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Merkel's former nemisis aims to become Germany's chancellor
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/cdu-friedrich-merz-angela-merkel-rival-german-election-2025-chancellor-v2/a-70845544

Friedrich Merz, an erstwhile rival of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been a beacon of hope for the conservative CDU party. He now wants to unseat Chancellor Olaf Scholz and take over as Germany's leader. Friedrich Merz has a good chance of becoming Germany's next chancellor. As the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union party (CDU) and the conservative parliamentary group that includes Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), he will be the bloc's top candidate, taking on the Social Democrats (SPD) in the February 23 general election. Though Merz has never held government office, opinion polls suggest that he is the favorite in the race. At the age of 69, Merz would become the oldest person to take office as Germany's head of government since Konrad Adenauer, who was 73 years old when he was sworn in as the first chancellor of the Federal Republic in 1949. Merz has had two political lives: one before Angela Merkel came to power as chancellor in 2005 and the second after she exited in 2021. He had slowly withdrawn from politics after Merkel's initial election as German chancellor. Merkel, who is often referred to as Merz's "nemesis," was a pragmatist and moderate who did not see eye to eye with the staunch conservative Friedrich Merz. He then took a break from politics in 2009, returning to the Bundestag only in 2021 after Merkel had retired. Merz hails from the rural Sauerland area of Germany's most-populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia. He is a wealthy corporate lawyer, a father of three and a Catholic. He started his political career as amember of the European Parliament for the CDU in 1989, at the age of 33. Five years later, in 1994, he switched to the German lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag, where his sharp oratory skills drew attention. He became an influential member of the conservative parliamentary group (CDU/CSU). Merz's withdrawal from politics dovetailed with successes in the private sector: From 2005 to 2021, he was a member of the international law firm Mayer Brown LLP and held top positions on supervisory and administrative boards. From 2016 to 2020, Merz was chairman of the supervisory board of the German arm of Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager. In 2022, on Merz's third attempt at the post, the CDU elected him as party leader. Merz had a reputation as an economically liberal representative of the conservative CDU wing. In 2008 he wrote a book entitled "Mehr Kapitalismus wagen" (Dare More Capitalism) championing a liberal economic policy, slashing bureaucracy, reducing social benefits and cutting taxes for companies. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video In the 1990s, Merz was in the minority even in the conservative CDU when he voted against liberalizing the abortion law and against preimplantation genetic diagnostics in the Bundestag. When parliament passed a bill to criminalize marital rape like any other rape in 1997, Merz voted against it. Merz has always been a supporter of nuclear energy and has expressed doubts over renewable energy sources such as "ugly" wind turbines. He drew flak in 2022 for flying his private jet to attend Finance Minister Christian Lindner's wedding on the island of Sylt at a time of rising energy prices caused by Russia's war on Ukraine. Merz has also been accused of pandering to the far right with denigrating remarks about refugees. On a TV talk show, he said female school teachers in Germany were experiencing a lack of respect from what he called "little pashas," apparently referring to sons of Muslim parents. That remark came only weeks after Merz referred to some displaced Ukrainians as "welfare tourists" — claiming that many of them had come to Germany seeking safety, only to then travel back and forth between both countries once they have secured social benefits. Merz later offered an apology of sorts: "I regret using the word 'welfare tourism.' It was an inaccurate description of a problem observed in individual cases." Merz previously complained about "problems with foreigners" and insisted on a German "Leitkultur" (dominant culture), a term dating back to the 1990s that many argue is a call for compulsory assimilation. He represents a CDU that has become more conservative, although he has stated his refusal to cooperate with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Shortly after Germany's center-left government collapsed on November 6, 2024, Merz stated in clear terms that the years of Scholz's coalition were now history, arguing that this had been a long time coming. Merz is hoping that he and the CDU/CSU will replace Olaf Scholz and his minority government with the Greens following the February 23 election. It remains to be seen which coalition partners he would choose to form a new government. This article was originally written in German.

Title: Balmoral shows ‘small’ investors the door

The Irish Stock Exchange, or Euronext Dublin as it is now known, spends a lot of time and lobbying muscle telling the Government it needs support to help make the stock market more attractive to small investors who traditionally are more likely to leave their savings on deposit than in shares. Balmoral International Land delisted from the exchange more than a decade ago, but given how the company has effectively moved to force small investors off its share register, it begs the question why the so-called “little guy” would want to invest in shares in general. At a gathering in Arthur Cox’s office this week some of Irish commerce’s blue bloods told thousands of small shareholders they were no longer welcome as investors in the listed business. The McCann family owns a majority stake in Balmoral International Land, formerly Blackrock International Land, the property business spun out of one of their previously listed businesses – fruit importer and distributor Fyffes. On Thursday, at a fractious extraordinary general meeting whose outcome was decided well in advance given the weight of shareholdings, company chairman Carl McCann forced through a motion taking the company fully private and, in the process, forcibly buying out “small” shareholders – those with fewer than 25,000 shares in the business, a group that owned more than a fifth of the business before Thursday, at €10.50 a share. Small is relative in McCann’s world. These ousted shareholders would have had holdings worth up to just shy of €262,500 at the takeout price which is hardly small change. The company argues that most had holdings of 500 or fewer shares but that’s still an investment of up to €5,250. Others, including AIB and PTSB, have offered similar buyouts of small investors but they have included an opt-out clause for anyone who was interested in sticking with their investment. The McCanns and their advisers tried to persuade the shareholders being ejected that they were doing them a favour but a vocal group of shareholders – almost all investors of many years’ standing – was not buying it. Why, they wanted to know, were they being forced out just as the business had returned to health and started making money from its property investments. And, more particularly, why at a substantial discount to the €18.72 net asset value of the portfolio and the €12 price at which a deal for shares was done on the grey market just the previous week.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. Data centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity.

(NASDAQ:GFS) stands against other AI news you should pay attention to. AI themes have dominated stock markets around the world over the past few months. Investment titan Blackrock recently released an investor note on the subject, stressing that as the new year unfolds, AI advancements and diplomatic developments will continue to shape the top market trends. In the note, Jay Jacobs, the US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs at the firm, stated that these two themes stayed in the limelight for virtually all of 2024 and are likely to remain in primary focus for 2025. The note further detailed that 2025 could be a pivotal year for technological progress and adoption in AI tech, as GenAI advances and more sophisticated models were combining to drive meaningful growth in AI capabilities.

However, the investment firm also addressed regulatory and geopolitical challenges that were hampering growth. Per the analysts at the firm, the rise and advancements in AI also added strains to the geopolitical map.

(Bloomberg) -- Asset managers with money to spend and few new deals to buy have pushed credit spreads to near all-time tights as the global economy remains strong. That’s a signal for some that it’s time to buy downside protection. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes Record NYC Thanksgiving Travel Signals Airport, Traffic Mess Corporate bond shorts have risen 25% to almost $336 billion in the past year compared with a rise of 10.6% in institutional longs to $4.6 trillion, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Wagers that prices will fall now stand at the equivalent of 7.3% of longs, up from 6.4% a year ago, based on securities borrowing. The rise in shorts comes as a gauge of complacency reaches the highest level since 2021, the amount of distressed debt falls to the lowest this year and US economic growth continues to confound skeptics. But expectations that incoming President Donald Trump’s policies on tariffs and immigration will boost inflation worry economists, leading some fund overseers to hedge their bets. “Large inflows into high-yield bond funds in the US and Europe are causing spreads to grind tighter. If valuations are screening extremely tight, shorting bonds can be highly profitable and hedge funds running quantitative strategies will use all these valuation metrics,” said Zachary Swabe, a high-yield portfolio manager at UBS Asset Management. Any “deterioration in the macro outlook will also give funds a fair reason to short securities,” he said. There are reasons for concern. US fiscal policy is on an “unsustainable path,” according to economists at Apollo Global Management, S&P 500 earnings misses are on the increase and funding costs in overnight repo markets are rising at a concerning rate. Adding to the woes, Germany’s economy has been moribund and China has yet to see a broader pickup in growth after a wave of stimulus. Click here for a podcast on rescue financing with Oaktree Capital Management Despite the warning signs, spreads in US junk bonds now stand about 30 basis points above their all-time lows, set before the global financial crisis. And while risk premiums in Europe have further to go until they reach rock bottom, they have fallen well below their historical average. Hedging Strategy Investors may also be shorting corporate credit as part of a broader hedging strategy to offset long positions in equities or other assets that may be sensitive to debt conditions, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence director Matthew Chessum. Market makers at banks are also borrowing bonds to sell to asset managers who are trying to put new money to work, leaving dealers effectively short until they can actually buy the debt, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. If they didn’t do so, banks would have been unable to tackle large buy orders by funds in recent months as bank inventories have shrunk due to post-crisis regulations, the people said, asking not to be identified as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly. Still, hesitancy about the state of the market can also be seen beyond the short data. Credit-default swap indexes covering a basket of junk-rated companies in Europe and North America have not tightened as much as the spreads of bonds they insure against. Shorting the securities will pay off if the economic picture suddenly darkens. Credit strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. told clients recently that “we are potentially on the precipice of a global trade war with spreads already at tight levels.” Morgan Stanley strategists, meanwhile, warned this past week that the performance of corporate credit is set to weaken in the second half of next year as “animal spirits” grow and “take hold.” Week in Review Companies are rushing to sell bonds and loans before markets slow down around Thanksgiving and the December holidays. US high-grade corporate bond sales climbed to the second-highest level on record. Nearly $185 billion of US collateralized loan obligations have been issued this year, setting an annual issuance record for the third time since 2018. A unit of Adani Group scrapped a $600 million green bond sale after US prosecutors charged founder Gautam Adani with participating in an alleged bribe plot. Adani’s bonds and shares dropped. Adani Group said the allegations are baseless, and that it would seek all possible legal recourse to defend itself. Some of Wall Street’s biggest banks are teaming up with BlackRock Inc.’s Aladdin technology system to provide real-time pricing data for trading US corporate bonds. Barings LLC priced Europe’s first collateralized loan obligation backed by a pool of private credit debt. Spirit Airlines Inc. filed for bankruptcy with a plan to hand over control to bondholders after failing to agree on a merger with rivals. R.R. Donnelley and Sons Co. is back in the junk-bond market with a deal that could pay up to a 12% coupon thanks to a rare feature that allows the firm to choose how it pays interest. Blackstone Inc. is considering tapping the securitized debt market to help finance its acquisition of a majority stake in Jersey Mike’s. Ares Management Corp. is exploring partnerships with other financial institutions, following its recent tie-up with Investec Bank Plc, to expand its offering in the fund finance market. The anything AI frenzy helped AppLovin Corp., a company shunned by Silicon Valley’s money a decade ago, take on a $3.5 billion blue-chip sale that saw demand eight times that much. Citigroup Inc and Banco Santander SA are readying an up to €4 billion ($4.2 billion) debt package to back a potential sale of Spanish waste-management company Urbaser SA. US banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. are asking investors to disclose whether they plan to use additional debt to invest in significant risk transfers as regulators scrutinize them for threats to financial stability. EQT AB’s Dechra Pharmaceuticals Ltd. is seeking to ditch its private credit debt for new broadly syndicated loans. Apollo Global Management is leading a roughly £500 million ($631 million) private credit loan to back Cinven’s purchase of Grant Thornton’s UK business. Medical Properties Trust Inc. has moved to take control of three Southern California health care entities after accusing the owner — Prospect Medical Holdings — of defaulting on debt. Healthcare software company FinThrive’s debt refinancing announced this week includes below-par exchanges and sweeter terms for creditors who crafted the deal. On the Move Bank of Nova Scotia hired Brian Lehman from Generate Capital as the second of two co-heads of its US capital-markets operations. The bank said last month that Nicole Frew, previously the lender’s chief compliance officer, would be the other US co-head. John Cho has been appointed the leader of private capital at KPMG Canada LLP, a new role the company has created to expand its presence in the fast-growing area. Cho was also named head of deal advisory for the Americas. Alberta’s government named former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper to lead the board of its public pension fund manager, less than two weeks after firing its chief executive officer and every director. --With assistance from Abhinav Ramnarayan and Dan Wilchins.

Title: Andy Farrell praises Ireland’s young guns for stepping up in Fiji win

Andy Farrell cut a contented figure after Ireland’s commanding 52-17 win over Fiji. He took particularly pleasure in making it a notable day for the debutants, Gus McCarthy and Cormac Izuchukwu, as well as Sam Prendergast in his first Test start, on a day when opportunity knocked for so many. But the sight of Jacob Stockdale pulling up with a hamstring injury, as well as Jamie Osborne departing due to an adductor injury, somewhat tarnished the day. “[Stockdale] pulled up sharp with a hamstring so obviously we’ll see how that is tomorrow. But he pulled up quite sharp, so I was gutted for him,” said the Ireland head coach. He added Osborne was unable to carry on, “so that doesn’t look bright at the minute.” The only blemish on Izuchukwu’s day in becoming the first Irish men’s 15-a-side international from Co Offaly was having a try ruled out by referee Hollie Davidson for a forward pass by Mack Hansen which looked marginal. “I was gutted for Izzy in regards to the forward pass, it was marginal, so Mack says anyway,” said Farrell. “It would have been nice for him to get over the line. I thought he was a presence, certainly in the lineout. He’s some athlete. [ Ireland make light work of ill-disciplined FijiOpens in new window ] [ Ireland v Fiji player ratings: Bundee Aki bounces back, Caelan Doris leads by exampleOpens in new window ] “You give people these opportunities for them to realise their own potential. It’s what they do with that experience now, that’s going to be important pushing on. “What a story there for Gus,” Farrell said of the 21-year-old Blackrock and Leinster hooker. “Two years ago (he was) lifting the Senior Cup at Caelan’s school. I thought he did a brilliant job. “A harsh call, I thought, on the first lineout,” added Farrell in relation to the first of two calls deeming McCarthy’s lineout throw crooked. “But it never bothered him at all. He just kept going to play 80 minutes and played the finish at number 7. Himself and his family will remember that forever.” As he was when Prendergast made his debut off the bench against Argentina a week ago, Farrell was effusive in his praise of the 21-year-old Leinster outhalf. “I thought he did great. I thought he was really composed. The kick to the corner, that was harsh as well, but it didn’t bother him,” said Farrell of Prendergast’s penalty to the corner which was ruled to have found touch in goal. “He had a few mistakes within his game but he was pulling the strings for a good while, and he was really, really composed. “It’s tough against Fiji because you don’t know what you’re going to get in front of you at times. “Certainly, the breakdown is an absolute mess at times, because they’re so ferocious there and they’re so short defensively that you can see the space but you have them shooting out from out wide, and to have the composure and play the line like he did at times, I thought it was a great showing from him.” Ireland captain Caelan Doris felt it was the best of Ireland’s three Autumn Nations Series games so far ahead of their game against Joe Schmidt’s revitalised Wallabies next Saturday. “It felt pretty dominant out there. Good start to the game, similar to last week, and the message at half-time was to have a ruthless start to the second half and to kick on. Our attack hasn’t quite fired in the second half over the last couple of weeks, but it was good today, we got a few tries off the back of it,” said Doris in light of Ireland scoring four tries in each half. “It’s pretty pleasing, I think like Faz mentioned, there was a bit of an onus on some of the older, more experienced guys to take a bit of a load off the younger guys, and I think there’s a pretty even spread across the week, even the guys who weren’t playing stood up and allowed the young guys to do what they do best.” Doris, having opened the scoring himself, was heavily involved in a couple more off strike plays, notably the trick tap penalty move when he gave the try-scoring pass to Josh van der Flier, which he accredited to Paul O’Connell. Prendergast’s day might have panned out differently had his yellow card been upgraded to a red, with the Fijian head coach Mick Byrne remarking: “I think he was wearing a green jersey so it stayed yellow.” Informed of Byrne’s remark, Farrell responded: “Ah, I get why it is but for me he turned his back and it’s harsh enough. I don’t know, I’ll have to have a look at it again but that’s the game, isn’t it? “I thought our discipline was pretty good in general and it certainly added to the reason why, if you look at the story of the game and you fast forward it, I thought territory-wise and dominance-wise, yes, a couple of execution bits could have been better, I thought our discipline added to our strong hold on the game.” Both Byrne and Fiji’s captain Waisale Nayacalevu accepted their concession of 17 penalties was of their own making. “They’re probably on us, they’re definitely on us,” admitted Byrne, while also lamenting “a few defensive lapses”. Nayacalevu didn’t believe they weren’t being respected by World Rugby and officials, but added: “We got out there and give our best. We train all week to be disciplined, to play the game the way we want to play and at the end of the day, the match officials make the calls. “Sometimes it doesn’t go your way, which is frustrating. At the moment, it’s happening, and if we can have that fair play call, then we can play more entertaining rugby and we get more momentum as well going into our games, playing how we want to play.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Storm Bert live updates: 11,000 homes and businesses remain without power in counties worst affected

Some 11,000 electricity customers remain without power on Saturday evening as a result of Storm Bert, ESB Networks has said. Those who remain disconnected are predominantly in areas worst hit by the storm including counties Donegal, Sligo, Mayo and Galway. ESB Networks said while most customers currently without power will have their supply restored by Saturday night, it could not rule out further power outages as the storm moves slowly across the country. The worst of the weather so far appears to have struck the northwest, with more than 3,000 people in Carndonagh and Dungloe are among those not expected to have electricity restored until Saturday night. In Cork, Ardcahan Bridge remains impassable after heavy flooding caused by Storm Bert. #CorkTraffic Ardcahan Bridge remains closed, and impassable due to flooding. #StormBert pic.twitter.com/UWYSz703p0 In Galway where a landslide has closed Maam Road in Leenane, some 50mm of rain are reported to have fallen in the Maam Valley on Saturday. There are further reports this afternoon of roads closed in the in Belclare, Kilconly and near Athenry. At Cork Airport one flight from Birmingham has been diverted to Shannon and the authority has advised passengers due to travel this weekend to contact their airline directly for updates to their travel plans. The airport remains open. On the east coast Irish Ferries’ sailings between Rosslare and Pembroke have been cancelled. Irish Ferries said passengers can be accommodated on the Dublin-Holyhead route. John Fallon reports from Galway: Flood protection measures taken six years ago in the Spanish Arch area of Galway city appear to be working with Storm Bert not causing any overnight damage. Businesses in the area who suffered significant flooding a few years ago have installed their own flood prevention measures, while a large inflated boom provided by Galway City Council along the banks of the River Corrib as it meets the sea in the Claddagh Basin has also helped alleviate the threat. Niall McNeilus, a Labour Cllr who owns Claddagh and Celtic Jewellery at Quay Lane near the Spanish Arch, said businesses and residents in the area are always on their guard. “The measures taken by the individual owners of buildings in the area, coupled with the measures from the city council, certainly have alleviated the problem,” he said. “But you are always fearful. The storm last night wasn’t as severe as feared and thankfully didn’t do too much damage but there are a lot of roads impassable around the county and thousands of homes and businesses, particularly in Connemara, are without electricity.” Meanwhile, swimmers at Blackrock in Salthill were not deterred by the stormy weather with several dozens taking to the water on Saturday morning. “This is ground zero when it comes to flooding.” In Wexford, Aontú's Cllr Jim Codd is in Duncormick where cars are being pulled from the flooded area. Councillor Jim Codd highlighting issue of flooding in South Wexford once again today. pic.twitter.com/dEymU2HRrT Another video of flooding from Storm Bert, this time from the Abbeyfeale area of Co Limerick. Overflow from the river Feale flooded local GAA pitches. Rebecca Mullen of The Flour House bakery in Riverstick, Co Cork, said that Storm Babet flooded the bakery last October, and the bakery had flooded again after Storm Bert. They had received grants from the Red Cross to help them through the last flood where a lot of damage was done. “Without those grants we really wouldn’t have a business today, it’s just really important that small businesses survive weather systems,” she told the PA news agency. “Saturday is one of our busiest days, we’ve already had to cancel a market because of the weather system, so now we’ve obviously had to shut the shop today, so we’ll be losing money there. “I’ve done deliveries of cakes today where I can to the people who have ordered, but now it’s the clean up, its the cost of getting the staff back in, extra hours, working out what is salvageable and what isn’t.” She said small businesses are already struggling because of rising costs such as the 13.5 per cent VAT rate and staff pay. “Every day counts. You can’t miss a day’s trade. I think that’s what’s going to really hurt us. Every single piece of coinage is required to get us through.” You can see the flooding in the video below: ⚠️Following extreme rainfall, floodwaters are rising at various locations throughout the county. Motorists are advised to avoid driving through floods. Council crews continue to assess and address issues.

The L5465-0 off the R579 is closed after the river Allow burst its banks. The L1121-55 is also flooded at Roskeen off the N72. Motorists are advised to avoid driving through floods. This video shows the Flour House Bakery and Café and the adjacent private dwelling in Riverstick, Co Cork, where the gullies flowing into the nearby Stick river were unable to take the volume of rain. Met Éireann has warned of further windy conditions on Saturday night with heavy rain in places and spot flooding continuing to track eastwards across the country. Lowest temperatures are expected to be between 5-9 degrees in fresh to strong and gusty south to southwest winds. The national forecaster reiterated it has a status yellow wind warning in place for Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford and Wicklow. The warning is valid up to 2am on Sunday. ESB Networks has reduced the number of homes and businesses without power due to Storm Bert to about 34,000, down from a high of 60,000 before early on Saturday morning. As of lunchtime on Saturday, the worst of the damage to the electricity network caused by Storm Bert remained in the northwest. Some 1,674 homes and businesses in the Dungloe area of Co Donegal remain connected with the ESB online fault map indicating power will be restored by 8pm. In Carndonagh, Co Donegal 1,483 customers were also expected to be reconnected by 8pm, as were 594 customers in Kilcar, Co Donegal. On Achill Island, some 248 customers have been told it may be 9.30pm before their power is restored. In Clifden, Co Galway, 1076 customers have been given a time of 5pm for restoration of service. In Macroom, Co Cork, 1,630 customers have been told their power will be restored by 1pm. In the Gurranebane area, near Valentia island in Co Kerry, some 768 electricity customers have been given a time of 2pm for the restoration of power. In Dublin where disruption was not as severe as many other counties, 100 customers at Stephenstown, near Skerries, will be waiting until 4pm for power to be restored. In Greystones, Co Wicklow, a further 32 customers have been told their supply will be restored by 2pm. ESB Networks has said the next update will take place close to 5pm. John Fallon is also reporting from Galway: Galway County Council crews are continuing to deal with extensive flooding in Clifden where a number of roads in the Connemara town are flooded. Meanwhile, some houses in the Inverin area of south Connemara whose electricity supply was disrupted during a snowstorm during the week remain without power. ESB crews are working to restore power to hundreds of houses and businesses in Galway. A number of roads throughout Co Galway remain flooded with motorists advised to take caution in areas such as Claregalway, Mountain North near Athenry, and Belclare and Sylaun near Tuam. Image of the landslide in Maam Galway this morning. pic.twitter.com/E2FiwIOkTz Andrew Hamilton reports from Galway: Four large mudslides have taken place on different roads surrounding the village of Leenane in north Galway overnight. The largest of these mudslides took place on the Leenane to Maam road and crews from both Galway County Council and Mayo County Council have been working to reopen the road this morning. The mudslides came as heavy rains from Storm Bert combined with melting snow on nearby mountains. “There were four mudslides in total, including one big one on the Leenane to Maam road. That completely blocked the road there,” said Fianna Fáil Cllr Gerry King. “There was one on the Leenane to Louisburgh road, another on the Letterfrack side of Leenane village and a fourth one, a minor enough one, on the Leenane to Maam road. “Thankfully there was nobody hurt in the mudslides and no major damage reported. Galway and Mayo councils are out working on the roads at the moment. Work is still ongoing but cars should be flowing again soon.” Further south, five houses were evacuated in the Clifden area as the Owenglen river burst its banks. The Galway fire service were on hand from 5am to pump water away from four houses in the Clifden Glen Estate and one house located on the low road in Clifden. It is understood that several centimetres of water entered one house in the Clifden Glen Estate but the efforts of the fire service have saved the other evacuated houses from damage. “This is the second time that this area has been hit. There was severe flooding here four years ago. Four houses in Clifden Glen were evacuated this morning and now the water is receding,” said Fianna Fáil Eileen Mannion. “I don’t know the extent of the damage yet but if water comes into your house it is very damaging.” #CorkTraffic Storm damage to a wall on the N72 outside of Ballyhooly.

High tide in Bantry passed without incident, according to Cork County Council, as crews will continue to be deployed across the county amid flooding in several areas. The R588 Copeen to Enniskeane road is closed due to flooding, while the R621 Longfield Bridge, Mallow, remains closed to traffic. There is also flooding on the R624 outside IFI Cobh. Council crews have been deployed and motorists are advised to avoid the area. Crews are also assessing fallen trees near overhead cables at Westview Cobh. Members of the public are advised to avoid this area. In Monaghan, the council is reporting that Castle Road is flooded, but Monaghan Shopping Centre is still operating as usual. ⚠️ #StormBert Update: Castle Road is flooded, cars should not enter the flood water.

Ronan McGreevy has all the latest in our election blog here. Irish Rail has said there is disruption on Dublin to Belfast services due to flooding between Newry and Lurgan. The company said there are also delays to early Westport and Sligo to Dublin services due to flooding on the tracks. Also on the travel front, Transport For Ireland said those seeking Local Link bus services should check with relevant transport operators before travelling as there may be delays or curtailments due to adverse weather conditions. Some services will be travelling at reduced speeds in the interests of safety. Bus Éireann has cancelled a number of services in the south of the country. For details, check the company website here. Barry Roche shares this photo of the bridge at the entrance to Belgooly in Co Cork where Storm Bert has caused flooding. Clare County Council has advised the N67 north of Lisdoonvarna, between Toovareragh Church and Killeany junction, is impassable due to flooding. The road is now closed. In Co Kerry, flooding has been reported in Tralee near the Rose Hotel. The N22 at Glenflesk is flooded as are roads at Fossa village, Glenbeigh, as well as the N71 near Kenmare and localised flooding in Killarney.

Units of Cork County Fire Service from nearby Kinsale and other Cork County Council staff responded and began pumping out water from both the Flour House Bakery and Café and the adjacent private dwelling. Local general election candidate Cllr Alan Coleman (Independent) said that the Office of Public Works (OPW) had provided some €40,000 for flood relief work on the river Stick but this was inadequate and he called on the agency to provide more funding to expedite the work. “The OPW has provided €40,000 but that will go nowhere near resolving the flooding problem in Riverstick – it’s not a major job – another €200,000 would be enough so I’m calling on the OPW to provide the money and expedite the work so as to avoid any repeat of today’s flooding.” Irish Times photographer Alan Betson shares this image of a blustery Dublin bay this Saturday morning. Back in Donegal, a video shared by business owner Mairéad Ó Hagan Anderson shows the level of flooding on Bridge Street in the Killybegs area. Thomas Pringle, a TD for the area, said his constituency office on Bridge Street along with several homes and businesses were flooded. “My thoughts are with everyone impacted,” Mr Pringle said. I cannot believe this is our town. The poor families and businesses on this street. Absolutely shocking. A tree was obstructing the flow of the river. pic.twitter.com/Xn8O6NEQlL While the status red warning for Cork has expired, Cork County Council says the effects of the rainfall event and strong winds may linger into the day. Council crews in the region are responding to the impacts of Storm Bert in West Cork and Cobh with reports of flooding and fallen trees.

Council crews are on the ground and anyone travelling is advised to do so with care. An update from Dublin Airport says flights are moving well but there have been a few delayed due to wind. “Staff are working hard to ensure minimal disruption for passengers,” a statement said. One incoming flight has been cancelled this morning due to weather conditions at the other airport. Barry Roche reports: Cork City Council has announced that the Corkmas Festive Market at Emmet Place will not open today due to Storm Bert while reports are also emerging of flooding on the R579 between Healy’s Bridge and Cloghroe on a stretch of road adjacent to the Shournagh river. John Fallon in Galway reports: Galway County Council advised motorists not to travel unless it is absolutely necessary as some roads are flooded in the region following a night of heavy rain. Storm Bert reached landfall last night but early morning reports in Galway suggest that damage has not been as bad as initially feared. ESB crews are working to restore power in some areas with Connemara the worst hit. There is flooding on the main N59 road from Galway on the approach to Clifden with local authority crews monitoring rising river levels. There is also localised flooding in An Spidéal and on the N83 approaching Claregalway. Back in north Cork, Barry Roche reports that more than 750 customers around Mallow lost power at about 7.30am but almost 550 of these have since had power restored. In east Cork, more than 2,000 homes in Youghal have been without electricity since approximately 8.30am. A new status yellow warning has been issued for Donegal from 8am on Sunday until 5am on Monday. Met Éireann also issued a new yellow warning for Clare, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo from 8am-7pm on Sunday. The forecaster reminded people to be careful of fallen trees and dangerous driving conditions. In Northern Ireland, police are urging motorists to take extra care on a number of roads in the Newtownards area because of the impact of poor weather conditions. It said that a fallen tree on the Belfast Road and on the Springvale Road, between Ballyhalbert and Ballywalter, has blocked both lanes. The PSNI said a shed roof has been blown on to the Ballyquinn Road, Dungiven, and is causing an obstruction, and there is a heavy build-up of traffic in the Dunhill Road area of Coleraine because of snow. – PA As Met Éireann forecasts the storm to remain the dominant feature of the weather over the weekend, ESB Networks said the numbers of premises without power had reached 60,000 and “further power outages can be expected”. The ESB said its teams were closely monitoring the storm’s impact on power supplies and “all available resources remain on alert”. Flooding is becoming a significant problem along the west coast this morning as damage brought by Storm Bert is assessed. The river Feale in Abbeyfeale, Co Limerick, has overflowed its banks. Emergency crews are responding.

In Clifden, Co Galway, surface water is becoming a hazard to motorists. Bus Éireann has cancelled services on Route 434 between Clifden and Westport. In Killybegs, Co Donegal, the town has been flooded with up to two feet of water reported in the streets. It is understood a fallen tree blocked a local river which diverted into the town. Emergency services are at the scene but significant damage to homes and property is expected.

The Galway city interagency emergency group is bracing for flooding in areas across the city. Local authority crews are monitoring the situation as high waves batter the coastline. Barry Roche in Cork reports: It appears that Cork city has escaped flooding with gardaí at Anglesea Street reporting that they had received no reports of any flooding from either the city centre, or its suburbs and satellites such as Glanmire and Carrigaline which have been hit badly in the past. Cork City Council had issued a statement earlier, saying that based on information from Met Éireann, there was no tidal flooding expected in Cork city and that Storm Bert was a pluvial or rainfall event that may lead to just localised spot flooding. Meanwhile, ESB Networks reported a number of outages in both Cork and Kerry due high winds bringing down trees on power lines. Carrigaline was among the worst affected, where almost 2,500 customers were without power for several hours with 152 still awaiting restoration this morning. Further west, some 1,300 customers in Rathmore, in Co Kerry, lost power around 6am but it is expected they will have power restored by midday. On the Iveragh Peninsula in South Kerry, some 2,500 customers around Cahersiveen and Waterville lost power at different stages. A photo here from Carlow Weather shows flooding in the Killybegs area of Donegal with emergency services at the scene. Another image from Killybegs showing the level of flooding with emergency services on site. As always it is the fire services that come to the rescue in floods. We really need to have a look at flood forecasting and preparation in Ireland. pic.twitter.com/YpLFnVIC8J Some 60,000 homes and businesses are without power this morning after Storm Bert brought heavy winds and rainfall overnight. Affected counties where large areas have lost power include Donegal Mayo, Galway, Sligo, Cork and Clare. In Donegal some 12,000 people are currently without electricity with the worst of the outages in exposed areas near Gaoth Dobhair and Buncrana. In Cahersiveen, Co Kerry, 6,813 premises are without power. About 7,000 households and businesses Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon have been left without power, with many additionally damaged by localised flooding ESB spokesperson Paul Hand said crews and contractors are responding where safe to do so. Mr Hand said the next update on numbers of homes and businesses affected would be available in about an hour. Estimated restoration times are being posted on www.PowerCheck.ie and www.ESBNetworks.ie as restoration work progresses. The authority said any damage to network should be reported by calling 1800 372 999. Rain and snow warnings cover Northern Ireland from midnight on Friday until 11am on Saturday. P&O Ferries said it had cancelled the 4am sailing between Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in Scotland’s south west on Saturday. Barry Roche in Cork reports: Business people and homeowners in Bantry in West Cork were this morning breathing a sigh of relief as the town escaped flooding, amid fears that heavy rainfall from Storm Bert might bring a repeat of last month’s inundation which saw over 40 houses and shops flooded. Met Eireann had issued a status red red rain warning for Cork and Galway with West Cork braced for the worst of the weather but this morning at 7am, gardai in Bantry were reporting that there was no major flooding anywhere in the town other than minor surface flooding on some roads. Gardai in Bandon, Clonakilty and Skibbereen similarly reported that all three towns – each the beneficiary of significant investment by the Office of Public Works (OPW) in flood relief schemes in recent years – had again not suffered any flooding other than some surface water on roads. However, Cork Safety Alerts was reporting that there was flooding on the main Cork to Bantry road, R586 at Ballineen while there was also flooding on the Bantry Line, the R587 at Ardcahan north of Dunmanway and both roads were impassable. In East Cork where Midleton, like Bantry, is still awaiting a major OPW flood relief scheme and both homeowners and businesspeople are constantly on high alert for any Met Éireann rain warnings after Storm Babet caused millions of euros worth of damage in October 2023. On Saturday morning, gardaí in Midleton at 7.15am, had received no reports of any flooding in the town or in any of the surrounding villages such as Ladysbridge, Mogeely, Whitegate, Castlemartyr and Killeagh where dozens of properties were damaged in Storm Babet. As of 7am on Saturday morning it seemed that Cork county had escaped any major flooding with Mallow and Fermoy, thanks to OPW flood defence systems, avoiding a return to the inundation that was a perennial feature of both towns when the Blackwater burst its banks. There was some surface road flooding on low lying roads and around Mallow, and Cork County Council did post that some local roads off the main Mallow- Killarney road (the N72), were closed at Spa Glen, Ballylough Cross and Parkadallane. The council was forced to announce road closures at the Killavullen Road on the southern side of Mallow and at Longfields Bridge at Newberry west and upstream of the town due to rising water levels in the Blackwater. Closer to Cork city, the operators of the Cross Ferry from Glenbrook to Carrigaloe, which links Cobh while Passage West and Monkstown, announced the cancellation of sailings this morning due to high winds. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Talaght Stadium will host the Leinster Schools final The Leinster Schools Senior Cup final will move out of Dublin 4 and into Dublin 24 next March, with Tallaght Stadium set to host the marquee game for the first time. The RDS has hosted the final in since Lansdowne Road was redeveloped, but is out of action for the next year due to the redevelopment of the Anglesea Stand. The Aviva Stadium is unavailable, but is also considered to be too big for the size of the crowd expected. With the capacity of Energia Park in Donnybrook capped at 6,000, Leinster have been on the look out for an alternative venue and the home of Shamrock Rovers in Tallaght has emerged as the favourite. South Dublin County Council, which own the 10,716 capacity stadium and lets it to Rovers, are understood to be keen to host the game. Leinster have previously played pre-season matches at the venue, facing Ulster in 2014 and Gloucester in 2016, while Ireland ‘A’ played the Argentina Jaguares there in 2009. The draw for the competition will take place on December 9 and it is understood that it will be confirmed at that time, with Blackrock College defending the title they won at the RDS earlier this year.

U.S. Defense Secretary reviews Fijian troops at Black Rock Camp, Fiji, on Nov. 22, 2024. U.S. Air Force / Tech. Sgt. Jack Sanders Stay Connected Bradley Peniston BLACKROCK CAMP, Fiji—Fijian and U.S. officials cemented one defense agreement and opened talks on another—but first, there was roast pig and rugby in the rain. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived on this South Pacific island on Friday, the final stop on a nine-day journey that has taken him to Australia, the Philippines, and Laos. “The goal really here is to not just regularize, but to make more frequent our engagement” with Fiji and the Pacific island region, a senior defense official said ahead of Austin’s arrival. Austin’s visit here is the first by a U.S. defense secretary, but among a handful in recent years by various cabinet-level officials. Fiji is a leader in the region and one of three Pacific-island countries that maintains a standing professional military. It also controls a wide swath of waters and resources in its exclusive economic zone. “People call them ‘small island nations,’ but really should call them ‘large oceanic states,’” one U.S. official said. On Austin’s to-do list: wrap up 10 years of U.S. work on an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement, or ACSA, a bilateral pact intended to smooth the way for joint U.S-Fijian military logistics. “From fuel to medical supplies to the use of maintenance facilities,” the senior defense official said. “When things happen, they happen fast. So to be able to say that we're able to do that, to offer that kind of logistical support, it's critical.” More than 120 countries have ACSA agreements with the United States. Some, such as Japan and South Korea, have copied the idea and signed their own ACSA-type deals with others. Such agreements do not commit signatories to military action in any way. Austin also came to launch talks on a status-of-forces agreement, another document that deepens a bilateral defense relationship. SOFAs lay out the legal status of U.S. troops and dependents in a foreign country, including civil and criminal jurisdiction. Basing arrangements, if any, are typically negotiated separately. “The SOFA will enable us to deploy and redeploy forces in support of Fiji and help us train with the Fijians on a very routine basis,” Austin said Saturday at a press conference at a nearby hotel and conference center. “I look for routine rotations, training rotations, where possible, to be conducted,” plus continued work with the Nevada National Guard. Austin said “there is no notion” of permanently basing U.S. troops in Fiji. “We did not have any discussions like that.” If SOFA negotiations are concluded as expected next year, Fiji will join several dozen nations that already have such agreements with the United States. Austin also said the U.S. would soon deliver several rigid-hull inflatable boats and a boat ramp to help Fiji patrol its waters, and announced plans for $4.9 million in foreign military financing, pending congressional approval. The senior defense official said Fiji would put the new funds toward small arms. “Again, building military capacity, right? Professionalization of the military. This will go really straight to what they're asking for, what the needs are,” they said. At the press conference, a local reporter asked Austin what to expect from the incoming administration of Donald Trump. “Fiji has always considered climate change a national-security threat,” the reporter said. “And we have President-elect Trump who considers climate change a hoax and who has also in the past pulled out of the Paris Accord.” What, he asked, should the Pacific expect in the way of U.S. leadership? “I can't tell you what the next administration will do in terms of policy adjustments or things of that nature,” Austin responded. “What I can tell you is that I'm absolutely proud of the work that we've done. We've advanced things in a number of areas and we've strengthened our relationship. “And I truly believe that the strength of those relationships will endure far beyond the transition of administrations. I think the United States enjoys the strongest network of allies and partners in the world. We have the largest network of allies and partners in the world. And our relationship with allies and partners around the globe has enabled us to sustain our efforts and to endure a number of challenges globally. And I'm confident that our strong relationship that we have now will continue to blossom.” Austin’s visit began with an elaborate welcoming ceremony at Blackrock Camp that included drums, dancing, and the presentation of a roast pig so large it took six grass-skirted Fijian troops to lay it before the visiting secretary. The rain-dampened proceedings continued with a 15-minute rugby game between the base’s team and a local village club. At the Saturday press conference, Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka recalled that Austin had played rugby at West Point. “If he’d come when he was younger, we’d have tried to recruit him for our rugby team,” Rabuka said. “You have some pretty good players,” Austin replied.

Commissioner Mark Uyeda defends the creation of regulatory sandboxes, as a CFTC committee advises usage of tokenized funds' shares as collateral for derivatives trading. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Following Donald Trump’s election as the new US President, regulators are pushing for crypto market reforms, from establishing regulatory sandboxes to allowing tokenized funds’ shares as collateral in traditional derivatives trading. During an interview for Fox Business, SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said President-elect Donald Trump is right about stopping the war on crypto in the US. He also commented on what could be done to make the country a leader in the global crypto market According to Uyeda: “First off, from a regulatory perspective, we can provide proper clarity. Some crypto is not even a security at all, but we need to make it clear whether or not you would fall within SEC jurisdiction or not.” If a token offering falls under the SEC’s jurisdiction, clear guidelines are necessary so crypto firms can decide the right course of action to comply with the regulator’s rules. Uyeda also defended the creation of “safe harbors,” which are regulatory sandboxes where crypto companies could experiment with different products, allowing “innovation to occur.” The SEC Commissioner also argued that regulators must work with Congress and other federal agencies to create a cohesive approach to crypto. Lastly, considering Gary Gensler will step down as the SEC Chair on Jan. 20, Uyeda was asked if he is interested in filling the role, and he answered that this is a decision for the President. Uyeda’s call for reform comes amid a wider regulatory shift toward crypto and blockchain technology in finance. The CFTC recently recommended using tokenized funds as collateral. Bloomberg News reported on Nov. 22 that the Global Markets Advisory Committee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved using tokenized assets, such as money-market fund tokens launched by BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, as collateral for derivatives trading. The committee’s recommendation, which now awaits review by the CFTC, highlights the potential for distributed ledger technology (DLT) to enhance the efficiency and transparency of collateral management. The advisory panel’s recommendation provides a framework for registered firms to hold and transfer tokenized non-cash collateral using distributed-ledger technology. The framework ensures compliance with existing margin requirements set by the CFTC, other U.S. regulators, and derivatives clearing organizations. Although the recommendations are not binding, the CFTC frequently incorporates advisory input into its policymaking due to the committees’ specialized expertise. However, there is no specific timeline for when or whether the CFTC will adopt these recommendations into formal guidance or rulemaking.

Title: Billionaire Larry Fink could have Trump’s ear no matter who gets Treasury job

One of the more under-reported aspects of how President-elect Donald Trump will run the economy will be the influence of those who don’t have a position of power publicly, but remain in his kitchen cabinet. It’s a loosely defined group of outsiders, some Democrats but mostly Republicans, whom he leans on for advice on major issues, including those that impact the $27 trillion US economy, people close to him say. It’s why the front-runners for key posts at the Treasury and the SEC – which have yet to be announced – might be out of the mix at any minute. On The Money has been told by a senior Trump transition official not to be surprised by a “dark horse” nominee emerging, particularly for Treasury, as Trump taps into this advisory network. Who are these back-channel advisers? I don’t know all of them, but one name I do know is Larry Fink, the very non-MAGA CEO of BlackRock. Fink is often associated with the Democratic Party given his support for progressive Environmental Social Governance investing, but he’s close to Trump; he had managed The Donald’s vast fortune in the past and the two still talk.

Never miss a story. On The Money has learned that earlier in the week, in the middle of the Treasury scrum (as I said there are a bunch of people vying for the job), there were outreaches between the Trump camp and Fink about various matters. I am told Fink immediately took his name out of the Treasury hunt. Fink’s ESG proselytizing often overshadows his amazing skill set as a risk manager and a market expert. You don’t build a firm from zero to $10 trillion in assets under management without being good at your job. You can bet he and Trump will be talking much more in the years ahead.

Title: Goldman Sachs: Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) Is A Top Growth Investor Stock

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) ranks on the list. With the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least. Naturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled ‘Global Strategy Paper No. 71, the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This ‘concentration’ refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence. Since the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street’s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos’ eCommerce company, and the world’s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns. As per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index “by an annualized 200 bp-800 bp” over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today’s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang’s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade. GS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market’s performance of the two indexes before the bubble’s ‘pop’ to point out that “the trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).” This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall “has been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.” Linking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this “extreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.” Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then “this would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.” While stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk’s car company record stunning gains. Goldman’s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that “the biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.” He shared that “any sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.” These include “energy, traditional energy versus renewables” with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%. Tuteja added that “the resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election” was a standout from the market’s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that “what I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.” This is because “it takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.” According to him, in 2016, “regional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.” Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that “under the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime’s policies.” For some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now. Within this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024’s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings “growth alone can explain 40% of next quarter’s cash spending growth.” Just like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the “typical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.” Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects “cash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,” but cautions that “the potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ top growth investment stocks, we used the bank’s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm’s cash flow from operations. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Growth Investment Ratio: 112% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) is an upstream semiconductor company that provides the building blocks of chip design to firms such as NVIDIA and AMD. This provides it with a key role in the ongoing rush of artificial intelligence since these building blocks are indispensable for any chip design. However, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS)’s shares are up by a modest 14.9% year to date primarily due to the firm’s exposure to the broader semiconductor industry and not just AI chips. Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) has missed analyst guidance for several quarters this year, and this led to its shares being down 3.8% prior to the third quarter earnings. However, Q3 was a reversal in fortune, as the stock soared by 12.5% in its aftermath. This was on the back of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) raised its full-year profit per share forecast to $5.90 over the previous $5.87 on the back of AI-related tailwinds. Subsequently, any AI demand materializing or a recovery in the broader chip sector should benefit the firm. Artisan Partners mentioned Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Bottom contributors to performance for the quarter included semiconductor design and simulation company Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS). Cadence declined due to weaker-than-expected guidance, sensitivity to Cadence’s hardware product cycle in the near term, and uncertainty around China exposure.” Overall, CDNS ranks 15th on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of CDNS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CDNS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) took in $1 billion in daily total net inflows yesterday as Bitcoin inched closer to the $100k mark. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw the most inflows, attracting $608.41 million, according to SoSoValue data. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $300.95 million. Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF brought in $68 million and Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB attracted $17.18 million. Grayscale’s GBTC was the only one with negative net flows, recording $7.8 million outflows. The 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs have earned a combined $30.35 billion since launching in January following approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Elevated trade among the spot Bitcoin ETFs followed as Bitcoin climbed to the $100k mark on November 22, continuing its bull run. The inflows also come after BlackRock launched its options contracts earlier this week. During trading on day one, BlackRock’s options brought in nearly $2 billion, helping to push Bitcoin to more than $94,000. Grayscale announced this week that it was also launching Bitcoin ETF options following BlackRock’s impressive debut and a surge in investor interest. As trade continues through spot Bitcoin ETFs, it’s becoming clear that these avenues are one of the main ways for investors to hold Bitcoin. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, US Bitcoin ETFs hit $100 billion in assets, adding on X: “They’re now 97% of [the] way to passing Satoshi as [the] biggest holder and 82% of [the] way to passing gold ETFs.” Speaking of "100" milestones, the US bitcoin ETFs hit $100b in assets (altho more like $104b given the price surge overnight) w/ YTD flows flirting with $30b (double our estimate). They're now 97% of way to passing Satoshi as biggest holder and 82% of way to passing gold ETFs. pic.twitter.com/Y3070yW7Jx — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 21, 2024 Elsewhere, in the market, Ethereum is up by more than 7% over the past week at $3,285, Solana has seen a nearly 20% increase at $253, and XRP has risen close to 60% to $1.44 in the same time, according to CoinMarketCap.
