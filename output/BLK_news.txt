91% of respondents intend to increase investments in private assets over the next two years60% of insurers targeting clean energy infrastructure investments for low-carbon transition objectivesRespondents see value in technology for key challenges of private asset modeling (53%) and regulatory capital integration (51%) NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Global insurers are focused on increased allocations to private markets, clean energy infrastructure and utilizing innovative technology in 2024, according to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s 13th annual Global Insurance Report. For the third year running, BlackRock's annual report shows a majority of insurers are planning increased investments in private markets, with 91% of all respondents saying they will do so within the next two years. This figure increases to 96% for APAC and 96% for North American insurers. The report tracks insights from 410 insurance investors surveyed across 32 markets, representing nearly $27 trillion USD in assets under management. Mark Erickson, Global Head of BlackRock's Financial Institutions Group, said, We've seen rapidly accelerated demand for private markets among insurers in recent years, given these investments' dual benefits of diversification and increased income generation. Navigating risk: finding the right investment partner With 2024 projected to be the biggest election year in history, insurers see political uncertainty impacting macro risks, citing regulatory developments (68%) and rising geopolitical tension and fragmentation (61%) as their top concerns. Additionally, interest rate risk (69%) and liquidity risk (52%) were highlighted as the most serious market risks for insurers. Despite this outlook, 74% of insurers have no plans to change their current risk profiles. Notably, many insurers reported they benefit from partnerships to augment their internal expertise for risk evaluation as well as portfolio construction. According to 40% of survey respondents, an investment partner who understands both their insurance business and its operating model is fundamental to the success of insurers' strategic priorities. Asset allocation: a balanced approach across public and private assets Within public markets, 42% of those surveyed planned to increase allocations to government and agency bonds. Inflation-linked bonds are also a priority, with 33% planning to increase exposure, given nearly half of insurers (46%) identify inflation as a major macro risk. Additionally, 44% of respondents are looking to increase their allocations to cash and short-term instruments for liquidity. In private markets, insurers report they are looking to increase allocations to private debt across multiple categories, including opportunistic private debt (41%), private placements (40%), direct lending (39%), and infrastructure debt (34%). As the scope of private debt has expanded to encompass a wider array of lending opportunities, BlackRock's report indicates this asset class can support insurance investment objectives for those needing long-term assets to support long-term liabilities, as well as increasing investment income through illiquidity rather than other investment characteristics. In addition, over half of insurers (52%) reported they will increase allocations to multi-alternative investments for greater flexibility and customization. Olivier Van Eyseren, Head of the Financial Institutions Group, EMEA for BlackRock said, Insurers face unique challenges when evaluating strategic asset allocation to alternative investments, including regulatory issues, liquidity needs, and higher capital charges. An important part of our work with insurance clients is helping them navigate these short-term complexities while working toward the best possible long-term portfolio outcomes. Seizing the moment for clean energy infrastructure Nearly all (99%) of insurers surveyed have set a low-carbon transition objective within their investment portfolio, with 57% of respondents citing management and/or mitigation of climate risks as a top motivation for doing so. Additional drivers for setting low-carbon transition objectives include responding to stakeholder and beneficiary interest and fulfilling regulatory requirements. To support their low-carbon transition strategy, clean energy infrastructure such as wind and solar (60%) and technologies such as batteries and energy storage (60%) were identified as the top two thematic areas that insurers plan to target. In addition, 66% of respondents stated that they have more conviction now towards investing in the low-carbon transition than they did one year ago. Leveraging innovative technology In an increasingly volatile and complex macroeconomic and regulatory environment, insurers recognize the importance of investing in technology. Integrated asset allocation (63%) and asset liability management (61%) were named as strategic priorities for their technology platforms. Regulatory capital integration (51%) was also cited as an area where technology could add value. As insurers look to continue their deployment into private markets, 53% of respondents view private asset modeling as an additional area to leverage technology. About the BlackRock Global Insurance Survey The BlackRock Global Insurance Survey, now in its thirteenth year, provides industry-leading insight into the thinking and plans of the insurance industry through independently conducted interviews of senior insurance executives across the globe. This year's survey conducted in July “ September 2024 encapsulates the views of 410 senior industry executives in 32 markets with the following regional distribution: 42% from EMEA, 29% from Asia-Pacific, 19% from North America, and 10% from Latin America.

Title: Most Asian shares track Wall Street higher, oil extends losses

By Stephen Culp NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed down on Tuesday, following world stocks lower as a weak sales forecast from chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML) weighed on tech shares, while crude extended its slide due to easing supply worries and weakening demand. The three major U.S. indexes ended the session in negative territory, with the S&P 500 and the Dow easing back from Monday's record closing highs. Financial firms Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America all posted better-than-expected profit, while healthcare companies UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) results underwhelmed investors. But Netherlands-based chip equipment maker ASML posted third quarter results that surprised markets with weak bookings and lower-than-expected sales forecasts, dour news that proved contagious to the U.S. chip sector. "The U.S. stock market is so heavily weighted in tech, it’s going to drive where the overall market appears to be going," said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. "But below the surface it’s not bad news across the board." "The global story is more due to soft data," Haworth added. Energy stocks suffered the steepest percentage drop among the major S&P 500 sectors, falling 3.04% on sliding crude prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 324.60 points, or 0.75%, to 42,740.62, the S&P 500 fell 44.54 points, or 0.76%, to 5,815.31 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 187.10 points, or 1.01%, to 18,315.59. European stocks posted their largest one-day percentage drop in over two weeks, weighed by tech stocks in the wake of ASML's disappointing annual sales forecast. Meanwhile, investors remained focused on the European Central Bank's rate decision on Thursday. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 6.20 points, or 0.72%, to 850.98. The STOXX 600 index fell 0.8%, while Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 19.22 points, or 0.92%. Emerging market stocks fell 11.40 points, or 0.98%, to 1,148.66. Oil prices slid to a near two-week low, extending Monday's losses amid easing supply pressures arising from the conflict in the Middle East, amid reports Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. President Joe Biden's administration that Israel would avoid striking Iranian oil targets. Additionally, OPEC and the International Energy Agency both lowered their global demand forecasts, mostly due to weakness in China. "Sliding oil prices are disinflationary and that’s a positive for the broader economy," said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist Ingalls & Snyder in New York. "What you’re seeing now is the speculation that Middle East oil properties are going to be exempt from attack." "And falling oil prices does say something about global demand." U.S. crude tumbled 4.40% to $70.58 per barrel, while Brent fell to $74.25 per barrel, down 4.14% on the day. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields edged lower, pausing after touching a 2-1/2 month high in the wake of soft manufacturing data from the New York Federal Reserve. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 3.7 basis points to 4.036%, from 4.073% late on Friday. The 30-year bond yield fell 5.8 basis points to 4.3237% from 4.382% late on Friday. The 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, rose 1.1 basis points to 3.952%, from 3.941% late on Friday. The dollar was nominally lower against a basket of world currencies amid wagers that the Federal Reserve will proceed with modest rate cuts in the near term. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.06% to 103.24, with the euro down 0.2% at $1.0887. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar weakened 0.37% to 149.2. Gold gained traction, lifted by lower Treasury yields. Spot gold rose 0.4% to $2,661.80 an ounce.

Title: NCIS: Origins Season 2 - Will It Happen? Everything We Know
URL: https://screenrant.com/ncis-origins-season-2-explained/
Time Published: 2024-10-15T00:30:14Z

Your changes have been saved Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address. You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics. The new spinoff NCIS: Origins represents a major change for the long-running procedural franchise, but will the Gibbs-centric prequel return for season 2? Debuting in late 2024, NCIS: Origins concerns young Agent Leroy Gibbs (originally played by Mark Harmon and now played by Austin Stowell) as he begins his career at Camp Pendleton in 1991 under his mentor, Mike Franks (Kyle Schmid). Exploring the early days of the franchise's most beloved hero, Origins is the first spinoff of NCIS to take place earlier in the show's timeline and eschew the typical procedural format found in other off-shoots. Though NCIS has been airing since 2003, NCIS: Origins marks the first time in the franchise's history that a spinoff has tried something new. The character-driven narrative not only serves to flesh out Gibbs, but also to deliver crucial context to what comes much later in the timeline. Instead of the narrowly-focused weekly cases of NCIS and its spinoffs, Origins (and the upcoming Tony & Ziva spinoff) shows a path forward for NCIS as it continues to set TV records. All that said, NCIS: Origins season 2 isn't confirmed yet, but it could get the green light soon. Even though Leroy Jethro Gibbs was a major character on NCIS for almost 20 years, there are several stories that only NCIS: Origins can reveal. Presumably, the spinoff is intended to be an ongoing series that will span across multiple seasons, but nothing has been confirmed yet. With a lot of buzz surrounding the debut season of NCIS: Origins, it is somewhat surprising that CBS has been tight-lipped about the show's future. Presumably, the spinoff is intended to be an ongoing series that will span across multiple seasons, but nothing has been confirmed yet. As such, Origins season 2 is not confirmed, and the network is likely waiting to see how the latest franchise installment fares before they make their final decision regarding its fate. NCIS as a franchise is in an odd place in the early 2020s, and Origins isn't a sure-fire hit. Though most of the show's off-shoots have done well, recent shows like NCIS: Hawaii were less fortunate, and CBS wasn't sentimental when axing it from their slate. However, with the promise of Mark Harmon's return as Gibbs, and a more recognizable framework for the story, there's little doubt that Origins will be able to hold its own in a crowded fall schedule. With the other character-driven spinoff, Tony & Ziva, also looming, CBS needs Origins to work as proof that the future of the franchise is in specialized spinoffs. Tony & Ziva is an NCIS spinoff focusing on the eponymous characters living in Europe trying to raise their daughter. The cast of NCIS: Origins is chock-full of familiar characters, even if the actors playing them have changed since the old days of NCIS. Austin Stowell was given the daunting task of playing the younger version of Gibbs, and he has slotted into the role excellently. Since it's his origin story that lends the spinoff its title, it stands to reason that Stowell will be back in the lead role alongside the likes of Kyle Schmid as Gibbs' mentor, Agent Mike Franks. Shockingly, Mark Harmon returned to play Gibbs (largely as a narrator) in season 1, but it's unclear if the actor is looking to make it a full-time gig. Another expected return is Mariel Molino as Special Agent Lala Dominguez, and her storyline seems to be just as crucial to the plot as Gibbs'. Similarly, Tyla Abercrumbie should be back as Field Operation Support Officer Mary Jo Sullivan, and Diany Rodriguez should reprise her role as Special Agent Vera Strickland, since Strickland is an original character in NCIS. The likely cast of NCIS: Origins season 2 includes: Actor NCIS: Origins Role Austin Stowell Young Agent Gibbs Mark Harmon Older Agent Gibbs Kyle Schmid Mike Franks Mariel Molino Agent Lala Dominguez Tyla Abercrumbie Officer Mary Jo Sullivan Diany Rodriguez Agent Vera Strickland Daniel Bellomy Agent Granville "Granny" Dawson Caleb Martin Foote Agent Benjamin "Randy" Randolf Julian Black Antelope ME Kai Blackrock Patrick Fischler SAC Cliff Walker Robert Taylor Jackson Gibbs As it stands now, it's impossible to guess exactly what will happen in NCIS: Origins season 2 since the season 1 finale hasn't aired yet. Unlike the procedural series found in the rest of the franchise, Origins will likely employ overarching narratives that will grow and change from season to season. Season 1 likely won't see Gibbs learn all the crucial skills he put to good use in NCIS, and there are likely more important connections he still needs to make. Furthermore, Gibbs' emotional storyline could take on a new dimension going forward as he learns how to really deal with the grief of losing his wife and daughter to a murder. This development will likely shape Stowell's Gibbs into the stoic and sure Gibbs that viewers met in the original series, but NCIS: Origins still has a long way to go before the accomplished agent can become self-actualized. Your comment has not been saved A young Gibbs embarks on his journey as a Naval Investigative Service agent in the early 1990s. Set against the backdrop of Camp Pendleton, the series explores Gibbs' formative years, the cases that shaped him, and the mentors who guided his path, including Mike Franks.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From THE DAILY SCEPTIC by Tilak Doshi Terrence Keeley is a long-time ESG practitioner who until recently headed the official institutions group in the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock advising sovereign wealth funds, central banks, finance ministries, and public pension funds. He claimed in 2022 that “ESG investing could well be the biggest thing in finance since the Dutch East India company issued shares in 1602…ESG’s success or failure could literally impact every living creature on Earth.” Mr. Keeley’s boss, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, was equally hyperbolic in his annual letter to CEOs in early 2020: We believe that sustainability should be our new standard for investing…all investors – and particularly the millions of our clients who are saving for long-term goals like retirement – must seriously consider sustainability in their investments…I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance. Alas, the ESG and sustainability movement, a financial juggernaut in its heyday, has performed poorly in the past two years. This poor performance has been a result of a combination of factors including the boomeranging impact of Western sanctions on Russia energy exports, the collapse of “clean” energy stocks, the rise in interest rates, and the widespread backlash against ‘woke capitalism’ and climate change regulations in Europe and the U.S. ESG investment momentum has slowed on both sides of the Atlantic since 2022. In 2022, for the first time in more than a decade, investors pulled more money from funds marketed as “sustainable” than they added. In the first half of 2024, the U.S. ESG market experienced net outflows of over $13 billion, on the heels of a $9 billion outflow in 2023. Morningstar, a financial research firm, found nearly 2,500 fewer sustainable funds globally in 2023 relative to the prior year and 2024 is on track for an even steeper plunge. According to Torsten Lichtenau, Bain and Company’s global carbon transition practice lead, “When you look at the importance of [environmental, social and corporate-governance efforts], you can clearly see a huge peak in 2021 to 2022 where there was also a lot of action off the back of the Glasgow COP26 climate conference in 2021. Now it’s dropped back to 2019 levels.” Competitive Sustainability Enter “competitive sustainability”, a buzz phrase of choice of its most vociferous proponents. The European Commission’s 2022 Annual Sustainable Growth Survey (ASGS) presented a “competitive sustainability” agenda for the EU covering four dimensions: productivity, environment, fairness, and stability. In a word salad worthy of Brussel’s unelected bureaucrats, it describes the agenda as one where “a fair, just, green and digital transition which requires sustainable social conditions, will serve as a foundation for future prosperity and resilience. Well-designed labour market policies and social protection systems are the basis for resilience and inclusive growth.” In offering a Panglossian world where all good things go together – high productivity, environmental sustainability, fairness and stability – “competitive sustainability” is now the battle cry for the Cambridge Institute of Sustainable Leadership (CISL). It is mom’s venerable apple pie, something no reasonable person could object to. There are no difficult trade-offs to be made since “competitive sustainability” ensures both economic growth and environmental sustainability, not to mention equity and stability. In an article published in the Financial Times last month, the interim CEO of CISL Lindsay Hooper begins by saying: “The business case for sustainability is clear: companies cannot thrive on a planet suffering from cascading crises and unmanageable risks. Yet, despite decades of corporate commitments, businesses continue to damage the planet, carbon emissions to rise and fossil fuel companies to chase growth.” Ms. Hooper asserts that “It is time to confront the uncomfortable truth: ESG as it stands – grounded in disclosures and voluntary market action – will not deliver the necessary change. The solution is a radical shift towards ‘competitive sustainability’.” What does this “radical shift” entail? To deliver change, Ms. Hooper says we must “redesign” penalties and incentives which “will require a critical mass of businesses to push for government action”. Evidently, market decision-making in the context of disclosure rules and voluntary action by company executives is not enough. She finds it imperative that governments “create conditions that make it economically compelling to phase out damaging activities. Otherwise businesses that voluntarily transition will be undermined by those that don’t.” There we have it, straight from the hallowed halls of academe. Governments – presumably advised by sustainability-congruent academics – must replace markets by diktats that determine which industries are pursuing “damaging activities” and need to be proscribed, and which are not. An extreme case of governments picking winners. The familiar trope of market myopia is trotted out by Ms. Hooper: “As long as the market rewards short-term gains over long-term resilience, businesses will harm the planet, and markets will destroy the foundations on which they depend.” Evidently, Mr. Hooper seems not to be too concerned about the “short-termism” of governments bound by electoral cycles. Meanwhile, in the Real World… Firms favoured by ESG investment metrics – the “non-damaging activities” as per Ms. Hooper – such as wind and solar system providers, electric vehicle manufacturers, “green” hydrogen producers, and other such “sustainable” entities have been having a hard time after initial enthusiasm and high IPO values. The Renewable Energy Industrial Index (RENIXX) is a global stock capitalisation index of the 30 largest renewable energy industrial companies in the world including First Solar, Gamesa, Orsted, Plug Power, Solarcity, Tesla, and Vestas. Established on May 1, 2006, with an initial value of 1,000 points, the index stood at 1,013 points on September 25th, essentially registering zero value growth over the last 18 years. In comparison, the S&P 500 Index more than quadrupled over the same period. The RENIXX is down three years in a row from 2021, losing half its value. It should be noted that that this performance would have been far worse if the outperforming Tesla stock was removed from the index. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF aims to “target access to clean energy stocks around the world”. Last year its value fell by 26.1% and from its inception in 2008 it has lost about 60% of an initial investment of $10,000. Perhaps the best example of ESG-inspired debacles is provided by bp, the hitherto “woke” oil company that has used lower-case letters for its name and logo since 2000. In the high road of the climate crusade, marked by corporate brochures extolling social responsibility and environmental sustainability, the company was first among its peers. Its then-CEO John Browne – now Lord Browne – declared in a 2020 speech at Stanford University: “We need to reinvent the energy business. We need to go beyond petroleum.” According to an article in the Telegraph published on Monday, bp has abandoned its target to cut oil and gas production by 2030 “as its new chief executive scales back a switch to green energy to boost its share price”. Its new CEO Murray Auchincloss plans to focus on investments in oil and gas projects in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico to boost output. Quite unsurprisingly, in the real world where money matters, the company’s shares rose as much as 1.3% after the story was first reported by Reuters. Perhaps rather late in the day, the company’s senior management has decided that its fiduciary duties to maximize shareholder profits trump its devotion to “sustainability”. Them Weasel Words The question about the ethically appropriate role of business firms in societies in which they operate is as old as the business firm itself. Adam Smith, a keen observer of businesses – he authored An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations after all – was not at all uncertain in his response to this question in 1776: it is from the appeal to the self-interest of the butcher, the brewer and the baker that we expect our dinner, not to their benevolence. He had also “never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good”. Almost two centuries later, Smith’s most famous acolyte Milton Friedman was just as clear: “There is one and only one social responsibility of business – to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.” He too was distrustful of businessmen who talk of promoting desirable social ends, for they are “unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades”. In the battle of the greatest weasel words of recent years, “ESG” and “competitive sustainability”, along with their corollaries such as “energy transition” and “net zero by 2050”, surely come out at the top. It is not capitalist free markets but those that seek to replace them that threaten to destroy the foundations of modern civilization. Dr. Tilak K. Doshi is an economist, a former contributor to Forbes, and a member of the CO2 Coalition. I hedged my bets by having one small investment in a battery storage investment trust and another in a wind farm investment trust. Both have continued to pay reasonable dividends but the share price has headed relentlessly downwards… I rest my case. I made several millions over the years investing in stocks—not trading, investing. As a general rule never invest when there is dubious management (Boeing today), or when there is not a clear value proposition (battery storage and wind). Or, as Charlie Munger used to say, better to buy great companies at fair prices than fair companies at great prices. In the main, Rud, that’s my investment philosophy too but in this case I hazarded a couple of small amounts “just in case I was wrong”. I knew the risk I took and, as I said, they have been consistent dividend payers. Could be worse. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GEVO/ Blackrock’s support of ESG violates their sole legal duty as a fiduciary—maximize beneficiaries financial returns. Mr. Fink’s name says it all. Agreed. I have never figured out why some group of enterprising young attorneys has not sued the crap out of them for that. Find a little old lady that suffered diminished returns, put her in front of a Texas (for example) jury, and rake in gigantic contingency fees. I am an attorney (among other things) albeit no longer young or enterprising. Too hard to prove ESG (only) damages. As one example, damages soley from DEI personnel policies. My brother is a stock broker. As far as he can tell, putting a sympathetic little old lady on the stand and getting a judgement on her behalf doesn’t require much of that difficult stuff like evidence, etc. If they touted ESG on the basis of better returns, and failed to beat a long litany of stock market alternative benchmark returns, then I think you could make a case. If you could certify a class action, I think they would offer a crap ton of money far beyond “nuisance money”. IANAL, but that seldom stops me from discussing legal issues! 😉 Go Woke, Go Broke: A Brief Guide to ESG Investing. Go Woke, Go Broke: Snowflakes scared of rainbows throw a temper tantrum…again If you had half a brain, you would be gifted. Very nice. WEF, ESG, DEI, and AGW are designed to destroy the middle class because it is the major impediment to gathering everyone under the Marxist flag. Burn down the village to save it under their ideology. If more people don’t see this slow moving train wreck gaining momentum we’re doomed to 1984. I worked for the U.S. government for the last 10 years of my career, and had their equivalent of a 401K, the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). There are five different funds available in a TSP, four of them equities of various types, and one federal government securities. All are managed by BlackRock. Toward the end of the Obama Administration, I noted with alarm that all of my equities funds were losing money, and a lot of it. My wife, who handles all of her own investments, remarked that the funds I had (small cap and international) had some down periods recently. I told her the percentage loss my funds had, year to date, and it was the one and only time I’ve ever seen her shocked to hear anything. I put everything into the government securities fund, where it remained, not losing numerically but not keeping up anywhere near inflation, until I rolled it into an IRA this year. I wonder how many government employees, who would mostly favor ESG investing, realize how much of their net worth was flushed by BlackRock. It is good to see articles like this one by Dr Doshi that amplify the theme of “Go woke, go broke.” However, a great deal more has to be done. The Western World is in hypnotic trance from 30 years of relentless propaganda on the vital importance of “environment protection.” This “EP”, we have been told, over and over that EP must be a supreme priority; we will have eternal damnation if we tread on the delicate toes of the environment. In the real world, our environment is a tough, self-sufficient being that does quite well without the Hand of Man to help or hinder. Read Charles Darwin on the Evolution of Species. Look at fossil creatures that lived hundreds of millions of years ago, markers in a trail of evidence of survival of Life with no creature named Man existing for the vast majority of this time. It is a human conceit to think that puny latecomer Man needs to Protect the Environment. It is even more dreadful to assume that Man has the intelligence, experience or motivation to do good with home-made EP. Mankind has long had survival of self and offspring as a major driver. Nothing that Mankind has done to Protect the Environment has been a significant advance. It has been in the category of children playing in the sandpit looking for coins. The real effort of Man, survival, has recently acquired a measurement device. It is called money. Money is the big motivator, way ahead of EP. It is so far ahead that most people who claim a godly effort of EP are in reality in the game to make money. The seductive force of more money is currently causing simple-minded folk to say and do silly things, hoping for public approval and more money again for their continues noble effort. I suggest that more effort is needed by “influencers” to tell the reality story about EP instead of the propaganda story. Geoff S The only thing that ever made ESG funds attractive was the massive government subsidies – just ask Warren Buffet. All these green energy companies are doomed to fail because their businesses are fundamentally inefficient money losers. All I want is a ham sandwich and a cold beer. Well, that and a couple of other things. When individual companies go the ESG route in a large diversified mutual fund, an investor has the choice of dumping that fund and becoming less diversified or compromising. I never invested in one of the ESG-directed offerings, but did, mostly, stay with the multi-company holdings. Boeing is a prime example of a ESG failure. A big green failure. One mans loss is another mans gain. i hope they don’t fail too badly. My pension is tied up with them. And, according to friends with visibility into TBC, DEI. Have they told China about this? Money is the dominant driving force behind the Man Made Climate Change catastrophic hoax and it has been since the day of its modern inception. The creation of an idea as an asset class was the genius of a small handful of amoral men. It has happened before but in much more modest forms; South Sea Bubble, Teapot Dome, Tulip mania ; but this one is huge and has global reach. Here on WUWT we spend a lot of time and intellect discussing “the science” which is nuanced and affected by exotic statistics and great insights while the real game plays out at Davos and similar places where money and its corollary power is discussed and allocated. In centuries past the French, Russians and Chinese attempted to solve this problem but their methodology failed. Maybe Trump’s attempt will succeed maybe not, but it is worth a try. ““ESG investing could well be the biggest thing in finance since the Dutch East India company issued shares in 1602… invested in tulips ” fixed it! 🙂 And we all know how that turned out. I think they are all terrified of investor law suits for breaching their fiduciary duty as a money manager … ESG is a clear breach of that duty … Login Become a WUWT Sponsor - click here Free signup if you want to post comments (includes ads) click here “Walk toward the fire.

After reporting a record-breaking profit of $5.2 billion in the first half, Tether explores inefficiencies in credit for the commodity market. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tether Holdings, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, is looking to expand beyond the crypto industry and explore new ventures in traditional finance (TradFi), including potentially lending to commodities trading firms, Bloomberg News reported on Oct. 14, citing CEO Paolo Ardoino. People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Tether is already in discussions focused on lending US dollars to commodity traders, a sector where access to credit is critical to sustaining the flow of multimillion-dollar shipments of oil, metals, and agricultural products. Ardoino confirmed the rumors during an interview with Bloomberg but did not disclose further details about the plans or the amount the firm intends to invest in them. However, he clarified that these explorations will remain distinct from the firm’s core stablecoin business. While major players like Trafigura Group enjoy extensive access to credit lines — reportedly $77 billion from 150 institutions — smaller traders often struggle to secure funding. Tether’s alternative approach could prove attractive, as its loans are not subject to the regulatory conditions traditional lenders face, potentially speeding up transactions. According to the sources, the company is looking at ways to expand USDT’s use in mainstream commodity trades globally, leveraging the liquidity and stability it offers, the report said. Tether reported $5.2 billion in profits for the first half of 2024, most of it related to the firm’s investments in traditional assets, such as US Treasuries, totaling $97.6 billion. The firm’s exposure to US Treasuries surpasses major nation-states, including Germany, the UAE, and Australia. The firm has seen remarkable growth and maintains a dominant position in the stablecoin sector, with USDT approaching a $120 billion market capitalization, which will be a new all-time high for the stablecoin. The recent foray is the latest in Tether’s efforts to channel its significant growth into new ventures. Tether has been working on expanding to new sectors for several months now, starting with an expanded focus on artificial intelligence (AI) announced in March. A month later, in April, Tether created four new business divisions focused on data, finance, power, and education. Following that, the firm made its first investment in neuroscience less than two weeks later by acquiring a stake in the brain-computer-interface company Blackrock Neurotech.

Title: There are major risks, but also solutions for AI in the Global South

Dr. Muggah is also an advisor to the United Nations, the IMF and the World Bank, and a member of the SecDev Group. Dr. Muggah is involved in developing new technologies and testing AI systems for security and governance. He also coordinated a global task force on predictive analytics in 2023 and 2024. Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) provides support as an endorsing partner of The Conversation BR. View all partners While artificial intelligence (AI) promises immense benefits, it also imposes tremendous risks. Some of them - accelerating misinformation, sophisticated cyber attacks and soaring energy consumption - have already arrived. Others, including super intelligent machines that take decisions independently of human oversight, are likely still a few years away. Although awareness about these risks is growing, there are many others that have yet to be defined. And for all the incalculable opportunities afforded by AI, especially in developing countries, it is risky business. Concerns are mounting about the ways in which the rapid adoption of AI will negatively impact societies, including in the Global South. Last year my Institute together with New America convened a Global Task Force made up of AI specialists from across the Americas, Africa, and Asia to review ways to improve AI safety and alignment. And in 2024, the task force issued a primer to practically mitigate risks and improve resilience while also closing governance and regulatory gaps between the Global North and South. One of the most significant risks the group identified is mass automation and job displacement. AI is expected to impact vast numbers of workers across sectors ranging from agriculture, manufacturing, retail to the law, medicine, finance. While new forms of employment will undoubtedly emerge, the jobs of up to 800 million people are at risk of automation by 2030, including 300 million in wealthy countries. The International Labor Organization estimates that over 56 percent of all jobs in low- and middle-income countries are at “high risk” of automation. Without safeguards in place, this could sharpen economic inequality and exclude low-skilled workers. Another risk involves deepening digital divides and sharpening inequality. The gap between those who can access advanced technologies and those who cannot is expected to widen over the coming years, leading to lower productivity, reduced economic growth, and greater social and economic inequality. This is particularly so in lower and middle-income settings already facing shortfalls in digital talent and related services. Biases and discrimination are another risk associated with AI. Advanced technologies and models designed in the US, China, and EU can perpetuate and amplify biases already present in the training data. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes in everything from credit scores to policing. It can also result in unfair exclusion from opportunities in the job market, credit and loans, and health services due to biased algorithms. The intensification of surveillance and privacy violations are also enabled by AI. The integration of AI into everything from smart cities to law enforcement can infringe on privacy, civil liberties, and human rights. This is especially so in countries with weaker democratic institutions. Indeed, authoritarian regimes are already deploying AI-enabled systems to track political opponents, suppress dissent, and target marginalized communities based on ethnic, religious, or ideological grounds. What is more, the reliance of foreign technologies and expertise also constitutes a risk in the Global South. The over-dependence on US, Chinese and European innovations can potentially reduce the incentives to build domestic tech sectors in lower-income settings. It can also degrade the bargaining power of local governments, contributing to higher costs for technology while reducing control over standards. Dependence on foreign suppliers can also result in data being more easily accessed, controlled, manipulated and exploited by foreign actors, raising concerns about privacy, property theft, and integrity of critical infrastructure. Given all these risks, what are some of the solutions being considered in the Global South? For one, there is a growing chorus for more involvement of developing country governments and experts in the formulation of global standards. This is a call echoed in a recent 2024 UN General Assembly resolution on AI inclusion and a recently agreed Digital Compact intended to overcome digital, data and innovation divides. A consensus is emerging to ensure that AI is more equitable, inclusive, and sensitive to the specific challenges of the Global South. Practically, more investment in education and vocational training is essential to prepare for coming automation and job losses. This requires developing training centers and online courses, retraining grants, job placement services, and progressive unemployment benefits as well as universal basic income (UBI) schemes. And promising examples are emerging: India’s AI for All initiative, Rwanda’s digital ambassadors, and Brazil’s Conecta program are all helping people and companies transition to the digital economy. And countries as varied as Kenya, Namibia and India are piloting UBI, though more action is needed. Public and private actors will need to dramatically scale investment in digital infrastructure to redress digital divides across the Global South. This includes expanding internet access and broadband access to the 2.6 billion people who are still not connected. Policies that promote digital hubs, equitable access to digital services and lost-cost technology programs are essential. One example of how to amplify such activities is Smart Africa Alliance’s AI for Development (AI4D) program which is building ethical AI frameworks for governance, agriculture and healthcare. Bias and discrimination can be minimized through improved guidance and standards for AI development and deployment. Countries, companies, and digital activists need to craft and enforce regulatory frameworks that mandate algorithmic transparency and regular audits. There are also major opportunities to mandate that data used to train AI systems is more diverse and representative. The Global Task Force identified close to 700 such strategies, albeit over two thirds formulated in wealthy countries suggesting that more work needs to be done to close the gap. Curbing surveillance and privacy violations requires robust data protection and privacy laws to safeguard personal information. The European Union and countries like Brazil, India, Kenya, South Africa, and Tanzania, are developing agile regulatory frameworks tailored to their specific realities. There also needs to be clear regulation governing the use of AI for surveillance to minimize invasive practices as well as public awareness campaigns together with advocacy from civil society for stronger protections. And reducing over-dependence on foreign technology providers requires investment in local AI policy and research, alongside grants and incentives for local accelerators, start-ups and labs. International partnerships and collaboration also play a key role, such as programs to skill-up law makers and civil servants led by ITU, UNESCO, UNDP- as do dedicated centers for workforce training and education provided by groups such as Google, Intel, and Microsoft. Measures to reduce AI risks must address the gaping AI governance divide between the Global North and South. This gap is expressed not just in terms of data scientists and data centers, but also in terms of regulation. A key priority involves stepping-up the participation of Global South decision-makers and experts in AI policy development, including in the G20 and OECDcontexts. Notwithstanding legitimate concerns with regulatory fragmentation, AI governance frameworks also need to be aligned with local contexts. The recently agreed AI Strategy and Digital Transformation Strategy established by the African Union offers promising signposts. The good news is that a recent UN Resolution on Inclusive AI, High-Level Panel on AI, and Global Digital Compact are charting a positive path forward. The compact calls explicitly for more inclusive AI policy development, the standing-up of an independent scientific panel on AI, and a global dialogue to anchor AI in human rights. Perhaps most important, it also recommends the launch of a global fund to support digital infrastructure and skills development. Such a fund will need to make big bets (similar to those set out in private-led initiatives such as the recent fund launched by IBM and Blackrock if it is to help close the AI governance and capabilities gap.

Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:PDM) stock has soared to a 52-week high, reaching a price level of $10.28. This peak reflects a remarkable turnaround for the real estate investment trust, which specializes in office properties. Over the past year, Piedmont Office has witnessed an impressive 100.59% increase in its stock value, signaling strong investor confidence and a robust recovery from any prior market lows. The company's performance is particularly notable in the current economic climate, as it navigates through the evolving landscape of office real estate demand. In other recent news, Piedmont Office Realty Trust reported strong leasing growth in the second quarter of 2024, marking the highest quarterly volume in over a decade. The increase was driven by more than 400,000 square feet of new tenant leasing and significant renewals. Despite a decrease in Core FFO per diluted share for Q2 2024, reported at $0.37 down from $0.45 in Q2 2023, the company remains optimistic about future leasing trends. In related developments, Piedmont Office Realty Trust has appointed Sherry Rexroad as the new Chief Financial Officer (CFO), effective November 8, 2024. Rexroad brings extensive experience from her tenure at STORE Capital LLC and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Global Real Asset Securities. Additionally, the company has reported minimal damage to its Orlando properties following Hurricane Milton, underscoring the effectiveness of its management and preparedness strategies. Truist Securities has revised its outlook on Piedmont Office Realty Trust, raising the price target from $10.00 to $11.00, while maintaining a Buy rating. These recent developments indicate a period of significant activity and change for Piedmont Office Realty Trust. Piedmont Office Realty Trust's recent stock performance aligns with several key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. The company's stock is currently trading near its 52-week high, with a price that is 99.12% of its peak, confirming the article's observation. This surge is part of a broader trend, as InvestingPro data shows a substantial 109.49% price total return over the past year, slightly exceeding the 100.59% increase mentioned in the article. The company's strong momentum is further evidenced by its 55.25% price total return over the last six months. This performance is particularly noteworthy given the challenges faced by the office real estate sector. Despite these positive price movements, it's important to note that Piedmont Office Realty Trust has not been profitable over the last twelve months, with a negative P/E ratio of -32.8. InvestingPro Tips highlight that the company has maintained dividend payments for 15 consecutive years, which may be attractive to income-focused investors. The current dividend yield stands at 5.04%, although there has been a significant dividend growth decline of -40.48% in the last twelve months.

Previous reports suggested Musk, the owner of X and Tesla, was omitted from the guest list following controversial social media comments he made regarding Britain’s summer riots, where he controversially claimed civil war was “inevitable.” In response to the snub, Musk recently said on X: “I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts.” However, in an interview with Times Radio this morning, Kyle said: “Elon Musk has never come to any of the past investment summits that have been held under the previous government, he doesn’t tend to do these sort of events, but I stand absolutely ready to engage with him, to talk about any potential global investments he’s making – I’m not aware of any at this moment in time.” He added that “we have good engagement with some of his companies” and praised Musk for the safe landing of his booster rocket yesterday. On Sky News today, Kyle also denied that Musk was not invited because he called the prime minister “two tier Kier”. The international investment summit, taking place today, will see Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledge to slash red tape that is hindering investment in the UK. Australian infrastructure giant Macquarie is expected to announce £20bn in new investment in the UK, and total pledges from businesses at the summit could reach as high as £50bn. High profile speakers at the event include Blackrock boss Larry Fink, former Google chairman Eric Schmidt, ex-England manager Gareth Southgate, and Aviva chief Amanda Blanc.

Title: BlackRock’s Blood and Tears-Fueled Rise: How Does Infamous Vulture Fund Make Its Money?

Between 2008 and 2009, BlackRock’s assets under management climbed from $1.31 trillion to $3.35 trillion - a 250%+ boost in a single year. Surpassing the $4 trillion mark in 2014 to become the largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock more than doubled its fortune to $8.68 trillion six years later in 2020, as the Covid pandemic swept the globe. “I do believe, emotionally, those who truly believe in a capitalistic system will be flooding Ukraine with capital,” Larry Fink predicted in January 2023. “And I’m not talking about philanthropy…I’m talking about if we can rebuild Ukraine, it can be a beacon to the rest of the world of the power of capitalism,” the financier said. “What essentially is happening under the guise of attracting private investment for large-scale projects in key areas of the economy, is a transfer of state sovereignty to external corporate management of the world’s largest investment fund, headquartered in New York,” he said.

The reason, according to European asset manager CoinShares, is that they think a Republican in the White House now looks a bit more likely than before. CoinShares said in a Monday report that investors are now more concerned with who the next president will be, rather than economic data. And with polls showing narrower odds between the two candidates, the firm believes that it’s having an impact on crypto ETF investments. The Republican candidate for next month’s election, ex-President Donald Trump, has branded himself as the more crypto-friendly candidate. He told Bitcoiners he wants the asset to be produced solely in the U.S., he has a colorful history with NFT collectibles, and even is launching a DeFi project. “This trend is evident in the fact that stronger-than-expected economic data had little impact on stemming outflows, whereas the recent U.S. vice presidential debate and a subsequent shift in polling towards the Republicans, perceived as more supportive of digital assets, led to an immediate boost in inflows and prices,” the report said. The price of Bitcoin is up as a result: the biggest virtual coin is now trading for $65,642 per coin—a neary 3% seven-day rise, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin rose above the $66,000 mark earlier Monday for the first time this month. CoinShares said that investors put a total of $407 million in digital currency funds. Investors pulled money out of products giving exposure to Ethereum and short Bitcoin investment vehicles, aka funds that allow people to bet on the price of Bitcoin going down. Most of the focus last week was on Bitcoin-related investment funds, the firm said. There are funds all over the world that can give investors exposure to cryptocurrencies, but for Bitcoin, newly-approved exchange-traded funds (ETFs) trading on stock exchanges make the biggest impact. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the funds—released by Wall Street titans such as BlackRock and Fidelity—in January. Both candidates ahead of the election have adopted a crypto-friendly outlook—but Democratic Kamala Harris was late to admit positive plans for the industry. On Monday, though, the current Vice President said that she would support “a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets so Black men who invest in and own these assets are protected.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Pink Warriors ‘Swim in Pink’ for Breast Cancer Awareness in Greystones Greystones was awash in pink as hundreds of people gathered for the third annual ‘Swim in Pink’ fundraiser yesterday morning to raise funds for breast cancer. Participants of all ages took a dip in the chilly waters of the Irish Sea adorned in pink hats, wigs and swimsuits. The event was a heartwarming display of emotions with participants cheering and hugging each other. Lucianne Hughes, organiser of the ‘Swim in Pink’, described the event as a “wave of emotions”. “It's such an exciting day. It's very emotional for a lot of people, people who are going through treatment, people who have survived, people who have lost their loved ones.” The event began four years ago in Blackrock Beach Tower, Galway, as an initiative of the National Breast Cancer Research Institute. Ms Hughes was unable to attend the Galway event and took the initiative to organise a local event in Greystones three years ago. “I kind of thought it would be myself, my friends, my family, and maybe, you know, 20 people, 30 people, and about 150 people showed up the first year,” she said. The event has grown significantly since it started, attracting over 300 participants on Sunday. “Breast cancer touches so many people that it really does affect everybody. So yes, three years on, where it's just getting bigger and bigger every year,” she added. Among the participants was Sharon Felton, who shared her personal journey with breast cancer. After undergoing 16 rounds of chemotherapy, 10 rounds of radiation, and a lumpectomy, she is now cancer-free and overjoyed to be part of the event. "I'm so happy to be here today, just with these amazing people here, and also just to acknowledge the people out there that have lost their lives, and also the people that have beat breast cancer," said Ms Felton. Other swimmers like Jennifer Kehoe and Anne Rooney, highlighted that early detection is key and shared the significance of regular breast checks. “Always go to your GP, don't be afraid to get checked. Always keep an eye. Know your own body. Keep an eye on it, get checked,” they added. As of October 14, the Swim in Pink fundraiser has successfully raised €184,154, contributing to breast cancer research.

Title: CEO of Gargantuan Pro-ESG Company Defends Big Tech Monopoly on CNBC

ESG-obsessed BlackRock CEO Larry Fink strongly opposed holding Google accountable after the biased, pro-censorship search giant was declared a “monopolist” in court. Fink went to bat for Google, Apple and Amazon in response to a question from chronically wrong CNBC host Jim Cramer on the Oct. 11 edition of Squawk on the Street. Cramer, who slavishly praised Fink throughout the segment, asked the BlackRock CEO whether the government was right to take Google to court while tussling with Amazon and Apple. The leader of a Leviathan asset manager that uses the size of its investments to pressure companies argued that Big Tech needed to stay big. “I like the U.S. position in technology, and it seems odd that we are now questioning the scale of these companies,” Fink said. “These companies actually are going to get quite a bit larger.” U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta ruled on Aug. 5 in U.S. v. Google that “Google is a monopolist and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.” Specifically, Mehta found that Google has a monopoly in “general search services” and “general search text ads.” Over 90 percent of internet searches take place on Google and its subsidiary YouTube, amounting to billions of searches a day. The Department of Justice is considering serious consequences for Google, including possibly forcing the tech giant to “divest its Chrome browser and its Android operating system.” Fink did not agree, casting support for Big Tech as somehow patriotic. “I'm not in agreement with the government,” he said. “They may have more knowledge than I do so I can’t speak about the specifics, but at the same time, we say that we … have a competitive advantage right now against China, and you know, the key is about our relative strength in technology, and it seems odd, at the same time we're becoming more and more dependent on our technologies, and we're now talking about breaking up these technology companies?” Rather than serve any patriotic purpose, Google exploits its massive power for partisan ends, several MRC Free Speech America studies have found. Google has interfered in American elections on behalf of its preferred candidates at least 41 times from 2008 through early 2024. Google buried Trump’s campaign website so far down that it did not appear on the first page of results during the Republican National Convention and ahead of the July presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. The search giant also did this while Trump shortly after a guilty verdict following Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s politicized prosecution of him. More recently, Google has been caught burying the Trump campaign’s website beneath negative news about the former president, while pushing any news from American right-of-center publications deep down in the search results. Fink’s BlackRock, which controls trillions of assets, also abuses its power. Fink has boasted that BlackRock has been "forcing behaviors" to achieve goals on gender and race. The BlackRock CEO, who has always been a huge proponent of ESG investing, continues pushing for the world to move away from cheap and abundant energy. During an October interview with leftist billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s Bloomberg TV, Fink said that “we have to be decarbonizing,” as he discussed BlackRock’s future plans for promoting infrastructure.

Title: Data centers that power AI will soon hit limits of energy grid...
URL: https://www.semafor.com/article/10/11/2024/microsoft-azure-cto-us-data-centers-will-soon-hit-limits-of-energy-grid
Time Published: 2024-10-14T16:00:03Z
Full Content:
The data centers that make generative AI products like ChatGPT possible will soon reach size limits, according to Microsoft Azure Chief Technology Officer Mark Russinovich, necessitating a new method of connecting multiple data centers together for future generations of the technology. The most advanced AI models today need to be trained inside a single building where tens (and soon hundreds) of thousands of AI processors, such as Nvidiaâs H100s, can be connected so they act as one computer. But as Microsoft and its rivals compete to build the worldâs most powerful AI models, several factors, including Americaâs aging energy grid, will create a de facto cap on the size of a single data center, which soon could consume multiple gigawatts of power, equivalent to hundreds of thousands of homes. Already, some parts of the national grid are overwhelmed on hot days, when air conditioners are running full blast, forcing rolling blackouts and brownouts. Microsoft has been working furiously to help add capacity to the grid, inking a deal to reopen the Three Mile Island Nuclear power plant, launching a $30 billion fund for AI infrastructure with BlackRock and inking a $10 billion deal with Brookfield for green energy, among other projects. Overhauling the USâ energy infrastructure was a big part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which provided $3 billion in incentives for building out transmission lines, among other priorities. But companies like Microsoft canât afford to wait around for more money from Washington, on top of the time it would take to deploy those funds. Microsoft has also innovated on how GPUs are utilized to help data centers run more efficiently. Given their AI ambitions, a solution could be building data centers in multiple locations to avoid overloading any one regionâs power grid. It would be technically challenging, but it may be necessary, Russinovich told Semafor. âI think itâs inevitable, especially when you get to the kind of scale that these things are getting to,â he said. âIn some cases, that might be the only feasible way to train them is to go across data centers, or even across regions,â he said. Connecting data centers that are already pushing the limits of modern computer networking will be no small feat. Even linking two of them is a challenge, requiring fiber optic speeds that, until recently, were not possible over long distances. For this reason, Russinovich said it is likely the data centers would need to be near each other. He wasnât sure exactly when the effort would be required, but it would involve several Microsoft teams as well as OpenAI. It could be years before the effort is necessary. âI donât think weâre too far away,â he said. In this article: When the largest foundation models are trained, the computation is split up among tens or hundreds of thousands of AI processors (such as Nvidia GPUs). There are many versions of this so-called âparallelization,â but the general idea is to divvy up tasks so that each GPU is working constantly. During the process, data must travel back and forth between all the GPUs. If you imagined a large foundation model were a skyscraper and construction workers were GPUs, it would be like trying to get them all to work constantly at full speed during the entire project, while simultaneously communicating with one another so that everything got built in the correct order and followed the blueprints. Creating a perfectly synchronized system to build one massive AI model is a huge technical challenge and it often goes wrong. GPU failures (often from overheating) can ruin a training run. Even a lag in communication between GPUs could prove disastrous in training. Adding the complexity of multiple data centers spaced out geographically means there are even more things that could go wrong. Semiconductor analyst Patrick Moorhead, founder and CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, said data centers are pushing the limits in a lot of areas. For instance, theyâve moved to more efficient liquid cooling systems, something that, before the era of massive AI data centers, was considered unnecessary. Data centers may reach a point where the cooling systems alone become the bottleneck, drawing too much power from the grid or becoming too inefficient when reaching a certain size. Chinese hyperscalers have already been experimenting with connecting multiple data centers to train AI models, Moorhead said. Those efforts, however, donât employ the most powerful AI chips, which are illegal for US companies to sell there. While connecting two data centers is challenging, some people believe training an AI model might one day be possible with smaller computers spread out all over the world. Companies like Gensyn are working on new methods of training AI models that can take advantage of essentially any kind of compute, whether from a less powerful CPU or a GPU. The idea is an exponentially more complicated version of SETI@home, an experiment that allowed anyone to use their computer to help analyze radio telescope data, in hopes of detecting extraterrestrial life. For now, training the biggest and most powerful AI models needs to be centralized, even if two or three data centers can train the same model simultaneously. But if Russinovichâs idea is a first step toward a truly distributed method of training AI models, it would be a big deal and could eventually make AI training more accessible to those who donât have billions of dollars. It would also mean AI chips, like Nvidiaâs GPUs, wouldnât be as important. You could use less advanced chips but connect more of them to get the same level of compute. Chip makers are already bending over backwards to make a single processor more powerful. Nvidiaâs Blackwell chips are really two separate ones combined. Cerebras makes one the size of a dinner plate. And TSMC is working on ways to make chips even bigger. Whatâs cool about the effort to push AI training and inference in the distributed direction is that it opens up new avenues for startups to innovate and potentially disrupt incumbents.

Title: From Art Heritage To Innovation: Leadership Lessons In Sustainability

Aparna Prabhakar, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Sustainability, Schneider Electric. "The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there." This timeless quote from English writer L.P. Hartley serves as a poignant reminder that the past, with its valuable insights and lessons, provides context for our present actions. As we navigate the challenges and opportunities of today, it's essential to draw inspiration from the past while recognizing the need for innovative solutions tailored to our current circumstances. But there's that other turn of phrase that comes to us from Einstein: "We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them." In August 2024, I had the privilege of visiting Padua, Italy. There, I discovered a hidden gem: the Scrovegni Chapel. Standing beneath the breathtaking blue fresco painted by Giotto, a master of the Renaissance, provided an experience that stays with me. The chapel's interior is one of the artist’s masterpieces—rows of painted vignettes bathed in warm morning sunlight. The colors are so vibrant and the details so intricate that it's hard to believe they were created centuries ago. The chapel's delicate frescoes have only recently undergone extensive meticulous restoration and ongoing protection. They offer a glimpse into a bygone era. Yet, beneath the beauty of the chapel’s painted walls lies a valuable lesson for our time: the necessity of planning for a sustainable future. The chapel offers a microcosm of research into temperature and humidity levels to prevent further damage. Then, steps were taken to ensure the long-term preservation of these peerless treasures. However, protecting something priceless can be very difficult indeed. The world grapples with the consequences of climate change, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events and the depletion of natural resources. We see the reminders of the past as they become our present. And thus, it becomes imperative to adopt a similar forward-thinking approach. Every action we take, from the products we consume to the energy we use, has implications for the future. • Understand the risks. Identify how and which environmental and social factors could impact your business. By anticipating potential challenges, you can develop strategies to mitigate risks and seize opportunities. • Invest in sustainability. Allocate resources for sustainable initiatives to reduce your carbon footprint, improve energy efficiency and source sustainable materials. • Adopt a long-term perspective. Take a page out of the chapel’s book—create a five- or 10-year road map with benchmarks and continual progress evaluation. Focus not just on backward measurement but also on creating opportunities to model forward outcomes. • Engage with stakeholders. Collaborate with employees, customers, suppliers and communities to address sustainability challenges and create shared value. Work up and down the value chain to increase supplier sustainability and compliance. Help educate the marketplace at regular intervals. • Communicate your sustainability efforts. Share your goals and progress with stakeholders. Transparency can build trust and enhance your brand reputation. As corporate leaders, we have a unique opportunity to drive positive change. By prioritizing sustainability in our business practices, we can contribute to a brighter future. Here are some questions to consider: • How can we integrate sustainability into our core business strategy? Are there opportunities to develop sustainable products and services? Can sustainable factors be considered at the bill-of-materials level? • How can we reduce our carbon footprint and minimize our environmental impact? Don’t let goals exist only at the top levels—they must be built bottom up. How can we get granular in assigning targets and tracking progress? • How can we engage our employees and stakeholders in sustainability initiatives? Are there opportunities for employee education, volunteerism and community outreach? Is there a segment of our employees who will give voice to our actions? • How can we measure and report on our sustainability performance? Are we transparent about our environmental impact and progress toward our sustainability goals? Honesty is harder when operating environments are under threat. Yet, greenwashing does no one any favors. We need to continually assess and share where we are—and what we're doing about it. At my home base, Schneider Electric, we call these corporate leaders "Impact Makers." They are the innovators and visionaries who drive these principles. They ask hard questions and create sustainable solutions, driving a better future in their industries. Here are a few examples: • Hewlett Packard Enterprise has set a net zero-goal across its entire supply chain by 2040. They’re developing ambitious energy-efficient solutions such as their GreenLake platform. • Ramboll, a global engineering and consultancy firm, partnered with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and has established a target of having 70% of their suppliers set science-based targets for 2028, focused on supply chain sustainability. • As one of the world's largest asset managers, BlackRock is integrating sustainability into its investment processes and its own carbon footprint. They engage companies on climate resilience, electrification and clean energy innovations. The Scrovegni Chapel's story is a powerful reminder of the proactive measures we must take to ensure a sustainable future. By prioritizing sustainability in our business practices, we not only help protect our planet but also create a lasting legacy for future generations.

Title: Futures mixed before earnings-heavy week; key economic data on tap
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/futures-mixed-ahead-of-week-packed-with-earnings-economic-data-3661145
Time Published: 2024-10-14T11:46:31Z

By David French (Reuters) -Wall Street ended higher on Monday, with both the S&P 500 and the Dow posting fresh record finishes, as investors bought into technology stocks ahead of a busy week packed with corporate earnings and crucial economic data. On a somewhat subdued day for trading, given bond markets were shut due to the federal holiday, just 9.55 billion shares changed hands, versus the 12.05 billion shares, which moved on average over the last 20 trading days. However, there was enough upward momentum carried over from Friday, when major banks kicked off the third-quarter corporate earnings season on a positive note, to send the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 43,000 points for the first time. With 41 S&P 500 companies expected to report results this week, this flood of new data points from corporate America will help investors assess the health of the U.S. economy, and whether companies can continue to justify stretched stock market valuations. Before then though, it was technology stocks, which helped drive markets higher on Monday with semiconductors particularly in vogue. An index of semiconductor companies jumped 1.8% to a more than two-month high, aided by the 6.8% advance by Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), as well as market heavyweight Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which rose 2.4% to a record close. The information technology index was a leading gainer among the S&P 500 sectors, rising 1.4%. Among other growth stocks, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all advanced between 0.6% and 1.6%. The S&P 500 gained 44.82 points, or 0.77%, to 5,859.85 points, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 159.75 points, or 0.87%, to 18,502.69. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 201.36 points, or 0.47%, to 43,065.22. Despite the Dow's positive milestone, its gains on Monday were kept in check by a 2% drop in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), following a brokerage downgrade, and a 1.3% fall in Boeing (NYSE:BA) after the planemaker flagged a larger-than-expected Q3 loss on Friday. Bank earnings may have boosted hopes that solid results could help stocks continue their strong 2024 run. However, with stock valuations stretched - the S&P 500 is trading at 21.8 times forward earnings, versus a long-term average of 15.7 - companies might struggle to satisfy investors. Year-over-year third-quarter earnings growth for the S&P 500 is estimated at 4.9%, according to data compiled by LSEG on Friday. "If you think about the earnings backdrop going into it, I would expect the bias to probably lead to the upside in this earnings cycle," said Kevin McCullough, portfolio consultant at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. "It's not like the prior earnings cycles where you went in with a really lofty set of expectations and it was really hard for companies to deliver on that," he said, adding because the bar was now a little bit lower, it was easier for investors to see company reports in a positive light. Among those reporting numbers on Tuesday are a slew of big-name financials, including Bank of America and Citigroup, as well as healthcare giants Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). Investors will also watch for crucial economic data this week, notably the September retail sales figures, for clues on the financial health of U.S. consumers. Natixis' McCullough said consumer-related data is becoming more important for clues on Fed thinking, as the central bank switches more towards fulfilling the growth side of its mandate. The two Fed speakers on Monday both adopted cautious tones on future rate policy. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he sees modest interest-rate cuts ahead as inflation hovers near the central bank's 2% target. Speaking this afternoon, Fed Governor Christopher Waller called for "more caution" on interest-rate cuts going forward.

Monday Tee Up: Corporate America Checks In The third-quarter earnings floodgates open this week, despite Monday being a partial holiday (with the bond markets closed). Wall Street will be focused on retail sales data, looking for updates on consumer spending. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was higher by 1.2%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both gained 1.1%. For the year, the DJIA is higher by 14%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have both popped 22%. The earnings calendar this week is packed with big companies from a range of sectors. On Tuesday, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Charles Schwab, PNC Financial, State Street, United Airlines, Johnson & Johnson, and United Health all report. On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley, U.S. Bancorp, Discover Financial, and Abbott Labs weight in. On Thursday, it's Netflix and Travelers, and on Friday, American Express and Procter & Gamble step up to the plate. Earnings grew 13% in the second quarter. We expect 3Q earnings growth of 5%-7%. For full year, we forecast roughly a 7%-9% gain. In the 3Q, we expect Information Technology, Communication Services, and Healthcare to be the sectors that shine. On the economic calendar, Retail Sales will be updated on Thursday, as will Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization. On Friday, Housing Starts and Building Permits will be released. Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, is highlighting Retail Sales as the call of the week. Chris expects the September report to show an annual increase of 2.2%. He adds that 'the report will be a timely health check on consumers ahead of the important holiday season. Employed consumers do their best to make the holidays special for the people they care about. The decline in the September unemployment rate to 4.1% should be a positive catalyst for shopping in November and December.' Last week, there were mixed signals on inflation. CPI slowed to 2.4% for September, down from 2.5% in August. Core CPI ticked up to 3.3% for September, compared to 3.2% in August. Looking deeper into core inflation data, the widely-watched shelter component is still proving to be sticky, with a rise of 4.9%. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that this one component accounts for more than 65% of the total 12-month increase. Other categories with sizable increases include motor vehicle insurance, up 16%, and medical care, up 3.3%. Mort GS PNC STT SCHW C

It would offer in-kind Ethereum subscriptions and redemptions—a feature absent in U.S. crypto ETFs. Monochrome Asset Management is set to debut Australia’s first spot Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Cboe Australia, marking a major step in the nation’s cryptocurrency investment landscape. Building on the success of its Bitcoin [BTC] ETF (IBTC) launched in August 2023—which has already attracted $15 million in assets—Monochrome’s new Ether ETF (IETH) aims to provide Australian investors with direct exposure to ETH. For those unaware, on 5th September, the asset manager filed an application hoping to secure approval by month’s end. Fortunately, after a swift approval process unlike the recent regulatory movements in the U.S., the IETH trading is set to commence on 14th October. Though modest compared to U.S. funds with billions in holdings, the Australian fund distinguishes itself globally by offering in-kind Ethereum subscriptions and redemptions. Providing further insights on the same, Jeff Yew, CEO of Monochrome Asset Management, highlighted a unique tax efficiency feature of the IETH in an exclusive interview with a publication. He explained that the fund’s dual-access bare trust structure is designed to avoid capital gains tax events, offering a strategic advantage for long-term Ethereum holders. This structure enables investors to transfer their Ethereum into the ETF without a shift in legal and beneficial ownership, potentially enhancing the tax advantages of in-kind subscriptions and redemptions. Yew added, “A ‘bare trust’ means that your investment in the ETF may be treated as if you directly own the Ethereum.” In fact, when IBTC gained momentum with its ETF in-kind subscription model, Yew said, “We are starting to see an interesting pattern with our Bitcoin ETF; people are moving their custody points from crypto exchanges into the ETF; that’s actually where we are seeing the biggest growth from.” That being said, recent U.S. ETF data reveals contrasting trends: as of 11th October, Bitcoin ETFs saw significant inflows, with $253.6 million added, while Ethereum ETFs recorded minor outflows of $0.1 million. Despite these contrasting trends, industry giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity maintain optimism for Ethereum’s potential. Although the Australian market is unlikely to replicate such high inflows, Monochrome aims to tap into the growing local interest in crypto investments, hoping to expand its presence as investor enthusiasm continues to build this year. “US crypto ETFs can’t be supported in kind, including Bitcoin ETFs, and they are not operated in this timezone.” In conclusion, the Monochrome Ethereum ETF (IETH) would offer Australian investors broad accessibility through major brokerage platforms, supporting crypto exchange and wallet transfers. With fees set at 0.5%, reduced to 0.21% for accredited advisers, it aligns closely with U.S. market rates, i.e. 0.20%- 0.25%. Hence, positioned for growth, IETH is well-prepared to capture any resurgence in market demand.

Title: Asia’s IPO bankers look beyond China slump with $6 billion week
URL: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/10/14/india-japan-ipo-hyundai-tokyo-metro-china-new-listings-this-week/
Time Published: 2024-10-14T10:30:45Z
Full Content:
Bankers are working on more than $6 billion of initial public offerings in Japan and India this week, getting a boost from two markets that have become an increasingly important revenue source amid a prolonged deal slump in China. Listings from [hotlink]Hyundai Motor[/hotlink] Co.’s India unit, subway operator Tokyo Metro Co. and Japanese X-ray technology company Rigaku Holdings Corp. will push IPO volumes in Asia Pacific excluding China past $28 billion, comfortably beating the $23.7 billion sold in 2023, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The deals underscore the increasing reliance on Japan and India among investment bankers who for years looked to China for bumper deal fees. Chinese listings have raised just over $20 billion this year, down from about $136 billion in 2021, after regulators increased their scrutiny of new deals and investors backed away amid concerns about the economy. The rise in Asia Pacific ex-China volumes has been fueled by more than $9 billion of supply from India, one of the biggest beneficiaries of investors’ doubts about China over the past year. “The stars are aligned in many respects,” Rahul Saraf, India head of investment banking at Citigroup Inc., said of the nation’s IPO market. Many Indian businesses have matured enough to list, and a stable political environment has provided a good backdrop for deals, he added. Hyundai Motor Co.’s India unit is taking orders this week for a $3.3 billion share sale, on track to be the country’s largest ever IPO. The deal has already seen solid demand, with BlackRock Inc., Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte and Capital Group among those to bid for the company’s shares, Bloomberg News reported last week. India’s busy market for share sales is leading to some concerns about a bubble. Regulators have cracked down on irregularities such as financial statement fraud and price manipulation, eager to bolster the credibility of India’s capital markets ahead of major IPOs in the pipeline. The country’s IPO mania will eventually fizzle, but that doesn’t mean the market will abruptly turn south, said Nitin Mathur, an associate investment director at Fidelity International. “There could be a period of volatility because valuations in some areas of the market are expensive,” he said. But that wouldn’t be a bad thing for the long-term health of the market, he added. There have been recent signs of life for bankers working on listings for Chinese companies, with appliance maker Midea Group Co.’s recent $4.6 billion share sale in Hong Kong providing an optimistic backdrop for other deals. In Japan this week, subway operator Tokyo Metro Co. is expected to price an up to $2.3 billion listing, the country’s largest in six years, while X-ray technology company Rigaku Holdings Corp. is slated to raise more than $730 million from its own Tokyo listing. Long-only investors have covered the entire international tranche of Tokyo Metro’s IPO, Bloomberg News reported last week. Rigaku’s share sale was also said to have seen international order books being covered within a day of the deal’s launch. “Large-scale IPOs like that of Tokyo Metro attract significant attention from overseas investors,” said Chizuru Morishita, a researcher at NLI Research Institute. “If successful, it could make it easier for other companies to enter the market.” A rally in Japanese shares and a push for companies to boost shareholder returns and cut cross-shareholdings with other firms have provided a rosy backdrop for share sales in the country. Hyundai Motor India is expected to list its shares on Oct. 22. Tokyo Metro is set to debut on Oct. 23, and Rigaku on Oct. 25. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Morning Bid: China doubts as economy struggles, US bonds closed

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan With U.S. Treasury markets closed on Monday, Wall Street stocks are set to cruise on higher into the unfolding corporate earnings season - but may first have to take early direction from China's weekend stimulus update. The Colombus Day holiday closes Federal offices and the bond market but the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq remain open and stock futures are higher first thing, building on the S&P500's latest charge to new record highs. Financials led the way on Friday as the early burst of big bank and asset manager earnings was cheered - with 3-6% share price gains on Friday for the likes of JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and BlackRock. On Monday, however, China's markets struggled for direction as Saturday's much-heralded press conference on fiscal measures to accompany the recent frantic monetary easing turned out to be a bit of a damp squib. A little short on the sort of details investors had been betting on, Finance Minister Lan Foan reiterated Beijing's broad plans to revive the ailing economy, with promises made on increases to government debt and support for consumers and the property sector. Chinese mainland stocks gyrated initially and eventually ended more than 1% higher. But Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended 0.75% in the red. The offshore yuan weakened slightly against a red-hot dollar. Depending on who you talk to, you'll get a different readout on Beijing's rescue plans. But what's not in doubt is that they are badly needed. The latest economic news from China shows the country still flirting with outright price deflation through September, as headline annual consumer prices fell below forecast to just 0.4% and annual factory gate price inflation continued to slump a whopping 2.8% rate during the month. What's more, China's exports missed too - growing at the slowest pace in five months in September and suggesting manufacturers are no longer rushing out orders ahead of tariffs from trade partners. But at a paltry 0.3%, annual imports growth slowed too and were a third of expectations. While some banks such as Goldman Sachs have nudged up next year's real GDP forecasts due to the stimulus measures, the price picture raises questions about nominal growth and still suggests the government's 5% growth targets will be hard to hit. And the geopolitics doesn't help much. China's military launched a new round of war games near Taiwan on Monday, saying it was a warning to the "separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces" - drawing condemnation from the Taipei and U.S. governments. Taiwan's giant chipmaker TSMC, the main producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, reports earnings on Thursday and is expected to show a 40% leap in third-quarter profit thanks to soaring AI-related demand. Oil prices weakened on the latest sweep of Chinese data and policy details, with some of the weekend premium on Middle East concerns dissipating on Monday too. Speculation over how Israel will respond to recent Iranian rocket attacks continues to simmer, however, with attention on Monday focussing on a U.S. decision to send both U.S. troops and anti-missile systems to Israel Even though last week's U.S. inflation numbers ran a bit hotter than forecast, the energy price picture remains relatively contained and annual U.S. crude prices have now been falling at a 10%-plus pace for more than six weeks. In Europe, markets are shaping up this week for the third European Central Bank interest rate cut of the year on Thursday. European stock were flat - warily eyeing both the muddy Chinese picture as trade tensions between Brussels and Beijing jar, but also likely further credit easing at home. LVMH, Hermes, Kering and other French luxury stocks exposed to China fell between 1.4% and 3.6% on Monday. The euro ebbed slightly into the ECB decision, with another quarter point cut in the official deposit rate to 3.25% now more or less fully priced. French debt markets and risk spreads shrugged off Friday's decision by Fitch credit ratings firm to lower the outlook on France's sovereign rating following the country's latest deficit-cutting budget plan last week. In Britain, Prime Minister Keir Starmer will vow to scrap regulation that holds back growth and investment when he hosts some of the world's biggest businesses on Monday at a conference designed to boost Britain's appeal. Back stateside, a relatively quiet Monday is likely as a result of the semi holiday. The earnings season resumes in earnest on Tuesday with updates from Goldman, Bank of America, Citigroup, State Street, Johnson & Johnson and others. Politics also gets more intense as the November 5 election nears. Although national opinion polls and those in swing states still show little between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, betting markets are making Trump slight favorite again for the first time since July.

Shares in mainland China rose as investors digested Beijing’s Saturday briefing on stimulus measures, in which the finance minister said more was needed but didn’t offer specifics. Japan’s markets were closed for a public holiday. China: Shares rise after stimulus briefing Shanghai’s SSE Composite rose 2.07% after Finance Minister Lan Fo’an said in a Saturday briefing that there was “ample room” in the budget for more spending and that other policy tools were “being discussed.” But he offered no specifics on which stimulus measures or how large they would be. China also reported trade numbers, with exports in dollar terms growing 2.4% annually in September and imports expanding 0.3%—both below expectations. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slid 0.75%. Europe: Shares hover as traders weigh China stimulus and expected rate cut European stocks floundered around breakeven early Monday as traders digested the China stimulus briefing and its lack of details. Luxury stocks with major exposure to China slipped, with LVMH, Hermès, and Kering all dropping more than 2% in the morning. The euro slipped marginally against the dollar, with the European Central Bank expected to cut interest rates at its Thursday meeting. The Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.04% and the FTSE 100 was down 0.05% in morning trading. U.S. premarket mixed after hitting record territory After Wall Street rode into new record territory Friday on the back of strong earnings from financial giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock, the main U.S. indexes were mixed in premarket trading Monday as investors digested the China briefing—and prepared for more big bank earnings. After being punished Friday for its underwhelming robo-taxi reveal, Tesla rebounded 1.7% before the opening bell, while Boeing took a 1.5% drop on the back of its Friday announcement of 10% layoffs. And earnings season continues… Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Citigroup all show their numbers Tuesday; Morgan Stanley reports Wednesday; Netflix has its turn Thursday; and Friday features P&G and American Express. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Futures muted, earnings this week, Boeing job cuts - what's moving markets
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/futures-muted-earnings-this-week-boeing-job-cuts--whats-moving-markets-3661019

Investing.com -- US stock futures were muted on Monday after the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched fresh record closes in the prior session thanks in large part to higher-than-expected earnings from two big Wall Street banks. More results are due out this week, including figures from streaming video titan Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) is reportedly preparing to deliver more details about planned job cuts as the jetmaker grapples with a financially-damaging work stoppage. 1. Futures muted US stock futures hovered around the flatline on Monday, with investors gauging upcoming corporate earnings and economic data this week. By 03:26 ET (07:26 GMT), the Dow futures contract and S&P 500 futures were mostly unchanged, and Nasdaq 100 futures had fallen by 11 points or 0.1%. On Friday, the benchmark S&P 500 and 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average logged record closes, buoyed by better-than-anticipated results from Wall Street banking giants JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo. Asset manager Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) also unveiled an all-time peak in assets under management. Along with outpacing expectations, analysts at Vital Knowledge said the returns helped bolster confidence that the US economy is on track for a so-called "soft landing," in which a period of elevated interest rates successfully quells inflation without igniting a sharp downturn in the labor market or broader economy. 2. Earnings season kicks into gear More big banks are due to report in the coming week, including Bank of America and Citigroup on Tuesday, while Netflix is due to report after the close on Thursday. Investors will be closely watching results from Netflix -- specifically whether the streaming service is adding or losing customers and at what pace -- for insights into the state of consumer spending. Companies will need to top expectations for profit growth in their quarterly reports to support the stock market's valuation, which stands well above its historical average. Third quarter earnings results should confirm that large-cap corporate profit growth remains solid, analysts at UBS said in a note on Friday. "Now that the Fed has started its rate-cutting cycle, the economy should get a further boost from lower interest rates on things like credit card debt and business loans." 3. Boeing job cut details expected - reports Managers at Boeing are due to find out more details on Monday about the aerospace giant's plan to slash around 17,000 positions, media reports have said. The cuts, which will amount to 10% of Boeing's global headcount, will reportedly have an impact on roles around the business and include executives, managers and staff. The firm will also delay the first deliveries of its 777X plane by a year and book $5 billion in losses in the third quarter, according to the reports. Boeing Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg told employees on Friday that "tough decisions," such as structural changes, will be needed to bolster the performance of the wider group and ensure its long-term competitiveness. Ortberg has been attempting to navigate Boeing through a prolonged strike by workers in the US Pacific Northwest that is leading to heavy expenses and placing its bond rating in jeopardy of slipping into junk territory. Analysts have said that the company will need to raise at least $10 billion in fresh financing to shore up its finances. 4. Chinese stocks rise despite middling stimulus cues, weak inflation data Chinese stocks brushed off initial volatility and clocked gains on Monday, rising even as the government provided middling cues on fiscal stimulus and inflation data underwhelmed. China’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes closed higher by 1.9% and 2.1% respectively. The two were choppy in morning trading. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, which has more exposure to foreign investors, fell 0.1%, trimming a bulk of its initial losses after falling more than 2% earlier. China’s finance ministry said in a weekend briefing that it will implement fiscal stimulus measures, including more debt issuance and support for provincial governments. But the government did not provide key details on the timing and scale of the plans. Calls for more aid from Beijing were further boosted by weaker-than-expected Chinese consumer and factory price inflation in September. 5. Oil slips amid China woes Oil prices fell sharply Monday, retreating after the Chinese inflation data and fiscal stimulus plans raised doubts about the health of the country's economy. By 03:27 ET, the Brent contract dropped 1.6% to $77.78 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 1.7% lower at $74.30 a barrel. Figures released over the weekend showed consumer price growth in China unexpectedly eased in September, while producer prices marked nearly two years of contraction -- data which bodes poorly for demand in the world’s biggest oil importer. A monthly report from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is due later in the day and is likely to provide more cues on supply, while the Middle East conflict remains in focus.

Title: Big business backs UK despite Budget tax threat

The chancellor has given the clearest signal yet that businesses will face an increase in National Insurance on the day the government announced billions of pounds in overseas investment had been secured. Rachel Reeves said Labour's election pledge not to increase National Insurance on "working people" related to the employee element, as opposed to the sum paid by employers. Her comments come as businesses await the new government's economic plans in the Budget later this month. The government claimed its international investment summit on Monday secured £63bn of private funding for UK projects. However, many of the commitments had already been announced in advance. While the investment pledges signal a boost for the government, many business leaders are closely watching what taxes will be hiked on 30 October. Reeves reiterated her Budget would be "tough", but stressed difficult decisions would not put off business investment in the UK because she would offer firms long-term certainty about the levels of taxation they will face. The government has ruled out increasing VAT, National Insurance or income tax, speculation has grown around the rate of National Insurance paid by employers. Reeves repeated the pledge not to raise taxes on "working people" - echoing comments from Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds - but only pledged to cap corporation tax, the levy paid by businesses on profits, at 25% for the next five years. There is also speculation over a potential rise in Capital Gains Tax, which is charged on profits made from the sale of an asset that has increased in value, such as second homes. However, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Bloomberg reports suggesting a rise as high as 39% were "wide of the mark", although he did not elaborate further. The chancellor did hint that she might change the government's borrowing rules to free up billions of pounds more in spending for big projects. "We do want to free up investment in those long-term responsible investments that we need to make, to unlock the private investment into our economy," she said. Some of the new investment pledges from firms on Monday include: Separately on Monday, Sir Keir defended the government's plans to overhaul and increase workers' rights as "pro-growth". He told the summit he would scrap regulation that "holds back investment" and would ask regulators to prioritise economic growth. The government's Employment Rights Bill includes proposals that would see people being able to get sick pay from the first day they are ill and claim unpaid parental leave as soon as they start a job. Most of the planned changes will not take effect for two years, but some business groups are concerned about how they would work in practice and impact hiring. But Sir Keir said greater security for workers would lead to better growth in the economy. Former Tory donor John Caudwell, the founder of Phones 4U who came out in favour of Labour ahead of the general election, told the BBC he was "not very keen" on Labour's plans to increase workers' rights, calling them "a real burden on business". But he said businesses and potential investors, would "swallow the difficulties that come as a result of that extra regulation on employee rights" if the wider goal of growing the economy was met. Sir Keir also said he wanted to "rip out" bureaucracy obstructing investment in the UK. Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of internet giant Google, told Sir Keir at the event that delays to regulation were "killing you". "I think the business community would much rather have a single person who can say yes or no... and then they can move on," he said. The head of insurance giant Aviva, Amanda Blanc, said simplifying planning procedures was key. "We can commit to doing projects but if you can’t get the planning permission you could be sitting with a project for two to three years where you’ve got money ready to go," she said. The boss of Eli Lilly, David Ricks, who also attended the event, said the UK had to take a "different" approach to attract multinationals given it was no longer part of the EU. Earlier this month it emerged that the world's richest person, Elon Musk, had not been invited to the investment summit. But Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said the billionaire would have been "very, very welcome". "We would love to engage with Elon Musk," Kyle said. "If he opens up an investment programme and there is global competition for it, believe me we will be first in line." Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

October 14, 2024 01:30 ET | Source: NICOX SA NICOX SA Press Release Nicox and Soleus Sign $16.5 million Royalty and Equity Financing October 14, 2024 – release at 7:30 am CETSophia Antipolis, France Nicox SA (Euronext Growth Paris: FR0013018124, ALCOX), an international ophthalmology company, today announced that it has entered into a royalty purchase agreement with Soleus Capital Credit Opportunities Fund I, L.P. (and any affiliated entity, “Soleus”), an investment fund managed by Soleus Capital Management, L.P. (“Soleus Capital”), a US-based life sciences investment firm. Soleus will acquire Nicox’s VYZULTA royalty (net of payments to Pfizer), for $15 million (€13.7 million), together with a subscription of $1.5 million (€1.37 million) for Units comprised of one share with one attached warrant (the “Units”) at €0.3144 per Unit, representing 120% of Nicox's closing share price on 11 October 2024, on the terms set out below. The warrants (the “Warrants”) give the right to acquire a maximum of 1,308,077 Nicox shares at a price of €0.5240 per share, which is a 100% premium to the closing price of Nicox’s ordinary shares on October 11, 2024. Exercise of the warrants would result in additional gross proceeds of €0.69 million. The Company has also entered into agreement with its existing lenders to release the guarantee held over VYZULTA, including, amongst other obligations, the repayment of €5.2 million of outstanding debt by June 2025, as set out below. “VYZULTA was the first nitric oxide donating compound from Nicox’s research to be marketed. The agreements announced today allow us to effectively monetize our VYZULTA revenue stream, creating an immediate source of cash to finance the development of our lead asset, NCX 470, whilst also bringing in a new, specialist investor, investing at a premium, to accompany our future development.” said Gavin Spencer, Chief Executive Officer of Nicox. “In addition, we are able to announce that the accelerated recruitment of patients in the Denali Phase 3 clinical trial of NCX 470 has brought the expected date of topline data into Q3 2025. With our financing needs addressed until Q3 2025, we look forward to the completion of recruitment in the Denali trial, together with the launch of ZERVIATE in China, where it was recently approved, bringing a new revenue stream to the Company.” “We are excited to partner with Nicox on this transaction, providing the company runway towards its key value inflection point of clinical data for its Phase 3 Denali trial. In addition to providing non-dilutive capital in the form of the VYZULTA royalty monetization, we also look forward to accompanying Nicox as shareholders as they continue their work to bring NCX 470 to the market and develop their partnerships,” said Benjamin Lund, Partner at Soleus Capital. Soleus Capital is an investment firm based in Greenwich, CT focused on the innovative areas of life sciences, including biopharmaceuticals, medical technologies, life sciences tools and diagnostics. With approximately $2.2 billion in total assets under management as of October 1, 2024, Soleus Capital invests across the healthcare lifecycle from developmental-stage through commercial, and partners with life science companies across the capital structure. Nicox was advised by Bourne Partners with Lexelians and Farber LLC law firms serving as legal advisors. Soleus was advised by Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP and Racine. Cash Runway Based on the cash and cash equivalents held by the Company, the net proceeds from the transactions announced today, after deduction of legal, banking and other fees, and expected milestone income from existing agreements, the Company estimates that it is financed into Q3 2025. If any of the assumptions around estimated income, recovery of taxes or costs change, this may impact the cash runway of the Company. The Company continues to evaluate all options for non-dilutive and dilutive financing to extend its cash runway. In particular, the Company is actively exploring multiple strategic options which could facilitate the development and commercialization of its drug candidate NCX 470 and the future growth of the Company. NCX 470 (bimatoprost grenod) Development update NCX 470 is a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop, based on the same technology as VYZULTA, and is currently in a second pivotal Phase 3 trial, Denali, in the U.S. and China for the lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The topline data from the Denali trial is now expected in Q3 2025 and the Company intends to commercialize NCX 470 in the U.S. through a partnership. NCX 470 is already partnered in China and Southeast Asia with Ocumension, who expects to be able to file a Chinese New Drug Application following completion of the Denali trial, and with Kowa in Japan, where additional clinical trials will be required. Upcoming milestones About VYZULTA VYZULTA, exclusively licensed worldwide to Bausch + Lomb, is a prostaglandin analog with one of its metabolites being NO. VYZULTA is indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in the U.S. At approval, VYZULTA was the first eye drop approved in the past 20 years with a novel approach to reduce IOP. VYZULTA is commercialized in more than 15 countries, including the U.S. where it is covered by a composition of matter patent to 2029. VYZULTA was licensed exclusively to Bausch + Lomb globally in 2010 and was launched in the U.S. in 2017. Prior to the transaction with Soleus, Nicox received 6% net royalties on global sales, net of royalties payable to Pfizer, per the terms of the contract signed with Pfizer in August 2009, with a $5 million net milestone payable to Nicox at $100 million net sales. Nicox received net royalty revenue of over €4 million in 2023, the majority of which was from VYZULTA sales. Terms of the VYZULTA Royalty Sale to Soleus Under the terms of the agreement, Nicox will receive a payment from Soleus of $15 million (€13.7 million), less certain expenses. In exchange for this payment, Soleus will receive all royalties and milestone payments due to Nicox from VYZULTA sales since 1 July 2024 and in the future, net of payments to Pfizer, per the terms of the contract signed with Pfizer in August 2009. Payments to Pfizer and to Soleus will be made by Bausch + Lomb at the direction of Soleus and Nicox. The agreement includes other customary provisions for a transaction of this nature. The agreement with Soleus only covers VYZULTA revenue and does not include any other Nicox products nor product candidates. In addition to this payment of $15 million Nicox will receive a $1.5 million (€1.37 million) equity financing as detailed below. Terms of the Amendment to the existing Debt Agreement Nicox will make debt repayments of €5.2 million to its existing lender Kreos Capital VI (UK) Limited (together with its affiliates “Kreos”1) by June 2025 and the interest rate on the outstanding debt shall remain at 9.25%. Such repayments will reduce the amortizable portion of the debt, currently representing €11.8 million, out of a total debt with Kreos of €19.4 million. Nicox will also pay a 1% restructuring fee on capital outstanding to Kreos. Kreos will release the security held over VYZULTA and will take an additional security over NCX 470. The other elements of the debt, set out in the Company’s Annual Report 2023, remain unchanged, except as explained below. In addition, Kreos shall be entitled to: Terms of the Capital Increase by Soleus Capital stock before the Transaction Nicox's paid-in capital consists of 64,233,248 fully subscribed and paid-up shares with a par value of €0.01 each. Nature and legal basis of the Transaction Using the authorization granted under the eighth resolution of the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of May 6, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors, meeting on October 11, 2024, voted to make a share capital increase without pre-emptive rights through the issue of Units consisting of shares with attached warrants, in the manner described in this announcement. Number of shares to be issued The total number of Units, each including one share with a par value of €0.01, to be issued is 4,360,256, at a unit subscription price of €0.3144, giving gross proceeds of €1.37 million (representing €43,602.56 of par value plus €1,327,261.93 of new issue premium). Each Unit will carry one Warrant, which is immediately detachable. 10 Warrants will be worth 3 new shares if exercised before 10 October 2034, at the strike price of €0.5240. Exercise of all the warrants would represent additional gross proceeds of around €0.69 million. Subscription price The subscription price for a Unit is €0.3144 i.e. 120% of the closing Nicox share price on October 11, 2024 (€0.2620). Features of the new shares The new shares, which will be subject to all the provisions of the Articles of Association, will be issued with dividend rights. They will be treated in the same way as existing shares as soon as they are issued. Application will be made for the shares to be admitted to trading on Euronext Growth Paris. They will be listed on the same line as existing shares and will be fully equivalent to them as soon as they are admitted to trading. Clearing/settlement and listing of the new shares on Euronext Growth Paris is expected by October 17, 2024. Features of the Warrants The Warrants will be detached from the shares when the Units are issued.

Wall Street rolled to more records as U.S. stocks added to their all-time highs NEW YORK -- Wall Street rolled to more records Monday as U.S. stocks added to their all-time highs. The S&P 500 climbed 0.8% to build on its record set on Friday. It’s coming off its fifth straight winning week and is on track for its longest weekly winning streak of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% and added 201 points to its own record, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.9%. The gains followed relatively quiet trading in Europe, while the U.S. bond market remained closed for the day because of a holiday. The strongest action in global markets came from China, where the finance minister gave a highly anticipated update on Saturday about plans for the world’s second-largest economy. Lan Fo’an said the government is looking at additional ways to boost the economy, but he stopped short of unveiling a major new stimulus plan that investors were hoping for. The lack of detail sent markets spinning. Stocks in Shanghai jumped 2.1%, but the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell 0.7%. Crude oil prices, meanwhile, sank roughly 2% on worries about demand from China’s slowing economy. Hopes for big stimulus in China have sent Chinese stocks sharply higher recently after they languished for years. But investors are skeptical about how much it can remake and restore the economy. “While clearly welcome, the efforts may be insufficient to spur a new reflationary cycle,” according to Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Besides oil, prices also fell for copper and other commodities that a healthy Chinese economy would devour. That helped drive down prices for miners, such as Freeport-McMoRan, which fell 2.3% for one of the larger losses in the S&P 500. Boeing lost 1.3% in its first trading since the aerospace giant warned that it expects to report that it burned through $1.3 billion in cash during the latest quarter and lost $9.97 per share. Boeing also said it was laying off 10% of its workforce as it tries to deal with a labor strike that is crippling production of the company’s best-selling airline planes. On the winning side of Wall Street was SoFi Technologies. It rose 11.4% after announcing a $2 billion loan platform agreement with investment firm Fortress Investment Group, where SoFi will refer pre-qualified borrowers. Longboard Pharmaceuticals soared 51.6% after H. Lundbeck, a Danish company, said it would buy the biopharmaceutical company in an all-cash deal valuing it at $2.6 billion. Trump Media & Technology Group jumped 18.5% and is near $30 again for the first time since July. The company behind former President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform had briefly dropped below $12 last month. It continues to lose money, but its stock often moves more with Trump’s perceived re-election chances than anything else. All told, the S&P 500 rose 44.82 points to 5,859.85. The Dow added 201.36 to 43,065.22, and the Nasdaq composite gained 159.75 to 18,502.69. This upcoming week will have few top-tier economic reports outside of Thursday’s update on sales at U.S. retailers to help guide trading. That will likely leave the emphasis on corporate earnings reports, which will pick up the pace this week after big banks began the reporting season last week. Bank of America, Johnson & Johnson and UnitedHealth Group will all report their latest results on Tuesday. Later in the week will come United Airlines, Netflix, American Express and Procter & Gamble. Analysts are looking for S&P 500 companies to deliver overall growth of 4.1% in earnings per share for the latest quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet. If they’re correct, it would be a fifth straight quarter of growth. Solid, continued growth in profits for companies would help tamp down criticism that’s built up about how expensive the broad stock market looks, after share prices ran higher faster than earnings. Stocks have broadly rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. Recent reports showing the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected have also raised optimism that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing where it gets inflation down to 2% without causing a recession that many had thought would be necessary. ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: US stock futures muted with Q3 earnings, Fed cues in focus
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-stock-futures-muted-with-q3-earnings-fed-cues-in-focus-3660832
Time Published: 2024-10-13T23:53:33Z
Full Content:
Investing.com -- US stocks traded higher on Monday as investors awaited more third-quarter earnings and potential comments from several Federal Reserve officials on monetary policy. At 11:04 ET (15:04 GMT), the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up by 62 points, or 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 index rose 31 points or 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 116 points or 0.6%. The third-quarter earnings season is set to pick up in earnest this week, with more results from the country's banking giants as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are set to report on Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) on Wednesday. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), chipmaking bellwether ASML (AS:ASML) and streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are due to report during the week. Investors will be largely focused on whether corporate earnings were able to persevere despite pressure from high interest rates and sticky inflation. Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 2.6%, with managers at the aircraft manufacturer likely to find out later Monday more details about plans to slash around 17,000 positions, around 10% of its global headcount. It will also delay the first deliveries of its 777X plane by a year and book $5 billion in losses in the third quarter. B. Riley Financial (NASDAQ:RILY) stock soared 22% after the Wall Street Journal reported the Investment bank has agreed to sell its appraisal and valuations unit, Great American, to asset-management firm Oaktree Capital for about $400 million. This week also sees addresses from a number of Fed officials, which are likely to provide more cues on the central bank’s plans to cut interest rates further. Governor Christopher Waller, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari are expected to speak later on Monday, and there is strong interest in what they might say about the central bank's rate outlook. Markets will get another update on the health of the U.S. consumer on Thursday, in the form of the latest retail sales data. Investors will also study the latest news about additional stimulus in China, the second largest economy in the world. China’s finance ministry said in a weekend briefing that it will implement fiscal stimulus measures, including more debt issuance and support for provincial governments. But the government did not provide key details on the timing and scale of the plans. Oil prices fell sharply Monday, retreating after OPEC cut its demand growth forecasts, while Chinese inflation data raised doubts about the health of the country's economy. By 09:35 ET, the Brent contract dropped 1.6% to $77.77 per barrel, while US crude futures (WTI) traded 1.6% lower at $74.33 a barrel. Figures released over the weekend showed consumer price growth in China unexpectedly eased in September, while producer prices marked nearly two years of contraction -- data which bodes poorly for demand in the world’s biggest oil importer. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2024, marking the producer group's third consecutive downward revision. OPEC, in a monthly report released earlier Monday, said world oil demand will rise by 1.93 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, down from growth of 2.03 million bpd it expected last month. For next year, OPEC cut its 2025 global demand growth estimate to 1.64 million bpd from 1.74 million bpd. China accounted for the bulk of the 2024 downgrade, as OPEC trimmed its Chinese growth forecast to 580,000 bpd from 650,000 bpd. (Ambar Warrick and Peter Nurse contributed to this article.)

Billions worth of investments in emerging growth sectors including AI and life sciences, and infrastructure are set to be unveiled by businesses and ministers at the government’s inaugural International Investment Summit today (Monday 14th October). World leading CEO’s and investors from across the globe will meet with ministers, First Ministers, and local leaders at the Guildhall – a historic landmark which has served as the ceremonial heart of the City of London for centuries. Securing investment is central to the government’s mission to deliver economic growth which will create jobs, improve living standards, and make communities and families across the country better off. The government has already secured tens of billions worth of investments within 100 days of being in office. The International Investment Summit will provide an opportunity to build on this progress and showcase the UK’s economic strengths. The event will demonstrate that through serious, stable governance, the UK can establish enduring partnerships with businesses to boost investment and give investors the confidence they need to choose Britain. In a sign of intent to deliver on its central promise, this government has immediately made a series of major interventions to restore economic stability and create the right conditions for growth and investment. Business leaders this week hailed the UK’s “clear policy direction” as they announced over £24 billion worth of investment in clean energy projects. The government’s policy platform – including bolstering the Office for Investment, a robust Industrial Strategy, major planning reforms to unlock infrastructure and housing, and founding a National Wealth Fund to catalyse private money – will attract investment, kickstart growth, and unlock Britain’s potential. In his keynote speech opening the summit, the Prime Minister will outline how the government will build on this work, with a vow to “do everything in my power to galvanise growth including getting rid of regulation that needlessly holds back investment.” He is expected to say not enough has been done to make sure the UK is keeping pace with emerging industries. He will pledge to “upgrade the regulatory regime to make it fit for the modern age, making Britain fit to harness all opportunities.” In his keynote speech, the Prime Minister will make his ‘pitch for Britain’. On the value of stability, the Prime Minister is expected to say: “It’s not just that stability leads to growth – though we all recognise that. It’s also that growth leads to stability. Growth leads to a country that is better equipped to come together and get its future back. That’s why it’s always been so critical to my project. “We have a golden opportunity to use our mandate, to end chop and change, policy churn and sticking plasters that make it so hard for investors to assess the value of any proposition. “We have the determination, the focus on clear long-term ends, a mission-led mindset that thinks in years, not the days or hours of the news grid, needed to unlock that potential. Do not doubt that. “We are focusing on investment because the mission of growth, in this country especially, demands it. Private sector investment is the way we rebuild our country and pay our way in the world. This is a great moment to back Britain. This is great moment to back England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.” On regulation, he is expected to say: “We’ve got to look at regulation where it is needlessly holding back the investment, to take our country forward. “Where it is stopping us building the homes, the data centres, warehouses, grid connectors, roads, trainlines, you name it then mark my words – we will get rid of it. “We will rip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment and we will make sure that every regulator in this country take growth as seriously as this room does.” The government will ask the CMA to prioritise growth, investment, and innovation through their work as a priority and it will also be reviewing the focus of other major regulators. The regulatory review is just one part of the government’s work ensuring Britain is at the front of the queue for emerging opportunities. It builds on the recent creation of the Regulatory Innovation Office, which will curb red tape for cutting-edge emerging technologies, speed up approvals, and allow them to be rolled out to the public safely and quickly. These changes come at the same time as the government delivers on a key manifesto promise to establish a modern Industrial Strategy. Long called for by business, the strategy hardwires long-term stability for investors and plays to the UK’s strengths by focusing on eight growth-driving sectors. The summit will involve sessions with ministers and business leaders to discuss how together we can ensure the UK capitalises on emerging growth sectors including health tech and AI, clean energy and creative industries, for the good of working people. Confirmed speakers including Ruth Porat President & Chief Investment Officer of Alphabet, David A. Ricks Chair and CEO of Eli Lilly, Alex Kendall CEO of Wayve and Pushmeet Kohli Vice President of Research at Google DeepMind. The Prime Minister will take part in an “in conversation” event with former CEO and chairman of Google Eric Schmidt, moderated by CEO of GSK Dame Emma Walmsley to discuss how the UK can seize the opportunities of AI to drive growth and productivity, and it’s potential to improve public services such as health and education. The Chancellor will close the summit and take part in a panel event discussing investment opportunities in the UK with Group Chief Executive of USS Carol Young, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock Larry Fink and CEO of Brookfield Asset Management Bruce Flatt. Attendees will then be invited to an exclusive reception at St Paul’s Cathedral attended by His Majesty The King. Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson OBE said: “It’s never been a better time to invest in Britain. This summit is a hugely significant moment to showcase the UK’s economic strengths on the world stage and I’m delighted to be part of the government’s important work to drive growth and investment across the UK.” Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: “I’m delighted to be attending the International Investment Summit. With a new government, we are reclaiming Britain’s reputation as a magnet for global investment - bringing with it new technology, new ways of thinking and, crucially, new jobs across our country, meaning higher living standards. “London and the UK are open for business, trade and investment. I will continue working with the Government to forge new partnerships, reset relationships and seize the opportunity to secure long-term investment so that we can build a better London for everyone and deliver the change Britain needs.” Alex Kendall, Co-Founder and CEO of Wayve, said: “I’m delighted to join the inaugural International Investment Summit. The UK has a strong opportunity to lead in Embodied AI, especially in automated vehicles. “We appreciate the Government’s proactive collaboration with industry on intelligent legislation like the AV Act 2024. Their sector-specific approach to AI regulation is the right way to encourage both investment and innovation. “As we advance our Embodied AI technology into safe, reliable, production-ready software for global automakers, we look forward to continuing to work with the Government to harmonise global regulations and scale UK innovation internationally.” Ruth Porat Chief Investment Officer at Alphabet Inc said: “Google is proud of our long history of meaningful investments in local talent, infrastructure and digital skilling in the UK which help everyone participate in the benefits of the digital economy. With the UK’s rich academic heritage, particularly in the sciences, it is well-positioned to capture the many opportunities that AI can deliver. “The Investment Summit is an important moment to reflect on the progress to date, and how to best position the UK as a global leader in AI, with the economic and societal benefits this transformative technology can deliver today, and in the years ahead.” The following links open in a new tab Don’t include personal or financial information like your National Insurance number or credit card details.

Title: Cardano Isn’t Failing: Hoskinson Credits Voltaire for Addressing Long-Standing Issues

Cardano (ADA) introduced decentralized governance through the Chang hard fork upgrade that went live last month. While this upgrade made Cardano more decentralized, Charles Hoskinson believes it has also spurred negative sentiment around the project. In an X post, Hoskinson noted that allowing the Cardano community to contribute and voice their concerns about the project opened up “pent-up grievances” on a wide range of issues. “There have been years of pent-up grievances, unexplored road map items, unfunded growth strategies, and needed partnerships that haven’t been addressed due to Cardano’s governance not scaling to meet the needs of the ecosystem,” Hoskinson stated. The outspoken Cardano founder also noted that the Voltaire upgrade would introduce a new roadmap for the project. This roadmap will ensure that issues not previously addressed will be brought into focus to improve the network’s scalability. One of these issues is the Cardano sidechain solution known as Midnight. This solution will help boost the project’s liquidity. Furthermore, the blockchain is also boosting stablecoin support to boost usage. Hoskinson also stated that Cardano differed from the rest of the cryptocurrency industry by being more transparent. He mentioned that, unlike other projects, Cardano did not deal in “backroom deals and dirty tricks.” “It’s why we are loathed by a lot of others… Short-term thinking, market manipulation, and companies seeking a handout have no role or place here,” he stated. Hoskinson also bashed projects fighting for recognition on Wall Street through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He stated that ADA was one of the few cryptocurrencies that still wanted to be “real and not the patron of BlackRock and Wall Street.” Hoskinson’s statement has drawn reactions from the broader cryptocurrency community. X user @cardano_whale stated that the negative sentiment around ADA revolved around price action and engagement farming. However, not all community members believe that Cardano is doing well in terms of governance. One user noted that Cardano developers were supposed to improve scalability before introducing the Voltaire upgrade. Wasn’t IOG supposed to finishing scaling BEFORE Voltaire? So that part of the roadmap was supposed to be YOUR responsibility.Or am I wrong? Another user also stated that Cardano was suffering from a lack of volumes and declining usage, which pointed towards the failure of the founding entities. Furthermore, the few governance wallets limited the project’s level of decentralization. Cardano traded at $0.3468 at press time after an around 1.49% drop in 24 hours.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

Goldman Sachs recently lowered the price target on the stock to $500 from $515 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The investment firm slightly lowered free cash flow expectations after Microsoft's fiscal 2026 and 2027 artificial intelligence capex estimates. However, as Azure capacity comes online and AI revenue continues to scale, Microsoft should execute well against Goldman's expectations for 14% revenue growth, the advisory told investors in a research note. The investment firm said Microsoft’s earnings growth is still 300 basis points faster than the S&P 500, which justifies the stock's valuation. Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In an investor note, the advisory said it surveyed about 13,500 teens as a part of the firm's Taking Stock with Teens Fall 2024 survey, and based on the responses, it continued to believe the stock was fairly valued at current levels, as the data did not suggest a 2024 super cycle. However, Piper noted upgrade expectations were up from the 20% level in its Spring 2024 survey. In addition, only about 30% of teens were upgrading any of their Apple hardware in the next six months due to Apple Intelligence, which to the firm felt low given the enthusiasm.

The bitcoin price has fallen back from a 2024 all-time high of over $70,000 per bitcoin, reached on a tidal wave of interest in BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)—with the $11 trillion asset manager chief executive Larry Fink issuing a "crazy" Federal Reserve warning last week. Now, as MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor reveals his $100 trillion "end game," Fink has outlined his plan for bitcoin, ethereum and crypto—predicting "digitizing the dollar" is going to be "under discussion."

[+] Street, pushing the bitcoin price sharply higher... "We believe bitcoin is asset class in itself, it is an alternative to other commodities like gold," Fink, who last year led the charge on Wall Street to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to U.S. markets, said during BlackRock's third quarter earnings call, predicting bitcoin, ethereum and crypto will "overlay" with artificial intelligence. "And so I think the application of this form of investment will be expanded. Two, the role of ethereum as a blockchain can grow dramatically. So if we can create more acceptability, more transparency, more analytics related to these assets, then it will be expanded." Bitcoin and ethereum, via the new crypto ETFs that offer exposure to crypto without having to deal with exchanges or risk self-custody, have helped BlackRock’s assets under management to top $11 trillion for the first time over the third quarter. BlackRock's IBIT has seen net inflows of $21.7 billion since January, far outpacing Fidelity's second-largest spot bitcoin ETF with $10 billion of inflows, according to SoSoValue data. "When major players like BlackRock and Fidelity launch bitcoin ETFs, and begin selling that idea to their institutional and individual investors, I think it's very positive," Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, said in a interview with investment platform Saxo—putting his bitcoin price target at $170,000. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street this year was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock last year—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.

"I truly believe we will see a broadening of the market of these digital assets," Fink said, pointing to BlackRock's experience with the mortgage market that grew along with data and analytics—"And then we’ll see how does each and every country looks at their own digital currency. That’s a very different asset than a bitcoin in itself. But I do believe what we’re going to witness as we build out better analytics." Fink called attempts in India and Brazil to digitize their currencies as a "big success." "How do we see in [the U.S.] the role of digitizing the dollar? And what role does that play," Fink asked. "That’s a very different question related to, let’s say, bitcoin and other items like that. But all of that is going to be under discussion." The debate around a digital dollar, also known as a central bank digital currency (CBDC), was electrified in 2019 when Facebook (now Meta) announced it was planning to launch a bitcoin-inspired digital currency before it was shut down by regulators. The possibility of a digital dollar, often compared to the digital yuan that's already widely used in China and used to monitor people's every day transactions, has sparked privacy concerns as well as questions over how it would impact the commercial, deposit-based financial system. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said the Fed won't create a digital dollar without the express authorization from Congress. One Community. Many Voices.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.

Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

In a research note, the investment firm detailed that a recent DOJ court filing was weighing on the stock but claimed that the initial proposed set of remedies regarding the Google breakup were generally in line with investor expectations. The advisory, which anticipates more twists and turns in the case ahead, also saw positives, including its belief that Google was well-positioned in the search market, Google's counter proposals in December were likely provide a more positive potential outcome, and limited layoffs so far compared to peers gave the company's new CFO a positive cost basis set up to drive EPS growth.

Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, will hold a private session on Monday to scrutinise the government’s industrial strategy green paper, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Monday 14 October 2024 01:50, UK The government will on Monday welcome more than £50bn of investment in the British economy as Sir Keir Starmer tries to reset his administration after a first hundred days marked by scandal and infighting. Sky News has learnt that the International Investment Summit in the City of London will comprise more than £50bn of deal announcements - or roughly twice the £28bn unveiled at the previous comparable gathering held under the former Conservative administration. The total figure to be announced on Monday was still being finalised this weekend amid continuing negotiations with companies. Politics latest: Minister doesn't rule out raising employer NI Sources said, however, that the final amount would "certainly" be in excess of £50bn. The summit will be attended by executives from globally important companies such as Alphabet, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and Deepmind. In recent days, a row emerged involving DP World, which had been planning to announce a £1bn investment in the London Gateway port. The company threatened to cancel its attendance at the conference and review the investment in the wake of comments by the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, labelling its P&O Ferries subsidiary "a rogue operator". After Downing Street officials intervened, the dispute appeared to have been resolved this weekend, with the investment proceeding. Sky News can also reveal that the summit will include a behind-closed-doors session chaired by the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and a number of chief executives. Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News The group will, according to insiders, jointly scrutinise a green paper on industrial strategy that will also be published on Monday. One invitee said they had been "asked to mark the government's homework". A source close to Mr Reynolds said: "When the business secretary said this government would work in partnership with business, he meant it. "We respect the expertise of business leaders and want their voice at the heart of policymaking. "That's why we're getting them around the table before the strategy is published, so it works for the industries it's designed to benefit." On Friday, Sky News revealed that Sir Keir would use his speech at the investment summit to say that his administration will scrutinise watchdogs across a range of industries to ensure that they are not acting as barriers to growth.

The event is being seen as a test of Labour's economic agenda in the eyes of investors which wield influence over the destination of trillions of pounds of investment funding. His speech will come, however, against the backdrop of a financial crisis at Thames Water, Britain's biggest water utility, which is backed by sovereign wealth funds and pension funds from countries including Abu Dhabi, Canada and China. Reports in recent weeks have suggested that global investors have become so alarmed by Ofwat's approach to the Thames Water crisis that they are reluctant to commit further sums to British infrastructure projects. On Thursday, the government appointed Poppy Gustafsson, the former boss of cybersecurity company Darktrace, as investment minister, ensuring that the government avoided the ignominy of staging Monday's summit without a minister for investment being in place. 👉 Tap here to follow Politics at Jack and Sam's wherever you get your podcasts 👈 Clare Barclay, who leads Microsoft's operations in the UK, has been appointed to chair a new Industrial Strategy Council. Officials declined to comment on Sunday on the headline figures that would be announced at the summit.
