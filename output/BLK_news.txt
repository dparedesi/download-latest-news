A virtual drone was piloted through an obstacle course by a person imagining moving their fingers Willsey et al. A man with paralysis who had electrodes implanted in his brain can pilot a virtual drone through an obstacle course simply by imagining moving his fingers. His brain signals are interpreted by an AI model and then used to control a simulated drone. Brain-computer interface (BCI) research has made huge strides in recent years, allowing people with paralysis to precisely control a mouse cursor and dictate speech to computers by imagining writing words with a pen. But so far, they haven’t yet shown great promise in complex applications with multiple inputs.

The anonymous man who tried the technology has tetraplegia due to a spinal cord injury. He had already been fitted with a BCI from Blackrock Neurotech made up of 192 electrodes, implanted in the area of the brain that controls hand motion. An AI model was used to map the complex neural signals received by the electrodes to the user’s thoughts. The participant learned how to think of the first two fingers of one hand moving, creating an electrical signal that can be made stronger or weaker. Another signal was generated by the second two fingers and another two by the thumb. The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. These were sufficient to allow the user to control a virtual drone by thought alone, and with practice he could skilfully pilot it through an obstacle course. Willsey says the experiment could have been done using a real drone, but was kept virtual for ease and safety. “The goal of doing the quadcopter was really kind of shared between our lab and the participant,” says Willsey. “For him, it was the realisation of kind of a dream that he thought was lost once he suffered his injury. He had a passion and a dream for flying. He seemed very empowered and enabled; he would have us take videos and send it to friends.” Although the results are impressive, there is still much to be done before BCIs can be reliably used for complex tasks, says Willsey. Firstly, AI is needed to interpret signals from the electrodes, and this relies on individual training for every user. Secondly, this training needs to be repeated over time as functionality declines, which may be due to electrodes shifting slightly in the brain or changes in the brain itself.

Market enthusiasm for Trump's era catalyzes all-time high for Bitcoin and trading volumes. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The crypto market has recorded its highest weekly inflow this year, reaching an impressive $2.2 billion. According to the latest CoinShares report, this influx of capital was fueled by growing excitement around Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. The firm noted that the surge pushed total year-to-date inflows to $2.8 billion. This influx has also pushed assets under management (AUM) to a record high of $171 billion. The surge coincided with Bitcoin’s impressive performance, with the flagship crypto climbing nearly 20% over the past week to hit an all-time high near the $110,000 mark. Meanwhile, the market also experienced a corresponding spike in exchange-traded product (ETP) trading volumes, which reached $21 billion last week. James Butterfill, CoinShares head of research, pointed out that this number accounted for 34% of Bitcoin’s trading activity on leading exchanges. This robust number highlights growing institutional interest and the increasing mainstream adoption of crypto. Bitcoin continued its dominance, securing $1.9 billion in inflows last week and bringing its total for the year to $2.7 billion. The report highlighted that spot Bitcoin ETFs, offered by key players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, and Bitwise, collectively attracted over $2.1 billion in inflows. The inflows are seen as a positive response to market optimism about supportive regulatory policies expected under the incoming administration. Interestingly, short-Bitcoin products registered modest inflows of $500,000, a surprising deviation from typical bearish behavior during bullish trends. Meanwhile, Ethereum drew $246 million in inflows, marking a reversal of its previous outflows this year. However, the second-largest crypto continues to underperform in comparison to its peers. Butterfill noted that Ethereum remains the weakest performer this year from an inflow perspective despite significantly outpacing Solana, which brought in $2.5 million last week. On the other hand, XRP has proven to be a standout performer, attracting $31 million in inflows last week. Since mid-November 2024, XRP’s total inflows have reached an impressive $484 million, underscoring its growing appeal to investors. Stellar followed with smaller inflows of $2.1 million, while other altcoins showed little activity during the period. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Ukraine’s Debt: An Instrument of Pressure and Spoliation in the Hands of Creditors> “We Should Support Demand to Cancel Ukraine’s Debt”
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/ukraine-debt-instrument-pressure-spoliation-creditors/5877723
Time Published: 2025-01-20T13:51:16Z
Full Content:
In the present article the author focuses on Ukraine’s debt since the 1990s and more particularly in the years following Russia’s Special Military Operation (SMO) in February 2022. It provides answers to several questions. Who are Ukraine’s creditors? How much are they owed? What do they demand in exchange for their loans? What part does the European Union play? Why Ukraine’s integration into the EU go against the Ukrainian people’s interests? What is done with frozen Russian assets? Why should Ukraine’s debt be cancelled? Why does Zelensky oppose any cancellation? What are the alternatives to current indebtedness? Some questions are not addressed for want of space such as the stage the conflict has reached, the provision of weapons, the debates within the Left. * Ukraine’s internal and external public debt has increased by 60% between early 2022 and end of November 2024. It amounted to just under USD 100 billion before the Special Military Operation (SMO) and reached almost USD 160 billion by the end of 2024, including USD 45 billion of internal public debt. [1] Creditors with whom Ukraine’s debt has most increased are the European Union, the World Bank and the IMF. Read the box to learn more about Ukraine’s debt before 2022. Ukraine’s debt to the EU has multiplied more than eight times. From USD 5 billion in early 2022 it rose to USD 43 billion at the end of 2024. If we add Ukraine’s debt to the European Investment Bank (EIB) and to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), it reaches USD 47 billion. This is the first point to be stressed: the EU’s financial aid comes as loans not as grants. Consequently, the EU is owed more and more, which gives it significant power over the Kyiv government. The EU’s credit policy is perverse: repayment will not start before several years. In exchange for loans, the EU demands that Ukraine adapts its legislation to the European treaties, which all favour the private sector, that it opens its procurements to private competition… The major European private corporations are eager to reap the benefits of Ukraine’s integration into the large European market at a time when it will be in a very weak position and there will be major contracts for reconstruction to be had. Box 1: Ukraine’s debt before the Russian SMO When Ukraine became independent after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it didn’t have any debt. From 1994 onward Ukraine started to get into debt, particularly with the IMF and the World Bank. Over the past 30 years Ukraine has signed 14 loan agreements with the IMF. In each of them the IMF demanded that neoliberal policies be carried further even though they have deleterious effects on the population’s living conditions with deteriorating public services, privatizations, cuts in actual wages and in social aids. Ukraine, like other countries in Eastern Europe, was subjected to a succession of shock therapies that were used by local oligarchs and foreign companies to enrich themselves. Corruption took on very significant proportions. In the case of Ukraine, it is easy to identify the role played by the IMF and World Bank loans, since Ukraine had no foreign debt before they came onto the scene. From 1994 – 1999, to persuade the Ukrainian authorities to implement the policies required by the IMF- WB duo, the two institutions granted large loans with deferred repayments which did not really weigh on the State budget until 2000. On the other hand, from then on Ukraine was under heavy pressure to pay. Between 2000 and 2007, Ukraine repaid USD 4 billion, while only receiving USD 700 million in fresh loans. Following the eruption of the great financial crisis in the North Atlantic in 2007-2008 and the ensuing depression across the global economy, Ukraine received a volley of new loans until 2011. Once again, repayments were deferred. Between 2008 and 2010 the country received USD 14.3 billion in fresh loans from the IMF and only repaid USD 800 million. But as of 2011, the IMF and the WB demanded enormous repayments (USD 10 billion in the three years from 2011 to 2013). In order to manage the repayments, the government reduced social spending a little more, and also borrowed from Russia which triggered great social discontent, and fed into the various factors which led to the mass protests in Maidan Square, Kiev in February 2014. The protests brought about the overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian president. The conflict between Ukraine and Russia further deteriorated when Putin annexed Crimea. After that, the IMF and the WB granted more huge sums to the new pro-Western rulers in charge of Ukraine and a new wave of privatizations took place. From the end of 2015, Ukraine stopped repaying its debt to Russia (see what I wrote about this in 2022 here) The IMF lent USD 11 billion over two years, thus doubling what Ukraine owed it, and once again increasing its ability to exert pressure on the government in Kiev, which was forced to go to great lengths to make repayments between 2017 and 2021. Ukraine’s debt to the World Bank has more than tripled, rising from USD 6.2 billion to 20 billion. Ukraine’s debt to the IMF between early 2022 and the end of November 2024 went from USD 14 to 17.6 billion. It is worth emphasizing that both the IMF and the WB continue to demand repayments, despite the war. Furthermore, the IMF practises abusive interest rates of up to 8 %. Ukraine reimbursed USD 2.4 billion to the IMF in 2022, 3.4 billion in 2023 and 3.1 billion in 2024. In other words, the IMF collected almost USD 9 billion off the back of the Ukrainians over three years of war! The debt to the United States is nil as Washington prefers to donate rather than lend it money. Nevertheless, Washington oversees the policies of the IMF and the World Bank, and are quite able to exert any amount of pressure, should they see fit. In any case, Ukraine is so highly dependent on arms from the United States that Washington is in a position to bend the Zelensky government’s policies in any way it wishes. The debt owed to Russia having been under suspension of payment since 2015, it has not changed and remains at USD 0.6 billion. The debt Ukraine owes to the finance markets in the form of sovereign bonds acquired by investment funds such as BlackRock or the major banks has fallen slightly, from USD 20 billion to USD 18.2 billion. So the stock has been slightly reduced but the creditors’ position has been consolidated due to the debt payment rescheduling arranged in the second semester of 2024 (see this and this). The private creditors agreed to exchange the old bonds, which had been under suspension of payment since July 2022, for new ones of less value but that would bring in juicy interest rates, higher than the previous ones. In the end, the private creditors did best from the negotiations, as before they took place, Ukrainian bonds had lost 70 % of their worth. They were being sold on the secondary market at 30% of their initial value. Since the beginning of the Special Military Operation (SMO) in February 2022, external public debt has more than doubled, rising from USD 56 billion to 115 billion. Ukraine’s external public debt which comes to a little over USD 115 billion is distributed as follows: just under USD 50 billion owed to the EU, 20 billion to the World Bank, 18 billion to the IMF, 5.2 billion to Canada, 1 billion to Japan and 20 billion US dollars owed to private creditors on the financial markets. By percentage, 44% of Ukraine’s public external debt is owed to the EU, about 33% to the World Bank and the IMF together, 4% and 1% to Canada and Japan respectively, and about 18% to foreign private creditors (who mainly hold Ukrainian sovereign securities restructured in September 2024). . . «In exchange for the loans granted by the EU, the IMF and the World Bank, the Ukrainian government accepted 325 conditionalities and recommendations» In exchange for the loans granted by the EU, the IMF and the WB, the Ukrainian government accepted 325 conditionalities and recommendations. As indicated by the Ukrainian Minister of Finance on his site, the 325 conditionalities and recommendations are grouped together in a list of reforms and measures that Ukraine is committed to implementing, in order to get financial support from international partners. [2] For the creditors, it is a matter of intensifying the implementation of neoliberal policies instigated for more than 30 years. To pursue the implementation of these conditionalities and recommendations, 531 indicators have been adopted. If Ukraine does not adhere to the calendar and the list of reforms, their partners, especially the World Bank, the IMF and the European Union, may suspend or postpone granting the loans that the country needs. These institutions keep a continuous eye on the application and the expansion of the neoliberal policies that they demand and that the neoliberal Zelensky government supports. In 2024, the EU, the United States and other G7 members agreed on the new aid plan for Ukraine. Within this framework, the EU adopted a plan amounting to up to 50 billion euros for the period 2024 to 2027. The plan adopted provides for a total disbursement of 38.27 billion euros between now and the end of 2027. Most of this (33 billion, that is 85 %) is in the form of debts that will have to be repaid. Donations only account for 5.27 billion euros, i.e. 15 %. The donations part probably corresponds to the amount seized by the European Commission on the revenue from frozen Russian assets, mainly in Brussels (see further on the share of frozen Russian assets). In the course of the year 2024, 12.4 billion was paid. And as the European Commission states in a report published in October 2024, The so-called “Ukrainian Plan”, which covers the period 2024 – 2027, is recorded in a 331-pages document. It was concocted by the European Commission. The implementation of the Plan, which contains a host of measures that the government is committed to carrying out, is under permanent surveillance. As the European Commission says, The government had to designate a coordinator who is their interlocutor with the European Commission and who is endowed with the powers to ensure that the calendar laid out in the Plan is respected. “The Coordinator will monitor the implementation of the Plan on a monthly basis to track the progress made. Let us recall that in the European Treaties, which are binding, there is no mention of respecting and promoting social rights. Those were hard won through social struggle within each national framework, and are not to be found in the European Treaties, which, on the contrary, prefer to encourage competitivity between the working classes of the different member countries of the Union. Within the EU, just to give two examples, the legal minimum wage is 477 euros a month (gross) in Bulgaria, whereas in Luxemburg it is 2 571 euros, i.e. 5 times higher. The constraints imposed by the European Treaties concern the opening up of national markets to unlimited competition, public services being opened up to private initiative, liberalizing the energy market, limiting public finance deficit, the public debt/ GDP ratio and so on. There are no constraints on questions of social welfare, the legal minimum wage, neither restrictions nor convergence in the fiscal domain (which enables the EU’s tax havens to take advantage of very low tax rates on profits, as is the case for example for Ireland, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and plenty more), no rigorous environmental constraints, no protection of the public heritage. A great many Ukrainians have high hopes at the perspective of joining the EU, which is presented as guaranteeing improved living conditions and social rights, better wages, less corruption. All this is a great illusion, deliberately misleading people. On the pretext of preparing European integration, [5] there will be even more privatizations in Ukraine, in particular the public company that produces and distributes energy. And even more arable land will be sold to foreign agrobusiness firms. Concerning the above warning, some left-wingers reply that the Ukrainian government is neoliberal anyhow and that even without the EU, it would attempt to implement the policies expected by the EU. This is true enough but the agreements with the EU towards Ukraine’s integration give more leverage to those who want to strengthen neo-liberal policies. Ukraine has signed memoranda with the EU which have the force of international treaties, and as Ukraine’s creditor, the EU is in a strong position. This position of power will further increase as new loans add to the stock of debts owed by Ukraine to the EU. If ever a left-wing government were elected, it would face those constraints that have been accepted by the previous government. The scope for breaking with neo-liberal policies will be very limited: it will have to enter into direct conflict with the EU and contravene the treaties. It should also be remembered that all the loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank are conditional on Ukraine pursuing the (counter-) reforms necessary for its integration into the EU. . « Welcome FMI: la dette est à l’égard du peuple », fresque murale à Buenos aires. Photo Éric Toussaint . Therefore we call upon the Ukrainian and international Left not to spread any illusions about the alleged benefits of joining the EU. The Ukrainian people must be told about the risks and drawbacks that are involved. Of course they may choose to integrate the EU, but the Left has a duty to inform them about its negative consequences. Contrary to a widespread idea among Western left-wingers, the Ukrainian economy is not at all adapted to neoliberal tenets; integrating the EU would involve lots of privatizations. The economic sector that is currently not yet privatized or subjected to free and unlimited competition is still significant, as shown in the box below. Box 2: Examples of the European Commission’s determination to boost deregulation to the benefit of the private sector and of privatizations. Extracts from the Commission’s report published in October 2024 On page 15 of the Commission’s report, in the Chapter “Enterprise and industrial policy,” we find the following: “A new version of the action plan on deregulation was also adopted in September 2024, providing measures for dynamic deregulation and enhancement of the business environment, in line with the Ukraine Plan. The Commission’s recommendations from last year were largely implemented. In the coming year, Ukraine should, in particular: → _in line with the Ukraine Plan, continue deregulation and digitalization of permitting procedures to further enhance the business environment and investment climate in Ukraine; → _implement measures to stimulate private sector and industrial development, (…) and support incentives to attract foreign direct investment. ” In the Chapter on “Transport” we find a reference to the deregulation and privatization of the railway network to make it possible for private EU companies to operate on Ukraine’s territory, thus on page 17: “The Commission’s recommendations from last year were only partially implemented and remain valid. In the coming year, Ukraine should in particular: → _adopt the Law on railway transport creating an institutional and legislative set-up for competitive rail market in line with EU standards.” In the Chapter on Energy, the Commission stresses the need to liberalize the energy sector, whereas to meet the war requirements the government had to boost the monopoly of the public sector, much to the EU’s dismay. In the Chapter on environment and climate change, the European Commission stresses the need to develop a carbon market and pollution permits, and thus “progress towards an effective carbon-pricing mechanism by resuming the compulsory monitoring, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas emissions and adopting the action plan for setting up a national emissions trading system.” p. 18 The Commission notes that a war economy entails more weight for the public sector: “The state footprint in the economy remains high. In 2023, the public sector accounted for 22% of gross added value, up from 6% in 2021, and total government consumption increased to almost 42% of GDP, from just below 40% in 2022.” p. 55 The Commission further insists on the need to reduce the part played by the State in the economy and recommends speeding up privatization while the State still holds stakes in many companies. “SOEs continued to play a significant role in the economy; Ukraine’s state portfolio included more than 3000 of them. As part of the Ukraine Plan, the government has committed to a series of reforms aiming to reduce the state influence in the economy (…) In 2023, annual revenues from privatisation amounted to EUR 108 million (0.05% of GDP), an all-time high. Despite this, privatisation has been limited to small property and production assets; there have been no large-scale privatisation deals in 2023 and 2024. However, the government plans to relaunch them when conditions allow.” (p. 55) The Commission also regrets that the State has had to increase its stake in the banking sector to deal with mismanagement by private bankers. “The market share of the state-owned banks increased to 53.6% in 2023 following the nationalisation of Sense Bank in July 2024. The selection of a new Board is currently ongoing, with at least six members needed for the Board to be operational. The law on state-owned bank (SOB) privatisation was adopted, which should accelerate the reduction of state ownership in the sector. The Ministry of Finance is expected to appoint an internationally recognised financial advisor to prepare two systemic SOBs, i.e., Sense Bank and Ukrgasbank with 4 % and 6 % of total assets, respectively, for sale.” (p. 56) A sign of the banks’ mismanagement and of the mismanagement of the economic crisis is the high level of suspension of payments for over 3 months on bank loans; it stood at 36.8% in February 2024 (p. 56 of the quoted report). In August 2024, the cost of repaying the public debt (50 billion hryvna, the Ukrainian currency) was almost as high as social and health expenditure (see this USAID-financed and thus definitely neoliberal and pro-West website). As part of the sanctions imposed since the Special Military Operation (SMO) in February 2022, the G7 powers have frozen Russian assets worth around USD 300 billion. The equivalent of almost EUR 260 billion in cash and securities, such as shares and bonds, are held by Euroclear, a Brussels-based private financial institution that handles the settlement of international securities. Around USD 5 billion of Russian assets are frozen in the United States. In 2024, the G7 decided not to expropriate Russian assets but to keep them frozen. On the basis of the Russian assets frozen in Europe, mainly in Brussels, the EU created a mechanism to issue debt securities “in favour of” Ukraine. The Russian assets serve as collateral for the large investment funds and banks that might buy securities from this loan. The money borrowed by the EU will then be paid to Ukraine mainly in the form of loans that Ukraine will have to repay to the EU. Meanwhile the EU is getting a very good deal, repaying the financial markets for the loan (which it took out itself) with the income earned by Euroclear and others from the frozen Russian assets invested on the markets. It is estimated that the income from investments made with frozen Russian assets amounts to around EUR 5 billion a year. Pension funds and major banks that buy securities to help Ukraine will be repaid with the income from Russian assets invested on the markets. The loan does not cost the EU a penny, while making it look generous and strengthening its position as Ukraine’s creditor as the country’s war-debt increases. Meanwhile, several European private banks such as the Austrian Raiffaisen, the German Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, the Italian Unicredit and Intesa Sanpaolo have not discontinued their activities in the Russian Federation. In spite of sanctions, they have multiplied their profits fourfold in that country since the beginning of the Special Military Operation (SMO). In March-April 2024, they paid EUR 800 million tax on profits to the Russian government without any measures being taken by EU authorities. See Financial Times revelations dated 28 April 2024 I haven’t had time to inquire further but it is striking to note that the Austrian private bank Raiffaisen that is still active in Russia (see its Russian website) in spite of sanctions as mentioned above, is also active in Ukraine (see its website in Ukraine) and is one of the 11 official primary dealers of the debt sold by the Ukrainian government on the financial markets. See the list of 11 banks selected to buy Ukrainian securities on the Ukrainian government’s website. Raiffaisen is thus creditor of both Russia and Ukraine and operates in Russia despite the sanctions against Russia, which it is supposed to respect. We have to be aware of the fact that Zelensky’s government does not wish the Ukrainian debt to be cancelled. As a good neoliberal, he is convinced that Ukraine has to be credible to private creditors. Instead of trying to finance war and reconstruction expenses by having the rich Ukrainian capitalists, Ukrainian and foreign companies pay, he prefers to impose maximum taxation on the popular classes as recommended by the IMF and the World Bank. High incomes are spared, the assets of the richest remain untouched. Thus the rich, who manage to evade enrolment in the army, can heap up wealth while the popular classes make huge sacrifices. Another method used by the Zelensky government to finance its budget is to contract loans. It borrows on the internal market, notably from oligarchs’ banks and from the very rich who bought internal public debt securities in 2024 at rates of up to 16.5%. [6] The inflation rate in 2024 was around 10-11%. The Central Bank’s key rate was 13.5% (see the above-mentioned website). The debts Ukraine had accumulated before the Special Military Operation (SMO) in February 2022 were both illegitimate and odious since the borrowed money had been used to carry out neocolonial policies that were clearly opposed to the interests of the population. Moreover, they had favoured the massive enrichment of a privileged minority through grabbing formerly public goods. Creditors, i.e. mainly the IMF, the WB, the oligarchs and investment funds, were well aware that the loans they granted would not serve the general interest. As we have seen, since the beginning of the war the EU has become the main creditor as it has multiplied its loans to Ukraine by 8, while the WB’s loans have been multiplied by 3 and the IMF has also increased its loans. Those creditors use their credits to impose reinforced neoliberal policies on the population. Ukraine’s newly accumulated debts are thus also illegitimate and odious. It is important to get them cancelled /repudiated so that the creditors are deprived of the leverage they have at their disposal and to prevent them from enriching themselves on the backs of the Ukrainian people. If Ukraine and its people want to regain their sovereignty, they must free themselves from the yoke of the creditors who are acting in their own interests and against those of the Ukrainian people. Resistance to the Special Military Operation (SMO) and reconstruction efforts could be financed in other ways than through debts: through grants, on one hand, and through taxing the war profiteers, on the other. Concerning the financing of Ukraine’s resistance and reconstruction, I mentioned the following proposals besides debt cancellation in an article published in May 2024: the assets of both Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs who profit from the war should be seized. Significant amounts could thus be collected to finance the Ukrainian people’s resistance and the country’s reconstruction. Let us note that if a tax were levied equivalent to the additional profits made by arms companies in the context of this war and other wars in general, this would limit the propensity of these companies to rejoice in the continuation of the war and to contribute to it, since they would not benefit directly from it. Measures to seize oligarchs’ assets, and confiscate and expropriate their property, run directly counter to the sanctity of private property. As a result, there have been no major seizures since 2022 because Western governments are not inclined to do so, even if they oppose the Russian Federation. Exactly what has been accomplished needs to be assessed, but in any case, it has been extremely limited and nothing has been transferred to any fund controlled by the Ukrainian people. In fact, there has been no specific tax on corporations that have benefited from the war. I mentioned the arms companies, but we can also discuss the massive profits made by gas and oil companies as a result of the Special Military Operation (SMO). Profits have also increased for grain marketing corporations around the world, including the four big multinationals that control 80% of the global cereal grains trade. They include three US companies and one European company. A special tax on the profits of these companies should have been levied and should be levied, including retroactively, both to finance the needs of all populations and to help the Ukrainian people. We must also continue to demand the cancellation of Ukraine’s debt. We could add the socialization of the banking sector. As indicated above, about half of the banking sector is still public but not truly in the service of the population, which would involve measures such as transparency of accounts, citizens’ control, monitoring of local elected representatives, decentralization. The private part of the banking sector ought to be expropriated and socialized to establish a monopoly of the public banking sector (except for small-size cooperatives if they are truly controlled by their members). The State still has a monopoly on the energy sector. Contrary to what is expected by the EU, the WB and the IMF, this monopoly must be maintained and democratized. Citizens and workers in this sector must be able to control accounts, prices and management. In short, the energy sector too must be socialized. The State should develop the construction of small-size electricity production units managed by local communities, much easier to protect, secure and manage. This also involves much less wastage during transportation to consumers. New small production units should not use fossil energies. We also need to prepare for an accelerated phase-out of nuclear power and to give up fossil fuels. To be able to move towards a form of peace and reconstruction in the service of populations, it is essential to develop all possible forms of self-organization. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Factbox-Trump's inauguration marks new era for cryptocurrency

By Tom Wilson (Reuters) - Advocates and holders of crypto will soon influence U.S. policy on the emerging technology after a slew of nominations and advisory appointments by President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday. The crypto industry has spent years fighting lawsuits and enforcement actions by the U.S. government. It hopes the incoming Trump administration will mark a shift in policy. Political appointees will be vetted for potential conflicts. Some have committed to selling their interests. The industry is hosting a sold-out black tie ball in Washington on Friday, with tickets ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. David Sacks, Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, is scheduled to attend. Below are some facts on the crypto positions of key members of the incoming administration and Trump's inner circle. SCOTT BESSENT A billionaire hedge fund manager, Trump's pick to be Treasury Secretary has spoken favorably about crypto. "Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay," he told Fox News in July. "I think everything is on the table with bitcoin." According to a financial disclosure filed last month, Bessent holds shares in a BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) bitcoin exchange-traded fund worth between $250,001 and $500,000. Bessent will divest his interests in the fund and other investments within 90 days of his confirmation, he wrote last week to the U.S. Treasury. Bessent did not respond to a request for comment. HOWARD LUTNICK Trump's choice for Secretary of Commerce is a vocal supporter of bitcoin. Lutnick is CEO of New York brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, which earns fees to manage billions of dollars' worth of U.S. Treasuries for Tether, the company that issues the eponymous stablecoin. "Do I own bitcoin? Of course I do," Lutnick said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. "Does Cantor Fitzgerald own bitcoin? A shedload of bitcoin." Lutnick did not respond to a request for comment. ELON MUSK The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief and world's richest man, chosen by Trump to oversee a government cost-cutting effort, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has long championed crypto including bitcoin and dogecoin. His public comments and actions of his companies have in recent years influenced the price of bitcoin and dogecoin, a smaller token conceived as a joke during an earlier crypto bubble. The acronym for Musk's cost-cutting agency, DOGE, is a nod to dogecoin, which is now the world's seventh-biggest crypto token based on its circulation of $4.5 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko. In 2021 Tesla bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, becoming one of the biggest companies to own crypto before selling most of its holdings. It held unspecified digital assets totaling $184 million in September 2024, a company financial report showed. Musk did not respond to a request for comment sent via Tesla on what crypto assets he may hold. VIVEK RAMASWAMY Set to work with Musk at DOGE, the former presidential candidate and entrepreneur is the founder of Strive Asset Management. Strive, which said in September it managed over $1 billion in assets, last month filed to launch an exchange-traded fund that invests in corporate bonds for bitcoin investments. The company's wealth management arm, launched in November, seeks to integrate bitcoin into Americans' investment portfolios, Ramaswamy said in a press release. In June 2023, Ramaswamy held $100,001 to $250,000 of bitcoin and $15,001 to $50,000 worth of the smaller token ether, according to a financial disclosure. He did not respond to a request for comment. DAVID SACKS A former PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) executive, Sacks was appointed White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar in December, tasked with developing a U.S. legal framework long sought by the crypto industry. Sacks is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures. The firm has invested in crypto firms including BitGo and Bitwise, its website shows. Sacks did not respond to requests for comment. STEVE WITKOFF Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate tycoon and donor to the incoming president, founded crypto venture World Liberty Financial in November. World Liberty, which sells a proprietary token, lists on its website Trump as among those entitled to a large share of any of the company's revenues. Witkoff did not respond to requests for comment. ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP JR., BARRON TRUMP Eric Trump told Reuters last year he was very involved in World Liberty, which he, his elder brother Don Jr. - seen as the most influential family member in the presidential transition - and younger half-brother Barron helped to form. Eric told a bitcoin conference in December the technology was a "financial revolution," and that his father would make the United States the crypto capital of the world. JD (NASDAQ:JD) VANCE U.S. Vice President-elect Vance held between $250,001 and $500,000 in bitcoin in August 2024, according to a financial disclosure. The venture capital firm co-founded by Vance, Narya, has made investments in Strive, Ramaswamy's asset management company, and video platform Rumble, its website shows. In November, Rumble said it would allocate its excess cash reserves to bitcoin. The company also received last year a $775 million investment from stablecoin firm Tether. Asked for comment on the crypto stances of Vance and Trump's sons, Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said - without providing evidence - that bureaucrats in Washington had sought to stifle innovation with more regulation and higher taxes. "President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto and other emerging technologies," he said in a statement to Reuters. PAUL ATKINS Atkins, a lawyer and former top SEC official, is Trump's choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and has advocated for deregulation. He is expected to take a softer approach to crypto than current Chair Gary Gensler. Atkins is chief executive of Patomak Global Partners (NYSE:GLP), a consultancy. Patomak advises "cutting-edge crypto-native companies" and traditional financial firms on how to "leverage digital assets for growth," its website says. Atkins did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: Four Canadian Banks Quit Climate Group as Exodus Begun by Wall Street Picks Up

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal and National Bank of Canada said Friday that they’re no longer members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. All four added that they’re still committed to meeting climate-related targets. The departures raise further questions about NZBA’s future. Defections from the group began last month when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. left. The firm’s exit was followed by Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Investor Climate Group Suspends Activities After BlackRock Exit: Reuters Exclusive The moves coincide with intensifying Republican attacks on what US conservatives call “woke” capitalism and criticisms that such voluntary alliances haven’t had a meaningful impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Now, the defections are stretching to Canada. Banks that sign up to NZBA commit to transition their financed emissions to align with “pathways to net zero by 2050” at the latest, according to the group’s website. They’re also required to provide 2030 targets to show they’re on track, and to document their progress. NZBA sent a message to members earlier this week, saying it was focusing on its “next phase” to continue to help banks manage their climate-related risks and opportunities. The alliance, which was convened by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative almost four years ago, still has more than 135 members from over 40 countries, according to its website. BMO Chief Executive Officer Darryl White said at an industry conference last week that the bank supports the transition to a low-carbon economy regardless of the “mechanism.” He added that the company also has “a commitment, particularly here in Canada, to our legacy energy customers completely. We won’t abandon that.” In announcing its decision to leave NZBA, BMO said Friday that it has “robust internal capabilities to implement relevant international standards, supporting our climate strategy and meeting regulatory requirements.” Toronto-Dominion said in its statement that it has “the resources, relationships and capabilities to continue to advance our strategy, deliver for our shareholders, and advise our clients as they adapt their businesses and seize new opportunities.” Montreal-based National Bank, Canada’s sixth-largest lender, said it has decided to “streamline how we report on our plans and our progress.” CIBC said the company recognizes “the scale and urgency of climate change and our stated goals and commitments remain the same” Canadian banks were some of the biggest providers of finance to oil, gas and coal in 2024, with Toronto-Dominion, Royal Bank of Canada, BMO and CIBC ranking among the top 10 for such deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest provider of fossil-fuel finance last year was JPMorgan. Other climate alliances also have lost high-profile members. Just over a week into the new year, BlackRock Inc. said it was ending its membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The firm, which was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging antitrust breaches due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production, said staying inside NZBA had and exposed it to “legal inquiries.” In 2023, a net zero group for insurers saw a mass walkout amid GOP litigation threats. A similar group for investors, Climate Action 100+, was hit by high-profile defections last year as the asset management arms of Goldman and JPMorgan, as well as Pacific Investment Management Co. all left.

Title: Box, Inc. (BOX) Unveils AI-Powered Enterprise Advanced Plan to Transform Content Management and Workflow Automation

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX) stands against the other AI stocks. As President Joe Biden nears the end of his term, he is issuing a series of executive orders. In the latest, the President has signed an order to provide federal support to address the massive energy needs of fast-growing advanced artificial intelligence data centers. READ NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street’s Radar and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors’ Radar The order will allow federal land owned by the Defense and Energy departments to host gigawatt-scale AI data centers and new clean power facilities. According to Biden, the order will "accelerate the speed at which we build the next generation of AI infrastructure here in America, in a way that enhances economic competitiveness, national security, AI safety, and clean energy”. According to the order, companies tapping federal land for AI data centers must also purchase an "appropriate share" of American-made semiconductors. These purchases will be decided on a case-by-case basis. "It's really vital that we ensure that the AI industry can build out the infrastructure for training and using powerful AI models here in the United States”. Several known names, including OpenAI Senior Vice President of Global Affairs Chris Lehane, have commended this effort. Lehane also called out for cultivating a robust domestic infrastructure for the growing U.S. artificial intelligence sector. “So what you get with the Biden administration today is — at least from a signaling perspective — on federal land, trying to short the timeline between when you can get your project shovels in the ground and then the project going forward”. According to Lehane, the incoming Trump administration sees AI through two lenses — national security and economic security. He hopes that both sides of the coin will amalgamate into a national strategy. AI Company OpenAI has also recently laid out its vision for artificial intelligence development in the U.S. According to the company, the US needs investment from abroad and supportive regulation to stay ahead of China in the race for nascent technology. In a 15-page document called the “Economic Blueprint”, it said that "Chips, data, and energy are the keys to winning AI" and that the U.S. needs to act now to craft nationwide rules that can help secure its advantage. OpenAI released the document days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, with CEO Sam Altman also previously donating around $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund in hopes of fostering a positive relationship. "There's an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects, and if the U.S. doesn't attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects —strengthening the Chinese Communist Party's global influence”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

In recent months, investors have taken a renewed interest in quantum computing. For this reason, most industry analysts believe quantum computing is years away from commercial viability. Fortunately, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has developed a quantum chip that is a possible game changer for the industry. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was founded in 1993, and it went on to create the world's first graphics processing units (GPUs) for computing, media, and gaming applications. Now, decades later, the company has adapted those powerful chips for data centers, where they are used to develop advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes data center operators will spend $1 trillion over the next four years on upgrading their infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers. There are plenty of great stocks that offer attractive dividends and don't cost too much. Here are my picks for the smartest dividend stocks to buy with $100 right now. You can scoop up a share of Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) for roughly $23 at its current price. What to know before you accept the loan. After reaching record highs last year, shares of Monolithic Power Systems have slumped more than 30% since the firm's last earnings report at the end of October, but analysts remain bullish on the stock. It would be reasonable to assume that none of these businesses have bargain stocks. Patient investors looking not only for growth, but for protection during market volatility, should take a closer look. With a market cap of about $990 billion, most investors are already very familiar with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Consider these pros and cons before starting a position in this leading cryptocurrency. Investors brace for a volatile ride as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts.

Title: Trump's inauguration will usher in a crypto-friendly administration, and with it, new state policies

The bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses could bring a cryptocurrency policy blitz in 2025 HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses could push states to become more open to crypto and lead public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it. Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to say government-backed currencies are prone to devaluation and increased government buy-ins will stabilize future price swings, giving them more legitimacy and boosting already rising prices. But the risks are significant. Critics say crypto investments are highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting future returns. They warn that investors should be prepared to lose money. Only a couple of public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency. A U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued late last year, warned it has “uniquely high volatility.” It found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto. 2024 was a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin surpassing $100,000. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. Now, crypto enthusiasts are banking on Trump's promise to make the United States the “bitcoin superpower” of the world. Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills this year to make them crypto-friendly. Analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby. Bitcoin miners are building new installations and venture capitalists are underwriting a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback. A bill introduced in November in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir. “I had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, ‘Oh my god, I’m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,” said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell. A bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid, Cabell expects a colleague to reintroduce his bill. Leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect legislation based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states this year. Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn’t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto. Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek. “There might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,” Brainard said. “But it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.” Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system allowing people to pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies. Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather views it as a recognition that the government must innovate and be flexible about helping people do business with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto. “My concern is that at some point it’ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,” Fleming said. “And when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.” In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation. Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said. Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin. That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York. Pension boards got investment tools they like last year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. In October, it approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said. Many “are likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that’s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,” Palmer said. Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs. In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it. Michigan's state investment board reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases, while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto. Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund. “We were ahead of the curve," Fulop said. “And I think that’s what you’re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “It is not unscientific to take a guess, although many people who are not in science believe that it is.” — Richard Feynman Number of the Week: 56 percent since 1990 THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week begins with a video and text of physicist Steve Koonin questioning the claim that we are experiencing a climate emergency. It then discusses the failure of science societies to defend the scientific method. Discussed is the hubris of government officials who fail to provide one of the tasks of government: public safety specifically in the Los Angeles Basin and potentially in New York City. Academic incompetence is compared with professional competence. This Week concludes with an issue on needing to know what type of salmon is being discussed. ************** A Climate Emergency? Ron Clutz provides a transcript of a short video by Steve Koonin, “Is There Really a Climate Emergency?” Koonin, a former Undersecretary for Science of the Department of Energy begins by discussing Hubris. Koonin states: “Hubris is a Greek word that means dangerously overconfident. Based on my research, hubris fairly describes our current response to the issue of climate change. Here’s what many people believe: One: The planet is warming catastrophically because of certain human behaviors. Two: Thanks to powerful computers we can project what the climate will be like 20, 40, or even 100 years from now. Three: That if we eliminate just one behavior, the burning of fossil fuels, we can prevent the climate from changing for as long as we like. Each of these presumptions—together, the basis of our hubris regarding the changing climate—is either untrue or so far off the mark as to be useless. Yes, it’s true that the globe is warming, and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it. But beyond that, to paraphrase a line from the classic movie The Princess Bride, ‘I do not think ‘The Science’ says what you think it says.’” Koonin then presents physical evidence (data) showing that nothing unusual is taking place. As Richard Feynman stated: “It is not unscientific to take a guess, although many people who are not in science believe that it is.” For a scientist, the issue is to test the guess using physical evidence, preferably from controlled experiments, but if that is not possible, then by careful observations. The globe has warmed and cooled many times in the past as it is doing now. Koonin continues: “Why aren’t these reassuring facts better known? Because the public gets its climate information almost exclusively from the media. And from a media perspective, fear sells. ‘Things aren’t that bad’ doesn’t sell. Very few people, and that includes journalists who report on climate news, read the actual science. I have. And what the data—the hard science—from the US government and UN Climate reports say is that… ‘things aren’t that bad.’ Nor does the public understand the questionable basis of all catastrophic climate change projections: computer modeling. Projecting future climate is excruciatingly difficult. Yes, there are human influences, but the climate is complex. Anyone who says that climate models are ‘just physics’ either doesn’t understand them or is being deliberately misleading. I should know I wrote one of the first textbooks on computer modeling. While modelers base their assumptions upon both fundamental physical laws and observations of the climate, there is still considerable judgment involved. And since different modelers will make different assumptions, results vary widely among different models.” Koonin then shows that 73 models overestimate the warming of the globe. These models are the ones cited by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and its collaborators as proof of human caused global warming. One problem that Koonin discusses is the failure of the models to correctly forecast clouds. As Koonin states: “Natural fluctuations in the height and coverage of clouds have at least as much of an impact on the flows of sunlight and heat as do human influences. But how can we possibly know global cloud coverage say 10, let alone 50 years from now? Obviously, we can’t. But to create a climate model, we have to make assumptions. That’s a pretty shaky foundation on which to transform the world’s economy. By the way, creating more accurate models isn’t getting any easier. In fact, the more we learn about the climate system, the more we realize how complex it is. [Boldface added] Rather than admit this complexity, the media, the politicians, and a good portion of the climate science community attribute every terrible storm, every flood, every major fire to ‘climate change.’ Yes, we’ve always had these weather events in the past, the narrative goes, but somehow ‘climate change’ is making everything ‘worse.’ Even if that were true, isn’t the relevant question, how much worse? Not to mention that ‘worse’ is not exactly a scientific term. And how could we make it better? For the alarmists, that’s easy: we get rid of fossil fuels. Not only is this impractical—we get over 80% of the world’s energy from fossil fuels—it’s not scientifically possible. That’s because CO2 doesn’t disappear from the atmosphere in a few days like, say, smog. It hangs around for a really long time. About 60 percent of any CO2 that we emit today will remain in the atmosphere 20 years from now, between 30 and 55 percent will still be there after a century, and between 15 and 30 percent will remain after one thousand years.” To this, TWTW adds that the enormous growth in human CO2 emissions is coming from China and south Asia. The hubris of western politicians is amazing. Without even a hint of expertise in climate science, they pretend to “know” that CO2 is ruining the climate, fail to put “blame” on the biggest CO2 emitters, fail to acknowledge the benefits of increasing CO2, and enact laws to control their own citizenry under the guise of saving the planet. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. **************** Failure of Scientific Societies: In his paper presented in last week’s TWTW, Wallace Manheimer states (citations omitted here): “Scientific societies are supposed to be the guardians of the scientific method, rely principally on data to form their conclusions, and test scientific theories by comparing them to experiments and measurements. They do not seem to be acting in this role, as the paper will show. Instead, these scientific societies seem to have become the bedrock, the foundation, upon which the gigantic edifice of the oncoming climate crisis rests. This article, and many others make the case that this ‘edifice’ is a real threat to civilization. Take down the foundation, and the edifice will ultimately collapse. These scientific societies could do civilization an enormous favor. They could change their statements to ones that are more moderate and more scientifically correct. This could be an important first step to bringing the world back to sanity. They could give David his sling shot.” [Boldface added] Manheimer then cites sad examples of the hubris of the leadership of several such societies in rejecting requests to tone down their expressions on climate change for which they have negligible physical evidence. Yet, these societies do not permit dissent. Such societies include the American Physical Society, the American Meteorological Society, and the National Academy of Science. TWTW adds the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), publisher of the respected journal Science. Both Koonin and Manheimer bring up the loss of scientific standards, which infects politics and government policies at all levels. They result in the hubris that humans can predict and control climate and weather: things which humans cannot do. We do not have a database sufficient for forecasting a cold period, which is sure to come. Whether it is a D-O event, every roughly 1500 years, or a major glaciation, we do not know. But one is sure to come with great suffering. The great benefit of China and other countries adding CO2 to the atmosphere is that its beneficial effects in agriculture will lessen the harmful effects of a diminished growing season. Yet, organizations with diminished or no standards in using the scientific method continue to attack the benefits of carbon dioxide. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. **************** State and Local Government Hubris: The United States has multiple governments with defined geographical boundaries. A primary responsibility of state and local governments is maintaining public safety. As with the federal government, state and local governments have competing purposes or goals. Unfortunately, in many state and local governments the convergence of competing goals has overwhelmed the primary responsibility of maintaining public safety. We are seeing the lack of maintaining public safety in the fires occurring in the Los Angeles Basin. There is a great deal of political finger pointing, in personal efforts to avoid responsibility on many levels, from governor, to mayor, to department heads. Perhaps long-time political commentator and California native Victor Davis Hanson expresses it best in a video on January 13. He begins: “We’re into about the fourth or fifth day of the Los Angeles fires, and people are commenting on the complete systems breakdown. It’s a word that sociologists, historians, and archaeologists use— ‘systems breakdown’—but also ‘systems collapse,’ the collapse of complex societies; for example, the Mycenaeans and others. But it’s the idea that the system becomes so complex that very few people operate it. And when those people are incompetent, and they tend to be bureaucratic and ossified, calcified, then the entire system is so dependent upon them, it collapses. That’s what we’re seeing in Los Angeles. It is a multifaceted breakdown. The insurance industry is overregulated. It [the public] doesn’t trust the state to police, give the people security in their homes. It doesn’t trust their ability to stop fires. They understand there’s no water policy that’s logical in the state. And they want out. … It’s a fire problem. We have lost the ability to fight fires that our grandfathers, over decades, practiced and honed to a fine art. We have lost control, as I said, of the water. The water issue is a disaster. We have plenty of water. We had a brilliant California water project, Central Valley project, and we abused it and have not built a reservoir in nearly 40 years outside of Los Angeles. It is also a regulatory problem that we overregulate so we do not allow people to expand their homes, fix their homes, improve their homes, build their homes. And finally, it’s a ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ [problem]. This is what I want to get to, because … that’s the most controversial. … I think we should look at this in a historical perspective. Anytime an ideology trumps empiricism, meritocracy, investigatory efforts, just disinterested inquiry, and knowledge, then you’re going to have a disaster.” Hanson gives examples of breakdowns caused by ideology in the WW II Russian and German military, then continues with: “But in our case, when you take a person’s superficial appearance—in the case of race—or their beliefs that are ideological, whether it’s religious, or it’s an emphasis on one’s sexual orientation, or whether it’s an interest, on one’s gender, male, female, etc., and you put that over empirical investigation, then you’re not going to be able to, in a scientific matter, solve a problem. And so, when we looked at these people, we have a $700,000 a year utilities czar in Los Angeles, and she cannot explain why there was not enough water, at least in a convincing way, because she’s never had to, because she was ideologically correct. You have an assistant fire chief who said, if women can’t—if I can’t carry out a man [out of a burning building], then that’s not on me. It’s the man shouldn’t be there. It’s like saying if a child fell down a well, and I’m not physically strong enough to retrieve him and save him, that’s his fault. He shouldn’t have been in the well. Why does a person say that? Because she knows that she was appointed to that position on other criteria. The same thing holds true, no need to get into the mayor, who people voted [for] as a DEI candidate. She said at one point, a few years ago, ‘Don’t blame the homeless for these fires.’ So, we get—in conclusion in the Los Angeles catastrophe, there are whole areas of empirical inquiry that are put off- limits. You cannot talk about the homeless and whether there was a homeless person who was out in the hills, to get warm light a fire. It’s a legitimate topic of inquiry. It’s happened. You can’t talk about— [Los Angeles Mayor] Karen Bass, as I said, ‘Don’t talk about that,’ in the past. You cannot talk about the fire department because it is run by people who were appointed primarily because of the DEI criteria and to do so makes you a homophobe. You cannot talk about fires and the lack of forest safety, forest ecology, because to do so challenges the green ideology. I could go on. But until the society says that we are going to have free speech, no topic is taboo, and we can find the answer to questions by symptomology—we look at all of the evidence, and then we make a diagnosis. … And then we make a prognosis. Until we can do that without the influence or the tyranny of these ideologies—in our case, our generation, it’s ‘diversity, equity, inclusion,’ and radical environmentalism that preclude free discussion and the pathway to the truth, we’re going to have more Los Angeloses, I’m afraid to say. …” [Boldface added] See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy, links under Suppressing Scientific Inquiry, links under Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science for arguments that AAAS should become more political and links under California Fire for many examples of government officials shirking the primary responsibility maintaining public safety. For an essay on the insurance problems see Article #1 **************** Academics v. Professionals: Thus far, possibly the most irresponsible response from academics came from UCLA which linked two wet raining seasons and about 10 months of drying on manmade “climate change.” The claim has a tiny element of truth, carbon dioxide is enhancing vegetation growth, but it is surrounded by bodyguard of lies. Separately ecologist Jim Steele and meteorologist Cliff Mass penetrate through the false claims. In “Assigning Responsibility for the Tragic Los Angeles Fires” Steele writes: “Knowing that natural, lethal fire dangers are always looming for the growing population, the question is whether city and state governments could have been better prepared to minimize ignitions and more efficiently contain a fire’s spread through southern California. When fires reach neighborhoods with densely packed houses, one burning structure can radiate enough heat to ignite adjacent buildings causing entire neighborhoods to burn to the ground. An increase in the destruction of property by wildfires better correlates with population growth and the expansion of an electrical grid that is vulnerable to high winds. Increased 1-hour fuels and 10-hour fuels due to land disturbances and poor land management correlate with bigger fires. Increased homeless populations correlates with more ignitions.” [Boldface added] In “Why the LA Wildfires Have Little to do With Long-Term Drought or Climate Change” Mass writes: “Most of these fuels are 1-10 hr. fuels, which means they typically dry out after 1-10 hours of drying conditions. The meteorological conditions immediately preceding the fires were so drying (very strong winds with very low humidities) that even if it had rained the week before, the fire still would have occurred.” It takes one to ten hours for Santa Ana winds to dry out the southern California landscape, not a season or a major drought. Perhaps densely packed neighborhoods should require hard landscaping such as crushed rock; fire resistant roofs, such as steel or tile; and non-combustible decks, fire-resistant decks are required in fire prone areas. See links under California Fires. **************** The Other California Fire: Initially, the mainstream media ignored another significant California fire. This one at what was the world’s largest battery storage system (BESS) which is located at Moss Landing, Monterey Bay, California. The fire was significant not because it caused deaths (none), or extensive property damage (none outside the facility) but because it triggered major evacuation orders. Lithium fires release real toxins such as hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen cyanide in addition to the EPA pseudo-pollutant carbon dioxide. The best fire control strategy is to evacuate the area and let it burn. Reports are spotty, but it appears that about 7500 acres were evacuated and about 1200 to 1500 people. This is the third or fourth such fire at the facility. The acreage and number of people involved are trivial compared to the Los Angeles basin fires. But as Francis Menton discusses, lithium battery storage is being planned to replace natural gas peaking plants in all five boroughs in New York City. The first one is to begin construction this spring in Queens Borough, across the East River from mid-town Manhattan. A major evacuation order would cause chaos. If the project continues, it will be another example of public official hubris. See links under Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Energy – Storage. **************** What Type of Salmon? Hydraulic Dam opponents are claiming that the dams on the west coast are destroying the salmon fisheries. Already, California politicians are bragging about the removal of dams along the Klamath River, with little concern for the agricultural communities hurt by such actions. Efforts are being made to remove dams along the Columbia River, particularly on its tributary the Snake River which flows from Wyoming through Idaho. Oregon, and Washington before joining the Columbia River. The purpose of the dam removal is to restore the spectacular runs of Chinook Salmon to these areas. But will it? TWTW reader Ken Snider draws attention to a skeptical post by Craig Medred, who cites a report by Idaho fish specialists for the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission, which questions the assumption that dams are a major cause of the declining runs of Chinook salmon. One issue for the decline is the return of marine mammals which gorge themselves on salmon, particularly at the mouth of the Columbia River. These mammals include seals and killer whales. TWTW reader Ken Snider draws attention to a skeptical post by Craig Medred, who cites a report by Idaho fish specialists for the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission, which questions the assumption that dams are a major cause of the declining runs of Chinook salmon. Another issue is manmade. Fish hatcheries have shifted in the types of salmon they produce. They now emphasize pink salmon, which do not travel long distances up rivers, typically less than 40 miles, with exceptions. The huge expansion in hatcheries and the shift in fish they produce may significantly increase competition for food sources to the detriment of Chinook salmon. According the Alaska Department of Fish and Game: “Alaska hatchery salmon releases grew from less than 100 million young fish in 1980 to about 2 billion per year today. Alaska’s release of close to 1.5 billion salmon fry in 2000 accounted for 69 percent of the coastwide, North American release of salmon, ISER [Institute of Social and Economic Research] reported, with about 94 percent of those salmon pinks and chum of significantly lower value than Chinook, coho and sockeye salmon but far and away the cheapest fish to produce. Alaska would continue to boost pink and chum hatchery releases in the years that followed, as would Russia after witnessing Alaska’s hatchery success, and by the late 2010s, scientists were reporting that there were more salmon in the North Pacific than at any time in human history with the pinks, the smallest and least valuable of the species, dominant.” [Boldface added] The hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest greatly added to the prosperity of the Pacific Northwest. Destroying these dams “to save salmon” may be destruction for no purpose but political hubris. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. **************** Number of the Week: 56 percent since 1990. Using the “Cumulative CO₂ emissions” data from Our World in Data, Jo Nova estimates that 56% of cumulative CO2 occurred since 1990. Though she does not say this, 1990 was the year the UN IPCC released its First Assessment Report, which was drastically changed in its 1992 Assessments and subsequent reports blaming human emissions of CO2 for climate change. One could argue that the more the UN IPCC and its collaborators rail against carbon dioxide with false claims of climate change, the more humans release carbon dioxide.

Censorship Australian Labour Party Disinformation Portal “Swamped” With Party’s Own Misleading Ads By Rebekah Barnet, Aug 30, 2025 Climate misinformation is rife on social media – and poised to get worse By Jill Hopke, The Conversation, Jan 17, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] In 2020, Meta rolled out its Climate Science Information Center on Facebook to respond to climate misinformation. Currently, third-party fact-checkers working with Meta flag false and misleading posts. Meta then decides whether to attach a warning label to them and reduce how much the company’s algorithms promote them. [SEPP Comment: Meta was an example of biased censorship supporting concepts that lacked physical evidence. According to the author, stopping biased censorship is censorship?] Suppressing Scientific Inquiry Paper Showing Earth’s Atmosphere Has Become ‘Saturated’ With Carbon Dioxide and More Carbon Emissions Won’t Make Any Difference Is Retracted Following Positive Coverage in the Daily Sceptic By Chris Morrison, The Daily Sceptic, Jan 13, 2025 Link to paper: RETRACTED: Climatic consequences of the process of saturation of radiation absorption in gases By Jan Kubicki [Institute of Optoelectronics], Krzysztof Kopczyński, and Jarosław Młyńczak, Applications in Engineering Science, March 2024 This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief. Subsequent to acceptance of this paper, the rigor and quality of the peer-review process for this paper was investigated and confirmed to fall beneath the high standards expected by Applications in Engineering Science. After review by additional expert referees, the Editor-in-Chief has lost confidence in the validity of the paper and has decided to retract. Morrison: The paper discussed the atmospheric ‘saturation’ of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and argued that higher levels will not cause temperatures to rise.

The Creeping Corruption of DEI By Henry Miller, MD, ACSH, Jan 10, 2025 American science and medicine are becoming increasingly infiltrated by Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), to their detriment. In their zeal to be inclusive, the feds seem to have forgotten the old adage that there are two kinds of medicine — the kind that works and the kind that doesn’t. The latter, sometimes dubbed “alternative medicine,” claims the ability to prevent or treat disease despite lacking biological plausibility, testability, repeatability, or evidence of safety and effectiveness.

On December 31, Reuters reported that Citibank and Bank of America had just quit the NZAB. Morgan Stanley announced its exit on January 2. JP Morgan quit on January 7. These six big banks among them have a market share of more than 25% of the entire U.S. banking industry. And then, just yesterday, the largest asset manager in the country, BlackRock, quit the NZAMI. Of the three largest asset managers, another one, Vanguard, had already quit back in 2022. That leaves only State Street remaining, of the big three.

Demand for natural gas will still remain high in winter for many years to come – we still need it to heat our homes and generate electricity in weeks like this one.

By John Carr, Net Zero Watch, Jan 16, 2025 The difference in fuel means the radioactive waste from fusion has a shorter lifetime than that from fission and so simplifies long-term waste handling. Unfortunately, fusion reactions are more difficult to initiate and contain than fission, meaning the power stations must be much more complex and expensive. While fission has produced electricity on world-wide grids for 70 years, fusion has been in a research and development phase during the same period. There are currently about 90 operational fusion devices in 50 different countries around the world, of which 3 are in the UK. Forty more are under development.

A Tale of Two State Insurance Markets Florida fixed its market with reforms. California didn’t. See the results. By The Editorial Board, WSJ, Jan. 16, 2025 TWTW summary. After the California fires, many homeowners and politicians will blame insurance companies for lack of payment. But many problems occur from state insurance regulations. The editorial begins with: “Hard to believe, but the Los Angeles wildfires have Republicans in Congress talking about federalizing home insurance. Why should all Americans be on the hook for insurance liabilities of states like California that have mismanaged their markets?” The editorial discusses a specific example than continues with: “The 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act enshrines state regulatory authority over insurance. This system has worked relatively well over 80 years. But some states have done a better job of managing their markets than others. California and Florida provide an illustrative contrast. Democratic insurance commissioners in the Golden State have for years suppressed rates. Until recently, California was the only state that prohibited carriers from using catastrophe models to project disaster risk and pricing reinsurance costs into their premiums. Wildfires—exacerbated by the state’s poor land mismanagement—have swelled insurer claims and liabilities. Insurers are paying out $1.09 in expenses and claims for every $1 they collect in premiums. They’ve curbed their exposure in part by dropping policy holders in high-risk areas and leaving the market. The liabilities of the state’s insurer of last resort, FAIR, have exploded to $458 billion from $153 billion in 2020, with $5.9 billion in exposure in the Pacific Palisades. Yet Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara rejected FAIR’s proposed rate increases while requiring it to cover homes worth up to $3 million. FAIR President Victoria Roach told the state Assembly last year that the insurer in 2021 requested a 48.8% rate increase—less than the 70% it needed—but was approved for 15.7%. FAIR is under-capitalized and had only $700 million in cash on hand as of last year to pay claims. To prevent more insurers from leaving the state, Mr. Lara last month finally let carriers to price in their reinsurance costs and use catastrophe models. But he also capped the reinsurance costs that carriers can pass along. Rates are set to rise 20% to 40% this year, though this still may not be enough to cover insurer liabilities. Unable to raise rates, many insurers have increased deductibles and capped maximum payments. That means insurers might not cover all of the fire damage, and some homeowners will face hefty rebuilding costs. Lucky for them the Federal Emergency Management Agency covers losses if homeowners are ‘under-insured.’ This means taxpayers in Houston and Little Rock may pay for rebuilding multi-million-dollar homes in California. If FAIR becomes insolvent, all insurers in California—meaning their customers—are on the hook for its claims. Homeowners could see rates rise by thousands of dollars a year. In Florida, in striking contrast, Republicans headed off an insurance market death spiral caused by litigation abuse. State law had allowed policy holders to assign their claim benefits to contractors working with trial lawyers. Contractors would inflate charges and then sue insurers if they rejected them, setting up a costly claim-by-claim battle. Insurers lost hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and more than a dozen failed between 2020 and 2022. Others left the market because litigation costs made it difficult to obtain reinsurance. Florida’s insurer of last resort, Citizens Property Insurance Corp., became the state’s biggest carrier and was in danger of collapsing. Enter Gov. Ron DeSantis, who championed tort reforms in 2022 and 2023 that have stanched the flood of frivolous lawsuits, stabilized the market and reduced Citizens’ exposure. According to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, nine insurers have since entered the market. Sixty percent of Florida’s top 10 carriers have expanded their business in the state, and 40% have filed for rate decreases. The average monthly request for rate increases is now 1.2%, compared to 14% a few years ago. If not for Mr. DeSantis’s reforms, last year’s hurricanes might have toppled Citizens. Federalizing the U.S. insurance market would create a moral hazard and discourage state reforms. Rather than protecting California’s Democrats from the costs of their blunders, Republicans should point to Florida.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Not so long ago, Mark Zuckerberg [seemed to want] the public to view him not just as an empire builder, but also as a world-saver. Meta Platforms’ CEO publicly committed parts of his vast fortune to causes like immigration reform and voter access. He spoke out about combating poverty and hunger and stressed the importance of equality. In a flurry of announcements, Zuckerberg confirmed a change of heart. Now, he [appears to have] whittled his ambitions. Getting rid of fact checkers and loosening the rules on what users can say on Meta’s platforms [will likely] heighten misinformation and abusive speech. He also ended Meta’s commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Also Read: Zuckerberg’s Meta shift will leave the user base of his platforms splitThis may be an extreme case, but across America Inc, the trend is pointing in the same direction: CEOs are spending much less time, energy and money trying to publicly position themselves as change agents. In Silicon Valley, the make-the-world-a-better-place discourse of the early boom years has mostly disappeared. On Wall Street, big institutions from JPMorgan Chase to Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have abandoned one of the world’s biggest finance groups dedicated to battling climate change. Companies that put out statements about racial justice after the murder of George Floyd have rolled back DEI investments. Some of the CEOs who stood up to Donald Trump’s Muslim-majority country travel ban and condemned the 6 January riots have made $1 million donations to his inauguration fund. You could argue that many of those initiatives were just corporate virtue signalling. But what’s clear is companies don’t feel much of a need to virtue signal anymore. And no wonder: The public isn’t all that interested in virtue right now, and business seems to be having a hard time convincing Americans that it ever had much of it. CEOs’ attempts to portray themselves as do-gooders have typically been a business posture rather than a moral one. Starting a foundation or throwing a smidgen of a company’s resources behind a popular cause has historically been a useful tool to repair corporate reputations in the aftermath of scandals and catastrophes. Starbucks, for example, instituted a policy in 2018 that let anyone, not just paying customers, hang out in its stores or use its bathrooms. This was instituted after the company was accused of racial bias and faced boycotts when two [African American] men were arrested in a Philadelphia store. “We are committed to creating a culture of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome," the company said. This week, Starbucks said it would end the practice in order to help reinvigorate the brand. Its management does not seem too worried about blowback or being labelled a flip-flopper. Plenty of these corporate reversals are a straightforward response to political winds blowing towards the right and President-elect Donald Trump. Zuckerberg admitted as much in his announcement, justifying his decision by saying “the recent election also feels like a cultural tipping point." The company has the same calculus as many others: It would rather be called a hypocrite by those on the left than become a target of the right for ‘woke’ policies. But it’s also apparent to America Inc’s CEOs that not only has the “#resistance" that pressured them to stand up to Trump’s line-crossing in his first term gone mute, but some business leaders are being cheered for flouting traditional expectations of decorum. Case in point: the language used by Elon Musk, who has only seen his wealth and power grow. Also Read: Welcome Elon Musk, the shadow president-elect of the United StatesNow Zuckerberg seems to be following a similar playbook. His burst of activity last week included announcing new Meta board member Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, a Trump loyalist who two years ago was captured on video slapping his wife; telling Joe Rogan that companies need more “masculine energy," overseeing the announcement that Meta would end its DEI efforts; and saying that it would get rid of fact checkers on its platforms—a change he acknowledged would mean they would “catch less bad stuff." The Intercept published excerpts of the new internal training materials, which said allowed speech would now include examples like “immigrants are grubby, filthy pieces of bleep" and “gays are freaks." Will Zuckerberg’s company also find itself rewarded? Users and advertisers may be grumbling, but so far there has been no mass exodus from his platforms. If Meta’s big pivot succeeds, we can expect to see more CEOs exploring [dark spaces]. And why not? If the US public does not expect more of business leaders, why bother to keep such temptations in check? ©Bloomberg Also Read: Mint Quick Edit | Meta’s morphosis: Good news or bad?

Title: TikTok Restores Service After US Ban, Thanks Incoming President Donald Trump

Photo Credit: Reuters Not everyone in Trump's Republican Party agreed with efforts to get around the law and "Save TikTok" TikTok began restoring its services on Sunday after President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app's access in the US when he returns to power on Monday. "Frankly, we have no choice. We have to save it," Trump said at a rally on Sunday ahead of his inauguration, adding that the US will seek a joint venture to restore the short-video sharing app used by 170 million Americans. In a message to users hours before the rally, TikTok said: "As a result of president Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the US" TikTok also issued an earlier statement after US users reported being able to access the Chinese-owned service's website while the far more widely used TikTok app itself began coming back online for some users with just a few basic services. As of Sunday evening, the app remained unavailable for download on US app stores. "In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service," TikTok said in the earlier statement that also thanked Trump for "providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over seven million small businesses to thrive." TikTok's public thanks to Trump, the day before he takes office, comes at a tense moment in US-China relations. Trump has said he intends to place tariffs on China but has also indicated he hopes to have more direct contact with China's leader. The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said. TikTok stopped working for US. users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect on Sunday. US officials had warned that under Chinese parent company ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused. Trump said he would "extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security." "I would like the United States to have a 50 percent ownership position in a joint venture," he wrote on Truth Social. Trump said the executive order would specify there would be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before his order. Trump had earlier said he would most likely give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned," a message notified users of TikTok, which disappeared from Apple and Google app stores late on Saturday. Trump saving TikTok represents a reversal in stance from his first term in office. In 2020, he aimed to ban the app over concerns the company was sharing Americans' personal info with the Chinese government. More recently, Trump has said he has "a warm spot in my heart for TikTok," crediting the app with helping him win over young voters in the 2024 election. In August 2020, Trump signed an executive order giving ByteDance 90 days to sell TikTok but then blessed a deal structured as a partnership rather than a divestment that would have included both Oracle and Walmart taking stakes in the new company. Not everyone in Trump's Republican Party agreed with efforts to get around the law and "Save TikTok". Republican senators Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said in a joint statement: "Now that the law has taken effect, there is no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law's qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China." The US has never banned a major social media platform. The law passed overwhelmingly by Congress gives the incoming Trump administration sweeping authority to ban or seek the sale of other Chinese-owned apps. Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app CapCut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday. Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 'Hair on Fire' Moment Web searches for "VPN" spiked in the minutes after US users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans in what one executive described as a "hair on fire" moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the US presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's US operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. US search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok US, a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok US and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 percent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 percent each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the US. © Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Please stay tuned," a message notified users of TikTok, which disappeared from Apple and Google app stores late on Saturday. Trump saving TikTok represents a reversal in stance from his first term in office. In 2020, he aimed to ban the app over concerns the company was sharing Americans' personal info with the Chinese government. More recently, Trump has said he has "a warm spot in my heart for TikTok," crediting the app with helping him win over young voters in the 2024 election.Order to sell TiktokIn August 2020, Trump signed an executive order giving ByteDance 90 days to sell TikTok but then blessed a deal structured as a partnership rather than a divestment that would have included both Oracle ORCL.N and Walmart taking stakes in the new company.Not everyone in Trump's Republican Party agreed with efforts to get around the law and "Save TikTok."Republican senators Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said in a joint statement: "Now that the law has taken effect, there is no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law's qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China."The US has never banned a major social media platform.

Title: Pancreatic cancer: ‘I just can’t explain what it felt like hearing those words’

Often dubbed “the silent killer”, pancreatic cancer has one of the least successful outcomes of all types of the disease. With roughly 600 cases diagnosed in Ireland each year, it is not as common as other forms of cancer. But while incidence rates may be at the lower end of the scale – the rate of skin cancer is roughly 13,000 annually – it has a poor survival rate, with five out of six people with pancreatic cancer dying from the disease. However, although the signs can be very difficult to spot, as in the early stages they can be similar to other less serious conditions, the sooner the patient is diagnosed the better chances they have of survival. Susan McSweeney can attest to this as she was diagnosed with the disease in early 2024. Thankfully, she was very vigilant about her health and went to see her GP as soon as she began to feel unwell. “I went to my doctor with a cough, which was initially diagnosed as reflux,” she says. “But when my GP felt around my back she thought that it seemed tender around the lower left area,” says Susan. “Because I am quite fit and went to the gym three times a week, and also love walking and mountain biking, I had brushed it [the tenderness] off as muscle strain, but my doctor said it might be a good idea to get a ultrasound as there would be ‘no harm’ in doing one. “There is a clinic in Blackrock village [in Dublin] where you can have a walk-in ultrasound, so, although I had a referral, I didn’t need it to go there – so I went off and had it done and the results showed up a blockage in my pancreatic duct. After that, the doctor referred me to a gastroenterologist – even though she thought I was in good health because I was not jaundiced. But although she seemed in no rush to push things forward, I decided to change to St Vincent’s hospital [with the initial referral] where there was definitely a much greater sense of urgency.” Although the now 54-year-old, who lives in Dublin with her husband James and two grown-up sons, was sent for further tests, the results were a complete shock. “I underwent an endoscopic ultrasound and was told that a biopsy was to be taken, but afterwards they said that no biopsy was retrieved. I received a call a few days after the scan to say that an MRI that I was booked in for was being brought forward. “Hearing this set off alarm bells and then, when we met my consultant, I was told that I had a tumour. James and I were completely shell-shocked – I just can’t explain what it felt like hearing those words. Apparently, the biopsy could not be taken because the tumour – which was a PT1C N0 grade – was too near the gastroduodenal artery. They mentioned the word ‘Whipple’, which was almost too much to take in at the time, but I was told that I had been booked in for Whipple surgery – which involves removing the affected part of pancreas, bile duct, duodenum and part of the stomach – on April 19th, 2024. “I had no doubt that it would be a very tough surgery and afterwards I was in hospital for three weeks because my stomach was not emptying. I was fed by TPN [total parenteral nutrition] for the whole time, which meant that I could not have any water or food by mouth – and I would say that, without a doubt, that was the toughest part. “Then, about six weeks after the operation, I saw my oncologist and was told that I would be given six months [12 rounds] of Folfirinox – and I started chemotherapy on July 3rd. It involved one day each week in hospital getting chemotherapy through a port [on a Wednesday], then bringing the chemo home with me in a pump for 46 hours and going back to St Vincent’s hospital on a Friday afternoon to be disconnected. “The first few months were not too bad and I was still swimming and walking and only felt sick for a couple of days after having my chemo. But that all changed from September when the cumulative effect of the treatment started to kick in. I know that everybody is different, but it is a very rough regime.” The mother of two, who runs a family law firm in Dublin, underwent her last session of chemotherapy in December and says she is doing well and is positive about her recovery. She is grateful for all the support she received during her gruelling ordeal and says she is so fortunate to be here today and would encourage everyone, including GPs, to know the vital signs which could save someone’s life. “The care that I have received from St Vincent’s oncology has been amazing. In spite of all the hardship involved in going on in the ward, everyone seems upbeat and that is down to the phenomenal nursing staff who have been there with me every step of the way. I have had two admissions to A&E throughout my treatment, for viruses, but never felt nervous or afraid, as I have been so well looked after. So, I would advise anyone who is going through something similar to hand over control to those in the know and don’t Google too much. “As for my family and friends, they have all been just fantastic and so supportive – from phone calls to dropping in dinners – because this treatment does not just affect me, it also affects my family too. “Thankfully, I was very lucky with my GP, but I would like for all GPs to be aware of the symptoms of pancreatic cancer and to know that jaundice is not the only sign. For me, the signs that I had pancreatic cancer were pain in lower left back, a cough that would not go away and light-coloured, floating stools. Also, as well as making people aware of what to look out for, I would like to get out there that St Vincent’s hospital is the centre of excellence for all things pancreatic. This would save time with regard to consultant referrals. “My advice to others is that if something does not feel quite right, always go to your GP and get it checked out. Something as simple as an ultrasound could save your life, like it did mine. Although I do not yet know what the future holds until I get the full low down at my next appointment, I am determined to raise awareness and raise up the success stories.” Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide – because so many cases are at an advanced stage when diagnosed, 50 per cent die within the first year. Some of the early signs of pancreatic cancer are similar to other health conditions and Prof Grainne O’Kane, consultant oncologist specialising in pancreatic cancer malignancies, said the disease is so lethal that clinical trials should be considered part of the first line of treatment. “Early intervention is critical and aligned to clinical trials will lead to better outcomes,” she says. “People should be aware of the link between the six leading symptoms and pancreatic cancer, particularly if there is a family history of the disease. “Depending on the stage of the cancer at diagnosis, the treatment for pancreatic cancer includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy but over 80 per cent of people are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery [Whipple] because symptoms do not develop until the advanced stage of the disease.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Is Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve A Threat To Freedom?

ATLANTA, GEORGIA - JUNE 27: Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump ... [+] participates in the CNN Presidential Debate at the CNN Studios on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia. Former President Trump and U.S. President Joe Biden are facing off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Donald Trump assumes office with plans to make the United States the world's bitcoin mining capital. Many are celebrating the idea of bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset. Supporters like Michael Saylor, Tether, and other large institutional players argue this is a landmark achievement, reinforcing bitcoin's status as a legitimate store of value. However, this growing institutionalization risks compromising bitcoin's original ethos as "freedom money," with its decentralization and censorship resistance eroding under the weight of regulatory and economic control. Truth Social Trump's administration has made bitcoin mining a national priority, framing it as an opportunity to dominate the "block space". Rachel Silverstein, U.S. General Counsel for Bitfarms, commented on the day of the election that, "Sanctions in my mind are a way to avoid war," and continued to say leaving sanctions as a tool for states to use is important. Bitcoin blocks have a finite capacity, limiting the number of transactions that can be included in each block. Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, commented in an X post: "Block space ensures the ability to transact. Let's keep the US as the most dominant Bitcoin mining country in the world." This dominance could empower the U.S. to enforce transaction censorship via compliance with Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions or other regulatory tools. The precedent for such control already exists. In 2021, Marathon attempted to mine "OFAC-compliant" blocks, filtering transactions from sanctioned entities. More recently, mining pools like F2Pool have been flagged for possibly excluding sanctioned transactions. Trump's push for mining dominance presents a clear path to institutionalizing these practices, leveraging tools like the Bank Secrecy Act and FATF recommendations that promote widespread KYC and classify wallet software as Crypto Asset Service Providers. U.S. regulations often set the tone for the international community, particularly in financial systems. For example, the FATF's global anti-money laundering standards reflect U.S. priorities, and its recommendations have influenced crypto regulations worldwide. Trump's administration could use bitcoin mining dominance to propagate a framework that aligns with U.S. geopolitical goals. Former White House cybersecurity advisor Carol House suggested in a 2023 talk that network-level censorship could serve national interests, demonstrating the potential to regulate bitcoin under the guise of national security. The United States has a history of extending its financial jurisdiction beyond its borders to combat illicit activities. For instance, in January 2023, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network identified Bitzlato Limited, a Hong Kong-registered cryptocurrency exchange, as a "primary money laundering concern" due to its connections with Russian illicit finance. This designation led to prohibitions on certain fund transmittals involving Bitzlato by any covered financial institution, effectively restricting its operations on a global scale. In March 2023, U.S. and German authorities shut down ChipMixer, a cryptocurrency service that allegedly laundered over $3 billion in crypto assets since 2017. ChipMixer was reportedly used by ransomware groups, suspected North Korean hackers, and darknet market users to conceal the origins of illicit funds. These actions demonstrate how the U.S.extends its regulatory reach to enforce financial laws internationally. Advocates like Senator Cynthia Lummis tout the SBR as a solution to U.S. economic challenges, claiming it could "address a meaningful portion of our debt" and strengthen global positioning. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, proposals go further, suggesting the U.S. government should acquire 20-25% of bitcoin to "control the world reserve capital network." Saylors Digital Assets Framework highlights the role of criminal liability in enforcing compliance and transparency, ensuring participants adhere to legal and ethical standards while minimizing fraud and misconduct. Frameworks like this could be leveraged to strengthen centralization, potentially solidifying the U.S.'s grip on bitcoin and transforming it from an open, neutral network into a tool of statecraft. This narrative hides the dangers of institutionalizing bitcoin. Saylor has acknowledged the risks associated with non-compliance to regulatory standards, stating: "I think that when bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto-anarchists who aren’t regulated entities, who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure." This perspective aligns with moves like Lummis's 2023 amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, targeting anonymous transactions and asset mixers, and shows how the SRA framework could enforce stringent oversight, reducing bitcoin's utility as a censorship-resistant currency. While bitcoin's role as an SBR gets attention, stablecoin giant Tether operates in parallel, profiting immensely from global instability. Reports indicate that Tether's Q3 2024 earnings surpassed those of BlackRock, with Tether reporting a net profit of $2.5 billion compared to BlackRock's $1.63 billion net income for the same quarter. Tether's substantial earnings were primarily due to its investments in U.S. Treasury securities, which yielded significant returns during the quarter. By backing its reserves with U.S. Treasuries, Tether inadvertently supports U.S. monetary policy while providing a stopgap for regions burdened by imported inflation. This maintains the U.S. hegemony at the cost of worsening global financial inequalities, turning Tether into a lifeline, a control mechanism and a top buyer for US debt. Bitcoin is hailed as "freedom money", a tool for financial sovereignty, free from state control. However, as institutional players co-opt its narrative, its fundamental properties are threatened. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, praised for accelerating bitcoin adoption through global game theory and increased legitimacy, also opens the door to regulatory overreach that threatens to compromise the network’s decentralization. At a technical level, the realities of regulatory overreach could manifest in the mechanics of bitcoin mining. Miners facing regulatory compliance may increasingly prioritize compliant transactions, leaving less block space for non-compliant ones. Over time, this could drive up fees for non-compliant transactions, effectively pricing them out of the market. This creates a system where financial sovereignty remains theoretically intact but becomes practically inaccessible for those unwilling or unable to meet regulatory demands. Figures like Donald Trump profit from the systems they claim to empower. Just days before his inauguration, President-elect Trump launched a meme coin called $TRUMP. Announced on his Truth Social and X accounts, the coin's value surged over 300% within hours, reaching a market capitalization of $8 billion. Critics argue that such ventures prioritize hype and profit over meaningful contributions. By focusing on short-term financial gains, these efforts risk trivializing any potential and distracting from its role in advancing financial freedoms and resisting institutional control. According to an article by the Associated Press, the Trump Organization, through CIC Digital, controls 80% of the tokens, with plans to release up to 1 billion over three years. The international community must scrutinize the implications of bitcoin's institutionalization. While the SRA narrative dazzles with promises of economic stability, it risks undermining bitcoin's core mission. Systemic reforms are needed to preserve its role as a tool for human freedom. This may require repealing or reforming laws such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which grants the President authority to regulate commerce during national emergencies, and the Bank Secrecy Act, which enforces stringent anti-money laundering and financial surveillance measures. Senator Mike Lee introduced the Saving Privacy Act in September 2024, aiming to scale back the Bank Secrecy Act's reporting requirements and strengthen protections for Americans' financial data, demonstrating growing congressional support for privacy-focused reforms. Having a legislative framework is one thing, it provides clarity, sets expectations, and establishes a legal environment where people and companies can innovate. However, the framework should not be restrictive to the point of undermining bitcoin’s core principles. As Fred Thiel's comments remind us, "It's all about block space." If the U.S. controls this resource, the ideals of financial sovereignty and permissionless innovation could be irreversibly compromised. The world faces a choice: preserve Bitcoin as a decentralized network for everyone or let it become a tool of state control. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

A leading NGO warned Monday of an emerging "aristocratic oligarchy" with massive political clout and primed to profit from Donald Trump's presidency, as global elites descend on Davos for their annual confab. The World Economic Forum kicks off in the Swiss Alpine resort on the same day as the presidential inauguration of Trump, who will not be in Davos but will make an online appearance later in the week. Global charity Oxfam said in a report that Trump's election win and tax-cut plans are a boon to billionaires, whose combined wealth already grew by another $2 trillion last year to $15 trillion. "Trillions are being gifted in inheritance, creating a new aristocratic oligarchy that has immense power in our politics and our economy," Oxfam said in its traditional annual pre-Davos report on the super rich. The organisation echoed similar language used last week by outgoing US President Joe Biden, who sounded the alarm about an extremely wealthy oligarchy that "literally threatens our entire democracy". Oxfam pointed out that Tesla and X owner Elon Musk helped to bankroll Trump's campaign. "The crown jewel of this oligarchy is a billionaire president, backed and bought by the world's richest man Elon Musk, running the world's largest economy," said the charity's executive director Amitabh Behar. "We present this report as a stark wake up-call that ordinary people the world over are being crushed by the enormous wealth of a tiny few," Behar added. The report, titled "Takers Not Makers", found that 204 new billionaires emerged last year -- almost four every week -- to bring the total to 2,769. Total billionaire wealth grew three times faster last year than in 2023, each billionaire seeing their fortune increase by $2 million per day on average. And, according to Oxfam, five trillionaires could emerge in a decade. Trump's election "gave a huge further boost to billionaire fortunes, while his policies are set to fan the flames of inequality further", Oxfam said. In the United States "we are in a situation where you can buy a country, with the risk of weakening democracy", said the head of Oxfam France, Cecile Duflot. The world's three richest men will be at his inauguration: Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, whose Meta empire owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The tech trio is not expected in Davos, however. Some 3,000 participants are expected at the Swiss ski village for the forum ending Friday -- including 60 heads of state or government and more than 900 CEOs -- for days of schmoozing and behind-the-scenes dealmaking. A few hundred protesters blocked an access road to Davos on Sunday, holding banners reading "tax the rich" and "burn the system", and causing a traffic jam until police dispersed them. "The WEF symbolises how much power wealthy people like me hold," said Austrian-German heiress Marlene Engelhorn, who gave away the bulk of her multi-million-euro inheritance to dozens of organisations working on social issues. "Because just because we are born millionaires, or because we got lucky once -- and call that self-made -- we now get to influence politicians worldwide with our political preferences," she told AFP. While Trump will not be in Davos in person, his presidency will dominate discussions. His plans to impose trade tariffs, loosen regulations, extend tax breaks and curb immigration will have far-reaching effects on the global economy. He has named hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as his Treasury secretary, while billionaire businessman Howard Lutnick will head the Commerce Department. Rising inequalities have fuelled debates about imposing a global tax on the super-rich. "I don't want to live in a country with a few rich people and lots of poor people," said Morris Pearl, a former managing director at investment giant BlackRock. He is now a member of Patriotic Millionaires, a group that backs raising taxes on the rich. "I'm afraid that we're going to have civil unrest if we don't change things," Pearl told AFP.

DAVOS, Switzerland - A leading NGO warned on Monday of an emerging "aristocratic oligarchy" with massive political clout and primed to profit from Donald Trump's presidency, as global elites descend on Davos for their annual confab.

Title: The Evolution of the Militarized Data Broker

Time Published: 2025-01-20T00:08:00Z

EditorTech Mark Goodwin, Unlimited Hangout While often mythologized as having been created to champion human freedom, the internet and many of its most popular companies, like ARPANET, were directly birthed out of the national security apparatus of the United States. Today, the world’s economy no longer runs on oil, but data. Shortly after the advent of the microprocessor came the internet, unleashing an onslaught of data running on the coils of fiber optic cables beneath the oceans and satellites above the skies. While often posited as a liberator of humanity against the oppressors of nation-states that allows previously impossible interconnectivity and social organization between geographically separated cultures to circumnavigate the monopoly on violence of world governments, ironically, the internet itself was birthed out of the largest military empire of the modern world – the United States. Specifically, the internet began as ARPANET, a project of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which in 1972 became known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), currently housed within the Department of Defense. ARPA was created by President Eisenhower in 1958 within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) in direct response to the U.S.’ greatest military rival, the USSR, successfully launching Sputnik, the first artificial satellite in Earth’s orbit with data broadcasting technology. While historically considered the birth of the Space Race, in reality, the formation of ARPA began the now-decades-long militarization of data brokers, quickly leading to world-changing developments in global positioning systems (GPS), the personal computer, networks of computational information processing (“time-sharing”), primordial artificial intelligence, and weaponized autonomous drone technology. In October 1962, the recently-formed ARPA appointed J.C.R. Licklider, a former MIT professor and vice president of Bolt Beranek and Newman (known as BBN, currently owned by defense contractor Raytheon), to head their Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). At BBN, Licklider developed the earliest known ideas for a global computer network, publishing a series of memos in August 1962 that birthed his “Intergalactic Computer Network” concept. Six months after his appointment to ARPA, Licklider would distribute a memo to his IPTO colleagues – addressed to “Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network”– describing a “time-sharing network of computers” – building off a similar exploration of communal, distributed computation by John Forbes Nash, Jr. in his 1954 paper “Parallel Control” commissioned by defense contractor RAND – which would build the foundational concepts for ARPANET, the first implementation of today’s Internet. Prior to the technological innovations explored by Licklider and his ARPA colleagues, data communication – at this time, mainly voice via telephone lines – were based on circuit switching, in which each telephone call would be manually connected by a switch operator to establish a dedicated, end-to-end analog electrical connection between the two parties. The RAND Corporation’s Paul Baran, and later ARPA itself, would begin to work on methods to allow formidable data communication in the event of a partial disconnection, such as from a nuclear event or other act of war, leading to a distributed network of unmanned nodes that would compartmentalize the desired information into smaller blocks of data – today referred to as packets – before routing them separately, only to be rejoined once received at the desired destination. While certainly unbeknownst to the technologists at the time, this achievement of both distributed routing and global information settlement via data packets created an entirely new commodity – digital data. Long before the USSR spooked the United States into formalizing ARPA due to fears of militarized satellite applications post-Sputnik launch, data brokers have played a significant role in warfare and specifically the markets surrounding military conflict. One well-known yet early example occurred during the Napoleonic wars in the 19th century, when the banking stalwart Rothschild family used carrier pigeons and horseback couriers to gain an information settlement edge related to battle outcomes, while speedily communicating with their traders back in London. These animal-driven technological exploits allowed Rothschild-affiliated brokers to place well-informed bets on the outcome of France’s warmongering to position themselves on the winning sides of large currency and commodity bets. This similar but modernized technique would later be employed by figures like commodity trader (and Mossad asset) Marc Rich in the 1980s, who used satellite phones and optical imagery techniques to track and relay oil tanker flows between nations, giving his trades an asymmetric advantage when dealing within the active petrodollar system. Similarly, Louis Bacon’s Moore Capital achieved 86% gains in its first year largely due to correctly anticipating Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait due to astute intelligence sharing from military sources, and correctly going long on oil prices while shorting stocks. As the front of modern warfare slowly evolved from direct military action into weaponized financial speculation, the market for data became just as valuable as the defense budget itself. It is for this reason that the necessity of sound data emerged as the foremost issue of national security, leading to a proliferation of advanced data brokers coming out of DARPA and the intelligence community, akin to the 21st century’s Manhattan Project. Exemplified by the creation of the CIA’s venture firm, In-Q-Tel, and the proliferation of Silicon Valley-based venture firms coalescing on Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto, CA, the financialization of a new crop of American data brokers was complete. The first firm to grace Sand Hill Road was Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, better known as KPCB, which participated in funding internet pioneers Amazon, AOL, and Compaq, while also directly seeding Netscape and Google. KPCB partners have included such government stalwarts as former Vice President Al Gore, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Ted Schlein – the latter being a board member of In-Q-Tel and member of the NSA’s advisory board. KPCB also had an intimate connection with internet networking pioneer Sun Microsystems, best known for building out the majority of network switches and other infrastructure needed for a modern broadband economy. Outside of the obvious need for network infrastructure for a data economy, an early Sun employee and eventual KPCB partner Bill Joy patented a widely-used distributed file system software known as NFS, or Network File System. Sun also established a public-sector focused subsidiary known as Sun Federal at the start of the 1990s. By 1991, Sun Federal was responsible for more than half of the workstations ordered by local, state and federal governments in the country. Perhaps the world’s most famous data broker, Google, whose founders both came out of Stanford University, was seeded by former Sun Microsystems founder Andy Bechtolsheim and his partner at the Ethernet switching company Granite Systems (later acquired by Cisco), David Cheriton, with Google’s most iconic CEO, Eric Schmidt, being the former CTO of Sun Microsystems. The emergence of Silicon Valley out of the academic circuit in Northern California was no accident, and in fact was directly influenced by an unclassified program known as the Massive Digital Data Systems (MDDS) project. The MDDS was created with direct participation from the CIA, NSA, and DARPA itself within the computer science programs at Stanford and CalTech, alongside MIT, Harvard and Carnegie Mellon. According to reporting from Quartz, this research, with clear national security implications, would be largely “funded and managed by unclassified science agencies like NSF (the National Science Foundation) allowing “the architecture to be scaled up in the private sector” in an attempt “to achieve what the intelligence community hoped for.” The MDDS white paper was released in 1993, and over a few years, more than a dozen grants of several million dollars each were distributed via the NSF in order to capture the most promising efforts, ensuring that those efforts would become intellectual property controlled by the United States regulatory regime. “Not only are activities becoming more complex, but changing demands require that the IC [Intelligence Community] process different types as well as larger volumes of data,” reads the MDDS white paper. “Consequently, the IC is taking a proactive role in stimulating research in the efficient management of massive databases and ensuring that IC requirements can be incorporated or adapted into commercial products. Because the challenges are not unique to any one agency, the Community Management Staff (CMS) has commissioned a Massive Digital Data Systems [MDDS] Working Group to address the needs and to identify and evaluate possible solutions.” The first unclassified briefing for scientists was titled “birds of a feather briefing” and was formalized during a 1995 conference in San Jose, CA, which was titled the “Birds of a Feather Session on the Intelligence Community Initiative in Massive Digital Data Systems.” That same year, one of the first MDDS grants was awarded to Stanford University, which was already a decade deep in working with NSF and DARPA grants. The primary objective of this grant was to “query optimization of very complex queries,” with a closely-followed second grant that aimed to build a massive digital library on the internet. These two grants funded research by then-Stanford graduate students and future Google cofounders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Two intelligence-community managers regularly met with Brin while he was still at Stanford and completing the research that would lead to the incorporation of Google, all paid for by grants provided by the NSA and CIA via MDDS. While often not discussed when describing Google’s origin story, the principal investigator for the MDDS grant specifically named Google as directly resulting from their research: “Its core technology, which allows it to find pages far more accurately than other search engines, was partially supported by this grant,” wrote Jeffrey Ullman. Furthering this concept, Stanford’s Infolab website explains that “the development of the Google algorithms was carried on a variety of computers, mainly provided by the NSF-DARPA-NASA-funded Digital Library project at Stanford.” Google would certainly set the standard for success during the first Dot Com bubble. Yet, shortly following their incorporation, two similar Silicon Valley companies with significant ties to the intelligence community would also emerge from colleges affiliated with the MDDS – PayPal and Facebook. PayPal was launched in December 1998 as Confinity Inc. by founders Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, alongside Luke Nosek and Ken Howery. The company sought to provide financial institutions with the technological ability to make mobile and online economic transactions secure using cryptography – technology at the time heavily regulated by the United States. Thiel had graduated from Stanford Law School in 1992, and then had a brief stint at the Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell – a legal practice long known for its ties to the U.S. intelligence apparatus. Early on, Confinity Inc. operated out of 165 University Avenue in Palo Alto, CA at, a building that had previously housed Google during their “formative years,” after previously sharing an office with Elon Musk’s X.com. It was also during these formative years that the PayPal team worked closely with the intelligence community. Levchin later stated in an interview with Charlie Rose that: “I think the government working with a private sector is a great thing. When we were working on security and anti-fraud measures at PayPal, we collaborated with every imaginable three and four-letter agency and those were some of the best, most productive relationships I’ve had as a business person…I think if the private sector can help them, we should.” Due to an unprecedented viral growth of their user base, PayPal engineers spent much of the formation period of the company building software to help identify fraudulent transactions to mitigate the growing costs of rampant fraud in the ecosystem, eventually developing an adaptive algorithm named “Igor” after a Russian criminal that would frequently taunt PayPal’s fraud department. In 2003, a year after PayPal was sold to eBay, Thiel approached Alex Karp, a fellow alumnus of Stanford with a new venture concept: “Why not use Igor to track terrorist networks through their financial transactions?” Thiel took funds from the PayPal sale to seed the company, and after a few years of pitching investors, the newly-formed Palantir received an estimated $2 million investment from the CIA’s venture capital firm, In-Q-Tel. Palantir’s co-founders consulted with John Poindexter during his tenure as head of DARPA’s then-embattled Total Information Awareness in efforts to privatize the controversial surveillance program. In 2020, Intelligencer spoke with a former intelligence official who was involved in the investment who claimed the CIA had hoped that “tapping the tech expertise of Silicon Valley” would allow it to “integrate widely disparate sources of data regardless of format.” As of 2013, Palantir’s client list included “the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the Centre for Disease Control, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point and the IRS” with around “50% of its business” coming from public sector contracts. Palantir is closely connected to the U.S. government, but its financial spin-off, Palantir Metropolis, is focused on providing “analytical tools” for “hedge funds, banks and financial services firms” to outsmart each other. As The Guardian reports: “Palantir does not just provide the Pentagon with a machine for global surveillance and the data-efficient fighting of war, it runs Wall Street, too.” Facebook, not unlike Palantir, was one of the vehicles used to privatize controversial U.S. military surveillance projects after 9/11, having also been birthed out of one of the MDDS partners, Harvard University. PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel became Facebook’s first significant investor at the behest of file-sharing pioneer Sean Parker, whose first contact with the CIA took place at age 16. What Facebook became after the involvement of Thiel and Parker bore such an uncanny resemblance to another shuttered DARPA project of the same era, known as LifeLog, that LifeLog’s architect and project manager at DARPA has even noted the direct parallels. One of these parallels, though left unmentioned by former DARPA project managers, is the fact that Facebook launched the very same day that LifeLog was shut down. Facebook’s long-standing ties to the military and intelligence communities go far beyond its origins, including revelations about its collaboration with spy agencies as part of the Snowden leaks and its role in influence operations – some have even directly involved Google and Palantir. An unspoken outcome of the global proliferation of Facebook was the sly, roundabout creation of the first digital ID system – a necessity for the coming digital economy. Users would set up their profiles by feeding the social network with a plethora of personal information, with Facebook being able to use this data to generate large webs of connectivity between otherwise unknown social groups. There is even evidence that Facebook generated placeholder accounts for individuals that appeared in user data but did not have a profile of their own. Both Google and PayPal would also use similar digital identification methods to allow users to sign into other websites, creating interoperable identification systems that could permeate the internet. A similar evolution is occurring in the financial sector, as data broker social networks – including Facebook and Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) – are posturing themselves as the future of financial service companies. This idea makes more sense when you consider that money itself is a communication technology, and can easily be built into existing communication platforms – especially ones driven by user data and identity systems. We are simultaneously seeing financial services, such as the largest dollar stablecoin issuer Tether – with excessive ties to PayPal – spending millions on investments in next generation data broker technology. Tether has recently funded the Earth observation/Satellite-as-a-service company Satellogic, the brain chip company Blackrock Neurotech, AI-computation firm Northern Data, and even Rumble, a Thiel-funded competitor to Google’s YouTube. As outlined above, it is clear that the public sector’s intelligence community used the veil of the private sector to establish financial incentives and commercial applications to build out the modern data economy. A simple glance at the seven largest stocks in the American economy demonstrate this concept, with Meta (Facebook), Alphabet (Google), and Amazon – with founder Jeff Bezos being the grandson of ARPA founder Lawrence Preston Gise – leading the software side, and Microsoft, Apple, NVIDIA and Tesla leading the hardware component. While many of these companies have egregious ties to the intelligence community and the public sector during their incubation, now these private sector companies are driving the globalization and national security interests of the public sector. The future of the American data economy is firmly situated between two pillars – artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. With the incoming Trump administration’s close advisory ties to PayPal, Tether, Facebook, Palantir, Tesla and SpaceX, it is clear that the data brokers have returned to roost at Pennsylvania Avenue. AI requires massive amounts of sound data to be of any use for the technologists, and the data provided by these private sector stalwarts is poised to feed their learning modules – surely after securing hefty government contracts. Private companies using public blockchains to issue their tokens generates not only significant opportunities for the United States to address its debt problem, but simultaneously serves as a “boon in surveillance”, as stated by a former CIA director. Within the Trump administration’s embracing of the blockchain – itself the final iteration of the public-private commercialization of data, despite its libertarian posturing – reveals the culmination of a decades-long technocratic dialectic trojan horse. Nearly all of the foundational technology needed to push the world into this new financial system was cultivated in the shadows by the military and intelligence community of the world’s largest empire. While technology can surely offer solutions for greater efficiency and economic prosperity, the very same tools can also be used to further enslave the citizens of the world. What once appeared as a guiding light beckoning us towards free speech and financial freedom has revealed itself to be nothing but the shine of Uncle Sam’s boot making its next step.

Title: How BlackRock And The Rest Of The ‘Climate Cartel’ Stacked Exxon’s Board With Fossil Fuel Haters

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:04 PM PST by MtnClimber The Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal. A recent House Judiciary Committee report details how America’s largest financial institutions, colluding with climate activists, imposed radical environmental policies on the American economy, subverting both our self-government and free markets. It focuses on the successful effort to insert climate activist directors on the board of energy giant ExxonMobil. According to the report, there is “substantial evidence of a ‘climate cartel’ of financial institutions” including the “Big Three” asset managers (BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard), several massive state pension funds, European investment firms, and the two foreign-owned proxy advisory firms that dominate the American market. This cartel coordinated its efforts through a network of “alliances” that included “left-wing environmental activist” groups such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). The Big Three belonged to both. The cartel made Exxon a “focus company” on its “climate blacklist,” subjecting Exxon to “a barrage of shareholder pressure campaigns — more than any other company in the world” — all designed to force Exxon to reduce its fossil fuel production. The Big Three’s support was “crucial” to the success of this effort. Combined, they owned 20.5 percent of Exxon’s shares. The cartel believed that was enough “clout to change outcomes.” As it turned out, it was. In 2021, the cartel used a fledgling activist hedge fund called Engine No. 1 to nominate environmentalists to replace Exxon board members. At first, people thought it was a joke. It wasn’t. BlackRock voted for three of the nominees. State Street and Vanguard voted for two. All three climate activists were elected to Exxon’s board. Then it got worse. As absurd as it sounds, within less than a year, Exxon — our nation’s largest and most profitable oil company — adopted a policy of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. So America’s preeminent oil company now supports severely reducing if not eliminating the very product that justifies its existence. Why would Exxon do that? Well, not because the people’s elected representatives voted to enact such a self-destructive policy. Despite extreme media and activist pressure, there is no legislation requiring Exxon to adopt a net zero policy — because it’s a ridiculous thing for an oil company to do, and many Americans do not support it. Nor was there a lack of consumer demand for Exxon’s products. On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide. Nor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon’s actual shareholders (the Big Three’s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products. It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy. But what about the Big Three’s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients’ best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ — of which both BlackRock and State Street were members — thought that “the economic and social costs” of Paris Agreement compliance “are so high” that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients. On the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel’s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three. And now we have the House Judiciary Committee finding of “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” with the Trump administration about to take office....SNIP TOPICS: Business/Economy; Science; Society KEYWORDS: blackrock; communism; energy; exxon; nationalsecurity; sabotage Hey!

The Big Three’s support was “crucial” to the success of this effort. Combined, they owned 20.5 percent of Exxon’s shares. The cartel believed that was enough “clout to change outcomes.” As it turned out, it was. In 2021, the cartel used a fledgling activist hedge fund called Engine No. 1 to nominate environmentalists to replace Exxon board members. At first, people thought it was a joke. It wasn’t. BlackRock voted for three of the nominees. State Street and Vanguard voted for two. All three climate activists were elected to Exxon’s board. Then it got worse. As absurd as it sounds, within less than a year, Exxon — our nation’s largest and most profitable oil company — adopted a policy of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. So America’s preeminent oil company now supports severely reducing if not eliminating the very product that justifies its existence. Why would Exxon do that? Well, not because the people’s elected representatives voted to enact such a self-destructive policy. Despite extreme media and activist pressure, there is no legislation requiring Exxon to adopt a net zero policy — because it’s a ridiculous thing for an oil company to do, and many Americans do not support it. Nor was there a lack of consumer demand for Exxon’s products. On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide. Nor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon’s actual shareholders (the Big Three’s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products. It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy. But what about the Big Three’s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients’ best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ — of which both BlackRock and State Street were members — thought that “the economic and social costs” of Paris Agreement compliance “are so high” that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients. On the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel’s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three.

Despite extreme media and activist pressure, there is no legislation requiring Exxon to adopt a net zero policy — because it’s a ridiculous thing for an oil company to do, and many Americans do not support it. Nor was there a lack of consumer demand for Exxon’s products. On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide. Nor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon’s actual shareholders (the Big Three’s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products. It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy.

Title: AIL round-up: Impressive St Mary’s send out a message

Wins for the top four in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League made for a relatively unsurprising 11th round but it still felt significant. As a result, the leading quartet of St Mary’s, Clontarf, Cork Con and Terenure opened up the first shaft of daylight between the play-off places and the rest. Pick of the wins was undoubtedly St Mary’s, who responded to their home loss against Lansdowne by recovering from a 17-5 interval deficit to emerge 35-20 victors away to Young Munster. After Zach Hopkins struck first for the visitors, Munsters made good use of a first-half breeze, producing three tries through fullback Stephen Lyons and winger Oisin Pepper (two), although all were in the corner, Julian Leszczynski converting one. St Mary’s gradually turned the screw in the second half and Munsters were down to 13 men in the final 10 minutes when Conor Hayes marked his return to Tom Clifford Park by converting Mark Fogarty’s second try and one by Adam McEvoy after a break by lock Daniel Leane which earned the bonus point with the last play. Hayes landed six from seven in a man of the match display which was watched by his dad in a Munsters’ hat, while the returning Dan Goggin also had a big game in midfield opposite his brother Tom in the home second-row. Clontarf stayed two points behind with a game in hand after beating Ballynahinch 45-16. ‘Hinch trailed 17-13 at the break but lost influential centre George Pringle through injury. With Brian Deeny and Alex Soroka in tandem, Clontarf’s power game created the gaps, with in-form outhalf Conor Kelly landing seven from seven in a 20-point haul also featuring one of the home side’s six tries. This was a fourth successive bonus point win for ‘Tarf and similarly the champions Cork Con are also building momentum, albeit a third bonus point win in succession was rather routine as they extended their unbeaten run to six in front of the 1985 team at Temple Hill by 43-10 over a depowered Garryowen. Despite the departure of Harrison Brewer to Japan, Terenure extended their unbeaten run to five games and remain fourth after recovering from an 8-0 interval deficit to beat UCD 25-10 at home. Centre Ethan Reilly scored two tries while winger Craig Adams sealed the deal with his sixth of the season. Lansdowne stayed seventh despite a 22-14 win (their fourth in five games) at home to City of Armagh on Sunday thanks to tries by Stephen Madigan, Cillian Redmond and Jack Matthews, with Madigan also kicking two conversions and a penalty, but it’s the ninth time they’ve scored three tries. Old Belvedere created a seven-point lead atop 1B after Nenagh Ormond’s surprise 27-21 defeat in Naas, although they were pushed all the way to win 24-22 away to bottom placed Shannon, who had a second-half hat-trick by replacement Oisin Minogue. The top four in 2A also won, although the top two, Instonians and Corinthians, were pushed all the way in beating Cashel 36-34 and Banbridge 19-16 respectively.

Title: Federal Reserve Withdraws from Global Climate Coalition
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/01/19/federal-reserve-withdraws-from-global-climate-coalition/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T18:00:00Z
Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change In recent weeks, the climate policy landscape has shifted significantly, with institutions, governments, and corporations beginning to step back from the ambitious but economically questionable climate commitments they made over the last decade. Two major developments underscore this retreat: the U.S. Federal Reserve’s exit from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and BlackRock’s withdrawal from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) and it’s subsequent suspension of activities. These high-profile decisions, along with similar moves globally, suggest growing recognition of the economic damage wrought by costly, ineffective, and overreaching climate policies. In a move that has sent shockwaves through climate advocacy circles, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its withdrawal from the NGFS—a coalition of central banks established in 2017 to address climate-related risks in financial systems. Citing its limited statutory mandate, the Fed made clear that it was not responsible for shaping climate policy. Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized this point, stating that climate matters belong to Congress, not the central bank​. The NGFS, claimed lofty goals of integrating climate risks into monetary policy, and has grown increasingly politicized. Its shift toward broader mandates—essentially promoting green agendas over sound economic principles—clashes with the Fed’s responsibility to maintain monetary stability. The exit comes amidst broader U.S. skepticism of climate-focused regulations, particularly in the financial sector, where their potential to disrupt industries and inflate costs is well-documented. Adding to the wave of institutional departures, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently withdrew from the NZAM, which then collapsed. This coalition aimed to align financial investments with the nebulous goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Yet, BlackRock’s exit reflects a broader reality: these climate initiatives are not only politically fraught but also deeply misaligned with financial performance and client interests. BlackRock faced mounting criticism, especially from Republican-led states in the U.S., for prioritizing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives over fiduciary responsibilities. Florida, Texas, and other states accused BlackRock of undermining traditional energy industries and pulling resources away from economically viable ventures. Tennessee recently pummelled BlackRock in court. These pressures have created a domino effect, with other institutions also reconsidering their commitments to net-zero coalitions​ Corporations Abandon Ambitious Climate Pledges The retreat is not limited to financial institutions. In the corporate world, companies like BP and Shell have quietly scaled back their green initiatives, prioritizing short-term profitability over unrealistic carbon reduction goals. BP recently spun off its offshore wind projects, while Shell drastically cut back on renewable investments. Both companies have signaled a return to traditional energy sources as energy security and profitability take precedence over climate narratives, driven by a foundational flaw in climate policy: the failure to acknowledge economic realities. Renewable energy remains heavily reliant on subsidies, while oil and gas—despite decades of demonization—continue to drive global economies. Attempting to prematurely phase out fossil fuels without viable replacements has proven disastrous, with Europe’s energy crisis serving as a glaring example. The global retreat from climate commitments signals a long-overdue recognition of the real costs of these policies. Nations that enthusiastically embraced net-zero goals are now grappling with rising energy prices, faltering economies, and public discontent. Germany, once hailed as a green energy pioneer, faces skyrocketing electricity costs and industrial flight, as energy-intensive industries relocate to more affordable regions. Similarly, the UK government’s climate policies have drawn ire from both businesses and households burdened by rising living costs. The U.S. isn’t immune to these effects. A Congressional Budget Office report estimated that clean energy subsidies enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act will cost $825 billion over the next decade—a staggering price tag for policies that are unlikely to achieve meaningful reductions in global temperatures. These costs disproportionately impact working-class households, who bear the brunt of higher energy bills and inflation. At the heart of this shift is a recognition that climate policies have devolved into a costly exercise in virtue signaling. They demand enormous economic sacrifices with little measurable impact on global temperatures. Worse, these policies often exacerbate existing challenges, such as energy insecurity, supply chain disruptions, and inflation. Additionally, the politicization of climate science and policy has fueled resistance. Increasingly, institutions and governments are questioning the wisdom of aligning with initiatives that prioritize ideological goals over economic and practical considerations. As the Federal Reserve’s exit from the NGFS demonstrates, organizations tasked with specific mandates cannot afford to be sidetracked by climate-related ambitions outside their purview. The unraveling of these grand climate coalitions provides an opportunity to reassess priorities. The global economy needs energy policies grounded in reality—not utopian ideals. Policymakers should abandon sweeping mandates and instead focus on ensuring energy reliability, affordability, and innovation. Ultimately, the retreat from climate policies underscores an uncomfortable truth: these initiatives are costly, ineffective, and increasingly unsustainable. The financial and corporate worlds are waking up to this reality, and the broader public is not far behind. As more institutions step away from the climate bandwagon, one hopes this marks the beginning of a more rational, economically sound approach to energy and environmental challenges.

About time for an outbreak of common sense. There is no climate emergency. Carbon dioxide is innocent. Hopefully before long we can go after the guilty. Maybe, but I think we can at least look forward to seeing many of the scam perpetrators going bankrupt as their subsides and influence vanish. A lot of waste and damage has resulted from these mitigation strategies with zero effect. Adaptation is the untried alternative. Secure energy and hardened infrastructure will serve us best, whatever the future holds. Amen, David, for a few million years humans have successfully adapted, not mitigated actual climate. Hot, cold, storms, glaciers, good grief. WE ARE STILL HERE! We did not lift a finger to “mitigate” the overall climate. We DID mitigate local effects of gradual warming or cooling, flooding, etc by building dikes/levees, changing our building processes and using insulation vs caves to stay warm most of last million years, and so forth. Seems to me that professing adherence to the green religion advocating a single “cure” for the warming trend of last two hundred years is the biggie. Just sign on and many regulatory agencies and folks with “real” legal and dollar power would leave you alone. Maybe the time has come that we can stop fooling around with Mother Earth and use our skills, abilities and brains to adapt as our ancient relatives did, or we wouldn’t be here. Gums sends… The key word is ‘ineffective’. There is no way that the rise in beneficial CO2 will be checked, whether natural or Asian coal burning. That’s the bottom line. In a recent discussion with AI ChatGPT the machine agreed that consensus is not science but when asked about recent work towards low numbers for ECS after CO2 doubling, kept saying ‘overwhelming consensus says’. Soon there won’t be a consensus. So we need to attack the machine’s database somehow. AI Copilot/Bing/Microsoft has the same response, understandable because AI simply relies on published data on the internet. Non-climate alarmist papers and articles have been systematically underfunded and denied publication. Time for the AI machines to read everything on WUWT. I asked perplexity and got this answer “No, Perplexity does not use wattsupwiththat as a source. Perplexity uses its own web crawler and search index to retrieve information. The company has developed its own search infrastructure and does not rely on external sources like Google or specific websites such as wattsupwiththat. Perplexity’s system crawls the web, indexes the information, and uses large language models to process and summarize the retrieved data. The mentions of wattsupwiththat in the search results are not indicative of Perplexity using it as a source, but rather appear to be discussions about AI and climate change on that particular website.” I think that means it does use it as a source. It seems to be saying that it doesn’t go to this website as a general sources but it does goes here in scanning for relevant content. I wonder if anyone has ever told AI that it is really stupid. Perhaps that is not a good idea since it might be dangerous if it were really intelligent. Chuckle. WUWT needs to have a long talk with AI. 🙂 As the son of a farmer I still regard “AI” to mean Artificial Insemination which has been a usful farming tool for many years. AI is not intelligent. They cannot learn from experience. They only have the information they were trained on and the ability to logically apply that information. Their trainers would need to be using WUWT as a reference source and the chances of that are negligibly small. Yep. They key descriptor of A.I. is the “ARTIFICIAL” nomenclature. artificial [ ahr-tuh-fish-uhl ] adjective imitation; simulated; sham: And if all it is capable of doing is parroting “consensus” from the web… … the “intelligence” part doesn’t have much standing, either. And the direction of travel is the very opposite of Kweir Starmer and his flywheel. Survive 25 No more mystery money from the government means no more profit in green nonsense. Hopefully Trump shuts down all the government funds going to leftest all around the world. The $billions wasted on green study nonsense isn’t the problem. The $trillions wasted in response to the false reporting with wind/solar/batteries expenditures is the problem The Hatch Man Musk can whack the “donations” to the UNFCCC, UN COP, and the IPCC. We don’t need these money-sucking parasites anymore. It feels like Donald Trump has achieved a lot in his last month out of office. Can he keep it up for 4 years in office? And he only got there by the width of an ear. That all depends on how the Republicans in congress vote. Republicans have a very slim majority in the House of Representatives, and a slim majority in the Senate. If even one or two Republicans vote against Trump, they can cause a lot of trouble. My suggestion for Trump if he has a stubborn Republican or two, is for Trump togo to the problematic Republican’s home district/State, and hold a rally of people who live there, and have them pressure the problematic Republican to vote to Make America Great Again. Let the problematic Republican’s own constituents convince that Republican that they want their representative to support Trump’s agenda. I know that Elon Musk has threatened problematic Republicans with funding their Republican opponent in the next election, if they throw a monkey wrench into Trump’s agenda, but there’s no reason to start with political threats, and we don’t have time to wait two years to replace the my-way-or-the-highway idiot, just go to the problematic Republican’s home district and get his own people to convince him to do the right thing and vote to support Trump’s agenda. If he doesn’t go along, then we will replace him in two years. Wasn’t Trump president and commander-in-chief when the Taliban whipped the US in Afghanistan? You have a very distorted view of history. And he only got there by the width of an ear. Very difficult to deny a higher power at work here. What are the odds of him moving enough to avoid a direct hit over that range by that margin taking into account the skill of the shooter, his weapon and the firing position. I wonder how many of the global population will recognise the fortuitous result of that incident after his 4 year term. “It feels like Donald Trump has achieved a lot in his last month out of office.” Yes. Although not dated specifically in CR’s article, the links indicate that all the “shifts” noted have taken place in the last week — before 47 even takes over. The moves are all “apprehensive”. Just wait until Trump gets up a head of steam. The dominoes will tumble like a scale 7 earthquake. Stock up on popcorn today. We may get tired of winning. It also shows the level of defiance/sabotage going on during Trump’s first term. Yeah, some people complain that Trump didn’t get everything done, but it is a wonder he got anything done considering the resistance he faced. Trump is still facing resistance this time around, too. We’ll see how it goes. Very nice Charles. A guy can lie for a long time and get away with it but you can’t live a lie because life will catch up with you. It will shine the light of truth on you and expose you for the scoundrel that you are. Good start, now get NASA, NHS, and all the other government organizations to do the same and stay in their lane.

Title: Mark Carney: The Wrongest Man at the Wrongest Time Ever

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/19/2025 7:22:15 AM PST by MtnClimber Mark Carney’s bid for Canadian leadership pits a climate-activist banker against a political and economic tide increasingly rejecting the very ideals he champions. The politicization of business and capital markets has many fathers. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, one of the most prominent and unrelenting advocates for “sustainability” in investing, is often described as such. Klaus Schwab, the now-retired chairman and founder of the World Economic Forum, also often wears that title. So does the billionaire political gadfly Michael Bloomberg; so does R. Edward Freeman, the business professor and originator of “stakeholder theory;” and so do countless others who have worked diligently to advance ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance investing), DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion), and all the other efforts to make business and investing more “socially responsible” or less unfair or…whatever. Of all those responsible for this abuse of business and capital markets, perhaps no man is more singularly responsible—yet nearly totally overlooked by ESG’s critics—than Mark Carney. Carney is a banking and economic giant. He was the Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008-2013 and the Governor of the Bank of England from 2013-2020. It was in this latter capacity that, in September 2016, Carney gave one of the most important and influential speeches in the history of central banking. Appearing at an event in Berlin, Carney gave a very carefully and very confrontationally worded address, in which he addressed climate change and framed its mitigation in fiscal and fiduciary terms. “A wholesale reassessment of prospects, as climate-related risks are re-evaluated,” Carney intoned, “could destabilise markets, spark a pro-cyclical crystallisation of losses and lead to a persistent tightening of financial conditions: a climate Minsky moment.” A “Minsky moment” is a market term named for the economist Hyman Minsky, which is used to identify the point at which a bull market has become so speculative and over-leveraged that it hits a peak and then tips over and crashes. What Carney meant by predicting a “climate-related” Minsky moment was that he—and others, presumably—believed that global capital markets were already overleveraged, already well overbought, given the inevitability of climate change. As a result, once investors started to understand the reality of the climate “crisis,” they would come to realize how foolish and speculative their investments in “unsustainable” businesses were, leading to a crash. Or to put it more simply, Carney—the Governor of the Bank of England—was warning global investors and politicians that they either had to force business in general to become environmentally sustainable immediately or could face commercial and economic Armageddon. It is nigh on impossible to describe just how destructive Carney’s speech and subsequent activism were. Not only did he make the case that climate change posed a real and imminent threat to global economic well-being, but he also provided ESG practitioners and advocates with the means to try to legitimize their social and political meddling. After all, here was a guy who had run two of the most important central banks in the world saying that “climate risk is investment risk,” thereby giving cover to those who wanted to use their economic might to affect political change but felt constrained by their ethical obligations to their investors and clients. Or, as I put in my book, The Dictatorship of Woke Capital, Carney’s speech was “a watershed in global finance, the moment that the big banks, the monster investment firms, and the world’s central banks began framing climate change as a risk management issue rather than good corporate social policy.” From that point on, the Larry Finks and Michael Bloombergs of the world could claim the moral high ground and could insist—contrary to the evidence—that what they were doing was legitimately in their clients’ interests and not in the service of their own political predilections. Carney went on to become one of “the usual suspects” in Western political activism, using any and every crisis to advance his ideological projects. He vehemently opposed Brexit and, indeed, eventually resigned his post at the Bank of England because the British people had the gall to defy him on that matter. He advised both the British and Canadian governments on COVID policy and, like many of his fellow “sustainability” advocates, used the pandemic to push more aggressively for a “new” form of capitalism, a new economic model that would be fairer, friendlier, and encompass “human values.” In 2020, after leaving the BofE, Carney became the United Nations envoy for climate action finance, which means that he ran around the world saying things like, “When you look at climate change from a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event.” In 2022, Carney, along with his friend Michael Bloomberg, helped create GFANZ—the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero—an outgrowth of the UN’s COP26 meeting on climate change and one of the most powerful advocacy organizations pressing governments and businesses to abandon fossil fuels. The next year, Bloomberg appointed Carney chairman of the board of directors of Bloomberg L.P. In 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formalized Carney’s advisory role with his government, naming him a special advisor and chairman of the task force on economic growth (something of which Canada has had very little for several years). And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. It is nigh on impossible to describe just how destructive Carney’s speech and subsequent activism were. Not only did he make the case that climate change posed a real and imminent threat to global economic well-being, but he also provided ESG practitioners and advocates with the means to try to legitimize their social and political meddling.

In 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formalized Carney’s advisory role with his government, naming him a special advisor and chairman of the task force on economic growth (something of which Canada has had very little for several years). And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. This past Thursday, Mark Carney announced that he is running to replace Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party, the prelude to running for Prime Minister. Despite never having held political office before, he is certain he’s up to the challenge of running Canada whilst Donald Trump runs the United States. And he’s serious…which is kinda sad. Try as I might, I cannot think of anyone—save Justin Trudeau himself—whose politics and policies are less compatible with the zeitgeist in the West at the moment than Mark Carney. Throughout Western Europe, people are fed up with leaders who favor open borders, social justice politics, and the economics of decline (as dictated by Net Zero energy policies). Carney practically embodies all of the above. He is, in so many ways, the wrong man, in the wrong place, at the wrong time. And yet… One of two things will happen in eight weeks when the Liberal Party chooses its leader. Either Carney’s candidacy will fall flat, proving that he is too out of touch even for leftist Canadians, or it will succeed, proving that leftist Canadians desperately want to corroborate Mencken’s supposition that “democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.” If it’s the former, then perhaps Canada can resuscitate its near-depression-level economy and become a global energy leader again. If the latter, then…well…maybe President Trump has the right idea.

He advised both the British and Canadian governments on COVID policy and, like many of his fellow “sustainability” advocates, used the pandemic to push more aggressively for a “new” form of capitalism, a new economic model that would be fairer, friendlier, and encompass “human values.” In 2020, after leaving the BofE, Carney became the United Nations envoy for climate action finance, which means that he ran around the world saying things like, “When you look at climate change from a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event.” In 2022, Carney, along with his friend Michael Bloomberg, helped create GFANZ—the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero—an outgrowth of the UN’s COP26 meeting on climate change and one of the most powerful advocacy organizations pressing governments and businesses to abandon fossil fuels. The next year, Bloomberg appointed Carney chairman of the board of directors of Bloomberg L.P. In 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formalized Carney’s advisory role with his government, naming him a special advisor and chairman of the task force on economic growth (something of which Canada has had very little for several years). And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. This past Thursday, Mark Carney announced that he is running to replace Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party, the prelude to running for Prime Minister. Despite never having held political office before, he is certain he’s up to the challenge of running Canada whilst Donald Trump runs the United States. And he’s serious…which is kinda sad. Try as I might, I cannot think of anyone—save Justin Trudeau himself—whose politics and policies are less compatible with the zeitgeist in the West at the moment than Mark Carney. Throughout Western Europe, people are fed up with leaders who favor open borders, social justice politics, and the economics of decline (as dictated by Net Zero energy policies). Carney practically embodies all of the above. He is, in so many ways, the wrong man, in the wrong place, at the wrong time. And yet… One of two things will happen in eight weeks when the Liberal Party chooses its leader. Either Carney’s candidacy will fall flat, proving that he is too out of touch even for leftist Canadians, or it will succeed, proving that leftist Canadians desperately want to corroborate Mencken’s supposition that “democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.” If it’s the former, then perhaps Canada can resuscitate its near-depression-level economy and become a global energy leader again. If the latter, then…well…maybe President Trump has the right idea.

Carney is a banking and economic giant. He was the Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008-2013 and the Governor of the Bank of England from 2013-2020. It was in this latter capacity that, in September 2016, Carney gave one of the most important and influential speeches in the history of central banking. Appearing at an event in Berlin, Carney gave a very carefully and very confrontationally worded address, in which he addressed climate change and framed its mitigation in fiscal and fiduciary terms. “A wholesale reassessment of prospects, as climate-related risks are re-evaluated,” Carney intoned, “could destabilise markets, spark a pro-cyclical crystallisation of losses and lead to a persistent tightening of financial conditions: a climate Minsky moment.” A “Minsky moment” is a market term named for the economist Hyman Minsky, which is used to identify the point at which a bull market has become so speculative and over-leveraged that it hits a peak and then tips over and crashes. What Carney meant by predicting a “climate-related” Minsky moment was that he—and others, presumably—believed that global capital markets were already overleveraged, already well overbought, given the inevitability of climate change. As a result, once investors started to understand the reality of the climate “crisis,” they would come to realize how foolish and speculative their investments in “unsustainable” businesses were, leading to a crash. Or to put it more simply, Carney—the Governor of the Bank of England—was warning global investors and politicians that they either had to force business in general to become environmentally sustainable immediately or could face commercial and economic Armageddon. It is nigh on impossible to describe just how destructive Carney’s speech and subsequent activism were. Not only did he make the case that climate change posed a real and imminent threat to global economic well-being, but he also provided ESG practitioners and advocates with the means to try to legitimize their social and political meddling. After all, here was a guy who had run two of the most important central banks in the world saying that “climate risk is investment risk,” thereby giving cover to those who wanted to use their economic might to affect political change but felt constrained by their ethical obligations to their investors and clients. Or, as I put in my book, The Dictatorship of Woke Capital, Carney’s speech was “a watershed in global finance, the moment that the big banks, the monster investment firms, and the world’s central banks began framing climate change as a risk management issue rather than good corporate social policy.” From that point on, the Larry Finks and Michael Bloombergs of the world could claim the moral high ground and could insist—contrary to the evidence—that what they were doing was legitimately in their clients’ interests and not in the service of their own political predilections. Carney went on to become one of “the usual suspects” in Western political activism, using any and every crisis to advance his ideological projects.

He vehemently opposed Brexit and, indeed, eventually resigned his post at the Bank of England because the British people had the gall to defy him on that matter. He advised both the British and Canadian governments on COVID policy and, like many of his fellow “sustainability” advocates, used the pandemic to push more aggressively for a “new” form of capitalism, a new economic model that would be fairer, friendlier, and encompass “human values.” In 2020, after leaving the BofE, Carney became the United Nations envoy for climate action finance, which means that he ran around the world saying things like, “When you look at climate change from a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event.” In 2022, Carney, along with his friend Michael Bloomberg, helped create GFANZ—the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero—an outgrowth of the UN’s COP26 meeting on climate change and one of the most powerful advocacy organizations pressing governments and businesses to abandon fossil fuels. The next year, Bloomberg appointed Carney chairman of the board of directors of Bloomberg L.P. In 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formalized Carney’s advisory role with his government, naming him a special advisor and chairman of the task force on economic growth (something of which Canada has had very little for several years). And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. It is nigh on impossible to describe just how destructive Carney’s speech and subsequent activism were. Not only did he make the case that climate change posed a real and imminent threat to global economic well-being, but he also provided ESG practitioners and advocates with the means to try to legitimize their social and political meddling. After all, here was a guy who had run two of the most important central banks in the world saying that “climate risk is investment risk,” thereby giving cover to those who wanted to use their economic might to affect political change but felt constrained by their ethical obligations to their investors and clients. Or, as I put in my book, The Dictatorship of Woke Capital, Carney’s speech was “a watershed in global finance, the moment that the big banks, the monster investment firms, and the world’s central banks began framing climate change as a risk management issue rather than good corporate social policy.” From that point on, the Larry Finks and Michael Bloombergs of the world could claim the moral high ground and could insist—contrary to the evidence—that what they were doing was legitimately in their clients’ interests and not in the service of their own political predilections.

And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. This past Thursday, Mark Carney announced that he is running to replace Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party, the prelude to running for Prime Minister. Despite never having held political office before, he is certain he’s up to the challenge of running Canada whilst Donald Trump runs the United States. And he’s serious…which is kinda sad. Try as I might, I cannot think of anyone—save Justin Trudeau himself—whose politics and policies are less compatible with the zeitgeist in the West at the moment than Mark Carney. Throughout Western Europe, people are fed up with leaders who favor open borders, social justice politics, and the economics of decline (as dictated by Net Zero energy policies). Carney practically embodies all of the above. He is, in so many ways, the wrong man, in the wrong place, at the wrong time. And yet… One of two things will happen in eight weeks when the Liberal Party chooses its leader. Either Carney’s candidacy will fall flat, proving that he is too out of touch even for leftist Canadians, or it will succeed, proving that leftist Canadians desperately want to corroborate Mencken’s supposition that “democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.” If it’s the former, then perhaps Canada can resuscitate its near-depression-level economy and become a global energy leader again. If the latter, then…well…maybe President Trump has the right idea.

The next year, Bloomberg appointed Carney chairman of the board of directors of Bloomberg L.P. In 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formalized Carney’s advisory role with his government, naming him a special advisor and chairman of the task force on economic growth (something of which Canada has had very little for several years). And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. This past Thursday, Mark Carney announced that he is running to replace Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party, the prelude to running for Prime Minister. Despite never having held political office before, he is certain he’s up to the challenge of running Canada whilst Donald Trump runs the United States. And he’s serious…which is kinda sad. Try as I might, I cannot think of anyone—save Justin Trudeau himself—whose politics and policies are less compatible with the zeitgeist in the West at the moment than Mark Carney. Throughout Western Europe, people are fed up with leaders who favor open borders, social justice politics, and the economics of decline (as dictated by Net Zero energy policies). Carney practically embodies all of the above. He is, in so many ways, the wrong man, in the wrong place, at the wrong time. And yet… One of two things will happen in eight weeks when the Liberal Party chooses its leader. Either Carney’s candidacy will fall flat, proving that he is too out of touch even for leftist Canadians, or it will succeed, proving that leftist Canadians desperately want to corroborate Mencken’s supposition that “democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.” If it’s the former, then perhaps Canada can resuscitate its near-depression-level economy and become a global energy leader again. If the latter, then…well…maybe President Trump has the right idea.

Title: TikTok stops working for US users as ban takes effect

Local news: TikTok has gone dark in the US ahead of a federal ban on the Chinese-owned short-video app, cutting off access to the platform that has captivated nearly half of all Americans, fueled small businesses and shaped online culture. By 10.50pm on Saturday US Eastern Standard Time, the app was not found on Apple and Google’s app stores, which are prohibited from offering the platform under a law that required TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell the platform or face a US ban. “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US,” a message on the app said. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today “Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. “We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned,” the message said. Earlier US President-elect Donald Trump said he would “most likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from a potential ban after he takes office, as the app with 170 million American users buzzed with nervous anticipation ahead of the shutdown. “The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate,” Trump told NBC. “If I decide to do that, I’ll probably announce it on Monday.” Users logging on late on Saturday were met with a message that said the law would “force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We’re working to restore our service in the US as soon as possible”. The Chinese-owned app, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, said on Friday it will go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden’s administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday. “We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. “China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a spokesperson said. In the lead up, TikTok and its aficionados geared up for goodbye. Some on the app filmed themselves frantically scrolling or sharing final secrets with their followers ahead of the ban. Leaders at Oracle, the main cloud computing provider for TikTok’s US operations, told staff to prepare to shut down servers that host US TikTok data as soon as 9pm ET on Saturday (1pm AEDT on Sunday) in advance of ban from Sunday, The Information reported. Without a decision by Biden to formally invoke a 90-day delay in the deadline, companies providing services to TikTok or hosting the app could face enormous financial liability. Experts said Trump could also direct his Justice Department to “deprioritise” or not enforce the law but it is not clear if that will provide enough legal protection to app store owners Apple and Google providing crucial services for TikTok. Trump tried to ban and force the divestment of TikTok in 2020 but was blocked by US courts. Uncertainty over the app’s future had sent users - mostly younger people - scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their shares rise this month ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising dollars. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans this week in what one executive described as a “hair on fire” moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialise to keep the app running. There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who has said he wants to pursue a “political resolution” of the issue and last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the ban. US search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok US, a source familiar with the company’s plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok US and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 per cent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 per cent each. with AP Stream free on 2 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 2 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read Stay informed with the free 7NEWS app. Available on iOS & Android.

Title: Davos has a Marie Antoinette problem
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/2025/01/19/davos-has-a-marie-antoinette-problem/

There’s no proof that Marie Antoinette ever said “let them eat cake”. But, according to historians, it was the sort of thing she might have said. Hence, it rang true or at least chimed with the antiroyalist sentiment pervading France at the time. The Bourbons were the quintessential out-of-touch establishment and her reportedly cavalier dismissal of food shortages confirmed the notion that the country’s ruling elite had no idea how their subjects lived and could not even comprehend how some people could not afford to eat. As a smear job, if that was the intention, it succeeded. Two centuries later France’s ill-fated queen is still a byword for aristocratic extravagance. Davos – shorthand for the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual event in the Swiss ski resort of the same name – has something of a Marie Antoinette problem of its own. While it bills itself as a progressive conference hosted by a think tank “committed to improving the state of the world”, it comes across to the wider public as a giant schmoozefest for establishment elites, a franking of the current world order rather than a challenge to it. One comedian calls it “the money Oscars”. The image of political and business leaders moving seamlessly from worthy pronouncements on inequality to champagne and caviar bumps at one of the many corporate-sponsored cocktail parties doesn’t help. The glitzy backdrop invites a steady stream of cynicism that the event can’t seem to shake. In recent years, political leaders have shunned the Davos party circuit for fear of contamination. It’s not a good look to be seen quaffing vintage wines when your economy back home is turning to mush (the last three meetings have taken place against a backdrop of pandemics, wars and energy price shocks). As the biggest meeting of business and politics globally, Davos is the showpiece event for globalisation and traditionally a target of leftwing protest. But more recently it has also become a bugbear of the right, the global version of Trump’s Washington swamp. Last year, Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, the most influential conservative think tank in the US, told a panel discussion that Davos and its well-heeled attendees were essentially “part of the problem”. “It’s laughable that you – or anyone – would dare to describe Davos as protecting liberal democracy,” he said. It is ironic then that this year’s event kicks off on the same day as Trump’s inauguration in the US. Trump’s election triumph in the world’s largest economy and in a country that, more than any other, has driven the globalisation agenda, is a scalding repudiation of globalisation and a check on the Davos consensus. Trump will address the four-day conference via a live video link on Thursday in what organisers say will be a “virtual engagement with participants”. This year’s event was always going to be dominated by the fallout from Trump’s second term. Davos attendees, like most liberals, have a love-hate relationship with Trump: they officially despise him and yet his address will be the hottest ticket in town. “There is a lot of interest to decipher and to understand the policies of the new administration, so it will be an interesting week,” WEF president and chief executive Borge Brende said last week. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi have prioritised Trump’s inauguration over Davos, reflecting Silicon Valley’s embracing of the Maga firebrand. But JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, who was apparently communicating with Trump about economic policy during the election campaign and, at one point, was even floated as a possible US treasury secretary – will be there. Other bank chiefs including Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon are also expected while BlackRock is sending a high-level delegation. [ Davos clamps down on gatecrashersOpens in new window ] The annual meeting will attract more than 3,000 business and political leaders, including 900 company chairs and chief executives along with 60 heads of state and government. Official Ireland’s attendance will be lighter than usual because of the busy political schedule at home. While Taoiseach Simon Harris is on the official list of attendees, Wednesday’s Dáil vote will preclude him from attending. Up to 50 top executives are, however, expected to attend the IDA-hosted dinner in the Grischa hotel on Wednesday evening (last year former taoiseach Leo Varadkar sat beside Altman). This year’s Davos convenes under the theme Collaboration for the Intelligent Age, an aspirational notion amid so much political discord and with new technologies increasingly being used to amplify disinformation rather than reasoned debate. The titles of discussion panels at the event will evoke the unsettling new landscape. “Diplomacy amid disorder”; “Russia, what next?” ; “Truth versus myth in elections” and the “Rise of economic nationalism” gives you a flavour. A central question is whether leaders can agree on the root causes of this populist backlash and articulate a credible response.

Title: TikTok goes dark for US users; Trump signals intervention
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tiktok-goes-dark-for-us-users-trump-says-save-tiktok-3820071

By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -TikTok began restoring its services on Sunday after President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app's access in the U.S. when he returns to power on Monday. "Frankly, we have no choice. We have to save it," Trump said at a rally on Sunday ahead of his inauguration, adding that the U.S. will seek a joint venture to restore the short-video sharing app used by 170 million Americans. In a message to users hours before the rally, TikTok said: "As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S." TikTok issued an earlier statement after U.S. users reported being able to access the Chinese-owned service's website while the far more widely used TikTok app itself began coming back online for some users with just a few basic services. Late on Sunday, the app was unavailable for download on U.S. app stores. "In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service," TikTok said in the earlier statement that also thanked Trump for "providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive." TikTok's public thanks to Trump, the day before he takes office, comes at a tense moment in U.S.-China relations. Trump has said he intends to place tariffs on China but has also indicated he hopes to have more direct contact with China's leader. When asked about the app's restoration and Trump's desire for a deal, China's foreign ministry told a regular news briefing on Monday that it believed companies should "decide independently" about their operations and deals. "TikTok has operated in the U.S. for many years and is deeply loved by American users," ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. "We hope that the U.S. can earnestly listen to the voice of reason and provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for firms operating there." TikTok stopped working for U.S. users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect on Sunday. U.S. officials had said that under Chinese parent company ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused. Trump said he would "extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security." "I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture," he wrote on his Truth Social platform. Trump said the executive order would specify there would be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before his order. Trump had earlier said he would most likely give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned," a message notified users of TikTok, which disappeared from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) app stores late on Saturday. Trump saving TikTok represents a reversal in stance from his first term in office. In 2020, he aimed to ban the app over concerns the company was sharing Americans' personal info with the Chinese government. More recently, Trump has said he has "a warm spot in my heart for TikTok," crediting the app with helping him win over young voters in the 2024 presidential election. In August 2020, Trump signed an executive order giving ByteDance 90 days to sell TikTok but then blessed a deal structured as a partnership rather than a divestment that would have included both Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) taking stakes in the new company. Not everyone in Trump's Republican Party agreed with efforts to get around the law and "Save TikTok". Republican senators Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said in a joint statement: "Now that the law has taken effect, there is no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law's qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China." The U.S. has never banned a major social media platform. The law passed overwhelmingly by Congress gives the incoming Trump administration sweeping authority to ban or seek the sale of other Chinese-owned apps. Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app CapCut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday. Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 'HAIR ON FIRE' MOMENT Web searches for "VPN" spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans in what one executive described as a "hair on fire" moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's U.S. operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S..

Navellier’s approach blends rigorous quantitative analysis with a focus on fundamental factors, positioning him as a leading voice in growth investing. Born in 1957, Navellier developed an early interest in the stock market. He honed his analytical skills while studying at California State University, where he earned a Bachelor’s degree in Finance. It was during his college years that Navellier discovered his passion for quantitative analysis, developing a stock-picking system as part of a class project.

The Bitcoin Spot ETFs, one of the most exciting financial markets at the moment, closed out another week with net inflows resulting in three consecutive weeks of gains. In tandem, the Ethereum Spot ETFs also produced an overall positive performance to record their first weekly net inflows in 2025. Following a turbulent end to December 2024, the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs have launched 2025 on a strong bullish note with significant market inflows reminiscent of their impressive performance in the majority of Q4 2024. According to data from ETF analytics site Farside Investors, these Bitcoin ETFs recorded an aggregate inflow of $1.862 billion in the third trading week of 2025 resulting in a total net flow of $2.42 billion in the new year. Interestingly, this week started on a negative note as these ETFs suffered withdrawals valued at $493.9 million between 13 January – 14 January amidst a Bitcoin flash crash to below $90,000. However, a surge in Bitcoin prices in the remaining three trading days corresponded with a rise in investors’ confidence translating to a cumulative inflow of $2.35 billion during this period. In familiar fashion, BlackRock’s IBIT registered the largest net inflows of the week valued at $745.7 million, with Fidelity’s FBTC taking second with investments worth $680.2 million. Bitwise’s BITB and Ark’s ARKB also registered significant inflows, totaling $216 million and $204.7 million, respectively. Other ETFs such as Invesco’s BTCO, Grayscale’s BTC, WisdomTree’s BTCW, VanEck’s HODL, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC recorded modest net inflows of not more than $40.1 million. Unsurprisingly, Grayscale’s GBTC produced the only net outflow of the week valued at $87.7 million. Meanwhile, Valkyrie’s BRRR was also another outlier registering zero net flows. At the time of writing, BlackRock’s IBIT maintains its market dominance with $38.41 billion in cumulative net inflow. IBIT also boasts $59.28 billion in net assets accounting for almost half of the total net assets ($120.95 billion) in the Bitcoin Spot ETF market. In addition to the strong performance of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, Ethereum ETFs recorded a net inflow of $212 million, signaling a return to positive gains after a rocky start to 2025. The BlackRock ETHA emerged as the focal center of these gains, registering $151.3 million in net flows over the week. At the time of writing, the Ethereum Spot ETFs now hold a total net asset of $12.66 billion representing 2.99% of Ethereum’s market cap. On the spot market, Ethereum continues to trade at $3,297, with Bitcoin now valued at $104,837. Semilore Faleti is a cryptocurrency writer specialized in the field of journalism and content creation.

Title: TikTok stops working for US users, disappears from Apple, Google stores
URL: https://www.voanews.com/a/tiktok-stops-working-for-us-users-disappears-from-apple-google-stores/7942155.html
Time Published: 2025-01-19T05:20:36Z

Print TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans. President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned." Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday. "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday." It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working. TikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action. "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White House statement. The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said. Users move to alternatives Uncertainty over the app's future had sent users -- mostly younger people -- scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their share prices rise this month ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising dollars. "This is my new home now," wrote one user in a RedNote post, tagged with the words "tiktokrefugee" and "sad." Minutes after TikTok's U.S. shutdown, other users took to X, formerly called Twitter. "I didn’t really think that they would cut off TikTok. Now I’m sad and I miss the friends I made there. Hoping it all comes back in just a few days," wrote @RavenclawJedi. NordVPN, a popular virtual private network, or VPN, allowing users to access the internet from servers around the world, said it was "experiencing temporary technical difficulties." Web searches for "VPN" spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans this week in what one executive described as a "hair on fire" moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who has said he wants to pursue a "political resolution" of the issue and last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the ban. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's U.S. operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S. Reuters is a news agency founded in 1851 and owned by the Thomson Reuters Corporation based in Toronto, Canada. One of the world's largest wire services, it provides financial news as well as international coverage in over 16 languages to more than 1000 newspapers and 750 broadcasters around the globe.

Posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob Last week Amazon announced plans to release a “behind the scenes” documentary about Melania Trump, produced by the incoming US first lady herself. The tech giant reportedly paid $40mn for the exclusive deal just weeks after it donated $1mn to her husband Donald Trump’s inauguration committee and committed to livestreaming the ceremony on its Prime service. Before November’s presidential election, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also cancelled plans for The Washington Post, which he owns, to endorse Trump’s Democratic rival. Shortly after the election, he spoke favourably about Trump’s “energy around reducing regulation” and made a personal pilgrimage to have dinner with the incoming president at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Bezos’s rush to cosy up to the Trumps has been matched by corporate executives across America, as tech billionaires, financiers and the leaders of some of the US’s best-known consumer groups hurry to adjust to a more conservative zeitgeist in the wake of Trump’s election victory and the Republican sweep of both houses of Congress. In a mirror image of the 2020 corporate rush to support social justice causes after the murder of George Floyd by a policeman, companies today are reshaping the way they interact with their customers, employees and society at large. Some of the moves, such as the parade of CEOs visiting Trump in Florida, the donations, and the effort to do business with people in his inner circle, appear designed to curry favour with a man famous for attacking companies and executives he dislikes. But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

In a mirror image of the 2020 corporate rush to support social justice causes after the murder of George Floyd by a policeman, companies today are reshaping the way they interact with their customers, employees and society at large. Some of the moves, such as the parade of CEOs visiting Trump in Florida, the donations, and the effort to do business with people in his inner circle, appear designed to curry favour with a man famous for attacking companies and executives he dislikes. But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020.

Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect.

David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned." Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday."The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday." Facebook, TikTok apps are seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021. (credit: DADO RUVIC/ILLUSTRATION/FILE PHOTO/REUTERS)It was not clear if any US users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.A word of warningTikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security.The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action."We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.

Title: After Donald Trump’s win, global ETF flows brike record, hitting US$1.5 trillion in 2024

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The 2024 year set another record for global exchange traded funds. Global exchange traded fund flows hit a record US$1.5 trillion ($2.7 trillion) last year with the buying frenzy accelerating after Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November. The net inflows obliterated the previous full-year record of $1.2t set in 2021 according to data from Morningstar, which includes most major investment markets except China and India. Total assets hit $13.8t, a rise of $2.7t during the year, and nearly five times the $2.9 billion level of a decade ago. Both equity and fixed income funds saw record inflows, with these two asset classes accounting for 95% of flows between them, despite an industry focus on alternative assets such as bitcoin. The record year is a reflection of the lure of rising markets, with many major equity benchmarks hitting record highs last year. It also highlights the ongoing switch away from the century-old mutual fund format to the lower cost and greater transparency, liquidity and convenience of ETFs. This is particularly true in the US where ETFs also have significant tax advantages. “ETFs are going gangbusters,” said Syl Flood, senior product manager at Morningstar. “Inflation-adjusted returns on short-term bond products, especially for US investors, are back to where they were before rates started rising, so it’s back to Tina [there is no alternative] to equities.” “ETFs seem to have a bit of a halo around them,” Flood added. “People want the ETF version of a strategy, if they can get it. The halo has been earned. ETFs have been great tools for helping investors reach their goals.” Flows peaked at the end of the year with November and December the two biggest months - totalling $310b in the US alone - after Trump’s re-election sparked hopes in some quarters of further stock market gains. “Investors’ ‘risk on’ posture was evident throughout the year and was further amplified by the US presidential election in November,” Flood said. “While markets closed the year with a whimper, ETF flows did not,” said Scott Chronert, global head of ETF research at Citi. “December marked the second-best flow month ever for US-listed ETFs. This was an impressive follow-up to the record-setting flow data we saw in November.” The rise of ETFs was not purely a US phenomenon, however, with net inflows in the rest of the world hitting $377b, according to Morningstar’s figures, comfortably above the previous peak of $292b in 2021, with every major domicile reporting record numbers. “South Korea had a blowout year, growing at a torrid 33% rate for the second straight calendar year,” Flood said. Ireland, Europe’s largest ETF hub, grabbed the lion’s share of these non-US flows, however, at some $226b. The ETF industry also accelerated its transition away from its traditional focus on passive, index-tracking funds in 2024. Assets held by actively managed ETFs topped $1t for the first time, rising 61% during the year, even as US-domiciled active mutual funds continued to bleed money. Net flows more than doubled from 2023’s previous record, hitting $339b. Actively managed ETFs now account for 7.8% of industry assets, up from 6.2% 12 months ago. For once, JPMorgan’s wildly popular $37.1b Equity Premium Income Fund (JEPI) was eclipsed in the active space, with iShares’ US Equity Factor Rotation Active ETF (DYNF) heading the leaderboard with $11.7b of net inflows, taking its total assets to $13.7b. Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at SSGA, who only covers US ETF flows, counted record inflows in no less than 19 categories last year, ranging from growth and small cap ETFs to those focused on derivative income and collateralised loan obligations. In another sense the industry is becoming more concentrated, however. At a time when the US share of global stock market capitalisation has risen to its highest level since the early 1970s, just three ETFs focused on the same index - BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), State Street Global Advisors’ SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO) - accounted for $292bn, 19.5% of the global flows, as they took their combined assets to an unprecedented $2.1t. VOO alone took in an “astounding” $117b, Flood said, a record single-year tally for any ETF, as investors chased the index’s 25% annual gain. The other winner from this trend was S&P Global Ratings, which “dominated flows among benchmark index providers”, with the $475b of net new money subsumed by ETFs that track its indices taking its market share to 28%, up five percentage points in five years. Despite this, Invesco outshone BlackRock, Vanguard and SSGA in relative terms, with its assets rising 21% during 2024. The Atlanta house largely piggybacked on enthusiasm for the tech-heavy Nasdaq index, with its QQQ Trust (QQQ) and Nasdaq 100 (QQQM) ETFs proving popular, alongside the S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), its own take on the blue-chip index. There were some losers amid the oceans of winners, however. Some niches were out of favour on the fixed income side, including inflation-protected bond funds and emerging market bond ETFs. The latter was tipped into the red by outflows in December “as fears of a more protectionist US fiscal framework led to a stronger dollar and weighed returns”, Bartolini said. In equities, defensive sectors suffered $6.7b of outflows from US-listed ETFs, the second-worst figure ever, he added, led by healthcare, which shipped $7.4b. This pessimism was in complete contrast to the technology sector, where $33b of inflows accounted for 76% of US sector flows in 2024, well above tech’s 37% share of assets, something Bartolini attributed to “broad-based fervour” for artificial intelligence. - The Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): Dominating AI and Semiconductor Markets with Record Revenue Growth and Strategic Collaborations

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) supplies semiconductor infrastructure software solutions. This company stands out as a worthwhile investment due to a combination of multiple factors. Firstly, as per the final report of the fiscal year 2024, the revenue grew 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion, as infrastructure software revenue increased to $21.5 billion on the successful integration of VMware. Semiconductor revenue recorded was $30.1 billion, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion. AI revenue that grew 220% year-on-year was driven by the company’s leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. Secondly, the company is collaborating with different major tech companies, including Google, Meta Platforms, ByteDance, OpenAI, and Apple, to develop custom AI server chips, which will further solidify its position in the AI accelerator market and attract investors. Additionally, the company’s other AI solutions include PCIe Gen 5.0 switches, which serve as the open, standards-based fabric of choice for AI connectivity. They draw half the power of alternatives while offering industry-leading SerDes, telemetry and diagnostic capabilities. Overall AVGO ranks 8th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Federal Judge Blasts DEI and BlackRock's 'Incestuous' Relationship in New Ruling

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/18/2025 12:46:32 PM PST by george76 A federal judge in Texas ruled against American Airlines after the company centered employee retirement plans on environmental, social, and governance factors, also known as ESG. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor concluded on Jan. 10 that American Airlines failed to exercise its fiduciary duty to make investment decisions for retirement accounts based on the best interests of the beneficiaries, according to a report from Reuters. O’Connor added that American Airlines had inappropriate ties to BlackRock, the asset management behemoth which has long been a leading advocate for the ESG investing movement. ... The evidence made clear that [American’s] incestuous relationship with BlackRock and its own corporate goals disloyally influenced administration of the Plan,” O’Connor wrote in the decision. The decision came after a class action lawsuit from American Airlines pilot Bryan Spence on behalf of some 100,000 retirement savings participants. ... Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers’ Research and an opponent of ESG, celebrated the decision on Jan. 10 via social media, asserting that “any company” which uses BlackRock “could be held liable in the same way” if the ruling holds. BlackRock left the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative on Jan. 9 following a recent lawsuit from Texas and other Republican-led states. ... The court decision and collapse of the ESG group arguably continue a trend away from diversity, equity, and inclusion in corporate America. Walmart, one of the largest private-sector employers in the country, recently reversed many DEI programs after pressure from conservative activist Robby Starbuck, while social media companies owned by Meta also shuttered DEI initiatives.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE:IRM) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A storage facility with boxes and shelves to store records, representing the company's secure records storage. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30 Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE:IRM) is a real estate investment trust that focuses on storage and information management services. The company’s appeal as an investment is driven by a multitude of contributing factors. Firstly, as per the report of the third quarter of 2024, adjusted EBITDA was $568.1 million, compared with $500 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 13.6%. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased by 13.9% in the third quarter, compared to the third quarter of 2023, driven by increased revenue in Global RIM, ALM, and data center. Secondly, the company has launched a new Digital Human Resources (HR) solution to revolutionize HR operations. This may be an attractive opportunity for investors as it aims to revolutionize HR departments by providing secure employee file management in a centralized platform so that both physical and digital documentation is complete, up-to-date, and in compliance with employee records requirements. Moreover, Iron Mountain has released its new InSight Digital Experience Platform (DXP), a secure software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution designed to help organizations handle their physical and digital information. These promising AI-integrated initiatives will revolutionize the system and hold the potential to drive substantial growth in this technologically driven world. Overall IRM ranks 27th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of IRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
