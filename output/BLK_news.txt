Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © NATO alliance flag on Europe map. North Atlantic Treaty Organization. High quality photo (Shutterstock.com) by Rokas Tenys Going into the final weeks of 2025, the S&P 500 has had another strong year. ETFs that track the S&P 500 have posted double-digit returns yet again for the year, with Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO) coming in year-to-date at 18.43% and SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) right behind at 18.34% at the time of this writing. Much of these gains can be credited to the multi-trillion net capital valuations that have swelled with Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and other Magnificent 7 AI stocks that festoon the S&P 500’s top 10. However, there are many household name companies that are not a part of the S&P 500 top 10, mostly due to their lack of AI development. A good number of them aren’t even American. For example – Nestle (chocolate), AstroZeneca (pharma), and LVMH (luxury goods) are all European companies whose products have garnered widespread use, and their respective stock prices have risen accordingly. A notable point is that none of these companies’ gains are contingent upon any in-house AI development, but rather on intrinsic value of their respective products and sales. Nevertheless, they are essential in the market, and all three can be found in the top 10 list of another ETF: the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (NYSE: VGK). More intriguing is the fact that VGK currently sports a year-to-date return of 32.97%, which is 79% higher than VOO and only a few points shy of doubling its returns. The Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF contains over 1,200 stocks hailing from the Eurozone and Scandinavia. Issued by Vanguard, the second largest asset manager in the world after BlackRock, the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF tracks the FTSE Developed Europe All Cap Index, which covers stocks from the Eurozone and Scandinavia. Passively managed, its inception dates back to 3-4-2005. An overview of VGK appears below: The top 10 holdings of VGK are: As one can see, unlike with VOO or SPY, in which 7 out of the top 10 are AI tech companies, the top 10 holdings of VGK contain a wider range of industrial sectors: pharma, technology, financial, and luxury goods. In fact, VGK’s sector concentration puts technology at #6, or 8.27%, behind: Michael “The Big Short” Burry is one of the higher profile critics of the perceived AI bubble, which has prompted the shift of many funds into VGK and other ETFs with solid growth upside without AI dependency. There are a number of reasons why VGK has been able to outperform VOO and SPY this year. It is admittedly an anomaly. Historically, it has usually lagged behind, sometimes by a substantial amount. However, 2025 contained certain events that helped to give VGK a big boost. A few of these include: Geopolitical Tariff Fears: In March, President Trump’s reciprocal tariff policy announcement caused a big drop in the S&P 500, since many believed the analysts and pundits that it would trigger massive inflation and supply chain issues. With WalMart and other US retailers relying on Chinese manufacturing for millions of their best-selling retail items, the concerns over a renewed trade war with China were understandably disconcerting. Europe, on the other hand, felt the impact much less severely. The initial trade conflicts largely were focused on China and India, so the comparative stability of European markets drew investors from all over the world who were seeking less volatility and unknown economic outcomes. Sector Preferences From Global Investors: The huge bull run on the AI focused Magnificent 7 stocks has created the first multi-trillion valuations of Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, et. al. This has also led to fears that the AI industry has become a bubble, not unlike that of the dotcoms. Michael “The Big Short” Burry is a vocal critic of the AI bubble and of Nvidia in particular, and his track record for shorting economic bubbles in the market warranted a movie about his successful prediction of the 2008 subprime mortgage banking meltdown, starring Christian Bale as Burry. VGK’s 44% weighting towards financials and industrials became appealing to many institutional investors this year who shared Burry’s fears. Strength In Numbers: While the S&P 500 represents 500 of the strongest market-weighted companies representing a cross-section of US economic and financial health, the Magnificent 7 stocks are responsible for over half of the 18% gain YTD, making it a “live by the sword, die by the sword scenario”. By contrast, VGK’s index, the FTSE Developed Europe All Cap Index, encompasses over 1,200 different stocks across multiple countries. Given the lower level of sector competition in each European and Scandinavian nation, each has its own territorial near-monopolies in various sectors, cumulatively making for multiple big winners all contributing to the overall index strength. As 2025 comes to a close, the S&P 500 is still not showing any signs of faltering, but Europe should be able to maintain at least some of its lead, provided it does not succumb to foolish policies or geopolitical in-fighting among EU members, such as Brussels’ attempts to compel Italy to accede to its migrant policy, which Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is staunchly resisting.

Title: Vanguard’s $11T Crypto Reversal: Can 50 Million New Investors Push Bitcoin to $100K?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Butus / Shutterstock.com Vanguard—one of the world’s largest asset managers—shocked the financial industry by reversing its long-held anti-crypto stance. The firm, which oversees $11 trillion in client assets, now allows Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and cryptocurrency ETFs on its brokerage platform starting December 2, 2025. This policy shift opens access for Vanguard’s 50 million clients (many of them conservative investors) to finally buy regulated crypto investment products. The move validates crypto’s place in mainstream finance and raises a critical question: could this influx of potential capital help drive Bitcoin’s price back to the $100,000 mark? Vintage Tone / Shutterstock.com For years, Vanguard stood out as a major holdout even as other financial giants embraced digital assets. When the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024 after lengthy SEC battles, Vanguard actively blocked its customers from buying those funds. So what changed by late 2025? Vanguard’s reversal came from shifts both inside and outside the company—new leadership played a key role. In July 2024, Vanguard appointed Salim Ramji as CEO, the first outsider to head the firm. Ramji came from BlackRock’s iShares division, where he helped launch that firm’s Bitcoin ETF, bringing a much more crypto-friendly perspective. Externally, regulations around crypto developed significantly. Under a more innovation-friendly administration, the SEC eased its stance and approved multiple spot crypto ETFs. Competitors like Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and traditional banks moved ahead with crypto offerings, creating competitive pressure Vanguard couldn’t ignore. Studies found many younger, wealthy clients were leaving advisors who couldn’t offer crypto options, highlighting a growing business risk. Faced with these realities, Vanguard capitulated. The firm still won’t launch its own crypto funds, sticking to its core indexing philosophy. However, it now serves as a gateway for clients to buy crypto ETFs from other issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise. The sheer scale of Vanguard’s $11 trillion clientele means the impact won’t arrive as a one-time tsunami, but as persistent demand. Fifty million new potential investors with trillions in assets don’t create overnight pumps—they create steady, persistent demand that supports multi-year bull markets. DUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.com The immediate market reaction to Vanguard’s crypto reversal was emphatic. Bitcoin’s price jumped roughly 6% in a single day when the news hit, briefly breaching $93,000 before settling around $91,000. Within minutes of the U.S. market opening on December 2, a wave of buying pressure sparked a sharp rally, catching many traders off guard. The surge liquidated an estimated $400 million worth of short positions—bets that Bitcoin’s price would fall—in 24 hours, as pessimistic traders scrambled to cover. One analyst noted the “violent move from $88,000 to $93,000 happened so fast because the market had loaded up on shorts” that got squeezed. Options markets saw heavy activity too, with large call options accumulating around the $95,000 to $100,000 strikes. That’s a sign some big players are positioning for Bitcoin approaching the $100K threshold soon. DUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.com Many crypto analysts are bullish about what Vanguard’s entry means for Bitcoin. They point out that Bitcoin’s supply is fixed at 21 million coins, with over 19.6 million already mined. Any influx of new buyers can have an outsized effect on price given the scarce supply. With tens of millions of new investors now gaining easy access through a trusted platform, the pool of potential Bitcoin demand has expanded dramatically. Each major wave of institutional adoption in the past has coincided with a leap in Bitcoin’s valuation. The late 2017 boom was fueled by retail and initial coin offerings. The 2020-2021 cycle saw Bitcoin soar to $69,000 amid retail frenzy and corporate treasury buys. The 2024-2025 cycle, after ETF approvals, sent Bitcoin to new highs around $126,000 in October 2025. Bulls argue that Vanguard’s embrace could mark the next leg of Bitcoin’s maturation, potentially driving it to six-figure prices on sustained institutional buying. Some optimistic projections suggest Bitcoin could climb to $150,000-$200,000 by the end of 2026 if mainstream adoption continues at this pace, meaning $100K might be just a stepping stone. Vanguard’s entry has sparked a new wave of bullish Bitcoin predictions. Here are three possible predictions for the BTC price heading into 2026. In an optimistic scenario, Bitcoin enters 2026 with strong momentum as Vanguard clients allocate even modest percentages to crypto. If just 1% of Vanguard’s $11 trillion flows into Bitcoin ETFs over the next year, that’s $110 billion in new capital. Combined with continued institutional demand and regulatory clarity, Bitcoin could push past $100,000 and test $120,000-$150,000 by late 2026. Outside Vanguard’s influence, other catalysts support this case. U.S. regulators approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, opening crypto to mainstream funds. ETFs have gathered roughly $121 billion in assets by December 2025. Assuming continued strong ETF inflows (several billion per quarter) and no major macro shocks, Bitcoin would likely follow a grinding uptrend toward new all-time highs. In a moderate scenario, Bitcoin’s price rises steadily but without parabolic gains. Vanguard’s customers remain conservative and allocate slowly. Initial allocation rates might be around 0.1% to 0.2% of eligible Vanguard assets flowing into crypto early on, translating to just a few billion dollars spread across various crypto ETFs over the first year. That alone won’t catapult Bitcoin’s price to six figures overnight. The base case portrays Bitcoin making modest gains into 2026, aided by steady investment from Vanguard investors, institutional flows, and clearer U.S. regulation, but without the hyper-enthusiasm or panic of extreme cases. Bitcoin trades in a $90,000-$110,000 range for much of 2026, with occasional tests of $115,000-$120,000 during bullish periods. Cautious analysts urge a more tempered outlook if things don’t go according to plan. Critics point out that Vanguard is late to the party—their clients missed out on huge gains from 2023 to 2025 while the firm dragged its feet, and those big early opportunities won’t simply repeat on command. Additionally, macroeconomic headwinds could dampen enthusiasm. If the Federal Reserve holds rates higher for longer or if recession fears intensify, risk assets like Bitcoin could suffer. The timing of Vanguard’s reversal also matters. Bitcoin already rallied from $15,000 in late 2022 to over $126,000 in October 2025—much of the institutional adoption story might already be priced in. In a bearish scenario, Bitcoin could consolidate in the $70,000-$85,000 range through 2026, with brief spikes to $95,000 followed by pullbacks. The $100,000 milestone would remain elusive as profit-taking and cautious macro sentiment cap gains. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Source: Bloomberg. We’ve gone from a moneyproxy war to a privatized reconstruction racket, and now to global asset managers and Trump’s inner-circle real-estate cronies literally inserting themselves into diplomatic negotiations over a live war zone. BlackRock has already positioned itself to manage Ukraine’s postwar “rebuilding” aka a $400+ billion fire-sale of national assets. Now Fink is reportedly sitting at the table with Twink Kushner and Real Estate Agent Witkoff, because to them Ukraine’s fate is a business venture, not a sovereign crisis. Are you getting it yet?

Title: Geminid meteor shower set to light up Irish skies

A meteor shower is expected to light up Irish skies tonight, with around 20 times more shooting stars than normal. The geminid meteor shower is set to reach its peak activity tomorrow night and into Sunday morning. However, Blackrock Castle Observatory centre manager Alan Giltinan said tonight will be the best night to catch sight of a shooting star due to a poor weather outlook across the weekend. He said that there could be up to 10-15 shooting stars per hour, but up to 100-120 per hour is possible. From 10pm onwards tomorrow night, stargazers should look to the east to try catch sight of the dazzling display.

According to Astronomy Ireland, up to around 20 times more shooting stars could be seen. They say that rural areas will get the most spectacular views, but city dwellers should see plenty too due to the bright glow of the meteors. Astronomy Ireland explained that the geminid meteor shower is caused by tiny pieces of space debris that fell off an extinct comet or asteroid called Phaethon that goes around the sun every one-and-a-half years. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: BeToken Transforms an 18-Year Business Into a Web3 Asset

December 12, 2025 10:14 ET | Source: BeToken BeToken BARCELONA, Spain, Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a market saturated with speculative crypto launches and short-lived experiments, a new European project is taking a fundamentally different path. BeToken, built on the operational backbone of Beself Brands, is introducing a model where tokenisation is no longer a promise for the future but a real extension of a business that has been running successfully for nearly two decades. The initiative marks a significant shift: tokenisation is finally stepping into the real economy. $BTK is Designed Around a Profitable Business Unlike most blockchain projects that begin with an idea and hope to build traction later, BeToken starts from a position of strength. Beself Brands, the company behind the token, was founded in 2007 and today operates a network of retail and ecommerce brands that reach hundreds of thousands of customers across Europe. Over the years, the group has built multi-million dollar revenues, strong customer loyalty, and the infrastructure needed to scale efficiently. This foundation is what makes BeToken different. It is not attempting to create value from scratch. Instead, it is opening access to value already proven in the market. For media and investors, this represents a rare case where a token is not detached from real-world performance but directly linked to a functioning, profitable business. Portfolio of Leading Consumer Brands The tokenisation initiative is anchored in a broad ecosystem of more than 1,000 products and several household-name brands in their categories. Beself Brands operates FITFIU Fitness, Greencut, Mc Haus, Beeloom, and Playkin, all of which have grown steadily through operational excellence, efficient logistics, and a clear understanding of European consumer demand. Tokenising part of this business is not just innovative, it positions BeToken among the first European retail ecommerce groups to take such a step. It signals a turning point: tokenisation is no longer reserved for financial instruments or theoretical real-world assets, but can be applied to real commerce with established supply chains and strong margins. As Mireia Calvet Verges, CEO of BeToken, said: "BeToken marks the beginning of a new era for Beself Brands: we are moving from being a consolidated, profitable European company with more than €20M in annual revenue to becoming a vehicle for exponential global growth. Our challenge is not demand — we already have it. What limits our acceleration is capital. We have strong brands, operations in 10 countries, and a clear plan to multiply our presence in key markets like France, Italy, and Germany. Tokenization allows us to break the barriers of traditional equity, bringing real liquidity and opening our expansion to a global investor base under a regulated, transparent, and efficient model. BeToken is not an experiment; it is the natural evolution of how modern companies should finance growth. With this initiative, we accelerate a business plan that will take us beyond €95M in sales within the next six years and drive sustained value appreciation across all our brands. Today, we are opening access to a tangible opportunity: becoming part of the future of Beself Brands." Access to High-Performing Companies One of the biggest barriers to investing in successful private companies has always been exclusivity. Access is typically limited to venture funds, private equity firms, or ultra-wealthy individuals. BeToken aims to change this dynamic by allowing anyone to participate in the company’s growth with a starting investment of €2,000. To make the entry experience even more appealing, the platform introduces tiered bonuses from 5% to 15% depending on the chosen investment pack. While simple in structure, this approach reflects a broader mission: to redefine how everyday investors can access and benefit from the growth of real businesses. Clarity and Transparency in Web3 Fundraising Clarity has become one of the strongest differentiators of the project. The BeToken platform prominently displays the official token price of €2.75, the effective price after bonuses, and the remaining availability in each tier. This level of transparency, although standard in traditional finance, is still uncommon in Web3 launches, where pricing often feels ambiguous or intentionally complex. For investors, this becomes a signal of maturity. For the broader market, it demonstrates that tokenisation can be executed with the same discipline and professionalism expected in established financial environments. Profit-Sharing Model At the core of the token’s design is alignment. BeToken holders participate proportionally in the performance of the entire group, gaining access to opportunities, exclusive benefits, and long-term upside that grows together with the company. This positions BeToken as part of a growing movement that sees tokens not simply as tradable digital assets but as vehicles for sharing the value generated by productive, real-world companies. It reflects what many analysts believe to be the future of retail investment, a bridge between traditional business performance and new digital ownership models. Built Under Regulatory Principles With MiCA shaping the future of digital assets in Europe, regulatory clarity has become a critical competitive advantage. From the outset, BeToken has prioritised compliance, transparency, and public documentation. The project follows a European approach to token structure, offering a contrast to many international launches that still operate without clear oversight. This alignment with evolving regulation not only increases investor confidence but also signals that tokenisation in Europe may develop differently, with stronger emphasis on protection, clarity, and long-term sustainability. A Scalable Model for RWA Movement What sets BeToken apart is not only what it represents today but what it could unlock tomorrow. The structure developed by Beself Brands is designed to be replicable, offering a blueprint for thousands of SMEs and mid-sized businesses looking for new ways to attract capital, engage their community, and modernise their financial operations. As Europe continues searching for a Web3 model rooted in tangible economic activity, BeToken is one of the first real cases capable of guiding the next wave of adoption. Limited Availability The launch introduces controlled scarcity by limiting the number of packs in each investment tier. With only 50, 40, 20, and 10 allocations available across the four levels, investors have a clear incentive to act early. For media outlets, this creates a timely narrative: this is not an open-ended raise, but a structured opportunity that reflects real business discipline. Global Tokenisation Trend BeToken enters the market at a moment when tokenisation is gaining global recognition. Boston Consulting Group estimates the tokenised asset market could reach $16 trillion by 2030, while BlackRock refers to it as “the next great financial revolution.” In this context, BeToken becomes more than a company initiative. It stands as a European example of how real-world businesses can meaningfully adopt Web3 technology. Team With Deep Experience Behind the token is Beself Brands’ 18-year track record, built by a team of more than 60 professionals across logistics, operations, technology, and e-commerce. Their experience allows the project to merge traditional business excellence with modern digital infrastructure, a combination rarely seen in the current tokenisation landscape. About BeToken BeToken is a European tokenisation project built on Beself Brands, a consolidated retail and e-commerce group founded in 2007. Through a transparent, regulation-aligned model, BeToken allows investors to participate in the performance of an established multi-brand business. The project aims to set a new standard for real-world tokenisation in Europe. About Beself Brands Beself Brands operates some of Europe’s leading consumer brands, including FITFIU Fitness, Greencut, Mc Haus, Beeloom, and Playkin. With 18 years of operation, multi-million annual revenues, and strong logistics capacity, the group now brings its track record into the Web3 space through BeToken.

Title: Scaramucci predicts ‘exponential opportunity’ for crypto at LONGITUDE

Time Published: 2025-12-12T13:34:47Z

The cryptocurrency industry is riding on the tailwinds of regulatory clarity and newfound interest from institutional investors into the new year. Institutional investment and clear-cut regulations are laying the foundation for a strong start to 2026 for the wider cryptocurrency industry. Industry players including Anthony Scaramucci, Kristin Smith, Eli Ben-Sasson, Ian Rodgers, Reeve Collins and Joseph Chalom delivered optimistic outlooks for the new year after a year of positive change, particularly in the United States. Cointelegraph’s latest LONGITUDE event featured panels focused on Solana’s growth, surging interest in privacy protocols and lessons learned from security incidents in 2025. “There’s been a tremendous amount of progress in 2025, an unprecedented amount,” Smith said. The president of the Solana Policy Institute has been intimately involved in crypto-focused discussions in Washington over the past 18 months. Scaramucci said educating policymakers remains a key hurdle to helping the traditional financial system adopt innovative protocols running on blockchain rails. “Kristin has got to go into those rooms, and she’s got to explain to these people why this regulation needs to get passed so that we can retool the financial system and make the system less expensive and more seamless,” Scaramucci said. The founder of SkyBridge Capital added that existing TradFi systems currently spend over $4 trillion on transaction verification globally. Shifting to protocols like Ethereum and Solana, which currently rank highest for RWA tokenization and onchain activity, could offer unrivalled efficiency and cost savings. Again, the major hurdle in recent years has been lagging regulations that have scuppered innovation and the ability for institutions to actively explore using blockchain protocols. “We can do that today. It’s actually fairly easy to issue a share or a bond on a blockchain. The problem is the regulations don’t make sense when it comes to trading those assets. And so that’s a piece that we’re working on,” Smith said. Related: Scaramucci family invested over $100M in Trump’s Bitcoin mining firm: Report Scaramucci delivered a bullish parting message, highlighting the intent of America’s biggest financial institutions, BlackRock, Blackstone and JPMorgan, moving to tokenize assets on blockchain protocols. StarkWare founder Eli Ben-Sasson, who also co-founded the Zcash protocol, engaged in a thought-provoking fireside chat unpacking why privacy protocols have been in vogue in the latter half of 2025. Ben-Sasson weighed in on the massive interest in Zcash (ZEC) in 2025. The privacy-focused cryptocurrency has been around since 2016, but saw a massive surge in value and interest off the back of support from various big names in the industry. “At one extreme, you have the stuff we did at Zcash, which is resistance money level of privacy. If you need to jump on a plane and the government is pursuing you and you need to be fully, you know, off the radar, then you have that,” Ben-Sasson said. However, Ben-Sasson said the cost of that luxury is in the user experience. Wallets, programmability and user experience are harder to provide with that level of privacy. The less technical end of the spectrum affords a use case that is in high demand. Related: Can Zcash’s rise revive the Bitcoin OP_CAT discussion? “Enterprises come in, and they are going to want a different kind of privacy and also a different kind of privacy from the kind that we did on Zcash. They’re going to want privacy where they, as enterprises, and their customers are shielded away from other customers and from their competitors,” he said. Security was another major talking point at LONGITUDE VII, given the spate of high-profile hacks and security incidents in 2025. The theft of $1.6 billion of Ether (ETH) from Bybit in March was a wake-up call for the industry. As Phemex CEO Federico Variola explained, social engineering and unverified access continue to be a major threat to everyday crypto users. “It’s difficult in crypto because sometimes you need to participate in an airdrop, or like you want your Twitter account to be linked to the MegaETH ICO, for example. Nevertheless, you should be aware that you’re always exposing yourself to significant risk,” Variola said. Related: Bybit hack: ‘Reckoning’ that led SafeWallet to rearchitect its systems Ledger’s chief experience officer Ian Rodgers said that the onus is on service providers and infrastructure builders to think critically about the risks their platforms and users face. “There is no way to make a risk go to zero. But it is the responsibility to minimize the risk as much as possible, to think about what is the worst thing that could possibly happen, what could go wrong here,” Rodgers said.

Title: ETFs May Be Blurring the Line Between Gambling and Investing

Wanna bet? ETFs aren’t for gambling, but a rise in risk-on products could prove irresistible to a population obsessed with sports betting. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com To paraphrase a variety of sayings about making money in risky endeavors, the easiest way to get to $1 million is to start with $2 million. Historically, gambling and investing have been handled differently by the average American. The latter, of course, is intended to build wealth over time. But as access to gambling has dramatically expanded in recent years in the US, with sports betting and prediction markets available on anyone’s smartphone, the behaviors and attitudes around it have arguably bled into the investing world. There is now a booming new menu of exchange-traded products that let investors take risky, short-term stances, and that development in the ETF industry has some observers sounding the alarm. “There really are few parallels between investing and gambling, but there are many close parallels between speculation and gambling,” said Robert Johnson, professor of finance at Creighton University’s Heider College of Business. “And, unfortunately, the line between speculation and gambling is not only getting blurred, but it is being eliminated.” There are examples in the investing world that resemble speculation or gambling, Johnson said. Those include crypto assets, picking stocks in the electric vehicles market and leveraged ETFs (which in some cases overlap with crypto and EV stocks). “There is no way to value cryptocurrencies other than the greater fool theory — the hope that some greater fool will pay you more than you paid,” he said. “It is the consummate bubble, and investors should stay far away from cryptocurrencies in general and bitcoin specifically.” A growing number of asset managers might disagree with that. It’s now common for traditional financial companies to offer access to them. And some firms even recommend small allocations to bitcoin for wealth management clients. The latest company to cave to the crypto craze, Vanguard, allows brokerage clients to buy bitcoin and other crypto ETFs, but it doesn’t include memecoins. It’s also notable that Vanguard doesn’t include leveraged or inverse ETFs on its brokerage platform. Broad market index ETFs are appropriate for most investors, Johnson said. Leveraged ETFs, though, which amplify gains and losses and often reset daily, are not, he noted. Those products are increasing in number and size: Robinhood and other brokerage systems have helped trading skyrocket in popularity, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people were trapped indoors and had an abundance of time on their hands. While stockpicking can be inherently risky, the stakes have been pushed higher with the availability of prediction markets, or yes/no derivative contracts for the outcome of almost any event imaginable. It’s also big business: Still, there are differences in the kinds of information people have and how they use it that can distinguish between gambling and investing, said Valeria Martinez, CEO of Bettingladies.com, an online community of women who bet on sports. “Investors rely on fundamentals and disclosures, while bettors rely on performance data, models and market sentiment,” she said. “Perhaps where the two overlap is in the mindset. People today are simply more used to making probabilistic decisions in all areas of life, whether it’s choosing a stock or picking a team.” A former CFTC enforcement attorney who now defends white-collar clients said risky behaviors that start while gambling can snowball into investing, and at great costs. “Investors who slip into speculative, emotion-driven behavior become far more vulnerable to fraud, market manipulation schemes and high-pressure sales tactics,” said Braden Perry, partner at Kennyhertz Perry. “The behavior that begins as entertainment trading can develop into misuse of margin, unauthorized trading or increasingly desperate attempts to recover losses. Those situations often lead to regulatory investigations or even criminal exposure.” What Could Go Wrong? Even for stocks with net positive returns, leveraged ETFs held for longer than a day can underperform those target stocks because of decay, caused by their daily resets, amplified losses during volatility and fees. But big losses can also happen quickly, as seen during 2020’s extreme volatility, when inverse VIX exchange-traded notes lost nearly all their value and closed, Creighton University’s Johnson said. A more recent example is UK-domiciled GraniteShares 3X Short AMD ETP, which erased its value in a single day in October after Advanced Micro Devices’s stock jumped 38%. “In the hands of amateur investors, leveraged ETFs and ETNs are weapons of mass wealth destruction,” Johnson said. What’s most worrisome to Aaron Randak, founder of Golden Acre Wealth Management, is the great wealth transfer, in which younger generations stand to inherit tens of trillions of dollars from baby boomers. The success stories of a few people in prediction markets might be what younger people most often see, rather than the risks. And that could potentially impact investing behavior down the road. “It could be an overall positive for the world to have these prediction markets, because it shines a light on the major events,” he said. When it comes to investing, leveraged ETFs can be very useful for highly experienced traders and institutional investors, but “the younger investor doesn’t have any clue what research is needed.” After a dive, the company’s stock is still up 8% in 2025, while both long and short leveraged ETFs are down. The world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the biggest crypto ETF is expanding into staked Ethereum. Is there room for anyone else? Active fixed-income strategies accounted for nearly half of ETF inflows so far this year. Niche strategies, like buffer ETFs, could play a larger role in deal activity. Its price is up 100%, significantly ahead of gold’s surge, and the (very) few silver ETFs on the US market have benefited. The company’s flagship ETF, QQQ, is just shy of enough votes to approve its reclassification as an open-end fund. Recent developments at Vanguard and Bank of America have boosted momentum for digital assets including bitcoin ETFs. The company on Tuesday reversed its ban on Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs, giving access to many of its 50 million clients. The rise of model portfolios has enabled issuers to choose funds in their best interest — not necessarily the client’s. AI and other tech platforms can help ETF issuers identify the best sales prospects among firms in their target markets. Asset managers acknowledge the reality of paying to access Schwab customers, as they have started to do with Fidelity. As active ETFs have exploded, so too has thematic investing, a dangerous trend for most investors, the author of a Morningstar report said. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: U.S. SEC Gives Implicit Nod for Tokenized Stocks

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) implicitly granted approval for some stocks and other securities to be tokenized and traded on blockchains. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC), the world's largest securities settlement system, said on Thursday that a subsidiary, the Depository Trust Co. (DTC), received a no-action letter allowing it to offer a tokenization service on approved blockchains for three years. Tokenization is the process of representing stocks, bonds and other real-world assets (RWAs) as digital tokens that can be bought, sold and traded on blockchains, with the aim of achieving greater efficiency and faster settlement. Some of the biggest names in traditional finance (TradFi), including JPMorgan and BlackRock, have developed projects in this area, demonstrating the potential institutional investment that they can draw to blockchain finance. The Depository Trust Co.'s authorization applies to the constituents of the Russell 1000 index, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking major indexes and U.S. Treasuries. It plans to begin rolling out the service in the first half of 2026. A no-action letter is a formal response from the agency to a company stating that the regulator will not take any enforcement action for a proposed activity.

The big picture: It's the first time during Trump's second term that the House has secured enough votes to repeal one of his executive orders, though the measure faces an uphill battle as it heads to the GOP-controlled Senate. Federal employee unions have been at the forefront of the administration's efforts to shrink the federal workforce — moves that laid off more than 200,000 federal employees earlier this year and an approximate 4,000 during the nation's longest-ever government shutdown. The administration has argued that restricting union rights is necessary to protect national security, despite many agencies being indirectly linked to those concerns. Driving the news: The House voted 231-195 against Trump's March order, which sought to strip the employees' protections to negotiate for better pay, benefits and fair treatment. Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) introduced the Protect America's Workforce Act, which they say would restore union rights for nearly 1 million federal workers. The corresponding Senate bill had 48 original co-sponsors .

Many of us dismiss a rash as “just allergies,” “just dry skin,” or “probably nothing.”. But doctors warn there is one rash that can turn deadly in hours, not days — and Americans rarely recognize it until it’s too late. One simple dryer mistake is linked to roughly 15,900 home fires a year and at least 10 American deaths -- and experts say it is completely preventable.

A seasoned law-enforcement officer in Wisconsin is sounding the alarm: illicit Fentanyl is now reportedly being disguised in everyday items—including eye‐drop bottles—amid a worsening drug‐overdose crisis. The Russian navy’s only aircraft carrier, the decrepit Admiral Kuznetsov, has been in overhaul since 2017.

Title: Jared Kushner eyes Apollo, KKR to join Ukraine’s postwar reconstruction fund: sources
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/12/11/business/jared-kushner-eyes-apollo-kkr-to-join-ukraines-postwar-reconstruction-fund-sources/
Time Published: 2025-12-12T03:18:42Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Jared Kushner, has approached Marc Rowan’s Apollo Global Management and Henry Kravis’s KKR to assist with post-war reconstruction in Ukraine, The Post has learned. Sources familiar with the matter said Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law who has no formal role in the administration, was in New York City on Wednesday for exploratory discussions with the top asset managers in Manhattan’s swanky Hudson Yards development. Insiders said the 44-year-old held meetings at the offices of both financial giants on how to rebuild the war-torn nation. The talks, which are still at a very early stage and may not come to fruition, came on the same day that he took part in a call with Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The names of the VIP participants were released in a statement by Ukraine’s presidential office that evening. Reps for BlackRock, KKR, Affinity Partners, the Treasury Department, and President Zelensky did not return The Post’s requests for comment. A spokesman for Apollo declined to comment. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink halted his firm’s own multi-billion-dollar Ukraine Development Fund in July amid uncertainty over how President Trump would try to end the war. But he is set to revive the idea, which would also include involvement from the World Bank, that aimed to drum up some $400 billion in fresh investment. “This is not a huge money maker for whoever does it. They are not going to charge incentive fees. It’s a public service,” one person briefed on the situation added. “But you are going to ingratiate yourself with the president and Mr Kushner,” the source added. “They are going to f–k the Europeans.” Indeed, the move could raise fears amongst Ukraine’s allies in Europe that they will be cut out of any lucrative contracts to rebuild the war-torn country. The Trump administration, via the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), in September pledged $75 million in equity intended to jumpstart the fund’s investment in critical minerals, hydrocarbons, defense, and related infrastructure in Ukraine. That investment is set to be matched by Kyiv to bring it to an initial combined total of $150 million, but DFC stressed that much of the work would be done by “aligned private sector partners.” Ukrainian government officials, including Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, are set to hold what one source described as “marathon talks” about the US-backed peace proposal this weekend. They will also focus on how to rebuild the nation that has been subjected to a brutal four-year attempt to wipe Ukraine off the map by Russian invaders. Kushner, who is not formally part of the administration, has emerged as a central figure in the process of negotiating a peace settlement between Ukraine and Russia. Alongside Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, he attended five hours of Kremlin talks last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin and then later discussions with a Ukrainian delegation in Florida. Kushner, married to the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, previously played a major role in negotiating a ceasefire agreement in Gaza between Israel and Hamas and has also put forward proposals for reconstruction in Gaza. A key point in plans for the reconstruction of Ukraine has been the establishment of an investment fund for sectors including rare metals – sought by the United States, with Svyrydenko playing a key role in setting it up. Kyiv sent its own revised draft of the now 20-point plan to the White House on Wednesday, according to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

A wide range of foreign and domestic investors were allotted shares, including the government of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Fidelity, Norges Bank, BlackRock, Aberdeen, Wellington, Capital World, J P Morgan Investment Management Inc., Goldman Sachs and Aranda Investments Pte. Limited, according to a circular uploaded on the Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) website. Domestically, the anchor book also saw participation from the state-owned LIC and top mutual fund houses, such as SBI MF, Nippon India MF, Axis MF, HDFC MF and Aditya Birla Sun Life MF, among others. According to the circular, ICICI Prudential AMC has allotted 1.39 crore shares to 149 funds at ₹2,165 apiece, which is also the higher end of the price band. This anchor allocation comes on the heels of a pre-IPO (initial public offering) funding round, where 26 domestic and foreign investors infused ₹4,815 crore into ICICI Prudential AMC. As part of this transaction, the asset management company undertook a private placement of 2,22,40,841 equity shares at an issue price of ₹2,165 apiece, according to its public announcement on Wednesday. This substantial fundraise drew participation from a diverse set of investors, including Lunate Capital, the Estate of late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, IIFL Asset Management, 360 One Funds, Whiteoak Capital, HCL Capital, and market veterans Manish Chokani and Madhusudan Kela. Alongside external investors, the ICICI Bank itself invested ₹2,140 crore to acquire an additional 2 per cent stake in the asset management company. With the anchor round completed, the company is now gearing up for its ₹10,602-crore maiden public offering, which will open on December 12 and close on December 16. ICICI Prudential AMC has set a price band of ₹2,061 to ₹2,165 per share for the issue, valuing the company at about ₹1.07 lakh crore ($11.86 billion). The IPO will be an entirely offer-for-sale (OFS) of more than 4.89 crore shares by its promoter, UK-based Prudential Corporation Holdings, meaning the company will not receive any proceeds from the offering. Currently, the ICICI Bank holds 51 per cent in the AMC, while Prudential owns the remaining 49 per cent. Once listed, ICICI Prudential AMC will become the latest asset manager to debut on Indian stock exchanges, joining players such as HDFC AMC, UTI AMC, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, Shriram AMC and Nippon Life India Asset Management. It will also be the fifth ICICI Group entity to be listed, after ICICI Bank, ICICI Prudential Life, ICICI Lombard and ICICI Securities. The company is scheduled to make its stock market debut on December 19. Published on December 12, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-600-rally-in-2026-if-this-support-holds/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As the start-of-week momentum slows, Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped 5.5% on the daily timeframe, falling to the recent lows once again. Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency is setting the stage for a massive short-term and mid-term rally if the retests of current levels hold. On Thursday, Dogecoin followed the rest of the crypto market and retraced to the $0.136-$0.138 levels. The cryptocurrency has retraced around 50% following the Q4 market downturn, trading within the $0.130-$0.155 price range over the past few weeks. Amid this week’s recovery, DOGE’s price briefly tested the local range highs, trying to break out of this area for the second time this month. However, Wednesday’s volatility, driven by the expectations of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut announcement, led to a 4.6% intraday drop before continuing its descent to the current levels. Market observer Trader Tardigrade highlighted the cryptocurrency’s performance, noting that Dogecoin is holding strong at a key support area despite the pullback, which could “potentially set the stage for a massive surge to $1” next year. According to the chart, DOGE is retesting an ascending support zone that has preceded major moves over the past two years. Since late 2023, this support has been retested three times, marking the bottom of each major corrective phase and serving as a “launchpad” to new highs. Notably, the subsequent rally’s size and duration have seen an increasing trend, with the bounces lasting longer and reaching higher levels after each retest of the two-year trendline. During the first rebound, Dogecoin rallied 87% in eight weeks. Meanwhile, DOGE surged by over 210% in ten weeks after retesting this crucial level. Lastly, it registered a 14-week 442% run between Q3 and Q4, 2024, to its multi-year high of $0.48. With the price currently retesting this level once again, the analyst suggested that a rally to the $1 mark could be brewing if the current levels hold. A bounce from this area could kick off a 610% jump at the start of 2026. The trader also pointed out that DOGE’s MACD Bullish Crossover “is now happening.” He explained that the cryptocurrency’s trend began shifting from a downtrend to an uptrend on Wednesday, suggesting a significant price move is to follow. He previously affirmed that this setup has preceded previous breakouts this year, with the price surging to new local highs in Q2 and Q3 after each MACD bullish cross. As this setup begins to unfold, the analyst’s chart suggests that the price could bounce to the October levels. Similarly, other market observers hinted that Dogecoin could be preparing for a 60%-120% surge in the short term. Analyst Bitcoinsensus highlighted a classic bullish reversal pattern, a falling wedge pattern, that has been forming since October in DOGE’s chart. After the recent price action, the “price has been slowly bleeding inside this structure and now potentially forming a nice rounded bottom. If we get a decent breakout above the upper yellow line, we could be targeting the 0.20$ area (+60%),” the analyst stated. Meanwhile, AltCryptoTalk recently noted that Dogecoin is retesting “the same weekly demand zone that sparked every major rally in the past,” which could spark a 115% rally to the $0.30 September high if the area holds. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.137, an 8% decline in the weekly timeframe. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Title: Trajan Wealth: Balancing Growth with Safer Options
URL: https://www.wealthmanagement.com/investing-strategies/trajan-wealth-balancing-growth-with-safer-options
Time Published: 2025-12-11T20:35:39Z
Full Content:
Co-CIO David Busch discusses how the firm approaches risk/reward calculations. December 11, 2025 Trajan Wealth, a $2.5 billion RIA headquartered in Scottsdale, Ariz., has a broad mandate. The firm serves clients on almost every level of the wealth ladder—from the mass affluent, which it defines as anyone with $500,000 to $1 million in assets, including in their 401(k)s, to high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth investors. In addition, the firm aims to be a one-stop shop for all of those clients’ needs, including not just wealth management, but retirement planning, estate planning, tax planning and insurance and annuity services, according to David Busch, Trajan Wealth co-Chief Investment Officer. Not surprisingly, that requires a careful balancing act, combining an acceptable level of risk—for example, through allocations to private equity and private credit—with some skepticism about popular products du jour. For example, the firm has stayed away from Bitcoin ETFs, considering crypto a highly speculative asset, though it may eventually consider Bitcoin buffer ETFs, Busch said. WealthManagement.com had a conversation with Busch, who worked as an institutional portfolio manager prior to joining the firm two years ago, about Trajan Wealth’s investment strategy and how it juggles its various clients’ needs. This Q&A has been edited for style, length and clarity. Related:Fidelis Capital: Focusing on Returns Net of Fees, Taxes and Inflation WealthManagement.com: Can you give us a sense of your typical client? David Busch: Our clientele is segmented between three groups. One I would call the mass affluent. Think about the everyday investor that retires and has $500,000 to $1 million in their 401(k) or people that have that [amount] in investable assets. We also cater to high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth. And as a firm, we offer services above and beyond just wealth management. We have our wealth management team that includes investment management. We also have estate planning, tax planning and preparation, as well as insurance and annuities. The idea is to have everything under one roof, so that our clients can have access to all of those different services if they need them. WM: Can you break down your allocations for us? DB: We offer a wide variety of investment products. Everything from your typical asset allocation models that range from conservative to aggressive to managed equity models, where clients buy individual stocks based on models that one of my investment managers manages. They include everything from large cap growth to dividend growth and value. We have an alternatives sleeve, where I include our managed futures product, which is a product that’s designed to provide crisis alpha. It’s a trend-following product, and its ... within managed futures that follow 30 to 50 markets. Essentially, they attempt to make money whether the market is going up or down. The caveat is that there has to be a clear trend. Related:Citi Global Wealth at Work: Investment Guidance for Execs and Other Professionals On the private side, we have curated specific opportunities for our clients to invest as limited partners into specific private equity funds. The reason we do it that way versus using a fund-of-funds type strategy, is that we can work specifically with a private equity firm, and we can perform our due diligence. We look under the hood, we look at all the investments, and then our clients who are accredited or qualified can invest within those vehicles. In that space, we offer everything from a venture fund to real estate, infrastructure and private credit. This gives our clients opportunities to invest in some of these sectors based on their risk tolerance and time horizons. The last thing is that we have fixed-income strategies that range from ultra-short to intermediate. WM: How often do you update your allocations? DB: It really depends on the specific client’s risk tolerance and their specific needs. We review our client holdings on a quarterly basis, their financial situation, their upcoming cash flow needs, whether they have to pay for something like college education or fund a payment on a home, as well as their long-term investment goals. Related:The Hidden Flaw in Style Index Funds WM: What were some changes you’ve made to allocations recently? DB: In this moment, what we are looking at is large cap growth, specifically large cap tech, which has outperformed value for the past 15 years. That was really driven by low interest rates, and now there are some concerns in terms of valuations for some of these high-tech companies. I still am a firm believer that tech is the way of the future, and we should be invested in large cap tech over the long term. Over the near term, we have to be cognizant of the valuations, but also the capital expenditures that are required to build out the AI infrastructure. I believe there could be some short-term volatility, specifically in the big names. That’s why, right now, we are looking at providing more of a balanced approach for equity models. You have your large cap growth, but balance that with large cap value, specifically dividend payers, because that cash flow will help offset some of the volatility. And when we have market volatility, value will typically outperform growth when the market is going down. On the fixed income side, I am looking at the Fed and the cutting cycle. The front end of the curve is going to move down because the Fed controls the overnight interest rates. They’ve also announced a cessation of quantitative tightening. They are now reinvesting proceeds back into U.S. Treasuries. What that will likely look like is that it will help dampen some rate volatility, but the front end is going to be driven by the changes in the Fed’s overnight funds rate. The long end is going to be driven by supply dynamics. So, I think there could be some volatility, particularly on the long end of the curve. As a result, we are focused on the three -to five-year part of the curve. With everything that’s going on within the credit markets—the consumers are stretched very thin right now, we are seeing rising delinquencies and defaults on consumer loans—how I translate that is: “Invest on the fixed-income side in the three- to five-year part of the curve, but go up quality.” That should include Treasuries, investment-grade corporates. For high yield, I would be very cautious and selective and ensure that the names we are buying have the ability to repay that debt. You have to do a complete credit deep dive, almost like an underwriting. WM: Do you work with outside asset managers on public equities and fixed-income investments? DB: We do it all internally. We have a pretty robust team on the investment management side. We have a bank of analysts, traders, as well as portfolio managers that are constantly researching the markets and positioning based on that research. So everything we do on the public side is in-house. We currently have six people on that team. WM: How do you choose asset managers on the private market side? DB: We perform due diligence on those asset managers. The reason we steer clear of fund-of-funds type strategies is because those structures are embedded with fees—there is the private equity manager’s fee, the mutual fund company fees, and then typically, an advisor fee on top of that. So, we are removing a layer or two of those fees. When we look at each one of these private equity firms, we are using the relationships that we’ve developed over the course of our careers and doing the due diligence in terms of their background, their history, their wins, their losses and also the opportunity that is in front of us. We look at these—I would call them boutique—private equity firms. We generally steer clear of the big private equity funds that are out there. We are intentionally specific in that middle-market space. The reason is that when you are competing against the BlackRocks, the Blackstones and the Apollos of the world, and they raise billions of dollars for a new fund, they have to put that money to work pretty quickly. As a result, there is a food fight for the biggest deals that are out there. When there is a lot more competition, it waters down the returns. For us, because we are looking in that upper middle market space, we are avoiding that competition from the big players, and it has historically provided our clients with the opportunity for better returns. WM: What types of returns do you look for in that space? DB: If it’s a private equity fund, either a venture or a buyout fund, it has to beat the returns of the S&P 500, or at least we have to anticipate that it’s going to beat the returns of the S&P 500. Because what’s the point of going into a private equity fund if it can’t beat the index itself? If it’s a real estate structure, we look at the income our clients can receive, as well as the project itself and the valuations at which we are buying. In some instances, our clients are able to get accelerated depreciation for their tax returns. On the private credit side, that’s one area I am very cautious. The biggest reason is that companies have turned to private credit to access the loans they need without going to a bank. Banks have a very defined box they can lend within, based on regulations. So the promise of a private credit fund is that they can work with a company to structure the debt in a way that makes sense for the company, and it’s also speed-to-closing. What I am concerned with, is that with non-bank lenders, they are able to make loans that are covenant-lite. And what we have seen recently in headlines is that there have been some banks that participated in these private credit loans and took losses because the borrower had assigned the same collateral to multiple loans. When they failed, it’s now impacting everybody who was lending against that one specific collateral. The nice thing about bank loans is that when a bank issues a loan, they have a lien on that collateral. And in private credit, that’s not happening, and with covenant-lite, there may be instances where the lender did not follow through with all the covenants that are required to keep their position safe in the event of a bankruptcy. The other issue with that space is that we just don’t have optics into it. There is no way to really know the performance of the underlying loans. WM: Do you invest in cryptocurrency in any way? DB: We have not. Our stance has been that it’s a speculative asset class. I recognize that there are many ETFs that are available, from BlackRock and Vanguard and State Street and multiple other companies. We’ve seen the volatility in Bitcoin over the past several weeks. That’s not an asset class we necessarily want to have available to our clients. What I can see in our future is that there are some very interesting structures in the ETF space where the ETF is built to participate in the upside in the cryptocurrency growth, but while protecting the downside using derivative contracts. In that instance, there may be an opportunity for us to allocate a portion, but it’s not something we go all in on. WM: Do you invest in international markets? DB: We do. We generally invest in developed markets. We steer clear of emerging markets. In international, we’ll use ETFs. There are a few countries that we are overweight on. Essentially, India as a country has the demographics. That’s going to be the next stop for the onshoring of American manufacturing that will shift from China. They are highly educated, they are a fast-growing country. That’s more of a growth bet. But we balance that with some good old, standby, safe countries like Switzerland as an example. The currency there is strong, that market is very stalwart. WM: Do you hold cash? DB: Yes. All of our model portfolios have a portion that’s allocated to cash. It’s really for operational purposes. We try to keep that cash balance at a minimum, unless somebody has a very specific need.

Title: JPMorgan Pushes Deeper Into Tokenization With Galaxy's Debt Issuance on Solana

Global bank J.P. Morgan has arranged a landmark commercial paper issuance on the Solana blockchain, in a move that pushes real-world financial instruments deeper into public blockchain infrastructure. Commercial paper, typically issued through legacy systems, is a short-term debt tool that companies use to raise working capital. This one was structured onchain and settled using USDC, the stablecoin issued by Circle (CRCL). J.P. Morgan created the onchain token representing the debt and handled the settlement. Galaxy’s investment banking arm structured the issuance. Coinbase acted both as investor and wallet provider, while Franklin Templeton, which has already created a tokenized money market fund, also invested in the token. The move underscores the rising institutional interest to use blockchain plumbing for traditional financial instruments, also known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) like debt, fund or equity. The process promises efficiency gains, faster settlement, proponents say. The tokenized asset market could mushroom to $18.9 trillion by 2033, BCG and Ripple projected. The trend has also gained support from U.S. regulators. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has recently touted tokenization as a key innovation for capital markets, saying in a FOX Business interview last week that it has the potential to change the financial system over the next couple years. The issuance was the latest example of J.P. Morgan's push into blockchain and tokenized assets. The bank has been an early mover, developing JPM Coin in 2019 and launching its blockchain unit, Onyx, in 2020. That division, now integrated under Kinexys, conducted blockchain-based repo trades, cross-border payments and tokenized asset settlements with partners including BlackRock and Siemens.

You can find columns and interviews at HelenRaleighSpeaks.com or her Substack newsletter, Confucius Never Said. Follow Helen on Twitter: @HRaleighspeaks. The White House has released a new National Security Strategy whose central purpose is unambiguous: to ensure the United States remains the preeminent global power. At its core is a new and pragmatic China strategy. The document opens with a blunt indictment of the past three decades of American policy, especially on China. Successive administrations—Republican and Democratic alike—embraced the delusion that flooding China with capital, technology, and market access would liberalize the Chinese Communist Party and peacefully integrate it into an America-led rules-based world order. Instead, we financed and armed our most dangerous rival. The result is a near-peer competitor that now menaces American security, prosperity, and the free world itself. The new National Security Strategy discards that fantasy. It is grounded in a cold-eyed recognition that the United States must compete—relentlessly and across various regions—while buying the time required to rebuild the industrial, technological, and military foundations that previous generations allowed to atrophy. In the Western Hemisphere, the administration is reasserting the Monroe Doctrine. China’s creeping penetration of Latin America—$2.5 billion into Panama alone, second-place usage of the canal we built, Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s pledge to wire 33 regional nations into Beijing’s orbit—has been met with swift counteraction by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, the Trump administration successfully urged Panama to withdraw from a China-funded infrastructure initiative. Soon after, Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison announced the sale of its controlling stake in two Panama ports to a group of investors led by American investment firm BlackRock. In April, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth reiterated the commitment to counter “malign Chinese influence” in the Western Hemisphere. The new security strategy declares, without apology, that the United States will remain the dominant power in the Western Hemisphere and that non-hemispheric actors—China foremost among them—will be denied military footholds and strategic resources in America’s backyard. The document delves more deeply into America’s China policy in its section on Asia. The Trump administration recognizes that the Indo-Pacific region accounts for nearly half the world’s gross domestic product by purchasing-power parity. Free and open Indo-Pacific is vital to our national interest. On the economic front, the administration seeks to a balanced trade relationship with China based on “reciprocity and fairness” to regain American economic independence. The goal is clear: “If America remains on a growth path—and can sustain that while maintaining a genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing—we should be headed from our present $30 trillion economy in 2025 to $40 trillion in the 2030s, putting our country in an enviable position to maintain our status as the world’s leading economy.” Some China hawks recoil at any language of “mutually advantageous” relations, hearing in it the echo of past naïveté. They are not wrong to be skeptical. Beijing’s definition of “win-win” has always meant China wins twice. Yet, total decoupling immediately is not feasible. The United States requires time to rebuild its manufacturing capabilities and secure its supply chains. However, a measured tone does not suggest that the administration will shy away from robust competition with China or neglect the essential interests of the United States and its allies. For instance, the National Security Strategy clearly commits to cooperating with allies and strengthening military capacity that can counter aggression in the First Island Chain near China, especially to protect Taiwan due to its strategic location in the South China Sea. This area is critically important for the U.S. and its allies, with one-third of global shipping passing through it annually. The Trump administration vows to establish “strong deterrence necessary to keep these shipping lanes open and free from arbitrary closures by any single nation.” Critics of President Donald Trump have sought to paint him as someone willing to compromise Taiwan’s security for trade concessions with China. However, the security strategy directly counters these speculations, offering much-needed reassurance to both Taiwan and Japan. This clarification is particularly welcome given the increasing pressure from China on Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who has stated that Japan would mobilize its defense forces in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Xi, who regards the reunification as a “core interest,” is bound to feel disappointed by the strategy’s approach, as it clearly indicates that the Trump administration firmly rejects any unilateral changes to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Moreover, the U.S. actively encourages allies like Japan to enhance their defense expenditures and collaborate with the U.S. to maintain the South China Sea as a free and open area. The Trump administration has clearly learned from past policy mistakes. The National Security Strategy rejects the platitudes of the past, accepting the hard truth that great-power competition has returned—and that the United States intends to win it by bolstering its economic, technological, and military leadership, while resolutely defending its interests, security, and prosperity against China’s aggressive actions, particularly the Western Hemisphere and the Indo-Pacific. If executed with discipline and sustained by the American people, America will remain a leading global power for many years to come. We publish a variety of perspectives.

Title: BlackRock still ‘pro-risk’ despite talk of AI bubble – Stock Takes

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. BlackRock remains bullish on artificial intelligence. Image / Getty Images US investment behemoth BlackRock is still “pro-risk”, despite widespread fears of a market bubble driven by the investment appetite for artificial intelligence. The fund manager sees the artificial intelligence (AI) theme as still being the main driver of US equities. “Identifying the winners as AI revenues spread is an active investment story,” BlackRock said in a commentary. “Mega-forces are transforming the global economy and markets, especially AI. “Technology is becoming capital-intensive and the AI build-out could be unprecedented in both speed and scale.” These investment ambitions were “pushing limits” on a number of fronts. “With a few mega-forces driving markets, it is hard to avoid making a big call on their direction. “We stay pro-risk and overweight US stocks on the AI theme.” BlackRock said North Asia anchored the hardware and infrastructure required for AI’s next phase. China is scaling its own AI ecosystem, and south and Southeast Asia are driving the region’s consumption and labour force growth. Unlocking these investment opportunities called for an active investment approach, BlackRock said. “We are overweight [on] Japanese equities, favour selective AI-linked opportunities in Taiwan, South Korea and China, and hold a strategic overweight to India. “The AI build-out remains centred in the US, where capital spending is scaling rapidly. Yet the spillover is evident in Asia. “Taiwan and South Korea anchor the semiconductor and memory chains powering the build-out, supported by firm order books, expanding capacity and clear earnings visibility.” South Korea equities gained more than 60% in the year to November 28, 2025, even after intermittent pullbacks as investors reassessed the pace of AI demand. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, with about US$13.52 trillion ($17t) in assets under management. Forsyth Barr has reinstated Vital Healthcare (VHP) – which specialises in investing in property used in the healthcare sector – to outperform. The broker set a $2.23 target price after the company’s move to internalise management, which it sees as being a long-term positive. “The current environment of modest inflation and stable interest rates is supportive of earnings growth, and we forecast AFFO [adjusted funds from operations] to lift 5% by financial year 2028.” Forsyth Barr said concerns over private hospital profitability in Australia were abating as margins improve. “Gearing remains higher versus peers, but management internalisation unlocks strategic optionality,” Forsyth Barr said. The former manager, Canada’s NorthWest, has a 24% stake in Vital. Forsyth Barr said it expects the stake will be a likely overhang for the stock, with the first escrow rolling off in February 2026. Last month, Vital raised $220 million to fund the internalisation. At the time, VHP chair Graham Stuart said internalisation marked an important milestone. Northwest has also agreed to an escrow arrangement through to the release of Vital’s first-half 2026 result in February and to not sell down below a 10% stake until after the release of Vital’s financial-year 2026 result next August. Investment research firm Morningstar noted fixed-lines infrastructure company Chorus’ BBB long-term credit rating had been reaffirmed by S&P Global last month. However, the agency said its outlook for Chorus was upgraded to “positive”, from “stable”, citing the resilience of the group’s regulated cashflow, prudent capital management and robust balance sheet. Morningstar said Chorus’ net debt/ebitda [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] ratio of 4.5 is not quite “prudent,” especially since the covenant limit is 5.5 times. “But we concur it can be supported by the group’s ‘infrastructure-esque’ business, with legacy copper largely in the rearview and fixed-line fibre the dominant broadband facilitator.” Fibre now represents 93% of total connections (from 56% five years ago) and fibre revenue 80% (from 49%). Fibre’s share of group ebitda is likely over 90% and the resilience of these earnings is underpinned by Kiwis’ essential (and voracious) demand for fixed-line broadband, Morningstar said. “We expect such steady earnings growth to continue, as Chorus becomes ‘all-fibre’ and extracts efficiencies from being so,” it said. Morningstar lifted its fair “value estimate” for Chorus by 16% to $9.30. “We also upgrade our uncertainty rating to ‘low’ from ‘medium’,” it said. “Predictability of Chorus’ earnings is reinforced by regulatory certainty. “While it ensures no excess returns from Chorus’ near-monopoly fibre assets, the relatively benign regulatory regime is also set in stone until the end of 2028.” Forsyth Barr noted clothing retailer Hallenstein Glassons (HLG) provided a strong 18-week 2026 trading update with sales up 13.8% on the prior year, accelerating from 12.9% in the seven-week trading update in September 2025. Sales growth has been driven by continued strength in Australia, with contributions from new store openings, store expansions and refurbishments completed in the last year. While the New Zealand operating backdrop remains challenging, both businesses are trading ahead of last year. With the key Christmas and summer trading periods ahead, management cautioned against extrapolating current momentum for the year ahead. “We forecast 11% sales growth in FY26 led by continued strength in Glassons Australia,” Forsyth Barr said. The broker continued to view the “risk-reward” from Hallensteins as attractive and rated the stock as “outperform”. As expected, the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates to a three-year low after a divisive meeting that exposed deep fractures in the central bank over whether to prioritise weakening employment or elevated inflation, the Financial Times reported. The central bank on Wednesday lowered its benchmark rate by a quarter of a point to between 3.5-3.75%, as widely anticipated by Wall Street. Three of the dozen voters on the Fed’s policy-setting board objected to the central bank’s quarter-point cut, “the most powerful revolt since 2019″, the Financial Times said. Fed governor Stephen Miran, a Trump ally, wanted a half-point cut, while the Chicago Fed’s Austan Goolsbee and the Kansas City Fed’s Jeffrey Schmid called for no change.

European shares advanced, shrugging off a decline in tech stocks as broader confidence in global growth sparked a rotation into sectors linked to the economic cycle, such as construction materials and banks. The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates again on Wednesday also helped calm market jitters around the health of the US economy. Outperforming its European peers, the Iseq index advanced by 1.4 per cent, led higher financial and airline stocks. AIB and Bank of Ireland advanced again, adding 0.7 per cent and 0.5 per cent to close at €8.90 and 0.5 per cent per share, respectively. Ryanair, off the pace earlier in the week, jumped by more than 3 per cent, part of a wider sectoral move across Europe. In what was a theme across European indices, home builders also advanced on Thursday. Cairn Homes jumped by almost 1 per cent to €2.01 per share while Glenveagh Properties added 0.5 per cent to close at almost €1.90. Cavan insulation giant Kingspan, meanwhile, surged again, adding 1.9 per cent to €75.30. European shares advanced, despite a decline in tech stocks after Oracle released disappointing results in the US. The blue-chip Stoxx 50 was up 0.8 per cent while the pan-European Stoxx 600 added 0.5 per cent. The big names in European banking gained, led by Spain’s BBVA, which jumped by 2.3 per cent. Its domestic competitor Santander also moved higher, while Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo, the Netherlands’ ING Groep, and France’s BNP Paribas all added between 1.6 per cent and 2.1 per cent. Utilities stocks slid, dragged lower by a more than 6 per cent drop in Spain’s Naturgy Energy after BlackRock ⁠sold a 7.1 per cent stake in the Spanish gas utility for around 1.7 billion euros. After Oracle’s disappointing results reignited concerns about an artificial intelligence investment bubble, European tech shares also dipped. Germany’s SAP and Infineon fell by 0.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively, and Dutch chipmaker ASML dipped 0.5 per cent. UK shares were subdued, with both the blue-chip FTSE 100 and mid-cap FTSE 250 indices eking out modest gains. Healthcare ⁠stocks on the FTSE 100 added momentum, with AstraZeneca up 0.5 per cent and ConvaTec adding 1.7 per cent. Miners also gained, tracking a rise ‍in copper prices. In line with trends across Europe, stocks linked to the economic cycle performed well, with the big UK banks all advancing. Barclays gained 1.1 per cent, while Lloyds and NatWest Group also inched higher. Retail stocks were weaker, with Next losing 0.8 per cent, while Frasers dipped by a further 1 per cent after Mike Ashley pledged around £670 million (€765 million) worth of shares in the group as collateral for an HSBC loan. Two of Wall Street’s three main indices were on track to fall on Thursday as some of the world’s biggest tech stocks dipped after Oracle plunged 14 per cent. Fresh concerns about Oracle’s sizeable outlay on artificial intelligence largely overshadowed the Fed’s decision to cut rates again, after the tech giant published quarterly forecasts that fell short of analyst expectations. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell by around 1 per cent, putting it on pace for its biggest decline in more than a month. The S&P 500, meanwhile, fell by 0.5 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent. Caution toward AI heavyweights persisted, with Nvidia down by around 3.5 per cent amid Magnificent Seven losses. Among others, Walt Disney gained 2 per cent after the streaming firm said it would make a $1 billion (€850 million) equity investment in OpenAI. AI ‌bubble concerns also hurt crypto stocks such as Strategy, which lost 3.3 per cent, and Bit Digital, which fell 3.1 per cent as bitcoin briefly slipped below $90,000. – Additional reporting: Bloomberg, Reuters Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Crypto for Advisors: Tokenization Trends

You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. In today’s "Crypto for Advisors" newsletter, Harvey Li from Tokenization Insights takes us through tokenization trends, money market funds, and institutional adoption as we head into 2026. Then, in "Ask an Expert," Michael Sena looks at what it means for investors with BlackRock’s announced plans to tokenize everything from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to real estate. - Sarah Morton Tokenization entered a new phase in 2025. What started as an experiment is now becoming a functional part of institutional infrastructure, led by banks and asset managers who aren’t waiting for a tokenized future — they’re building it. One specific product category has emerged as the clear front-runner: tokenized money market funds (MMFs). Tokenized MMFs are quickly becoming the core on-chain liquidity instrument for institutions, treasurers, and sophisticated funds. They bridge traditional short-term U.S. Treasury exposure with digital settlement, programmable workflows, and real-time portability. Growth is real: And institutions are incorporating tokenized MMF into businesses: Momentum is building, but the real story is what comes next in 2026. 1. Regulatory validation and collateral eligibility The Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC)Global Markets Advisory Committee recommended tokenized MMFs as eligible collateral, and Acting Chair Caroline Pham launched a dedicated initiative in late 2025 to advance tokenized collateral adoption. If tokenized MMFs become approved as eligible margin collateral, recognized for cleared derivatives, swaps, and repo and embedded into CCP and FCM rulebooks, then tokenized MMFs evolve from a cash-parking tool into core institutional collateral, the same category that fuels trillions in daily financing today. This is a major unlock for banks, brokers, hedge funds, and trading venues that need intraday settlement and programmable liquidity. 2. The “institutional legitimacy” moment Seventy institutions, including State Street, Fnality, Franklin Templeton, and UBS, contributed to Global Digital Finance’s November 2025 report and demonstrated that tokenized MMFs can be: 3. The rise of tokenized cash rails at major banks Until recently, tokenized MMFs could only be redeemed via traditional banking rails or stablecoins. That is changing quickly. In 2025, we saw: As tokenized cash rails mature, institutions will be able to move tokenized MMF to tokenized deposit and settlement cash within the same ecosystem, with no friction and no conversion back to legacy payment rails or stablecoins. That is the moment when tokenized MMFs stop being a crypto-adjacent product and become digital liquidity management blocks for institutions. 4. Regulatory momentum for U.S.D and EUR stablecoins While tokenized institutional cash rails are rapidly expanding, stablecoin policy and legislation are helping stablecoins become the default cash rail for public permissionless space: Once these frameworks settle and SMEs become more comfortable with leveraging stablecoins for cash purposes, tokenized money market funds naturally become the yield, collateral, treasury, and portfolio cash solution. The direction of travel is clear. Cash that used to sit in bank accounts or legacy MMF portals is now being re-packaged into programmable instruments that plug directly into digital asset rails, and tokenized money market funds are becoming the cash management and collateral solution for all tokenized cash forms: tokenized bank deposits, deposit tokens and stablecoins. 2025 was the breakout year for tokenized money market funds as an asset class.2026 looks to be the acceleration phase, when tokenized MMFs become a standard treasury, settlement, and collateral asset for institutions. - Harvey Li, founder, Tokenization Insight Q: Traditionally, U.S. ETFs follow Wall Street’s market hours and settle through their clearing houses. What are the benefits and hurdles BlackRock’s investors will face in terms of round-the-clock trading? A: 24/7 trading will change everything from staffing to risk management. When markets never close, it changes the way you need to operate. The benefits of real-time markets means that those who can react first will be able to capture the bulk of moves in asset prices. Q: The tokenized asset market is still insignificant compared to the trillion-dollar U.S. ETF industry. How will BlackRock’s participation contribute to the tokenization ecosystem? A: BlackRock’s massive asset portfolio will instantly increase the overall value represented by the tokenized ecosystem. More than that, it brings credibility to all types of blockchain-based assets beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Q: BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, has been bullish on asset tokenization and wants to tokenize almost every traditional asset. Is tokenization a move to extend better services to investors or maintain its hegemony as the largest asset manager? A: BlackRock clearly sees the future of tokenized assets and all the benefits they bring: reduced operational overhead, increased efficiency, and more trust. Most of a large asset manager’s business isn’t in front-facing markets, but is in clearing, settlement, and other types of back and middle office operations.

It says a lot about the ever-bullish outlook of Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood that she predicted bitcoin to reach $1.2 million by 2030, and it was, in fact, a downgrade. This feature is a part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2025 list. Cathie Wood made her forecast for BTC's price in November 2025, slightly revising the target down from $1.5 million based on the explosive rise of stablecoins, which she claimed may usurp some of bitcoin's value as a transactional instrument. Her impact on cryptocurrency goes beyond her notoriously bullish predictions, however. Ark's spot bitcoin ETF, which it listed in partnership with 21Shares, is the third-largest such product in the U.S. behind only the runaway market leaders provided by asset management giants BlackRock and Fidelity. Wood's optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency industry is evident in the holdings of some of Ark's largest ETFs. The firm’s $8.4 billion Innovation ETF counts crypto exchange Coinbase among its largest holdings, as do two of Ark's other largest ETFs by net assets. The initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2025 of stablecoin issuer Circle and crypto exchange Bullish (the parent company of CoinDesk) also prompted sizeable investments by Ark. Through its ETFs, Ark and, by extension, Wood, who also holds the role of chief investment officer (CIO), may represent a North Star for understanding which disruptive technologies are likely to provide the most lucrative high-growth plays.

Title: Climate Skeptics Rush to Misuse Texas v. BlackRock
URL: https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2025/12/11/climate-skeptics-rush-to-misuse-texas-v-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-12-11T14:06:37Z
Full Content:
Texas v. BlackRock (E.D. Tex.) (BlackRock), a case in which 11 states claim that the institutional-investor defendants colluded to profit through coordinated output reductions at coal companies they partially owned, remains in its early stages, with discovery continuing through 2027. Already however, opponents of climate-risk mitigation have rushed to extract specious theories of antitrust harm from Judge Kernodle’s partial denial of the motion to dismiss (the BlackRock MTD decision). Following procedural requirements, Judge Kernodle took as true plaintiffs’ allegations that the BlackRock defendants joined climate alliances and pursued related mitigation goals that “necessarily result in the reduction of coal output.” Judge Kernodle also found plausible plaintiffs’ allegations of antitrust harm to consumers, as reflected in rising prices during a period of decreased production by the relevant coal companies. Judge Kernodle did note that BlackRock may possess a valid defense to these allegations, stemming from long-term declines in coal consumption. But interests aligned with the BlackRock plaintiffs already have assembled a house-of-cards antitrust argument that any institutional investor factoring climate risk into its business decisions should face heightened scrutiny on routine portfolio acquisitions. A neutral analysis of the BlackRock MTD decision does not justify imposing such legal burdens, which would hinder these investors’ capacity to compete against their climate-indifferent rivals. This post seeks to clarify: (1) why the BlackRock MTD decision remains far from proclaiming institutional investors’ every climate consideration a proven anticompetitive output reduction; and (2) why institutional investors’ “solely for investment” exemption from antitrust scrutiny still permits these investors to promote a wide range of climate-risk mitigation measures. The BlackRock complaint contains multiple antitrust claims. The plaintiffs assert violations under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, claiming each defendant used its partial ownership of coal companies in a manner reasonably likely to reduce competition, to consumers’ detriment. Plaintiffs also assert violations under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, claiming defendants collectively agreed to coerce the coal companies’ implementation of a coordinated output reduction (reducing coal supply in order to intensify demand, raise prices, and boost profit margins). And Plaintiffs assert violations under state antitrust laws (not covered by this blog post). Judge Kernodle’s MTD dismissal notes that the Texas complaint’s “first of its kind” allegation of a “horizontal agreement among investors to pressure competitors in another industry to reduce output” [italics in original] does not call for per se antitrust analysis (an approach which assumes the anticompetitive harms of a given activity, and only considers whether defendants engaged in that activity). Instead, the court will conduct an elaborate rule-of-reason balancing, to “divin[e] the procompetitive or anticompetitive effects” of these defendants’ business arrangements. Judge Kernodle makes clear that “weighty economics questions” remain to be resolved in later stages of litigation. Those questions will likely focus on defining an appropriate market to measure the competitive effects of defendants’ actions, determining whether plaintiffs have persuasively pinpointed how defendants’ actions harmed competition in these markets, and assessing defendants’ claims of procompetitive benefits. To scrutinize antitrust defendants’ effects on competition, courts typically first define a particular market in which the purported harm occurred or might occur. Judge Kernodle’s MTD dismissal notes that defendants did not contest “at this stage” of litigation the plaintiffs’ proposed focus on the markets for South Powder River Basin coal, and thermal coal. Yet defendants may have good reason to contest these market definitions at subsequent stages. Consideration of a broader market (one encompassing a wide range of energy sources that satisfy the relevant consumers’ needs) could allow defendants to argue that modernization and diversification of product options in order to meet shifting economic conditions (such as mounting climate risk), have not, on balance, harmed energy consumers. By extension, defendants might call into question the status of coal-company output decisions as a but-for cause of consumer harm, by pointing to across-the-board price increases for a diverse array of energy products. Alternately, if defendants could show that rising coal prices coincided with increased demand for substitutable energy products (such as renewable power, nuclear power, and/or natural gas), this also may weaken the plaintiffs’ claims of harm to consumers or to competition. The BlackRock plaintiffs will face additional challenges meeting their burden of persuasion as this case progresses. The defendants only need to poke holes in plaintiffs’ theory of harm. The defendants might start, for example, from plaintiffs’ argumentative reliance on: “different responses…exhibited by…publicly held companies…whose shares Defendants acquired and who cut their output during a period of rising prices…and…privately held companies, who raised their output.” This facile comparison between publicly and privately owned coal companies looks easily contestable. The plaintiffs must convince the court that broader economic trends would not have prompted these same disparities between public and private coal companies’ output. But given the escalating societal concerns and conspicuous financial risks associated with an emissions-intensive energy source like coal, public companies’ greater susceptibility to reputational costs (alongside their added disclosure obligations) may incentivize such categorical differences in output. That certainly offers a simpler account than the elaborate conspiracy plaintiffs allege, in which institutional investors promised transformational clean-tech innovations, pushed for robust emissions reporting while faking their focus on climate mitigation, and cynically captured inflated profits by peddling dirty fuels. The BlackRock plaintiffs also advance tenuous antitrust causation claims through their frequent conflations of defendants’ alleged coal-reduction, emissions-reduction, and net-zero pledges. This misapplies antitrust’s output-reduction concerns to restraints on firms’ negative externalities (greenhouse-gas byproducts), rather than on their supplying of economic goods (carbon-based energy sources). To date, Judge Kernodle has taken as true plaintiffs’ assertion that a pledge to reduce coal emissions “necessarily means cutting coal production because ‘there is no realistic path for a coal company to cut coal emissions other than by cutting production.’” Yet regardless of whether one doubts the fossil-fuel industry’s pledges of near-term clean-coal deployment, we consider it unlikely that a merits-stage court analysis would give the plaintiffs’ brusque, future-oriented pronouncement of “no realistic path” much factual weight in proving present market harms. We likewise find it ironic that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has signed off (both as a licensed attorney, and as an accountable public official) not only on this sweeping denial of clean-coal boosterism, but also on a recent letter celebrating President Trump’s “BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL” [capitalization in original] agenda. Nor do AG Paxton’s questionable claims stop there. In fact, the BlackRock complaint comes closest to demonstrating an agreement to reduce coal output (rather than to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions) by repeatedly misrepresenting plaintiffs’ own evidence on this topic. For but one example, the complaint brazenly cherry-picks from a Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) document, so that NZAM appears to call on its members (including each BlackRock defendant) to “immediately ceas[e] all financial or other support to coal companies…building new coal infrastructure.” Yet plaintiffs fail to disclose that the cited NZAM document does not require this particular approach. The approach is one of five climate-mitigation strategies that NZAM signatories are expected to choose from (other options include a “phase out” of thermal-coal investments on an unspecified timeline, or “restricting financing for unabated coal power generation, i.e. without carbon capture and storage”). Judge Kernodle’s MTD decision, in turn, cites this NZAM quotation in multiple passages, at times reading it as an express NZAM requirement, rather than as a nonbinding option. Later stages of litigation will allow defendants to question whether membership in a climate alliance that permits an open-ended “phase out” of coal investments has evidentiary value in a lawsuit claiming real-world market effects between 2019 and 2022—and whether plaintiffs established that evidence in bad faith. Former Congressmember (and ranking Republican on the House of Representatives’ Antitrust Subcommittee) Ken Buck has catalogued further ways in which “the facts dispute the allegations,” including: no relevant coal-company manager being removed by proxy vote during the complaint’s timeframe; certain defendants never voting against a single director; and purportedly colluding defendants consistently voting differently from each other. Should plaintiffs navigate these impediments to presenting a persuasive causal chain that culminates in anticompetitive effects, they still will need to address defendants’ procompetitive defenses. Multiple procompetitive rationales for corporate climate pledges present themselves, particularly for pledges to reduce emissions. To begin with, given regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. on coal emissions, as well as increasingly strict greenhouse-gas regimes in other advanced economies, reducing industry emissions (especially through lower emissions intensity) may facilitate continued coal production, under whatever constraints the industry finds itself facing. Moreover, the net-zero commitments in this case’s climate pledges need not even commit a signatory to reduced coal emissions (let alone reduced coal output), since by definition “net-zero” calculations balance GHG additions to, and removals from, the atmosphere (with possibilities for offsets). Defendants also may argue that collective emissions pledges improve the quality of each investor firm’s offerings, and follow antitrust law on standard-setting by “encourag[ing] competition with cleaner, more innovative, or more transparent products.” Along related lines, the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission’s (the Antitrust Agencies) statement-of-interest filing on the BlackRock MTD sets the stage for a green-transition procompetitive defense, particularly in investment markets: “an institutional investor…could advocate in favor of the business in which it owns…stock to exit one market in favor of another, more profitable market [and] could even pressure the management of the firm to undertake such a transition [so long as this transition] would reduce output in the first market in service of achieving higher profits in another.” This logic leaves ample room for institutional-investor defendants with substantial coal holdings to persuade the court that they did not seek to self-destruct by advocating a net-zero transition—but instead to increase profits (and improve their own investment products) by calling for energy-sector innovation that better fits evolving economic circumstances. Amid these daunting challenges still faced by the BlackRock plaintiffs, climate denialists already have doubled down on dubious antitrust rationales for stifling emissions-mitigation and disclosure initiatives. The “woke alert” advocacy organization Consumers’ Research, for example, sent a September letter to the Antitrust Agencies, celebrating Judge Kernodle’s “vindicat[ion]” of the agencies’ BlackRock statement, which primarily argued that defendants overstated antitrust law’s exemption from Section 7 scrutiny, provided to stock acquisitions made “solely for investment.” Consumers’ Research highlights the Antitrust Agencies’ assertion that “an investment is not ‘solely for investment’ if an investor has an intent to use stock to influence significantly or control management of the target firm.” Yet from this measured premise, Consumers’ Research mischaracterizes many reasonable business efforts to reduce climate risk as suspicious “mixed motive” practices demanding enhanced antitrust scrutiny. These suspect practices would include: an institutional investor’s public statement encouraging clarity in corporations’ greenhouse-gas reduction targets; an institutional investor’s voting of shares against incumbent directors who fail to pursue net-zero alignment; and even an investor’s mere vote for annual emissions disclosures like those increasingly required in most advanced economies. This legal pivot from anticompetitive harms and managerial control (in the Antitrust Agencies’ statement), to a much broader array of climate-minded “business decisions,” would vastly restrict the shareholder rights of institutional investors and their clients, while harming competition in investment markets by capriciously targeting firms that engage in broad categories of risk analysis. By contrast, the Antitrust Agencies’ BlackRock statement offered multiple indications that “conferring with directors and management on best practices for…oversight processes,” or using “investment holdings and market status to influence or change…public reporting practices,” does not inevitably depart from Section 7 solely-for-investment standards. Rather, these actions confirm the “critical role in corporate governance matters” played by institutional investors. Subsequent rounds of the Texas v. BlackRock litigation hopefully will clarify that such investors need not sit on their hands as the world burns.

Title: BlackRock’s move into Ethereum staking signals a brutal new fee regime that mid-tier operators won’t survive

BlackRock’s filing raises questions on slashing risk, custody waterfalls and yield passthrough. We chart three scenarios for fees and liquidity. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock filed for a staking-enabled Ethereum (ETH) trust on Dec. 5, which reframes the question of what kind of risk stack institutional investors will accept. The document outlines a structure that requires allocators to price three distinct failure modes simultaneously. First, protocol-level slashing penalties can hit the trust's vault account with no guarantee of full recovery. Second, a multi-entity custody arrangement where a trade credit lender holds first-priority liens over trust assets and can liquidate positions if credits aren't repaid on time. Third, a variable yield stream in which the sponsor controls how much ether is staked versus held in liquid form, creating a direct tension between the trust's redemption needs and the sponsor's staking-related fees. The filing seems like a bet that institutional buyers will treat Ethereum validator risk the way they've learned to treat counterparty risk in prime brokerage: as manageable, diversifiable, and worth paying someone else to monitor. BlackRock plans to stake 70% to 90% of the trust's ETH through “provider-facilitated staking,” selecting operators based on uptime and slashing history. The S-1 acknowledges that slashed assets are debited directly from the vault and that any compensatory payments from providers may not fully cover losses. The language leaves open how much residual risk investors ultimately absorb and whether the sponsor would cut staking levels materially if validator risk climbs. That matters because slashing doesn't hurt through the raw ETH destroyed, but through the second-order behavior it triggers. An isolated slashing event is written off as an operator-quality problem, while a correlated slashing event, such as a client bug that takes down validators across multiple providers, becomes a system-trust problem. Exit queues lengthen because Ethereum's validator churn is rate-limited. Liquid staking tokens can trade at steep discounts as holders scramble for immediate liquidity while market makers pull back. Institutional allocators are demanding clearer indemnities, proof of multi-client failover, and explicit backstops, which are pushing fees higher and separating “institutional-grade” operators from everyone else. The custody structure adds another layer. The trust routes assets through an ETH custodian, a prime execution agent, and a trade credit lender, with the option to move to an additional custodian if needed. To secure trade credits, the trust grants a first-priority lien over both its trading and vault balances. If a credit isn't repaid on time, the lender can seize and liquidate assets, burning through the trading balance first. The dynamic creates a claim-priority question in fast markets: who gets paid when, and what happens if service relationships are restricted or terminated? The filing notes that insurance programs may be shared across clients rather than dedicated to the trust, which weakens the comfort level for large allocators. Settlement timing adds friction. Moving ETH from the vault to the trading balance occurs on-chain to prevent network congestion from delaying redemptions. That's not theoretical, as Ethereum has seen periodic gas spikes that would bottleneck large fund flows. On yield, the trust will distribute staking consideration net of fees at least quarterly, but the exact fee split remains redacted in the draft filing. The S-1 flags a conflict of interest: the sponsor earns more when staking levels run higher, but the trust needs liquidity to meet redemptions. There's no guarantee of rewards, and past returns don't predict future ones. The filing implicitly prices three scenarios, each with different effects on validator fees and liquidity. Under normal operations, staking looks boring. Exit queues stay manageable, withdrawals happen on schedule, and liquid staking tokens trade near fair value with small discounts that reflect general risk appetite. Additionally, operator fees stay tight as providers compete on uptime, client diversity, and reporting quality rather than charging explicit insurance premiums. Reputation and operational diligence drive pricing more than tail risk. A minor, isolated slashing event nudges the equilibrium but doesn't break it, causing only a small direct economic loss. Some providers quietly rebate fees or absorb the hit to preserve institutional relationships, and demand drifts toward higher-assurance operators. The result is a modest fee dispersion between top-tier and mid-tier setups. Liquid staking token discounts might widen briefly, but liquidity mechanics stay smooth. The effect typically fades within days or weeks unless it exposes deeper operational flaws. A major, correlated slashing event resets risk pricing entirely, and institutional allocators demand stronger multi-client diversification, proof of failover, and explicit slashing backstops. The best-capitalized or most trusted operators gain pricing power and can charge higher fees. Exit queues lengthen because Ethereum limits the number of validators who can leave per epoch. Liquid staking tokens trade at deep discounts as holders chase immediate liquidity and market makers protect themselves against uncertain redemption timing and further losses. The system can appear liquid on paper while feeling illiquid in practice. Confidence and pricing can take weeks to months to normalize, even after the technical issue resolves. A staked Ethereum ETF will likely operate in the “normal-ops” regime most of the time, but the market will embed a small haircut into its staking yield to account for tail risk. That haircut widens in a major slashing scenario due to both lower expected net yields and a higher liquidity premium demanded by investors. The question isn't whether BlackRock can execute the mechanics, but whether the structure shifts enough demand toward “institutional-grade” staking to create a new fee tier and liquidity regime. If it does, the validators who win institutional flows will be the ones who can credibly price and manage correlated risk, not just run nodes reliably. The losers will be mid-tier operators who can't afford the insurance, reporting infrastructure, or client diversification that allocators will start requiring. Wall Street will pay for Ethereum yield if someone else owns the operational and protocol risk.

Title: So Trump Seized A Venezuelan Oil Tanker?

Excuse me, what in the Somali pirate?! Donald John Trump, commander in chief of these United States, claimed on Wednesday that the US Coast Guard has seized a Venezuelan oil tanker. And the US is going to keep the oil! And he’ll do it again! Was the oil tanker full of liquefied fentanyl it was coming to squirt on the US? No! Was it engaging in hostilities? No again. It was full of oil from PDVSA, Venezuela’s state-owned facilities, chugging between Venezuela and Cuba, reportedly en route to Asian oil brokers. Seems Trump has now forgotten all about that fake “fentanyl” pretense now. Subscribe to Wonkette for all your WARBLOGGING needs! It sounds like legit privateering and not piracy though. The ship called the Skipper had been sanctioned for moving Iranian oil, and a federal judge had approved a warrant for its seizure a few weeks ago. Joe Biden also seized a tanker, in 2023. But a big difference is that that one was actually full of Iranian oil. And this one is full of Venezuelan oil. So why does the US get to seize all the oil too? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Anyway, Pam Bondi posted video on X. The oil boat maybe went to Iran before, so this is just fine? And an unnamed official claimed to the New York Times that the vessel was sailing under the flag of another Latin American nation in which it was not registered. If true, that is just like Russia has allegedly done at least 133 times that we know of to evade sanctions! But Trump would never dare. What has Trump ever gotten from NATO? Where is his Trump Tower Paris? Watch his baloney hole, if you can stand it: An interesting day, from the standpoint of news. “As you probably know, we have just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually, and other things are happening.” Trumptannia rules the waves! He does not sound all there. And oh hey, are we ever going to get video of those bombing survivors getting murdered, like Trump said? What about these Asian oil brokers, does he plan to pay them anything for bogarting their delivery? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ But Trump’s not taking the well-worn path America has usually taken to remove South American dictators! Coups and installing a puppet would be traditional, being much cheaper, faster and cleaner than murdering random innocent-until-proven-guilty people on tiny boats in international waters off of the coast (many who have turned out to not even be Venezuelan at all) in hopes that the dictator presidente will then step down out of sympathy, or something. But seems Trump doesn’t just want a new partner at the top, he wants a different sort of package entirely, details TBD. He seems particularly focused on the seas, in addition to the oil that will be a “field day” for American companies, obviously. Venezuela may not be a significant source of drugs to America, but being at the tippy-top of South America, it is one of the busiest waypoints for cocaine and heroin in the world, and is one of the busiest container ports for other goods, too, including oil. Money comes in, oil, opiates and heroin go out, that’s what running a port is all about! Why would Trump want a mere puppet, when he could occupy it all, and Venezuela will pay for it? Throw in collecting a toll at the Panama Canal, and Trump and friends like BlackRock could do grifts the likes of which the world has never seen, from most of the ship traffic in the hemisphere! But why won’t these unnamed White House sources specify what the plan is for after deposing Nicolás Maduro? A new election? Edmundo González, the apparent winner of the 2024 vote, returning from exile in Spain? Maybe Congress should try harder to find out. That vote on War Powers would be nice, too. Meanwhile, Americans are not fucking interested in whatever Trump’s got going on. In a CBS/YouGov poll a few weeks ago, only one in five had even heard that there was a military buildup in the first place. (These voters today, with their TikToks and their algorithms!) Once informed, two-thirds of Republicans said Trump needs to explain his actions. Independents were especially pissed, with 86 percent demanding an explanation. And 70 percent of all respondents opposed any kind of military action down there. What next in the old man’s all-to-real reality gameshow? Stay tuned, it’s sure to be full of more surprises!

Title: Trump Administration Joins EU in Russian Frozen Asset Madness

Time Published: 2025-12-11T11:52:15Z
Full Content:
The level of derangement among far too many of our putative betters has reached such a fever pitch that mere narcissism and grandiosity seem inadequate as explanations. The latest example comes via the Wall Street Journal, in an exclusive account as to how the Trump Administration intends to avail itself of Russian central bank frozen assets, with the fig leaf that of course Russia would go along to curry favor with Trump and because investing in a busted up country is clearly a fabulous commercial opportunity. Let us not forget that the US tried a more adult version of this plan and got nowhere. It hired BlackRock as an adviser to flog a Ukraine reconstruction fund,1 back the days when the tale that Ukraine would win the war seems much more plausible, and got nowhere. The interesting angle here is that the US has pitched this goofy idea to EU officials, since they control the bulk of the frozen Russian central bank assets which has been reported most recently as €140 billion or more worth in Euroclear.2 Mind you, the Europeans, in the persons of European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, and her allies in planned Russian asset heist like Emmanuel Macron, Kier Starmer, Frederich Merz, and Kaja Kallas, are as deluded, but less flamboyantly so, since they are having to labor mightily to paint a veneer of legality over a theft that puts the budgets of EU member states in peril. Part of von der Leyen’s scheme is grandly to apportion liability to each and every member state that is made to participate in this heist, even if it is fiercely opposed. But back to the more obviously bonkers Trump plan. The Journal account suggests that the Trump plan to use Russia frozen assets in a US managed “fund” for Ukraine reconstruction, which was part of leaked 28 points plan, has set off the frenzy in European capitals to grab them pronto, before the US and Russia can come to an agreement….as if that were at all likely. From U.S. Blueprint to Rewire Economies of Russia, Ukraine Sets Off Clash With Europe: The Trump administration in recent weeks has handed its European counterparts a series of documents, each a single page, laying out its vision for the reconstruction of Ukraine and the return of Russia to the global economy… The U.S. blueprint has been spelled out in appendices to current peace proposals that aren’t public but were described to The Wall Street Journal by U.S. and European officials. The documents detail plans for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap roughly $200 billion of frozen Russian assets for projects in Ukraine—including a massive new data center to be powered by a nuclear plant currently occupied by Russian troops. Let’s stop here. The Zaporzhizhia nuclear power plant is not merely “currently occupied”. It is in one of the four oblasts that voted to join Russia and Russia, per its constitution, has made part of Russia. There is simply no way that the West is going to get use of it on anything other than arms-length commercial terms. Any discussion of power or reconstruction of Ukraine generally ignore the fact that no one other than Russia can execute it. Recall that Russia has already done considerable damage to not just Ukraine electricity transmission but increasing to generation as well. Ukraine’s grid runs on old Soviet standards, as does Russia now. Western businesses simply are not going to set up production capacity to make want amounts to a very large special order of the needed repair and replacement kit. Russian firms are in that business and could be persuaded or induced to gear up for the needed big but time-limited output surge. And of course there is the overriding highly optimistic assumption, that there will be an economically and politically independent Ukraine after the war. Ukraine and the EU are laboring mightily to make sure that does not happen. Their continued intransigence and belligerence have made the case to a highly risk-averse Putin that Russia will have to dictate outcomes on the battlefield. So the only question is how much Russia decides it has to add to Russia versus make into a rump Ukraine overseen by a friendly regime. Back to the Journal: Another appendix offers America’s broad-strokes vision for bringing Russia’s economy in from the cold, with U.S. companies investing in strategic sectors from rare-earth extraction to drilling for oil in the Arctic, and helping to restore Russian energy flows to Western Europe and the rest of the world. This is the worst sort of arrogant paternalism, as if Russia still needed the West. The quiet scandal in global economics: From 2008 to 2025, Russia’s real GDP per capita grew faster than Germany, the UK, and France despite sanctions, SWIFT bans, export controls, frozen assets and a full-scale geopolitical confrontation. pic.twitter.com/0C7ijjrCcc — . (@Lucid_Watcher) December 5, 2025 But not to worry, the Journal reassures us that Russia really is hurting: A new assessment by a Western intelligence agency, reviewed by the Journal, said that Russia has technically been in recession for six months and that the challenges of running its war economy while trying to control prices are presenting a systemic risk to its banking sector. One has to assume the Russian negotiators were also informed about this scheme (a version of this idea, but perhaps less detailed, was to be respectfully receptive when the US presented this asset, erm, usage plan, as opposed to bursting out laughing, or alternatively getting angry over being presumed to be total chumps. Returning to the Journal: Some European officials who have seen the documents said they weren’t sure whether to take some of the U.S. proposals seriously. One official compared them to President Trump’s vision of building a Riviera-style development in Gaza. Another, referring to the proposed U.S.-Russia energy deals, said it was an economic version of the 1945 conference where World War II victors divvied up Europe. “It’s like Yalta,” he said. Readers are encouraged to opine, but given the early similarly high-handed-while-also-barmy Ukraine “raw earths” scheme that the US browbeat Ukraine into accepting after some negotiation, yours truly thinks this is part of Team Trump following the Red Queen practice of working to believe impossible things. Such as: U.S. officials involved in the negotiations say Europe’s approach would quickly deplete the frozen funds. Washington, on the other hand, would tap Wall Street executives and private-equity billionaires to invest the money and expand the amount available to invest. One official involved in the talks said the pot could grow to $800 billion under American management. “Our sensibility is that we really understand financial growth,” the official said. Now to the European part. Ursula von der Leyen is attempting to ram through legislation that would allow the Commission to seize the frozen assets in Euroclear pursuant to emergency powers. Belgium has objected vociferously since it would be on the hook if Euroclear were sued successfully. The ECB has refused to provide a backstop: I asked ECB President Lagarde about the potential impact on financial stability of using Russian frozen assets held at Euroclear (140 billion). The ECB has (rightly) indicated that a guarantee would be a breach of the Treaty. Other options urgently needed for Ukraine👇 @wbeke pic.twitter.com/ih9j89n5GV — Dirk Gotink (@DirkGotink) December 3, 2025 Since Euroclear has also said in no uncertain terms that it thinks the asset heist, prettied up as trying to use the assets as collateral for loans, is illegal, I am not sure how it can be compelled to turn over the funds, given the general rule of “possession is 9/10 of the law” and the near-certainty that Euroclear and Belgium would seek an injunction too. ❗️Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever called the European Commission's proposal to use frozen Russian assets to provide Ukraine with a reparations loan “theft,” reports VRT NWS. “There are certainly better solutions than stealing the Russian central bank’s money. This is a… pic.twitter.com/KJR0mQWD5D — 🪖MilitaryNewsUA🇺🇦 (@front_ukrainian) December 10, 2025 Aside from Russia suing Euroclear in a non-EU court where Euroclear operates (readers can opine, but I see Singapore courts provide for discovery), Russia can also take matters into its own hands: One of the unintended consequences of the EU's batshit crazy plan of ̶s̶t̶e̶a̶l̶i̶n̶g̶ appropriating and repurposing Russia's frozen assets is the fact that Euroclear, a body responsible for processing equities, bonds, derivatives, and investment fund transfers, still holds… pic.twitter.com/6RHLDTpjEk — Nina 🐙 Byzantina (@NinaByzantina) December 10, 2025 But weirdly (or perhaps following its friends at the Commission) the Financial Times in a story yesterday tried to make Hungary’s Viktor Orban, regularly demonized for being too friendly with Russia, into the bad guy. From a Wednesday story: EU countries are to fast-track a decision to indefinitely immobilise up to €210bn in Russian sovereign assets, in an attempt to bypass Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán even before Europe’s leaders meet for a summit next week. The hurried effort to pass the legislation — which invokes emergency powers to override national vetoes on the extension of sanctions — aims to protect Brussels’ leverage in US-led peace talks over the war in Ukraine, according to officials familiar with the plans. Diplomats handling the legislation see advantage in moving swiftly in coming days to detach the contentious question of immobilising assets from the debate on raising loans for Kyiv backed by the frozen Russian funds. That funding question will be left to EU leaders next week. The move to vote within the coming week, overriding the principle of unanimity on sanctions decisions, risks enraging Hungary and other countries that oppose the measure. Past instances of EU countries outvoting other member states on critical issues — such as Poland and Hungary on migration policy — have caused bad blood between capitals for years. The European Commission last week proposed using €210bn of Russia’s foreign assets immobilised under sanctions in the EU to fund a loan to Kyiv, initially for €90bn that would be disbursed in the next two years. For the loan scheme to work, the underlying assets need to be immobilised indefinitely, rather than for six-month periods that can only be renewed with unanimous agreement of all EU27 countries… To bypass the risk of the sanctions being lifted, the commission has proposed using emergency powers reserved for dealing with economic crises to indefinitely impose the sanctions on the assets. Enacted under Article 122 of the EU’s treaties, it can be passed with just a majority of EU countries, circumventing potential vetoes. Mind you, there is no crisis. There will be a tsunami of litigation if the Commission and its allies manage to get this scheme implemented. And there would be a crisis due to their malfeasance if the plaintiffs were to prevail. So the plan is use emergency powers to contend with the emergency knowingly produced by entirely voluntary action decried by those best in the know (Euroclear) as illegal. Alexander Mercouris covered the circularity of this argument in his video on Wednesday, and earlier argued that the loud and clear objections by Euroclear and the Belgian government would be powerful ammo in litigation over any seizure attempt. As an aside, one has to think that a and perhaps the reason that Ursula von der Leyen has pursued this scheme so manically is that it is far and away her best opportunity to greatly expand the Commission’s powers. She’s been on a massive land grab ever since she took office. This morning’s Politico European newsletter seemed less bullish than the prior day pink paper account, and also corrected the barmy idea that Orban was the big baddie: GROUNDHOG DAY ENVOYS DISCUSS ASSETS SUPERFREEZE: EU ambassadors will today weigh up whether to hand the Commission emergency powers to keep Russia’s state assets frozen indefinitely. Envoys will examine updated legal texts after Wednesday’s inconclusive discussion, three EU diplomats told POLITICO’s Gregorio Sorgi. What’s that: The mechanism is a cornerstone of the Commission’s plan to mobilize €210 billion in frozen Russian assets for Ukraine — most of which are held by the Belgian-based Euroclear. It would overhaul the current system that compels EU countries to unanimously reauthorize the sanctions every six months. That means Kremlin-friendly countries such as Hungary and Slovakia would lose the power to release the sanctioned money with a simple no vote, leaving EU capitals on the hook to repay the loan to Russia. The light at the end of the tunnel: The diplomats said late Wednesday that the proposal could be “stripped down” in a bid to win Belgium’s support and adopt the plan by the end of the week. Hopefully. Yes, it’s still all about Belgium: PM Bart De Wever is holding out over concerns that Belgium could be financially exposed if the money needs to be repaid and has now asked for more safety nets. In an interview with VRT NWS Wednesday, De Wever even refused to rule out legal action if the EU moves ahead with seizing the assets… More stick than carrot: Europe’s strategy to sway Belgium may be to warn the kingdom that it could be treated like Hungary if it doesn’t come on board — with its diplomats, ministers and officials losing their voice around the EU table, reports Zoya Sheftalovich. The Politico entry contains this amusing section: . “No jurisdiction”: A legal memo circulated among diplomats Wednesday by law firm Covington & Burling rejects Belgium’s argument that it would face major legal retaliation from Russia. The four-page document says the risk of litigation is “minimal,” insisting Russia wouldn’t be able to challenge an EU reparations loan in the International Criminal Court or “any comparable international adjudicative body.” Legally-sophisticated readers know that if you look long enough, you can find a lawyer who will bless pretty much anything.3 And I don’t think of Covington as premier firm in financial or international litigation. I would have thought one of the top New York “white shoe” or London firms would be the go-tos on this topic. A ranking by Chambers of US firms alone for Disputes (International & Cross-Border) | Global of US firms confirms this notion, putting Covington well down on the list. I hope our expert commentariat will pipe up with their views. Even though von der Leyen and her fellow conspirators are laboring mightily to get her long-sought “seize not freeze” scheme across the line, note the Politico signposting: Groundhog Day. They are of the view this will be another episode of motion playing at progress. But even then, simply keeping the matter in play bolsters Zelensky domestically, as in continuing to keep alive the fantasy that there will be more money and weapons for Ukraine. European leaders are as committed as every to fighting to the last Ukrainian. _____ 1 BlackRock never committed to invest in this scheme, contrary to some claims. 2 The total amount reported has varied, in part because the EU has been stealing the interest, and some accounts may include the assets of sanctioned Russian entities and individuals along with the central bank holdings. The Financial Times on Wednesday reported that Euroclear held €185 billion of Russian frozen assets. 3 For instance, recall Linklaters blessing Lehman’s use of Repo 105 to engage in accounting fraud, which pretty much every legally responsible adult derided when it became public. Just a little quibble: “Ukraine’s grid runs on old Soviet standards, as does Russia now. Western businesses simply are not going to set up production capacity to make want amounts to a very large special order of the needed repair and replacement kit. Russian firms are in that business and could be persuaded or induced to gear up for the needed big but time-limited output surge.” Crazy but true: I happen to know for a fact that ABB (a company headquartered in Switzerland but production mostly in the EU) delivers huge amounts of electrical equipment to Russia. Supposedly the delivery is to Hungary or Switzerland. As an insider joke workers in Germany put a “Z” on deliveries to Russia. Mind you: industrial workers in Germany vote 50% for AFD. With a little modification anything produced for the European grid will also work in Russia. What do you mean by “electrical equipment”? That covers a multitude of sins. I have been told the reverse as far as the transformers are concerned. Ukraine was having to scavenge former Warsaw Pact states for replacements early in the electricity war. They would presumably not have needed to do so if they could be manufactured readily by friendlies. Apparently most utilities do have a lot of spares, they are pretty long-lived, so it may be only with the increased intensification of the grid attacks that Ukraine is now short on/out of gear. There are no transformers on the market. Not for Ukraine and not for anybody. Delivery times are in years. The reason being the expansion of the grid caused by renewables. ABB is delivering all kinds of electrical fuses. Which shows the Russian market is humming. Lot’s of building as a few hundred thousand soldiers from formerly depressed areas are getting huge payments for serving in Ukraine. When you look at Russia war you should look at Russia casualty rate. That will say how long Russia can continue this war until Russia people start feel pain. We also have to count how long can people afford 16% interested rate. I still don’t get how that central bank can still keep her job. Russia have lost about 100k soldiers and same amount of injured. All this spell Russia will accept USA peace deal but the only stopping it is Ukraine. Putin was wrong in his calculation that he would get a good deal from USA by dragging this war slowly Russia regards this war as existential. So your metrics do not apply. Look as WWII for how much pain Russia can take, This conflict is not in the same universe. I doubt that Russia could take as much pain as in WWII. Already 20 years ago every conscript was given a SIM card so he could phone home to mom once a week. Inconceivable in Stalin times. But Russia doesn´t have to take such pain. The “kontraktniki” are paid handsomely. There are no conscripts at the front. Another story is that it is the ethnic minorities and the poor (which mostly overlap) that are doing the dying. Not your single son of a middle class family in Moscow or St. Petersburg. Russia is closer to us than we think. Another story is that it is the ethnic minorities and the poor (which mostly overlap) that are doing the dying. Not your single son of a middle class family in Moscow or St. Petersburg. This is based on purposeful reading of the statistics, by comparing the percentage of kontraktniki of the eligible population of the region. In the reality, Moscow and St. Petersburg regions provide the bulk of the contract soldiers – as in several hundred thousand, just because they are so huge population centers. Especially after the liberation of the Kursk oblast the St. Petersburg region has constantly exceeded it’s recruitment quota. Also, at least a year or two ago, several Duma members, governors, mayors and other members of regional administration volunteered for the SMO. Mostly those with military experience, but anyway. You’re right this war is existential for Russia, and I think a lot of Russian people have come to that conclusion, including the young soldiers fighting on the front lines. But is the war being fought as if it were existential for Russia? In my view, no. Two strategies come to mind one where Putin forces the Russian population to accept a Minsk style peace deal, or another where Putin believes the West will eventually come to the negotiating table to agree on a new security arrangement. A new security deal won’t happen but Russia might be able to secure a Minsk 3 agreement with the USA However, the EU and the UK would never allow that to happen. This war will likely drag on until the Democrats return to power in the USA There’s no way the Republicans will hold onto the House or the Senate. So now you have an EU implementing austerity on steroids just so it can keep sending billions to Ukraine, and the USA doing the same. Scott Ritter said just a few days ago that Ukraine will collapse soon and its people will freeze but none of that really matters, because for Russia to capitalize on such a collapse, it would need the troops to actually take Ukraine. And right now, Russia doesn’t have those troops. Nor will the Ukrainian population rise up in support. Instead, everyone will either wait their turn to be sent to the front or try to escape the country. I just think people are struggling to accept what’s coming because it’s so unprecedented. I hope you’re right but sadly, I fear we’re heading toward a very dark place in this world. I may be wrong, but I think this is the consequence of the lesser evil strategy finally coming home to roost. These politicians in the west they have no morals. So US sued for peace after Antietam, I guess? All this spell … … differently in Cyrillic. They even have a word meaning non-agreement-capable*. * See for example https://www.moonofalabama.org/2022/06/how-russia-can-and-will-de-nato-size-europe.html The retaliatory response of Russia confiscating European assets would be an adequate deterrent to the theft of Russian funds if the EU leaders were sane, but that is a big if. If I were Belgium (things you never thought you’d write!), I would seize the Russian assets *and* European Commission assets to the same value as collateral for the indemnity *and* the Euroclear and SWIFT servers and IT personnel for long enough to place them under Belgian control. When the rules are broken, the rules are broken and all that counts is leverage. Remember poor Greece and its attempt to leave the Euro Hotel California? No leverage. But controlling Euroclear would give Belgium the next best leverage to controlling Target 2…. Since an ongoing fantasy about Russia is to crash Putin’s credibility in his home country, via tempting Putin to go along with US/European schemes, Trump’s home peanut gallery wants to pretend that Ukraine is close to victory… a song that is sung by the media (and arms merchants) that have played along for so long. After all, having pushed Ukraine into suicidal choices, don’t “we” the West owe Ukraine and ourselves some dignity amidst the rubble? Well, The Financial Times is not alone on demonizing Orban (no matter if he is good or bad I am not opining on this) put he is the preferred excuse for many to stay silent when in reality they do not align with the General Stupidity now in charge. Today I found an article written by a retired Spanish councelor for the EU titled “Europe and The Accounting Miracle of The Century: The “Reparation Loan” and Other Legal Fictions” (in Spanish) which explains the (false) equilibriums that the EU pursues to seize the Russian assets while at the same time claiming they are not touching them and at the same time assuming fiscal obligations for EU countries which are out of EU’s reach and treaties. This is all incredible stupid and there are many more governments (more than Just Orban’s) which are absolutely not wanting to become indebted for this unlimited support to Zelenski. I would mention the Spanish government even if they do not say it when being forced to reduce debt and at the same time being wanted to increase debt… because Zelenski. If somehow the EU Commission manages to force their financial games I anticipate this as the beginning of the end of the EU. I guess we will know by the 18th of December. The interesting angle here is that the US has pitched this goofy idea to EU officials, since they control the bulk of the frozen Russian central bank assets which has been reported most recently as 140 billion euros worth in Euroclear. The timing coming so soon after the Belgians took fright at the seizure means this is probably an effort to cajole them with a US blessing. Now the real question is: Is the EU/UK trying to bribe Trump to support the asset seizure, or in reality was the asset seizure a US lead directive all along? Sorry, this is an incorrect reading. 1. The US wants Russia to contribute Russian assets, not steal them, so there would be no risk to Brussels if Russia goes along. 2. The EU is opposed to this scheme. This is off point utterly to what the EU intends. It wants the money to be used to continue the war. Does anyone have figures for the Russian assets owned by US, European and other investors at the time of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? Many of which are now likewise frozen, and written down, but have great underlying value if not endangered by the proposed theft? The lack of discussion ofwhat is at stake for western investors (including pensioners & other indirect holders) seems extraordinary. I hate sounding harsh, but you are awfully late to that party. And you seem to be suggesting that was Russia that could or did take hostile action, when Russia bent over backwards in the early years of the SMO not to abrogate agreements with the West. For instance, Russia kept supplying the EU with gas until the EU made it a point of pride to go without. It was the US, EU and UK investors that imposed shock and awe sanctions in February 2022. Western owners of Russian securities and ETFs at the time were very shortly barred from trading. Their balances were written down to zero at US brokerage firms. Now there has been wrangling about recovery. For instance, the BlackRock Russia ETF is trying to complete its liquidation by year end. It last traded at $8.06 but I cannot tell quickly how much investors recovered: https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/239677/ishares-msci-russia-capped-etf#/ As a holder of Gazprom, Sberbank and Polyus, not only frozen and effectively zero, but getting none of the dividends as well. There was a point I believe, where sale at a huge discount was possible to a too big to fail bank that was allowed to keep access to the Moscow exchange. What Covington does a heck of lot of in Brussels is lobbying, esp. on behalf of tech giants. To my eyes, that’s what’s behind the stupid memo. Mutual hand-washing. Aha! Thanks! …Kaja Kallas, are as deluded, but less flamboyantly so, since they are having to labor mightily to paint a veneer of legality over a theft that puts the budgets of EU member states in jeopardy. Part of von der Leyen’s scheme is grandly to apportion liability to each and every member state that is made to participate in this heist, even if it is fiercely opposed. And Italy’s share of the estimated 185 billion euro at Euroclear would come to some 25 billion euro. YS: I add a couple-a edits, with your indulgence. First, I’ll add the polite word “jeopardy” instead of “pasticciaccio,” that is, omnishambles. Second, I’m reading here in Italy the figure of 185 billions euros parked at Euroclear, too, which may come from Financial Times (or another source). What is this current bout of tripping over one’s wee-wee to wreck things stemming from? As Yves Smith has consistently pointed out, as well as the other writers at Naked Capitalism, what we are now witnessing is elites running helter-skelter to try to cover up their complicity and criminality in the proxy war in Ukraine (one million dead Ukrainians, mainly men sent to the slaughter) and the genocide in Palestine (minimum acceptable estimate, in my not so humble opinion, is 400 000 slaughtered in the West Bank and Gaza). Here in Italy, the formidable philosopher Donatella di Cesare and ex-ambassador Elena Basile have been elaborating the same line of thinking. So we have a case of convergent evolution (take that, anti-Darwinists): Trump and von der Leyen are acting pretty much alike. The law is for the little people. Their carefully defined constitutional roles don’t matter anymore — what matters is our chance to witness their lust for power. Hmmm. I wonder if Dr. Guillotine’s marvelous invention can be trundled out for a double salami slicing. Or am I overestimating the severity of the symptom? (To which I will add in my argument for failed elites avoiding consequences Hillary Clinton’s recent spewings, Marco Rubio and resentments, the timeless Kaja Kallas, Pete Hegseth, Mark Rutte, and the thoroughly egregious Friedrich Merz.) PS: I am no fan of Vladimir Putin, but the line chart of GDP growth explains much. Not to be overlooked. Is Covington & Burling a premier firm in international litigation? And does their listing as a Band Four national firm on the Chambers list support that they are not? I don’t know who at Covington wrote the memo referenced above and I haven’t read the memo. That being said I worked at Covington as a litigator and at one of the higher ranked firms listed on the Chambers ranking for international litigation. I’ve also advised law firms about how to be recognized by Chambers, both as law firms and as individual attorneys (which Chambers also ranks). My overwhelming experience is that any firm mentioned by Chambers and many law firms not recognized by Chambers do very careful work, especially when litigation departments send memos about the law to clients. Covington has been around since 1919. If their lawyers write a memo that they think the risk of litigation is low because of lack of jurisdiction, there is a very high probability that there is at least a colorable argument supporting that conclusion. That doesn’t mean the conclusion in the memo will prove correct, but it is unlikely to be just made up to tell a client what it wants to hear. And there is no difference between a Band One firm and a Band Four firm in Chambers in this regard. Chambers has its quirks, but it’s people interview law firm clients as the basis of creating their rankings. If you are a band four firm nationally in a given practice area, that means you are in the top 10 to 15 firms in the whole country. That is a signal to in-house lawyers at large corporate law departments that you are very good in that practice area. Again I don’t know specifics about this particular memo, but it’s a stretch to conclude that a law firm just manufactured a legal opinion desired by a client because of its Chambers ranking. Band 4 out of 5 is low, not high, relative to the other big firms. It means they are in the running as a reasonable choice and might be good on a horses-for-course basis All the firms in the higher bands are above them. And the ranking was for what amounted to their international practice compared to other big US firms, not international litigation and not international financial service. As indicated there are very strong UK firms in international legal works, such as Freshfields in arbitration And I have been a Covington client, as in I retained them when I was head of M&A at Sumitomo. They are not all that strong in litigation. There are specialist firms (and not small ones, BTW) that are the killers in that field. You asked for the commentariat to provide perspective on your comment about Covington’s litigation prowess. So, I did. I understand that, based on your experience as a client of the firm, you weren’t that impressed. Suffice it so say that some folks have reached a different conclusion. Their litigation department has been recognized many times as an elite department. See, e.g.: https://www.cov.com/en/about/firm-honors None of this speaks directly to the specific memo that was referenced in the post above. I asked for reader experience. You did not indicate you had any as a client and instead tried to argue from the same link I provided. You did not even bother finding other sources that could perhaps be more germane. You are not in a position to judge Covington on any sort of comparative performance basis as an ex-employee. Chambers is limited, as I indicated, by covering only US law firms. My gut is London being a much more international finance center (and also having until recently been in the Union) would be more likely to have the best counsel for this sort of matter. I did not say I was not impressed. I was a client of Gene Ludwig, who I imagine you have heard of. I went to Covington rather than a NYC firm because I knew a Japanese bank would be way down the food chain for a white shoe NYC firm while Covington would (and did) value having Sumitomo as a client more than they would have. So I got a good seasoned M&A partner while with a NYC firm, I would be at risk of being fobbed largely off on a 5 year associate. I knew generally that what I needed ought to be within their capabilities. And they did a fine job on my particular matter. Being good in one area (negotiating a fairly simple but cross border M&A deal) does not extend to other areas. They ran up a huge and unwarranted bill on some international tax structuring, basically reinventing the wheel. The awards list you linked to prove my point, not yours. The awards were nearly all onesies, from years back and very narrow sub-fields of litigation. I have also had the privilege of sometimes working with top M&A and securities lawyers (the top M&A counsel at Cleary and Cravath, Rodgin Cohen at S&C before he became managing partner, for instance) and so know what a very top tier counsel looks like. And so I have also been lucky enough to occasionally find less illustrious representation that was excellent, such as a biomedical engineer who first worked at the NIH and drafted the first US intellectual property agreement. 80% of her language is still in use. Later general counsel at a public company, so both 3/4 of the way to being a securities lawyer as well as an IP lawyer. Drafting a bit rough but effective, and a fantastic negotiator. No you did not ask for reader experience with Covington, you asked “I hope our expert commentariat will pipe up with their views.” Well EnigmaWrappedInBacon piped up with their views. You may not agree with them but they did specifically what you asked and you jumped down their throat. Not to doubt your comment or Covington’s expertise, but Covington has represented Ukraine and Ukrainian companies in disputes with Russia. I assume they wrote the memo for Ukraine that wants reparations, not for Everclear or European companies or banks that might be on the hook if Covington’s opinion is wrong. No, please re-read the Politico quote. It was very clearly about the Euroclear fracas, see the reference to the ICC, which would never come up in a commercial dispute. In keeping, it also referenced the Russian state retaliating, not corporate entities. But that is another useful tidbit on Covington. Putting aside the fact that this whole scheme doesn’t make much sense, I could see a reason for Russia to go along with it (or at least not oppose it publicly). They’ve already likely written off those assets and if this works out to be a “free” card to play to deal with Trump, why not. It would also create even more conflict between the US and the EU because they both want the assets for their own goals. Alexander Mercouris has said the reverse, that informed contacts have told him it would suit Russia for the West to seize the assets because they could very legitimately make a monster stink, which would create more sympathy in the Global South. Recall that one big reason Russia has had to go slowly in the war is not just its practice of attrition (that is the big driver) but also that its economic allies are not happy with Russia gobbling up Ukraine, no matter how legitimate the reasons, and would prefer a negotiated settlement. The seizure would be further grist for the case that the West is untrustworthy, does not respect agreements, and there is therefore no sound basis for trying to reach a settlement with them. Tweets in May (with links to sites in Asia) said Russia was contemplating suing Euroclear in Hong Kong. See also: Euroclear has refused to comply with any plan to hand over frozen Russian assets for use by the EU. The company maintains that such a move would amount to confiscation, with major legal and financial risks, and insists it doesn’t have a procedure for it. https://t.co/myGzF8ZyNx — Nynke Feenstra (@DutchMindset) December 9, 2025 The seizure would be further grist for the case that the West is untrustworthy, does not respect agreements, and there is therefore no sound basis for trying to reach a settlement with them. The Western countries have been doing a bang-up job making this case themselves throughout their entire histories! Everyone from native Americans in the 1600s forward can help testify to this case if it’s needed. Ultimately, I don’t know because I don’t know what Russian officials are thinking. It’s just that using those assets to damage relations between the EU and the US could be a viable option. We’ve seen public statements threatening legal action (or worse) over EU confiscation, but nothing (yet?) about the US “proposal”. Maybe they just don’t take it seriously or maybe it suits Russia just fine to have the US and EU fighting over that money. Personally I have lost track of the number of loans that have been taken out using the interest of those frozen Russian assets as collateral. It was like every month a new loan like this was being made. So of course the Europeans will not allow those assets to be swiped by the Americans – nor will the Russians. About half would be used in repairing the damage in the Ukraine and a red line for Russia is “reparations.” The Russians will have to spend huge amounts of money to rebuild the Donbass alone. And if Donny thinks that the Russians will hand over one of their major power plants, well, America is more likely to hand over one of theirs to the Russians. I think that Jared Kushner had a big role to play in that so called peace plan as it tries to make sure that America in the end wins this conflict while making huge pots of money. for Trump and his team, it is always about making money and nothing else exists. Politico yesterday had the following explication: According to the document, the extra cash buffer [for Belgium] should be financed by the windfall profits that Euroclear collects in interest from a deposit account at the European Central Bank, where the Kremlin-sanctioned money is currently sitting. The proceeds amounted to €4 billion last year. The bulk of this revenue is currently being funneled to Ukraine to pay down a €45 billion loan from G7 countries, with Euroclear retaining a 10 percent buffer to cover legal risks. In order to better protect Euroclear, Belgium wants to raise this threshold over the coming years. So if Politico’s read of it is right, there is no “loan” backed by the interest on Russian assets. Rather, the interest is taken directly (legal mavens may chime in on whether this constitutes theft) to pay for some other extant obligation. To G7, so the Americans are getting some of that money too… That whole last paragraph is utterly fascinating. Starting with the fact that Euroclear is already building up a contingency reserve for “legal risks”, which is kind of telling in and of itself. Parenthetically. I know everyone’s been focused on the possibility of a lawsuit against Euroclear. I seem to recall the Russian government, possibly in the form of Lavrov, dropping an off-hand comment recently that European private companies still have several hundred billion euros worth of assets inside Russia. Meaning, a reciprocal action could be the seizure of these assets (I assume a majority of these are equity stakes in joint ventures or Russian subsidiaries). Yet it seems the European business community is utterly silent on the question, at least in public. Do they simply not want to admit that these assets still exist? Do they hope and pray that the Russians would exercise leniency and go after Belgium and Euroclear instead (which they very well might)? Is this simply yet another completely, utterly unexpected and thoroughly surprising move that no-one ever expects the Russians to make? Who knows… “Yet it seems the European business community is utterly silent on the question, at least in public.” This is a continuation of an attitude that the European business community adopted almost a decade ago. It was silent on the question of Brexit — despite all the evidence that the way the British government was mishandling matters would have devastating consequences (practical, commercial, financial). It was silent when the EU forced the renunciation of Russian energy imports (oil, gas, coal), and silent when Nord Stream pipelines were sabotaged — despite knowing very well the devastating consequences all this would entail regarding energy prices and the availability of raw materials for industrial processes. There was the supine way the EU reacted to the tariffs imposed by Trump, and no big outcry from the business community — if there was one, I do not remember it to be followed by concerted actions to put pressure on the EU Commission and on the European governments. Now it is again silent while the EU considers measures that will entail not only dire losses regarding investments in Russia, but also the ruin of Europe as an international financial centre (plus a possible collapse of the €). My opinion has always been that large, internationally active firms do not care — they will just relocate their activities somewhere else if conditions become unbearable; they do not have any loyalty to Europe anyway — while SMEs lack influence — they are too small to lobby successfully when governments only take big players seriously. But this is now going a bit far. No matter what foolishly destructive measures the politicos envision, industrial, commercial, and financial circles never put their foot down; it is getting very disconcerting. What I’m wondering is that in 2022 it was reported that most of those Russian assets were debt securities (likely Eurobonds), so basically IOUs by EU, not actual money. How much has this changed in a few years, I can’t seem to find out. Anyway, to me it seems that Eurozone countries not honoring their debts would cause even more economic havoc than just breaking the Euroclear and the kingdom of Belgium or the Russian countermeasures. High quality bonds are financial assets and easily monetized. I don’t understand your point. In general, large balances are put into securities. A bank deposit is a liability of the bank and is also not money. It’s guaranteed only up to very low limits. Depositaries like Euroclear and the US DTC (Depositary Trust Company) are full of securities, not cash balances. My point is that if we’re talking about debt owed to Russia by, say, EU Commission and some Eurozone countries, and they now go and decide they will just resell this debt and take the money, it’s not just theft of Russian assets, but also defaulting on the “original” debt. I really, really don’t know how this works (thus the word “wondering” in the original post), but if this is as I understood, would there really be market for bonds under such a serious legal predicament? And given the risk, I’d assume they’d have to be (re)sold with a significant undervaluation. No, Eurobonds are not “debt owed to Russia”. They are bonds that Russia bought. The EU Commission does not issue bonds. Nor does Europe. Eurobonds are issued both by companies, banks, and states. They are legal obligations to pay interest and principal irrespective of who owns them at the time. That is why seizing them from Euroclear = stealing. EU Commission indeed issues bonds. The European Commission is empowered by the EU Treaties to borrow from the international capital markets on behalf of the European Union. It is a well-established name in debt securities markets, with a strong track record of successful bond issuances over the past 40 years. All EU-Bond issuances executed by the European Commission are denominated exclusively in euro. The estimated value of the outstanding bonds is €1 trillion for the Commission alone. Another trillion of outstanding bonds has been issued by other EU institutions, according to CEPR. I expect that RU has long ago written off those frozen central bank assets (which is not to say that RU won’t litigate ferociously to get them back…..even if RU loses in court, the bad publicity surrounding the litigation might cause irreparable damage to the EU). Seizing and spending the stolen assets (assuming weapons and the trained UKR manpower to use them are readily available, which I very much doubt) will only serve to prolong the conflict for a few more months. The real issue here is the potential long-term consequence to the EU if Ursula succeeds in grabbing (and spending) RU’s money. I think the reputational damage will be enormous. Of course Ursula (et al) will be long gone by the time the legal chickens come home to roost (the wheels of justice grind slowly), so she likely doesn’t care. This does not bode well, methinks. No, see the comment above re what Mercouris’ sources say. Russia has every incentive to litigate for geopolitical reasons. Look at how (in a very different sort of case) the US tried to prosecute Internet Research Agency, the bot farm part or totally owed by Prigozhin, that famously won the 2016 election for Trump with $200,000 of Facebook ads…half of which appeared after election day and 25% of which were viewed by no one. The DoJ filed criminal charges v. the IRA to advance its Russiagate narrative (I forget whether v. individuals or the company). They showed up to defend the case. The DoJ immediately dropped it. So as the Covington memo suggests, methinks the Eurocrats are similarly over-relying on the idea that the Russian government or individuals won’t act. Oh, of course RU will litigate; perhaps I wasn’t clear enough. My point was that they will do so not in any expectation of getting their assets back, but simply for the fun of it (knowing that the awful publicity will torch the EU’s reputation and cause dissension both inside the EU, and between the EU and the USA). Shredding western unity (and possibly shattering the EU itself) is arguably worth more to RU than 200bn clams (or whatever the exact amount is), and in any case RU will offset much of this 200bn loss by seizing EU assets inside RU. has anyone in he west calculated the value of western assets in Russia that could be seized in retaliation for this bizarre scheme? it can’t be a small number. “The documents detail plans for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap roughly $200 billion of frozen Russian assets for projects in Ukraine—including a massive new data center to be powered by a nuclear plant currently occupied by Russian troops.” As if, after all of this, the first thing on the minds of the people remaining in Ukraine is some damn data center. Putin signed a decree in 2024 that allows Russians to claim US assets in Russia, if Russian assets were seized by any member of the G7. Some online estimates (no link) have been as high as $1 Trillion. Aha, good intel! But not European? I believe the decree in question obligated the government to prepare legislation to allow Russian subjects who’s property or assets have been confiscated by a G7 country to go to a Russian court to receive compensation from similar property or assets of the said country’s subjects holding within Russian jurisdiction. Sort of a counter to the REPO act, but covering all G7 countries and over $80 worth invested in Russia by them. And right on cue, the Central Bank of Russia today announced it is suing Euroclear in the Moscow Court of Arbitration for recovery of losses caused by action of Euroclear.

Sputnik News 20251210 MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Negotiations on the Ukraine settlement revolve around discussions on three documents, namely a US-proposed peace plan, a security guarantees agreement, and an economic recovery plan for the post-conflict period, The Washington Post newspaper reported, citing US and Ukrainian officials. The talks remain far from concluded, the report said on Tuesday. Ukraine and its European allies plan to present further revisions to the plan on Wednesday, it added. Additionally, US officials are in discussions with Larry Fink, CEO of financial giant BlackRock, about reviving the company's proposal for a Ukrainian reconstruction fund that could raise $400 billion, The Washington Post reported. The World Bank may also be involved, the report said. Since mid-November, the US has been promoting a new peace proposal for Ukraine. On December 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin received US special envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in the Kremlin. The US representatives' visit to Russia was related to the discussion of the US peace plan for Ukraine. US President Donald Trump said later that he was disappointed that Volodymyr Zelenskyy had not read the peace proposal for the Ukraine conflict. On Tuesday, the Financial Times newspaper reported that Witkoff and Kushner gave Zelenskyy "days" to come up with a response to the peace plan. Zelenskyy reportedly told his European allies that Witkoff and Kushner pressured him during a two-hour phone call on Saturday to respond to the plan that demands Kiev accept territorial losses in exchange for US security guarantees, with Trump aiming to finalize the deal "by Christmas."

Title: Ukraine Considers Legal Path To Elections Under Martial Law As US Pushes For Vote
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2025/12/ukraine-251211-rferl01.htm

By RFE/RL December 11, 2025 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he held a "substantive discussion" with members of Ukraine's parliament on the possibility of holding an election, amid pressure from the United States to hold a vote despite wartime legal restrictions. Addressing Ukrainians in a nightly video on December 10, Zelenskyy said strong security guarantees from Kyiv's allies -- especially Washington -- are needed to hold a vote. "If partners, including our key partner in Washington, speak so much and so specifically about elections in Ukraine, about elections under martial law, then we must provide legal Ukrainian answers to every question and every doubt," he said, responding to a suggestion by US President Donald Trump that Kyiv was using the war as an excuse to avoid elections. "It is not easy, but pressure on this issue is definitely not what we need...Security challenges depend on partners, primarily America. Political and legal challenges must be answered by Ukraine. And they will be," he added. The White House has been pushing for Ukraine to hold elections -- US President Donald Trump told Politico in an interview published on December 9 that "it's time"-- even though Ukraine's constitution doesn't allow for elections during wartime. In a shift from previous statements, Zelenskyy told reporters on December 9 that he would push parliament to draft legislation allowing for elections during martial law. A vote could follow in 60 to 90 days once there are security guarantees in place to make sure voting would be safe for Ukrainians. Zelenskyy's comments come amid intense negotiations aimed at ending Russia's all-out war on Ukraine, launched in February 2022. Ukrainian officials have been pushing back on a US-drafted peace plan that was seen as heavily favoring Russia. The possibility of holding elections has been regularly dismissed, with officials saying it would be impossible given daily Russian air strikes across the country, thousands of soldiers battling on the front lines, and millions of Ukrainians displaced. Opinion polls show most Ukrainians are against holding wartime elections, though with the last elections held in 2019 some want changes in the government to bring in fresh ideas. Widely popular, Zelenskyy's support has slipped in recent weeks amid a major corruption scandal that led to the resignation of an influential adviser, Andriy Yermak. On the battlefield and in negotiations, Russian officials believe they have the upper hand, and the 28-point plan proposed by the United States echoes most of the hard-line positions that Moscow has held since before the invasion. Ukraine's European allies, meanwhile, have been unenthusiastic about Washington's proposal. Before a planned meeting between the so-called Coalition of the Willing -- which includes Germany, France, Britain -- with Zelenskyy on December 11, leaders from the three countries held a phone call with Trump. Trump said said he exchanged "pretty strong words" with the leaders of France, Britain and Germany over Ukraine, another sign of a widening rift on how to end the war as it nears its fourth anniversary. "We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words," Trump told reporters when asked about the call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany Chancellor Friedrich Merz. "I think we had some little disputes about people, and we're going to see how it turns out. And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things," Trump added, noting the European countries talked about meeting this weekend in Europe. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said Ukraine had agreed on key points of a possible reconstruction plan in discussions with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other senior officials, including Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. "The principles of the economic document are completely clear and we are fully aligned with the American side," Zelenskyy said. "An important common principle is that for reconstruction to be of high quality and economic growth after this war to be tangible, real security must be at the core. When there is security, everything else is there too." Zelenskyy wrote earlier that he and and his European partners will soon present the United States with "refined documents" on the peace plan as well. There have been several major sticking points in the back-and-forth negotiations including the size of Ukraine's armed forces, Western security guarantees, and Russia's insistence that Ukraine be permanently barred from seeking NATO membership. The White House peace proposal, and the belief that it heavily favors Russian interests, has drawn criticism from some Republican lawmakers in Congress. President Vladimir Putin "is mocking President Trump and buying time to keep killing Ukrainian families," Representative Joe Wilson said.

Title: Bitcoin dips after Fed’s 25 bps cut – Is BTC’s 2026 rally at risk?

Weak bids and macro volatility cloud Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. The market is taking the Federal Reserve’s move with cautious optimism. The recent 25 bps rate cut to 3.50–3.75% by the Fed on the 10th of December marks the third cut of 2025. Consequently, traders are now eyeing a potential liquidity boost, putting Bitcoin [BTC] back on the radar. But that’s not all. One key point in the Fed’s statement is that they’ll start buying $40 billion in U.S. T-bills over the next thirty days. By doing this, the Fed injects extra short-term liquidity back into the banking system. Source: X Simply put, the U.S. economy is about to get a fresh wave of liquidity. With another 25 bps rate cut and $40 billion in Treasury bill buys from financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is clearly trying to push cheaper capital back into the system as labor-market risks start creeping higher. And yet, BTC has reacted with a 2.14% dip, breaking below $90k. Notably, this move is no fluke. The Fed may be boosting short-term liquidity, but it’s also stirring concern about longer-term risks, especially as markets start pricing in a pause in rate cuts heading into 2026. It appears investors were already prepared for Bitcoin’s volatility. From mining firms to BlackRock, millions in BTC were unloaded ahead of the FOMC. With inflation still running hot and the Fed split on how aggressively to cut rates next year, investors are clearly staying cautious. And that caution isn’t misplaced. Over the last four FOMC meetings, Bitcoin has repeatedly pulled back. In fact, after the October FOMC, BTC slid almost 30% to $80k, marking its first major flash crash of 2025. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) Against this setup, the question remains: Is history about to repeat itself? A recent Glassnode report highlights weak bids around $90k, reinforcing the cautious sentiment. Add aggressive selling by smart money, and Bitcoin is clearly in a supply-skewed setup, signaling potential downside pressure. Looking ahead, BTC’s base-building for a Q1 2026 rally is still uncertain. With investors reshuffling, macro volatility lingering, and weak FOMO, Bitcoin could repeat its post-FOMC breakdown, testing key support levels.

Title: State Street, Galaxy and Ondo join tokenized cash race with 24/7 sweep fund

State Street Investment Management and Galaxy Asset Management are launching a tokenized private liquidity fund on Solana, with Ondo expected to invest $200 million. State Street Investment Management and Galaxy Asset Management are joining forces with Ondo Finance on a tokenized liquidity fund that will push cash “sweep” balances directly onto public blockchains, creating a potential source of 24/7 onchain liquidity. The planned State Street Galaxy Onchain Liquidity Sweep Fund, or SWEEP, is designed to take in and pay out PayPal’s (PYUSD) stablecoin for accredited investors, the companies said on Tuesday. Ondo is expected to seed the fund with $200 million, tying a major tokenized real-world asset (RWA) issuer directly into State Street’s tokenization stack. The fund will be powered by Galaxy Digital infrastructure, while State Street Bank and Trust Company, an affiliate of State Street Investment Management, will act as custodian. SWEEP is set to launch on Solana in early 2026, with rollouts on other networks, including Stellar and Ethereum, to follow, using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Related: Solana and Coinbase’s Base connect together using Chainlink The move drops another heavyweight into an increasingly crowded race to define what “onchain cash” looks like for institutions. BlackRock and Franklin Templeton already run tokenized cash‑management vehicles, including money‑market and other short‑term fixed‑income funds, on public blockchains. For its part, Ondo has built a business around wrapping Treasurys and other credit exposures into onchain vehicles that can plug into crypto markets. “By partnering with Galaxy, we will push the envelope together and drive the evolution of the TradFi landscape onchain,” said Kim Hochfeld, global head of cash and digital assets for State Street Investment Management. “Tokenization is rapidly becoming the connective tissue between traditional finance and the onchain economy,” said Ian De Bode, president of Ondo Finance. “Our planned investment would not only anchor this innovative fund – but also supports the continued growth of Ondo’s fund that offers institutional investors exposure to short-term US Treasuries with 24/7 instant mints and redemptions.” Related: Blockchain trial on Canton Network tests collateral reuse with tokenized US Treasurys The launch comes as tokenized funds and tokenized equities are starting to resemble components of an emerging onchain capital markets stack more than isolated pilots. Superstate opened up onchain capital raising for US Securities and Exchange Commission‑registered public companies via its Direct Issuance Programs on Ethereum and Solana Wednesday, targeting the equity side of that stack by letting issuers sell new stock directly for stablecoins and settle immediately to investor wallets. State Street’s partnership with Galaxy and Ondo also highlights how the roles are shaping up as traditional finance and crypto firms share the same products. State Street brings Big Four regulatory cover and custody, Galaxy contributes digital‑asset infrastructure and tokenization expertise, and Ondo provides both capital and an existing RWA distribution network. Related: Galaxy expands into UAE as part of Middle East push Solana’s role as the initial venue highlights a second competitive race unfolding beneath the product arms race. The chain has become a favored home for tokenized assets and high‑throughput trading, from tokenized public shares to experiments in onchain liquidity funds, as issuers look for lower fees and fast settlements. Some of the largest institutions in the world have chosen the Solana blockchain for their digital assets play, including Western Union, which processes over $100 billion in remittance volume every year, and Pfizer, which processes $2 trillion of merchant payment volume annually. Physical staked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Solana have reached almost $1 billion in assets under management. Launching on Solana first, with plans to expand to Stellar and Ethereum, will allow SWEEP to tap into multiple ecosystems where stablecoins and RWA tokens are already part of the infrastructure.

Title: XRP ETFs close in on $1bn inflows as investors drive ‘new price discovery’

About us Copy link Demand for XRP exchange-traded funds shows no signs of ebbing. Spot ETFs backed by the Ripple-linked crypto have attracted $954 million in investment since Canary Capital’s blockbuster November debut, SoSoValue data shows. That is triple the $293 million in Solana products over the same window. By contrast, Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.5 billion in selling, while Ethereum ETFs also bled $471 million, DefiLlama data shows. ETFs are “significant flow machines,” Hyunsu Jung, CEO of treasury firm Hyperion DeFi, told DL News. They “play a key role in providing market participants with regulated access to the underlying tokens and can push assets to new price discovery in bullish environments,” Jung said. The leading performance of XRP ETFs — four straight weeks of positive inflows — comes amid a stagnant crypto market that is still down over $1 trillion from its October peak. XRP’s token price is at $2.01, or 45% below its all-time high set in July. Analysts have told DL News they see ETF proliferation as a key catalyst. Macroeconomic factors are also critical to crypto ETF performance, according to Jung. “We believe that additional liquidity will become available in global markets as central banks end quantitative tightening and lower interest rates, which often has flowed to more risk-on assets,” he said. The Federal Reserve on Thursday cut interest rates by another 0.25%, bringing its key lending rate to the lowest level in three years. When asked about Vanguard’s late entry into the crypto ETF arena, Jung said, “it was inevitable.” “Vanguard has recognised at this point that Blackrock, Fidelity and other platforms build massive digital asset ETF franchises, and seen the broader global institutional adoption of digital assets as both stores of value and critical technology infrastructure.” Jung said he anticipates new ETFs linked to other crypto tokens, such as HYPE, which powers the perpetual futures exchange Hyperliquid. “We expect ETFs for Hyperliquid such as 21Shares or BItwise Hyperliquid ETF,” Jung said. “If approved, will see significant institutional demand from traditional asset managers looking to gain exposure to one of the highest-revenue-generating blockchain platforms.” “Unique on-chain products like Hyperliquid and Polymarket should benefit from increasing global adoption as awareness of digital infrastructure continues to proliferate,” he said.

Title: Americans barely own gold — and that means prices could climb even further, Goldman says

Gold's record rally this year has grabbed headlines, but American investors barely own any of it, which means the yellow metal's price could have more room to run, according to Goldman Sachs. Even with gold hitting repeated highs, US ownership hasn't budged much. Gold ETF exposure is still six basis points, or 0.06 percentage points, below its 2012 peak since the launch of gold ETFs in the mid-2000s, according to Goldman's analysis published on Wednesday. The low gold allocation is simply because "portfolio growth has outpaced gains in gold prices and volumes over the past decade," Goldman's analysts wrote. And while gold has surged to new all-time highs in 2025, Goldman's analysis shows that the rally hasn't translated into meaningful increases in actual US ownership. Gold ETFs make up just 0.17% of private US financial portfolios as of the second quarter — a microscopic slice of the roughly $112 trillion Americans hold in stocks and bonds, according to Goldman's analysis. Goldman's data also shows that fewer than half of large US institutions managing over $100 million hold any gold ETF position at all. Among those that do, allocations typically sit between 0.1% and 0.5%. For major long-term investors, only about 0.2% of their portfolios are in gold. Despite the social media buzz around Costco gold bars and US Mint coin sales, the report notes that physical gold demand in the US is tiny compared with ETF flows — just 11 to 15 metric tons year-to-date, versus roughly 400 tons of net ETF buying. That low ownership stands in sharp contrast to recommendations coming from major market voices, including Citi, UBS, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, advising investors to add gold to their portfolios. The gap between those recommendations and reality is exactly what Goldman says could push gold's next leg higher. The bank estimates that every 1-basis-point, or 0.01 percentage point, increase in gold's share of US financial portfolios would push gold prices up by about 1.4%. Goldman argues that if households or institutions meaningfully boosted their gold exposure as a diversifier — especially amid global macro uncertainty, including concerns about the fiscal outlook — such inflows could "substantially raise prices" in the small gold market. The bank forecasts gold to reach $4,900 by the end of 2026, but says that forecast carries "significant upside risk" if private-sector buying broadens beyond the central banks that have dominated demand in recent years. The spot gold price hit a record high near $4,400 per troy ounce in late October and has since pulled back to around $4,220 per ounce. Prices are up 60% so far this year.

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto statue lands on NYSE in sign of changing times

Time Published: 2025-12-11T06:13:26Z
Full Content:
There are five other Satoshi statues made by Valentina Picozzi located around the world, in Switzerland, El Salvador, Japan, Vietnam and Miami, in the US state of Florida. The New York Stock Exchange has become the sixth host of Valentina Picozzi’s “disappearing” Satoshi Nakamoto statue — a striking shift from just a few years ago when crypto was still taboo on Wall Street. Long seen as a bastion of traditional finance, the NYSE called the installation “shared ground between emerging systems and established institutions” in an X post on Wednesday. The statue was installed by Bitcoin (BTC) firm Twenty One Capital, which began trading this week. The design itself is the work of Picozzi, who wrote on X under her Satoshigallery handle that seeing her latest piece in such a high-profile setting is “mind-blowing.” “This is such an achievement, even in our wildest dream we wouldn’t think about placing the statue of Satoshi Nakamoto in this location! The 6th/21 statues of Satoshi Nakamoto found its home in the NYSE,” she added. It also happens to coincide with the anniversary of the Bitcoin mailing list, which Nakamoto launched on Dec. 10, 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block on Jan. 3, 2009, minting the first 50 Bitcoin in history and planting the seeds for the crypto industry we see today. Over a year later, on May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz made the first documented purchase of goods using Bitcoin, paying 10,000 Bitcoin for two Papa John’s pizzas. In the intervening years, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency faced many challenges, as institutions and banks shunned them, and governments allegedly attempted to suppress them through efforts such as Operation Chokepoint 2.0. However, it has since turned a corner, as skeptics, such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, have changed their minds about the technology, and institutions and Wall Street have scrambled to invest through vehicles like exchange-traded funds and directly by holding Bitcoin in their treasuries. Public and private companies, countries and ETFs now collectively hold more than 3.7 million Bitcoin, according to Bitbo, worth more than $336 billion. Picozzi has five other Nakamoto statues around the world, located in Switzerland, El Salvador, Japan, Vietnam, and Miami, Florida. Related: Disappearing Satoshi statue in Lugano took 21 months to create, says artist Picozzi, under her Satoshigallery handle, said she is committed to placing 21 around the world, a possible reference to the theoretical 21 million Bitcoin maximum supply. Speaking to Cointelegraph last year, she said Nakamoto is one of the most intriguing and fascinating figures of this era, and the statues stand as a tribute to the person behind Bitcoin. “The statue itself wants to give to the viewer this feeling of disappearance, and the sense that the inventor stays between the lines — as of today, Satoshi exists in the lines of the Bitcoin code, allowing humanity to have the first decentralized payment system,” she said.
