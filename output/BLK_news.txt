Shares of BlackRock (BLK) hit an all-time high Friday after the investment firm easily topped financial estimates and posted records for assets and inflows. The company reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.46, with revenue increasing 14.9% year-over-year to $5.20 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $10.38 and $5.02 billion, respectively. BlackRock's assets under management (AUM) rose $2.4 trillion to $11.5 trillion, and net inflows came in at $221 billion, both all-time highs. The company explained that the big jump in revenue came from "the positive impact of markets on average AUM, organic base fee growth, and higher performance fees." Chief Executive Officer CEO Larry Fink said, "Our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working." He noted that the firm was driving "access to the enormous investment potential of infrastructure, especially to support AI innovation." Fink added that "the opportunities ahead of us have never been greater." BlackRock shares recently rose 3% to $983.28 after earlier touching a record $995.99. They are up more than 20% year-to-date.

Title: Child going abroad for scoliosis surgery can travel business class with one parent, says CHI

Children with scoliosis who are going abroad for treatment under a new scheme can travel business class on a plane with one parent, while the other will be booked in economy, it emerged today. The travel package for children was detailed as it emerged up to 38 children have had their spinal surgery outsourced from Dublin children’s hospital to another hospital, including hospitals in the UK and the United States, according to September waiting list figures. The travel package states for comfort and flexibility, families will be booked into either a three-star hotel or a serviced apartment, close to the hospital abroad. Families will be provided with these details directly before their travel date, it added. Families will be provided with a daily stipend for meals and expenses while they are away. Before the trip, parents will receive a prepaid currency card. More information about this will be discussed directly with families when their surgery date is confirmed, said CHI. It will include travel insurance, an issue which some parents were worried about. Under an initiative to reduce waiting list for children with scoliosis needing spinal surgery it was announced during the summer that suitable patients could have their surgeries in other designated hospitals. Overall, the waiting list or spinal surgery in September stood at 248 compared to 258 the month previously. The children whose care are outsourced come under the suspended list. Children’s Health Ireland (CHI), which oversees the three children's hospitals, announced during the summer that it was engaging with other hospitals and organisations, both in Ireland and abroad, regarding spinal surgeries and patient care agreements. At that stage a number of patients had been assessed and deemed suitable for spinal surgery abroad. The hospitals include New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital and the Portland Hospital in London There is an ongoing agreement with Blackrock Clinic in Dublin to continue to work together to expand out-sourcing for adolescents who require spinal fusion surgery. For the first time CHI has published dedicated phone numbers and the names of staff who will take calls from parents on clinical questions.There are also personal emails for questions around surgery abroad and an email for a spinal patient advocate liaison coordinator. Advocacy groups representing parents of children on the waiting list have remained critical of the service and poor communication with reports of parents trying to get an update on their child and failing to get information. Waiting list figures show that nationally 87,022 patients were waiting for an appointment for their inpatient or day case treatment in September. While 23,883 patients were waiting to receive an appointment for their gastrointestinal endoscopy and 595,575 patients are waiting for a first hospital outpatient consultation. The Department of Health said today the hospital waiting list for hospitals across the country demonstrate the progress achieved through the multi-annual action plan approach implemented by the Government to address long wait times for care. The latest hospital activity report, published by the Health Service Executive (HSE), shows increased levels of activity in the delivery of scheduled and unscheduled care. The figures show significant positive progress being achieved in terms of patients waiting longest. There has been a .17pc reduction in the total number of patients waiting over 12 months since this time last year, and a corresponding reduction of .27pc in the number waiting over 18 months.

Title: Inside Track On The Wall Street Embrace Of Bitcoin And Digital Assets
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/11/inside-track-on-the-wall-street-embrace-of-bitcoin-and-digital-assets/

Full Content:
BUDAPEST, HUNGARY - SEPTEMBER 22: A statue of Satoshi Nakamoto, a presumed pseudonym used by the ... [+] inventor of Bitcoin, is displayed in Graphisoft Park on September 22, 2021 in Budapest, Hungary. The statue's creators, Reka Gergely and Tamas Gilly, used anonymized facial features, as Nakamoto's true identify remains unconfirmed. (Photo by Janos Kummer/Getty Images) There should no longer be a question in anyone’s mind that bitcoin is here to stay. What may be a little less clear is, why? The answer is fairly simple: Wall Street found the money. The last sentence should be amusing to those who are supporters of bitcoin or are immersed in the digital asset class. Bitcoin Bitcoin , after all, was created to be money. On October 31, 2008, the mysterious unknown developer of bitcoin who goes under the what is widely believed to be a pseudonymous name, Satoshi Nakamoto, described a digital cryptocurrency in a white paper titled, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” It is entirely plausible that the leaders of global financial institutions read the white paper, studied the behavior of bitcoin throughout the fifteen plus years of existence, and converted to the belief system that bitcoin is going to have a fundamental impact on the global financial system. There is no reason to believe this did not happen. Chairman and CEO of BlackRock Larry Fink (Photo by Mat Szwajkos/Getty Images) This is, in fact, fairly close to what Larry Fink, the chief executive of Blackrock, believed to be the world’s largest asset manager, said during an interview with Jim Cramer on CNBC. Larry Fink said, “I was a proud skeptic. I studied it. Learned about it, and I came away saying okay, my opinion five years ago was wrong, here is my opinion today, I believe the opportunity today. I believe bitcoin is legitimate…it is a legitimate financial instrument that allows you to have uncorrelated, non-correlated type of returns.” There is an alternative explanation, however, that is equally plausible: the global financial institutions simply listened to their customers. In the month of October 2024, bitcoin has a market cap of over $1.2 trillion. There may be reasons to be skeptical of bitcoin, and far more reasons when considering the broader cryptocurrency universe, but it is impossible to deny that an asset with a value of over one trillion dollars is not real or meaningful. Young traders are taught that markets have momentum, and that momentum and market sentiment can be more important than fundamentals. Experienced financial market participants know that the markets can be like trains, and one should never stand in the way of a freight train under the misguided belief that you know exactly where it is going to stop. Bitcoin is a train in motion. Skeptics should be careful. Customers across the entire spectrum, from retail to institutional, have expressed interest in bitcoin. More importantly, these customers have asked financial service institutions to provide access to bitcoin in a manner consistent with other established financial assets. LevelField Financial, my firm, is in the process of acquiring a U.S. chartered bank because we heard those customers, and we wish to provide a safe, simple, and secure experience for customers who wish to participate in the digital asset class. Financial institutions – particularly the large Wall Street firms – exist to serve customers. If they do not offer the products and services requested by their customers, then it is entirely probable that those customers will migrate to other firms that offer the desired products. For financial institutions, meeting the needs of customers is how they generate revenue. All products and services sold to customers generate value for the firm, one way or another. Put another way, financial institutions make money by selling products to customers that the customers want to buy. Customers have said they wanted access to bitcoin products. For institutions they face a choice: not delivering such products could potentially risk the customer relationship, while providing the customers the products they want will generate revenue for the firm. It may be the case that the titans of Wall Street are converts to the future of cryptocurrency based upon extensive study and a belief that this asset class represents a considerable improvement over the status quo. Alternatively, a simple explanation for why so many firms are supporting bitcoin may be that they are simply reacting to overwhelming demand from their customers. After all, strong demand for products can lead to lucrative profits. Occam’s razor suggests that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. Financial institutions responding to their customers and making money while doing so is how markets are supposed to work. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Why are we seeing the Northern Lights more frequently in Ireland?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/environment/2024/10/11/why-are-we-seeing-the-northern-lights-more-frequently-in-ireland/
Time Published: 2024-10-11T17:11:32Z
Full Content:
The Northern Lights, also known as aurora borealis, are the results of collisions between gas particles in our atmosphere and charged particles ejected from the sun’s atmosphere. The colour of the Northern Lights change due to the type of gas particles that are colliding. Oxygen molecules at approximately 100km above the earth produce a greenish-yellow colour, while a red aurora can be seen when high-level oxygen molecules are involved. Blue or purple auroras indicate the presence of nitrogen molecules. Frances McCarthy, education officer at MTU’s Blackrock Castle Observatory in Cork, said it was predicted based on images of the sun that showed a “coronal mass ejection”, where a large amount of the outer part of the sun’s atmosphere was ejected into space. “When the charged material from the sun arrived yesterday, it affected the upper atmosphere near the poles and made the glow of the aurora,” she said. “We saw red light in Cork, due to oxygen at the upper levels glowing. Red aurora are rare. The green light was from lower level atmospheric gases, and are more common. Prior to this, I had only ever seen green aurora.” The UK’s Met Office had also reported that sightings of the Northern Lights were likely on Thursday night and the early hours of Friday across northern areas of the UK. Solar activity changes in an 11-year cycle and we are currently near the top of the cycle of most activity, so eruptions such as coronal mass ejections and sunspots are more common. Ms McCarthy added that the sun was “last this active in 1989” while aurora are more common near the north and south magnetic poles so only very strong space weather events will affect us or be visible to us as aurora. The Northern Lights are best observed in locations with very small amounts of light pollution and clear skies in terms of ideal weather conditions. Parts of the west and north coast offer the greatest chance of seeing the display, according to Met Éireann. It points out there are a number of forecast services for the Northern Lights; including one which comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that provides a 30-minute forecast for the aurora. People can also check out spaceweather.com. Unfortunately no, we are not likely to see the Northern Lights again on Friday night as the geomagnetic storm is subsiding. Ms McCarthy added there would be chances again in the future to see the Northern Lights but probably not this weekend. Sarah Burns is a reporter for The Irish Times © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Catch up on the latest World of Warcraft news with This Week in WoW (TWiW)! Join the celebration as World of Warcraft celebrates its 20th Anniversary with new activities and myriad ways to earn currency. When: October 22, 2024 – January 6, 2025 Where: Outside the Caverns of Time in Tanaris Here’s what you can look forward to during the 20th Anniversary Celebration: Players level 10 and up will receive the quest, “Another Timely Invitation,” inviting them to the celebration in Tanaris outside the Caverns of Time. You’ll speak with Yllana to turn in your quest and then pick up some one-time quests to learn more about the event. Grab all the celebration details from our World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration article. The WoW 20th Anniversary introduces a variety of new activities and ways to earn currency during the event, which can be used to purchase myriad items including iconic Tier 2 transmog appearance sets. We’ve consulted top goblins and tallied it all up so that you know how to earn these currencies and where you can spend them. Players will also automatically be granted a 10% experience and reputation buff during the Anniversary and can add an additional 10% experience and reputation buff by completing the repeatable “Celebrate Good Fun” quest with Yllana. This buff will not countdown while offline and will be offered to you again once per day when it expires. Developer Insights: For the Anniversary event, we want these epic new rewards to feel both special to players and well-earned. To that end, we have worked to create a rewarding system that should help players earn their first Tier 2 set in the first 2-3 weeks, depending upon their play style. We know that there are a lot of people who are excited to earn more sets if not all of them. To accommodate this, we have both discounts and increased abilities to earn currency that kick in after those early weeks (detailed further below). This should allow players who play through the event regularly to have the ability to earn all thirteen of these Tier Sets and many, if not all of the other new cosmetic rewards tied to the anniversary. If you run out of time this year, don’t worry; we will have the sets available from the anniversary event in future years. Learn all the details about currency types, anniversary vendors, Tier 2 armor appearances, and more from our previously published article. Calling defenders of Azeroth to brave the inferno and push back against Ragnaros and his wayward loyalists—the Rage of the Firelands update arrives on October 29, followed by the Firelands Raid on November 7. The Rage of the Firelands content update will burn an indelible mark in Azeroth's history. Take on the new Elemental Bonds questline, and increase the challenges for powerful rewards with the new Elemental Rune Dungeons: Protocol Inferno difficulty option. Then, soon after the update, the legendary Firelands Raid arrives with its Raid tier armor and weapons, two new mounts, Achievements, and seven unique boss encounters. This will also be the stop for Druid, Mage, Priest, Shaman, or Warlock in their quest to build the legendary staff Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest, a weapon of unsurpassed quality that requires a spectacular effort to construct. Like the Shadowmourne questline in Wrath of the Lich King Classic, adjustments have been made to make Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest, faster to acquire on both 10 and 25-player raid sizes. More details await you in our previously published article. The time to strike at Ragnaros the Firelord draws near. For all champions daring to begin a new adventure or continue their odyssey in Azeroth, you can prepare for the heat when you take advantage of the Joyous Journeys experience buff*, which increases experience gains by 50% for all players up to level 85! Finish leveling a character, create a new one, or invite friends to join you in Cataclysm Classic. The buff is active by default, but you can visit any innkeeper in the capital cities and Dalaran to turn it off or on again. Take advantage of the Joyous Journey’s experience buff now. It’s an excellent opportunity for new and returning players to level up and join the defenders of Hyjal as they fight to create a foothold in the Firelands at the Molten Front before the Ragnaros makes his grand entrance in the Rage of the Firelands content update.

Title: Altice Offers Creditors 15% Stake in Return for Haircut
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/altice-offers-creditors-15-stake-in-return-for-haircut-11728664364432.html
Time Published: 2024-10-11T16:32:43Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Altice France is floating a proposal to give secured creditors a stake in the company to get them to agree to a haircut on their holdings, as the embattled telecommunications giant seeks to whittle away at its €24.4 billion ($26.7 billion) of debt. Under this informal proposal, debtholders would get an equity stake of between 10% and 15% in exchange for writing off the same amount of their principal, according to people familiar with the matter. Other features of the plan include the extension of the maturities by a certain number of years with a lower interest rate than the existing debt, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. The proposal, which was put forward to advisers of its secured creditors, doesn’t envisage new funds from billionaire owner Patrick Drahi, who would remain in charge, the people added. While this was not a formal offer, the company asked the steering committee if the creditors would be willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement to negotiate on this basis, the people said. BlackRock Inc., Elliott Investment Management and Pacific Investment Management Co. are among the investors in the steering committee, Bloomberg reported earlier. Spokespeople for Altice and the secured group of creditors declined to comment. Altice France’s €800 million secured bond due in October 2029 rose about 3.5 cents on the euro to 75.7 cents on Friday, the highest since March, according to pricing compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Altice France Holding’s €1.3 billion unsecured bond due in May 2027 fell 1.6 cents on the euro to about 30 cents, the biggest drop since April. While the plan in some ways represents a more attractive option for creditors than an earlier offer proposing a 20% haircut, the latest suggestion is still a long way away from the idea put forward by the lenders themselves, under which Drahi would have potentially lost control of the company. The latest proposal would still fall short of achieving a sustainable capital structure, some of the people familiar added. Altice is in talks with its creditors to cut its debt to reach a leverage target of below 4 times its earnings, from 6.7 times. Sentiment in the leveraged finance market is fairly positive on the back of recent interest rate cuts. A lack of supply has also seen investors reach for yield on a technical basis. That means borrowers have been able to get fairly aggressive deals accepted by buysiders, something that could potentially benefit Altice. Investor appetite is certainly stronger than it was when the company first told creditors in March that they would need to take losses. A group of creditors holding about 90% of Altice’s secured debt recently agreed to extend a cooperation agreement that binds them in negotiations on restructuring the company’s balance sheet by a year until February 2026. Separate to the discussions with creditors, the company has also held talks with funds including Apollo Global Management about raising new debt to repay looming maturities, potentially hurting existing creditors down the line, Bloomberg reported earlier. --With assistance from Eleanor Duncan.

Title: BlackRock brought in more money last quarter than ever before. Here's where the $11.5 trillion asset manager hopes to become the industry leader next.

BlackRock became the world's largest asset manager because it made cheap funds for the masses. Now, the $11.5 trillion behemoth wants to put high-fee private market strategies in your portfolio. The firm brought in more assets last quarter — $221 billion — than ever before, but on its earnings call, the firm's leaders focused more on integrating strategies from the recent acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners into model portfolios than on its ballooning ETF franchise. "This is a revenue growth story," said BlackRock's chief financial officer Martin Small Friday morning. GIP, the infrastructure asset manager that BlackRock paid $12.5 billion for, is expected to add $250 million in management fees to BlackRock's bottom line in the fourth quarter alone. "This is a meaningful accelerant to our private markets capabilities," he said. A quarter century after BlackRock went public — the firm IPOed on October 1, 1999 — the firm hopes to blend its private market strategies into its model portfolios for wealth managers. Private equity and private credit strategies have the potential to bring on higher returns but are also less liquid and more expensive investments than mutual funds or ETFs. The manager is hoping to be the builder of next-generation technology, whether that's data centers needed for artificial intelligence or infrastructure needed for decarbonization. "We're not going to say they're alternatives because they'll just be part of the market," said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, about private strategies, which have long been touted in industry lingo as "alternatives" to the public market. Fink said risk will be measured by the liquidity of these blended portfolios. The firm's $3.2 billion acquisition of data giant Preqin will help bring these more complex strategies to a broader audience. The acquisition is set to close at the end of the year. "It's going to happen with the expansion of data and analytics," Fink said. The firm's focus may be shifting because there aren't many more levers to pull for increased growth in its iShares franchise, which crossed $1 trillion in total assets last quarter. The firm's leaders said the fourth quarter is traditionally a strong one for this segment of their business, and the franchise has also seen serious inflows following political events and central bank decisions. Comparatively, retail allocation to the private markets is in the "low-single digits," according to Small, giving BlackRock another territory to expand into. "The opportunities ahead of us have never been better than they are now," Fink said. Private credit, for example, could pick up billions of dollars from the firm's insurance clients, which have $700 billion invested with BlackRock. "We've never shied away from taking big bets," Fink said, and private market strategies are the latest roll of the dice. Jump to

Title: Stock market today: US stocks edge up after wholesale inflation comes in cool
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-today-cool-wholesale-inflation-data-boosts-stocks-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-11T13:41:50Z
Full Content:
US stocks edged higher on Friday after Producer Price Index data for September came in lower than expected, signaling a continued cooling of wholesale inflation. The producer price index was flat month-over-month, below economist estimates of a 0.1% rise. Meanwhile, Core PPI rose 0.1% in September, compared to an expected rise of 0.2%. TradeStation strategist David Russell told Business Insider the data supports another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. "CPI might have seemed hot, but PPI was not. Overall, these numbers are getting less impactful as inflation moderates. The Fed could still be on track for 25 basis points at the next two meetings. Yields have surged lately, but it's not clear they have much more reason for continued upside," Russell said. Investors are also digesting earnings results from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock. All three stocks moved higher after the results, which beat analyst estimates on most fronts. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon praised his bank's performance in the earnings release, but warned that geopolitical conditions are "treacherous and getting worse." Apart from earnings results, retail sales data, set to be released on October 17, is the next big data release for investors to watch. Bank of America analysts expect September retail sales data to show a 0.8% surge, while consensus estimates expect just 0.2% growth.

The S&P 500 is on track for a muted open and its fifth consecutive winning week despite a slight decline Thursday. The producer price index, a measure of wholesale inflation, came in below expectations for September. A day earlier, consumer inflation data was hotter than expected. With earnings season kicking off, investors should focus more on corporate results than every single economic report. 2. Tesla skeptics are everywhere after the electric vehicle maker's hyped-up robotaxi event was short on details. Shares were down nearly 7%. CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will start building the self-driving taxis, dubbed Cybercab, before 2027 and would cost less than $30,000. But historically he has been too optimistic with these timelines. 3. BlackRock reports a total blowout quarter, with earnings per share of $11.46 well ahead of the $10.33 estimate. Revenues of $5.2 billion also beat. Inflows were insanely strong, representing 8% organic asset growth. The stock is on my shopping list for the CNBC Investing Club. 4. Wells Fargo, one of two financials we currently own for the Club, reported earnings of $1.52 a share on revenues of $20.37 billion. Both were weaker year over year, but EPS was a big beat. Shares added more than 3%. Non-interest income rose 12% on annual basis in the quarter and credit discipline was strong. Also Friday, JPMorgan topped profit and revenue estimates. 5. Domino's offers cheaper pizza, and it is catching on. The "Emergency Pizza" promo is back. Really drawn to the stock down here, even with a number of analysts lowering their price targets after the company's third-quarter earnings report Thursday. Domino's trimmed full-year sales and income growth guidance, citing the economic environment. 6. Advanced Micro Devices' pullback Thursday on its AI event looked like an opportunity. AMD was steady on Friday. Was the Club stock hurt by fact that Amazon Web Services wasn't there? Melius Research suggests that might be it. The rest of the big players were included: Microsoft, Oracle, OpenAI and Meta. We own Microsoft and Meta for the Club. 7. Goldman Sachs upped its price target on Nvidia to $150 a share from $135 and kept its buy rating on the stock. Toshiya Hari, a noted analyst, told clients that after meeting with CEO Jensen Huang and other execs, he has a better appreciation of Nvidia's competitive moat. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley reiterated Nvidia as a top pick. Nvidia is way ahead of everyone else. 8. Johnson & Johnson landed a huge win by forum shopping. A judge ruled that its subsidiary's third try at resolving tens of thousands of talc cases can stay in bankruptcy court in Texas. There is now a path out of this nightmare. Worth a look for risk-takers. 9. Barclays raised its price target on ServiceNow to $980 a share from $890, implying just a few percentage points of upside. Still, analysts kept their buy-equivalent overweight rating on the stock. Analysts said their supplier checks ticked down, making it tough to get very excited about the software earnings season. Did ServiceNow's business tick down though? I doubt it. 10. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway continued its sales of Bank of America stock this week. The latest trims brought Berkshire's stake in the bank below 10%, which means it will not have to report its sales within two business days to comply with U.S. securities law. Bank of America reports earnings Tuesday. Sign up for my Top 10 Morning Thoughts on the Market email newsletter for free (See here for a full list of the stocks at Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

WFC (U.S.: NYSE) 23 hours ago By Vivien Lou Chen Yields on long-dated U.S. government debt ended higher for a fourth consecutive week as the impact of last Friday's shockingly strong jobs data lingered. The 10-year yield has jumped a total of 42.4 basis points over the past four weeks, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Meanwhile, the 30-year rate has climbed a total of 40.5 basis points over the same time period. U.S. 10 Yr BX:TMUBMUSD10Y (XTUP) U.S. 30 Year Treasury Bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y (XTUP) 23 hours ago By Christine Idzelis U.S. stocks were picking up steam in late-afternoon trading Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising sharply. The Dow was up around 440 points, or 1%, and on pace for a record high, according to FactSet data at last check. The S&P 500 was also on track for an all-time high. DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) Nasdaq COMP (Nasdaq) 23 hours ago By Myra P. Saefong Natural-gas futures on Friday posted a loss of nearly 8% for the week, with demand taking a hit due to power outages caused by Hurricane Milton. Milton, which made landfall on the Florida coast Wednesday, left over 3 million people in Florida without power, wrote Hamad Hussain, assistant climate and commodities economist for Capital Economics, in a note. He pointed out that Florida is the second-largest consumer of natural gas for power in the U.S., behind only Texas. Natural gas for November delivery settled at $2.63 per million British thermal units, down 1.6% for the session and tallying a weekly loss of 7.8%. Oil prices, meanwhile, finished the week with a gain on the possibility that a wider Middle East conflict would disrupt the region's supplies. West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery fell 29 cents, or 0.4%, to settle at $75.56 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, for a weekly rise of 1.6%. December Brent crude, the global benchmark, lost 36 cents, or nearly 0.5%, at $79.04 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, with prices up 1.3% for the week.

The SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF was up 1.8%, while the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF increased 1.3% and the Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF was gaining 1.1%.

But Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.'s stock is on pace to do what Nvidia's couldn't. Its American depositary shares are up 3% in recent action to $191.28. Any close above $191.05 would be a new high, and the stock's first since July 10, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. ADR TSM (U.S.: NYSE) NVIDIA Corp. NVDA (U.S.: Nasdaq) 1 day ago By Christine Idzelis Shares of an exchange-traded fund that focuses on stocks in the S&P 500’s financial sector were climbing toward a potential record high on Friday, as investors assessed third-quarter earnings results from major Wall Street banks. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund was jumping 1.9% on Friday to $46.51 in afternoon trading, FactSet data show, at last check. The ETF’s rally on Friday had it on pace for a fresh all-time high, according to Dow Jones Market Data, citing data going to December 1998. Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF (U.S.: NYSE Arca) 1 day ago By Tomi Kilgore The retail sector was seeing a broad rally, after JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum said consumer spending on discretionary goods was more "normalization" after a post-pandemic spike than weakening. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF was rising 1.5% in recent trading, with 70 of 78 components gaining ground. In JPMorgan's post-earnings call with analysts, Barnum said "we're not seeing weakening...in retail spending." He added that regarding the consumer, "we're pretty much in the trough right now, as we speak." SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT (U.S.: NYSE Arca) 1 day ago By Tomi Kilgore JPMorgan Chase's stock was surging 4.7% in recent trading following better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, which put it on track for its biggest one-day gain since it rallied 7.6% on April 14, 2023. The stock's price gain of $10.07 was adding about 66 points to the price of the Dow, which was up 264 points, or 0.6%. In JPMorgan's earnings report, the bank said investment banking revenue jumped 29% and investment banking fees surged 31%. That helped boost shares of fellow Dow component and investment banker Goldman Sachs, as they rallied $9.65, or 1.9%. That added another 63 points to the Dow's price. JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM (U.S.: NYSE) Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS (U.S.: NYSE) DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) 1 day ago By Christine Idzelis Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were posting sharp gains Friday, beating all other sectors of the U.S. equities benchmark in early afternoon trading Friday.

Title: Shoplifting on the rise: ‘The amount of theft is unbelievable ... we have maybe three or four instances every day’

Time Published: 2024-10-11T11:15:14Z
Full Content:
Last week at Nine Crows, an independent vintage clothes shop in Temple Bar, Dublin, a staff member picked up the phone and dialled Pearse Street Garda station to report the theft of a pair of jeans from the shop moments earlier. While they were on the phone, another shoplifter made their way to the exit with stolen items from a shop display in hand. “In a matter of minutes – two separate incidents, two different people, two different thefts ... that’s how often it’s happening now,” says regional manager Faye Power. This year, according to Power, the rise in thefts at the Temple Bar shop – as well as at other locations across the city – has been “quick and fast”. Nine Crows is an independent business with limited resources for investing in security measures, and these crimes place a serious burden on the shop. “It’s just increasingly difficult. Like, what do you do? There’s rising costs across everything. A security guard isn’t obtainable for us,” says Power. “It’s not just us. [There are] six to eight shops in this area who are reporting daily, sometimes multiple times daily.” An increase in thefts is a nationwide problem. Figures released by the Central Statistics Office last month show that theft crime is at its highest level in five years. Analysis of theft and related offences, which were up by 8 per cent – or by 5,354 incidents in the 12 months to the second quarter of this year – showed nearly half or 49 per cent of such incidents involved theft from a shop. For Jim Kenny, who has run a Centra shop in Blackrock village in south Co Dublin for 27 years, theft became a serious issue following the Covid-19 pandemic. “Post Covid, the amount of theft was unbelievable,” says Kenny. “We have maybe three or four instances [of shoplifting] every day.” [ Shoplifting and burglary offences up, sex crimes and homicide downOpens in new window ] Tara Buckley, director general of the Retail Grocery Dairy and Allied Trades Association (RGDATA), says dealing with theft is a “daily occurrence” for the vast majority of the association’s members. A proportion of such offences at supermarkets is perpetrated by organised retail crime groups, she says. These groups seek high-value items such as alcohol, cigarettes and even costly cuts of meat. Other offenders include “serial” shoplifters, she says, and young people “who feel like they’re untouchable”. Kenny feels a lack of Garda resources allocated to support businesses in combating theft leaves shops – as well as owners and staff members – vulnerable. He lists various instances of shoplifting where assailants were threatening towards him or other workers. “We’re not being protected ... We’re vulnerable. We’re actually having to protect ourselves. It creates an awful sense of anxiety.” People shoplift for various reasons. There’s a lot of desperation ... and sometimes that can be a very unsafe situation for someone to be in Power says a dearth of policing resources makes businesses in Dublin city centre feel like they are not a priority. “It’s obvious at this point. Dublin people, Dublin businesses, aren’t a priority right now. We’re just not. And I think that the evidence will show you that ... How many times did we ring [about a theft] and we get a guard visit seven days later? What does that tell you?” Power stresses that although responding gardaí are often sympathetic and helpful in any way they can be, she believes those in decision-making roles within the force – and in Government – are failing to provide adequate support to businesses affected by rising theft. She says during big policing operations this summer – for high-profile football matches such as the Europa League final, and concerts such as Taylor Swift – instances of crime at the shop fell. “Because it’s just a known fact that when they’re [gardaí] walking around, we just don’t get that level of crime,” she says. “We don’t want staff to have to deal with this, but we’re being forced to deal with this because we’re not getting supports from the guards ... Really Government level, I suppose, is where it’s coming from.” Without support, Dublin will be left without the independent businesses that offer an alternative to fast-fashion giants, she says. Insp Damian Boland of the Garda National Crime Prevention Unit says retailers have expressed frustration to gardaí at tardy response times to theft reports, as well as a lack of feedback following a report being made. Insp Boland – who is in regular contact with retailers and their representative bodies through biannual forums and other conferences – says part of the reason for increased theft figures is the Garda’s active encouragement of retailers to report every theft. [ Retail group calls for share of Apple fundsOpens in new window ] Operation Tairge, he says, was launched last December as a direct response to the rise in retail theft. The operation aims to reduce retail crime, with a specific focus on organised retail crime groups (ORC) and recidivist offenders. Retail theft will never go away, he says, but he hopes that if more people are held responsible for crimes by gardaí, the rate of thefts will stagnate and fall. “From our point of view, we’re pushing for reports [of thefts] to go in ... if we go after the top offenders, and if we go after the ORCs, and make it less attractive for that kind of criminality,” he says. Since launching last December, several people have been before the courts on theft charges following Operation Tairge activity. According to Garda literature on Operation Tairge, retail theft “also has an impact on staff retention, recruitment and personal safety while at work”. Buckley says the level of aggression that sometimes goes with such instances is having a “huge impact” on owners, staff and their families. “A lot of staff find that it’s just too threatening and upsetting,” she says. “It’s hard to retain staff.” Staff safety is a key consideration for Nine Crows, Power adds. “I want people to feel comfortable working here in the city, and not having to be dealing with these situations. It can be very intimidating for people to be confronted with a situation like that. People shoplift for various reasons. There’s a lot of desperation ... and sometimes that can be a very unsafe situation for someone to be in.” Power believes the rise in theft might point to a wider societal issue. At their shop, people who commit theft come from “every walk of life”, she says. “It is just across all demographics of people.” “I don’t think many people go out every day for the craic, just to rob something – there is obviously a bigger issue here,” she says. “Are people struggling? Are costs just too high? Are people feeling under pressure? ... There could be various reasons why [people are] stealing at this point.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Davide Barbuscia (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s assets under management hit a record high for the third straight quarter as a U.S. stock market rally boosted inflows, while the world's largest asset manager continued a push to expand its footprint in private markets. Assets managed by BlackRock shot to $11.48 trillion in the period, compared with $9.10 trillion a year earlier and $10.65 trillion in the second quarter, the company said on Friday. That growth came as stocks reversed an August sell-off and broadened their rally in the third quarter, boosted by renewed hopes of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. BlackRock is expanding its offerings to become an all-in-one platform for investors by integrating public and private markets. "Our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working," Larry Fink, chairman and CEO, said in a statement. The company's shares were recently up 3.6% on Friday. They have advanced about 18% in 2024 as of last close, trailing the 21% jump in the S&P 500. Last week, the New York-based firm completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, adding over $100 billion in assets to its kitty. Later this year, it is expected to close its $3.2 billion acquisition of private markets data provider Preqin. The two deals are expected to bolster BlackRock's presence in infrastructure investments and in private markets, both key areas of growth. "Growing public deficits are only going to expand the role of private markets in powering economic growth," Fink said in an earnings call on Friday. BlackRock registered $160 billion in long-term net inflows in the third quarter. Total net inflows hit a quarterly record of $221.18 billion, up from $2.57 billion a year ago. A majority of the long-term inflows were captured by ETFs, at $97.41 billion. Clients poured in $62.74 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income products. Asset managers have contended with softer inflows in recent years as interest rate hikes boosted the appeal of safe-haven assets like cash. But with interest rates expected to fall as the Federal Reserve continues a long-anticipated easing cycle it kicked off in September, some of that money could flow into assets such as fixed income products, a development Fink said could occur in a more “normalized” but "relatively high-rate environment.” Equity market benchmarks finished higher in the third quarter, with the S&P 500 gaining 5.4%, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.2%. BlackRock's net income rose to $1.63 billion, or $10.90 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $1.60 billion, or $10.66 per share, a year earlier. "The combination of a strong ETF franchise, an expansion into private markets, a favorable market tailwind, and contributions from acquisitions combined to widen the moat around BlackRock,” said Catherine Seifert, equity analyst at CFRA.

Title: IOG CEO: Cardano (ADA) ‘Wants To Be a Real Cryptocurrency and Not the Patron of BlackRock and Wall Street for Number Go Up Preferences’

Charles Hoskinson, co-creator of Cardano (ADA), addressed the recent shift in sentiment surrounding Cardano in a post on X on October 10. According to Hoskinson, the negative discourse is not indicative of failure but rather a consequence of the implementation of the Voltaire governance phase. He suggested that long-standing issues, such as unmet roadmap objectives, unfunded strategies, and partnerships that haven’t been formed, are coming to the forefront now that the ecosystem is transitioning to a more adaptive governance model under Voltaire. Hoskinson acknowledged that the ecosystem has not previously scaled to address the evolving needs of the community, but he expressed confidence that Voltaire’s governance framework is capable of addressing these concerns. He shared that he, too, has a lengthy list of unresolved issues that could not be tackled prior to this shift in governance. Specifically, Hoskinson mentioned that working with a Cardano Native Asset (CNA) — as part of the Midnight project — has made him acutely aware of challenges such as liquidity and asset custody. While he plans to continue contributing to these areas, he emphasized that the new on-chain governance model will also take on the responsibility of solving these issues. He referenced stablecoin support as another area where the governance structure will play a vital role in ensuring growth and security. Hoskinson contrasted Cardano’s open governance approach with other cryptocurrency projects, stating that Cardano’s commitment to transparency and public decision-making distinguishes it from others in the space. According to Hoskinson, while other projects may rely on opaque “backroom deals,” Cardano operates in a manner that is transparent to its global community, which spans over 100 countries. He stressed that the ecosystem’s governance is dedicated to long-term progress and integrity, standing in contrast to short-term market manipulation or companies seeking financial benefits. Hoskinson concluded by reinforcing that Cardano is not in decline but is instead thriving and growing. He asserted that Cardano remains dedicated to its goal of being a genuine cryptocurrency, as opposed to aligning with financial giants like BlackRock or catering to the preferences of Wall Street, whose focus he criticized as being driven solely by financial gain. You all may have noticed that the Twitter sentiment around Cardano has been more negative lately. This change isn't a reflection of our project somehow failing, but rather the desired result of Voltaire. There have been years of pent-up grievances, unexplored road map items,… On October 8, Cardano Ambassador Mauro Andreoli announced via the social media platform X that he and Lucas Macchia had successfully signed the first legally enforceable contract on the Cardano blockchain. The contract, compliant with Argentine law, marks a significant step toward the integration of blockchain technology into the legal realm. Andreoli emphasized that this agreement can be upheld in court, allowing any violations to be pursued legally, with obligations fulfilled in Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, ADA. The contract was a loan agreement between Andreoli and Macchia, valued at 10,000 ADA, with a four-month repayment term and a 10% interest rate. According to Andreoli, the transaction was notarized using a unique transaction ID, which is referenced in the legal documents attached to the agreement. Although Andreoli expressed excitement about this milestone, he mentioned that the full details of the contract remain private, as they include sensitive information such as his ID number, home address, and wallet information. Andreoli highlighted the importance of this event, calling it a major milestone for both the Cardano ecosystem and blockchain technology in Argentina. He believes that this legally enforceable smart contract paves the way for further use of blockchain in legal agreements, establishing legal precedents and simplifying future transactions. This development could potentially encourage the widespread adoption of blockchain-based agreements across various industries. He also discussed the adaptability of the framework, suggesting that the same structure could be applied to other types of contracts, such as real estate leases, purchase agreements, and other business transactions requiring legal support. The existing legal framework in Argentina, combined with the flexibility of blockchain contracts, provides a solid foundation for future growth and development in the space. Andreoli further pointed out that this milestone doesn’t just benefit individuals but could also open doors for businesses in the Cardano ecosystem. He mentioned companies such as NMKR, EMURGO, Lago, and PALM Economy, which could use this development to establish legally sound operational frameworks, enhancing trust and credibility in blockchain-based business models.4o This structure and the associated benefits will also enable all companies within the Cardano ecosystem, such as @nmkr_io , @emurgo_io , @IagonOfficial , and @palmeconomy , to legally structure their businesses if they choose to do so.

Stock markets overcame the August selloff and broadened their rally in the third quarter, driven by renewed hopes of a soft landing for the world's largest economy after encouraging inflation data.

Title: Cardano Hosts First Legally Enforceable Smart Contract In Argentina As Hoskinson Asserts ADA Isn’t Dying

The Cardano network has achieved a major feat by hosting its first legally enforceable smart contract signed in Argentina and under the jurisdiction of its courts. Input Output Global chief technology officer Romain Pellerin highlighted this historic feat in a recent post on X, stating: “Cardano paves the way of legally enforceable smart contracts in Argentina.” #Cardano paves the way of legally enforceable smart contracts in Argentina 🇦🇷Congrats @MauroAndreoliA et al. 🖖#web3 #lawonchain https://t.co/8Psfb1NRCe Cardano ambassador Mauro Andreoli recently announced to the Cardano community the signing of the first legally and judicially enforceable contract on the Cardano network, over which Argentina’s courts have jurisdiction. The contract is a loan agreement between Andreoli and Lucas Macchia for 10,000 Cardano (ADA) tokens — valued at around $3,380 — with four-month repayment at a 10% interest rate. The pair also signed a legal document outlining important details of the smart contract loan, including the blockchain and wallet used and the Transaction ID. Andreoli posited in an Oct. 8 X post that this marks the first time an Argentine court can implement full payment in the ADA cryptocurrency from a Cardano smart contract: “We did it, we have just signed the first legally and judicially enforceable contract on the Cardano network, in full compliance with the laws of the Argentine Republic.” Andreoli further noted that the milestone could encourage Argentine courts to recognize smart contracts more widely as a technology for streamlining commercial transactions. “Legally, this establishes evidence and streamlines procedural steps, marking the initial phase of creating favorable jurisprudence in the country and facilitating commercial transactions.” Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson has reiterated his conviction in the Cardano blockchain amid negative sentiment escalation. “Cardano isn’t dying. It’s thriving and growing. It’s also one of the last cryptocurrencies that still wants to be a real cryptocurrency and not the patron of Blackrock and Wall Street for number go up preferences,” Hoskinson wrote. In a long post on X, Hoskinson suggested the reason negative sentiment around Cardano has increased recently is not about Cardano “somehow failing” but “rather the desired result of Voltaire.” The Cardano network transitioned to the Age of Voltaire on Sept. 1. He explained the reason for this: “There have been years of pent-up grievances, unexplored road map items, unfunded growth strategies, and needed partnerships that haven’t been addressed due to Cardano’s governance not scaling to meet the needs of the ecosystem.”

This change isn’t a reflection of our project somehow failing, but rather the desired result of Voltaire.” He wrote in a post shared on X. Like other blockchain networks, the Cardano network is no stranger to failed projects. In a report shared by AlphaQuest, Cardano topped the list on Dead Coins. Notably, 74% of projects on the network have become inactive, and as a result, Cardano has now emerged as one of the ten ecosystems with the most defunct coins. In his post, Hoskinson revealed that the development was associated with failing to scale Cardano’s governance to meet the ecosystem’s needs. Per his notations, the network has yet to explore several road map items, growth strategies, and partnerships necessary to drive growth. However, Hoskinson added that the presence of the Voltaire era, which is expected to bring about decentralization, is likely to turn things around. On September 1, 2024, Cardano completed the Chang Hard Fork, marking its official entrance into the highly anticipated Voltaire era. Another promising project is the Cardano Native Asset, which Hoskinson considers essential for the asset’s success. According to him, custody and liquidity are also essential. Hoskinson further emphasized the structure of Cardano, explaining that the network’s transparent landscape has played a major role in influencing public opinion. He went on to spotlight the role of the network’s on-chain government in its commitment to serving network users in over 100 countries. The Cardano boss stressed that “short-term thinking, market manipulation, and companies seeking a handout” have no place in the Cardano community. “Cardano isn’t dying. It’s thriving and growing. It’s also one of the last cryptocurrencies that still wants to be a real cryptocurrency and not the patron of Blackrock and Wall Street for number go-up preferences.” He asserted.

Title: China shares tumble as markets await stimulus news—and Tesla takes a hit

Shares in mainland China tumbled as U.S. inflation data clouded hopes for another Fed rate cut and traders awaited Beijing’s Saturday briefing on stimulus measures. China: Shares slip ahead of stimulus briefing A day after China shares rebounded on stimulus optimism, Shanghai’s SSE Composite slid 2.5%. Markets digested the unclear choices faced by the U.S. Federal Reserve, as it received U.S. inflation data for September, which came in slightly above expectations, as well as a rise in unemployment benefit numbers. Markets are cautious ahead of Beijing’s Saturday stimulus briefing, at which investors are hoping for more measures to boost the economy. Hong Kong markets were closed for a public holiday. Japan: Nikkei posts small rise and the back of banks and Uniqlo The Nikkei 225 notched a 0.57% rise as it headed into the weekend, led by the financial sector and a 6.09% jump in Uniqlo-owner Fast Retailing, which hit an all-time high after reporting stronger-than-expected revenue and profits for the year. Europe: Shares largely unchanged as traders weigh U.S. CPI and unemployment data European stocks hovered early Friday as traders digested U.S. inflation and jobless benefits data in the run-up to China’s Saturday stimulus briefing. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 0.13% in early trading, while the STOXX Europe 600 was down 0.07%. BP slipped some 0.5% after it announced that lower than expected refining margins would cut quarterly earnings by $400-600 million. U.S. premarket slips as Tesla robotaxi reveal does not impress The main U.S. indexes were all down slightly in premarket trading Friday. Investors digested the slightly warm September CPI inflation numbers, and punished Tesla with a 5.88% premarket haircut after its Thursday evening Cybercab reveal failed to live up to their hopes. On Thursday, Wall Street retreated from its records following the dual reports showing cooling inflation and climbing unemployment. And earnings season continues… JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock report on Friday, while Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup all show their numbers Tuesday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

What caught my eye this week. I belatedly enjoyed Dumb Money on Netflix this week. Finumus put me onto it as a chaser to the story in my Active Antics links below about the Canadian who made and lost $300m trading Tesla options. Dumb Money is hilarious (whereas that second story is almost tragic) but it’s also a solid piece of filmmaking. The movie deftly captures the time and (all over the) place when Reddit GameStop trading was at its height. From Covid in the backdrop and mask-wearing on the metro to how it transmutes Pied Piper and YouTuber Roaring Kitty’s riffing into the void into almost a communal event – like some virtual version of Woodstock for Gen-Z – you can imagine it being watched in future decades as a historical drama. For a darker follow-up to this follow-up, also read of Freddie deBoer, who this week offered a cold take on why the meme trading phenomenon still comes with cult-like language from its adherents: Quite literally, everyone who bought into GameStop can’t make money off of doing so because somebody’s got to be late to the selloff. Which is why this whole thing is such a particularly sad expression of aspirational capitalism; the meme stock people celebrate their own jocular spirit of togetherness, but fundamentally all of them are looking, someday, to fuck the people who wait too long. For my part, I said sell very near the height on 28 January 2021. But of course I only had a couple of shares on Freetrade and I’d never have made the stacks racked up by the early diamond hands. Then again neither would most of those who followed Roaring Kitty and the gang. Dumb Money is a great story but it’s not a guide to investing that anyone should follow – except maybe with some fun (dumb) money. Indeed hundreds of millions of ordinary people got richer in that period just by holding the index. As for once in a generation events, joining thousands of spaced-out hippies in a farm would probably be more profitable than playing pass-the-parcel with Reddit’s most degenerate gamblers.

Or peruse a few of our best articles. The money perspective article is interesting. I plain refused to believe the similarly boosterish Aeon article about this in the West, in a similar vein, but perhaps they were also right, given that big picture. It’s harder to get a perspective across a lifetime, because I also accumulated capital, so the reference point is changing. “Dumb Money” and films like it are wonderful financial lessons for investors especially the small guys They also allow the amateur investor the vicarious pleasure of “trading “ without actually having to put any money down except the price of the film ticket! Education never stops,human nature,s willingness to get a bargain/gamble is eternal For a small investor like me constant reinforcement of the benefits of index investing and then “staying the course” is a dynamic state that needs constant reminders Hats off to the artists and bloggers(Monevator) that help most of us to keep on the straight and narrow investing path! xxd09 The Causal Fallacy link struck a nerve. I have had to spend a fair bit of time around Stratford in East London, not the post-Olympic bit but the original town. There is little crime compared to when I was a youngster but lots of bad behaviour, ranging from rude to the obnoxious to the downright intimidating. Society needs rules, or an etiquette, to work and it does not take much for it to break down. People copy others and if they see someone ‘getting away’ with it they are more likely to do the same, to the detriment of everyone. zero’ charges as ‘materially misleading’ – AIC. The IT sector is getting to the point where their charges figures are going to be forever suspect. I never did see a satisfactory explanation of how their charges are listed wrongly. It looks to me like they are trying to cover up high charges. “Boomers’ money secrets are a ticking time bomb for their kids” Fortunately, or wisely, we have so far avoided that sort of mess. But I still worry a little as to how, when I have pegged out, my widow and offspring will locate all our money. It’s all listed in notebooks but obviously not with passwords and the like. And of course I’ve not produced a Treasure Map of where all our gold sovereigns are buried. Actually we don’t have any gold sovereigns but if we did how/where would we store them? I thought I’d had a couple of decent ideas but both opportunities have since vanished. And even if I found a satisfactory solution, how/where would I record it? A word of warning: when a cousin died a swine at the Care Home stole her keys and let herself into the house and stole some valuables. “ Quite literally, everyone who bought into GameStop can’t make money off of doing so because somebody’s got to be late to the selloff. Which is why this whole thing is such a particularly sad expression of aspirational capitalism; the meme stock people celebrate their own jocular spirit of togetherness, but fundamentally all of them are looking, someday, to fuck the people who wait too long.” This encapsulates Bitcoin perfectly. Bitcoin is sadly much more harmful than meme stocks due to pointless and eye watering energy wastage. The Canadian Tesla option guy story on Sherwood is possibly even better than Dumb Money. There’s probably whole tiers of discussion one could have about the duties and boilerplate protection for “financial advice” from organisations but it does seem that he might have a case that professionals singularly failed to save him from himself. Though I suspect reading between the lines he might also have been suing them if they’d moved a substantial chunk of his portfolio into boring indexes and he’d missed out on further Tesla growth. Guess I can’t quite understand the mentality that let it all ride on one company (and let’s face it one highly unstable individual). Mind you I’d likely have cashed out at below the first C$10m and gone to live a quiet life. Great to hear Monevator name up in lights on the fantastic Merryn (Summerset Webb) Talks Money podcast this week! Hopefully that drove some extra traffic to the website. The episode was “How safe is your pension pot” released on Tuesday, if anyone wants to listen (only 12 mins long) John Stepek is clearly a long term reader, which is (well deserved ) high praise, for the treasure trove of insight that is Monevator “…joining thousands of spaced-out hippies in a farm…” Unless it’s the one with the special kool-aid To many Keith Gill was a folk hero and probably remains so. There were lots of Keith Gills but he cut through just at the right time. It’s more a socio-political story than investing one of course and the lessons and some of basic themes from the story will not doubt replayed in part in the forthcoming US election. I will be booking a movie ticket for some light entertainment. @AlCam. Regarding whether I am buying pre-retirement or at retirement. I think the idea that we can break up the process discretely into accumulation vs. deaccumulation is not always helpful. Twenty years ago, my post-tax income might have been 100% of my net worth. I was in accumulation mode. Now, it’s 5%. Practically, my net worth is being driven more by my portfolio than my job. Retirement is coming in the next few years. I essentially look more like a deaccumulator. So, my portfolio needs to reflect that now. I’m also accumulating linkers to partially hedge the risk that real yields fall back into negative territory. I fear that much more than real yields rising. My bias is to buy longer-dated linkers now, not short-dated ones. I still have incoming cash and nominal bonds to hedge that. And, yes, this is somewhat of an active view. About FX hedging, as I said, I see that as a totally different view from whether I buy foreign linkers or not. If I had a foreign portfolio of 70% equities and 30% bonds, and decided I wanted to be 50% FX hedged, it matters not whether that 50% is 30% FX hedged bonds and 20% FX hedged equities or 50% FX hedged equities. Same currency position. Right now, I am not hedged on many of my USD assets. Theoretically, FX risk is uncompensated volatility, so I should hedge. I see FX, though, as basically an active decision for every currency pair. @GF – have also been dismayed by how poorly the ‘over-reporting’ of investment trust charges has been explained. Ultimately though, as I understand it, the argument boils down to this: Investment trusts are listed companies with a relatively stable number of shares (being closed-ended), therefore their price is determined not only by the value of the assets (net asset value, or NAV) into which they invest, but also supply and demand for the shares in the investment trust. That supply and demand is affected (upfront) by the costs charged to NAV, which is why most investment trusts trade at a discount to NAV. Investors will be willing to pay a higher price for £100 of NAV that’s subject to 0.3% per year of costs (e.g. management fees) than £100 of NAV subject to 2% per year of costs, all else being equal, i.e. being relatively predictable in advance, costs are ‘priced in’ (upfront) as part of the share price discount. With the costs already being reflected in the price paid for the shares, the costs obviously act as a drag on the NAV over time, but they don’t act as a drag on the share price at which you can sell later on down the line (unless the costs change, affecting the discount rate). Therefore “costs are not a direct drag on investment returns”, so you can act as if the costs were zero, the same as for shares in any other listed company like Shell or HSBC or AstraZeneca (all of which also pay lots of money to management to make capital allocation decisions as part of the running of the company, but are disclosed to investors as not having an ‘ongoing charge’). With open-ended structures like funds and ETFs, by contrast, which (more or less) can only be bought or sold at NAV, costs act as a direct drag on investment returns. Hope that helps Screwup by me. My comment #11 seems to have gone into this thread, when it was aimed at the prior thread. @John Thank you for your explanation. In your explanation you say ” the costs obviously act as a drag on the NAV over time, but they don’t act as a drag on the share price at which you can sell later on down the line (unless the costs change, affecting the discount rate). ” I would say thats not true because if the share price is at a discount to the NAV then any reduction in the NAV due to costs will be reflected in the share price assuming the discount remains the same. When you do sell at a later date on down the line then the costs will have eaten into the returns on the NAV and assuming the discount remains the same, will have to be reflected in the share price. Costs do impact on returns and will register in the share price, you cant disregard them. @ZX (#11): Thanks for the interesting additional info re the Q’s I posted at the earlier @TA posting. Very interesting and I get the idea of getting your longer term [linker] hedges in whilst they are relatively well priced and covering the nearer term using a different approach whilst you are still working.

Title: Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) Considers Expansion in Gujarat or Assam, Urges India to Boost Incentives for Suppliers

We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI News You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss. The AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification. Another notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician in a clean room assembling a semiconductor chip using a microscope. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77 Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) provides equipment, services, and software for the semiconductor industry. Latest reports, published by news outlets in India, suggest that the chipmaker could set up operations at Dholera and Sanand in Gujarat or Morigaon in Assam. The reports quote Prabu Raja, the president of the Semiconductor Products Group at Applied Materials, on the sidelines of the Semicon India 2024 event. Raja advised authorities in India to make incentives more lucrative for the suppliers. Per the executive, the company wanted suppliers to get the same incentives, or close to the same, that manufacturers did. Raja, however, praised the cost benefits of working in the Asian country. Overall AMAT ranks 18th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: ‘Cardano Isn’t Dying’: Charles Hoskinson Defends Project Amid ADA Price Criticism

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson took X to defend the project from its detractors, arguing that the network has continued to grow and thrive despite the criticism. As ADA’s price falls 2.9%, some analysts warn of the next key level to watch out for. On Thursday, Charles Hoskinson addressed the adverse response towards Cardano in an X post. Hoskinson noted that the crypto community’s sentiment about the project has lately been more negative than usual. However, he argued that Twitter’s sentiment change isn’t a reflection of the project failing “but rather the desired result of Voltaire.” Cardano’s “Voltaire” era is set to turn the network into “the most advanced blockchain governance system,” focusing on decentralized governance and its future sustainability. Hoskinson believes that Cardano’s collaborative efforts and the transparency of the network is what sets it apart from the rest of the crypto space. “It’s why we are loathed by a lot of others. Their backroom deals and dirty tricks can’t be hidden because there is no one to ask to do it under the table,” he added. In the post, the project’s founder also underscored Cardano’s “passion” for integrity and long-term vision for growth and progress: Short-term thinking, market manipulation, and companies seeking a handout have no role or place here. That’s the difference that makes a difference. Lastly, Hoskinson remarked that the project is not dying but “thriving and growing.” He that ADA is one of the last cryptocurrencies still wanting to be a real crypto instead of “the patron of Blackrock and Wall Street for number go up preferences.” The crypto community reacted to Hoskinson’s message, with many arguing that, regardless of the developments, the Network’s “lack of volume” and “limited” ecosystem growth remains a problem for its community. Meanwhile, part of ADA’s community agreed with Hoskinson, concurring that “it is the only chain that has truly built what I can only see as the groundwork to deliver on the promise of crypto.” Despite the ongoing criticism, some market watchers remain bullish about ADA’s future price action. Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello recently predicted that the cryptocurrency will “easily” reclaim the $1 mark before year’s end. To Gambardello, the exponential surge “could happen fast” and leave many “flabbergasted.” Additionally, he stated that after the 200% surge, ADA’s potential targets of $5 and $10 would “look more realistic.” Conversely, crypto analyst Sebastian warned about a key level to watch for following ADA’s recent performance. Earlier this week, the analyst highlighted that ADA showed signs of a breakout after retesting the trendline it had recently broken above $0.35. However, the cryptocurrency’s price dropped 2.9% in the last 24 hours, falling below the $0.34 mark. The analyst signaled that ADA must hold the current levels as failing to bounce from the $0.335 level could send the token to a retest of the $0.30 support level. As of this writing, ADA is trading at $0.337, a 1.95% and 2% decline in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Shares trade flat on the NSE at ₹609 “Market is likely to remain volatile in the near-term alternating between FII selling and DII buying. Attractive valuations in other markets, particularly in Chinese stocks, will facilitate further selling by FIIs in India since Indian valuations are elevated. Concerns of earnings downgrades in H2 FY 25 render Indian valuations difficult to sustain. However, the sustained flows into the domestic mutual funds, where monthly SIPs have set a new record of Rs 24500 in September, will ensure that all FII selling will be easily absorbed by DII buying. This has been the trend in October so far. A healthy trend in the market is the leading private sector banks getting accumulated and showing resilience even in a weak market. This is the most attractively valued segment in this market where there is no valuation comfort. Lot of stock-specific action can be expected in the coming days in response to Q2 results. Banking and IT are likely to post reasonably good results.” US Sep CPI print came in higher than expected. Headline CPI print came in at 2.4% yoy against expected 2.3%.

While thematic category-based schemes are getting lion’s share of flows, rest of the flows have been spread uniformly across Multicap, Flexicap, Large and Midcap, Large cap, Multi Asset, Midcap and Small cap schemes. Arbitrage funds due to lower spreads and liquidity funds due to quarter end redemptions from institutional investors have seen outflows while medium to long duration funds like gilt and corporate bond funds have seen significant pick up in net flows in the anticipation of future rate cuts”.

Given yesterday’s report we expect Sep-24 PCE/Core PCE at 2/2.6% YoY. For rate cuts, we expect the Fed to cut by another 50bps cut in CY24, unless Nov-24 unemployment rate comes near 4%. We are keeping a close eye on the US 10y, which inched to 4.1% which can add to pressure again in EM assets in Q4CY24 - we retain our US 10y outlook at 4-4.4% for CY24 as noted in our mid year outlook in July The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage surged to 6.32% as of October 10th, rebounding further from its mid-September 2022 low of 6.08% seen September 26th, according to Freddie Mac.

It extended the downswing in the first week of October as well. However, it found support at ₹430 this week.

Going ahead, we expect the stock of Laurus Labs to build further momentum in the rally and touch ₹530 in the near-term.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI News You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss. The AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification. Another notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of IT professionals working on a digital platform, indicating the company's agile digital services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a California-based real estate trust that operates data centers and other technology assets. HSBC analyst Phani Kanumuri recently upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold with a price target of $1,000, up from $865. The advisory said operational momentum for Equinix and Digital Realty were set to improve significantly in 2025. Data center demand has far outstripped supply in 2024, due to strong artificial intelligence-driven demand and constrained supply in major markets, yet the stocks have underperformed, the advisory told investors in a research note. HSBC said improved utilization is likely to accelerate Equinix's 2025 revenue growth to 10%. Overall EQIX ranks 25th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of EQIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EQIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) markets process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor industry. Investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald recently penned a research note on the semiconductor space, noting that recent issues from Intel and Samsung were likely to negatively impact the semiconductor equipment market. Analysts at the advisory stressed that orders were bottoming and fundamentals would modestly recover for semi stocks in CY25 with even greater recovery into CY26. Per Cantor, regulatory risks remained, but cyclically the market was at the point where the group was a buy.

Title: New ‘Transparency’ Act Forces Small Businesses To Register Personal Data With Federal Law Enforcement

Posted on 10/10/2024 3:00:32 PM PDT by george76 By year-end, Americans will be required to hand over data on their small businesses to the federal government’s law enforcement database... The Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) is an aggressive domestic program to federally register millions of unsuspecting small business owners under the guise of an “anti-money laundering initiative.” By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury. Such small businesses include limited liability companies, corporations, “and any other entities created by the filing of a document with a secretary of state or any similar office in the United States.” They will also be required to turn over personal data, which can include uploading their driver’s license, passport, marriage certificate, and other non-business related information, into this law enforcement database. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect more than 33 million small business owners, who employ 61 million Americans. The Department of the Treasury already has a history of targeting innocent Americans. During the Lois Lerner scandal, the IRS was forced to admit that it used political partisanship to specifically target conservative groups. The unelected bureaucracy was ultimately forced to settle with the innocent Americans they targeted. CTA is the for-profit equivalent of Department of the Treasury’s partisan overreach. With the IRS scandal, nonprofit organizations with the word “tea party” and “patriot” were targeted and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status. Under the CTA, an overly aggressive anti-Second Amendment bureaucrat could decide to do a word search for “gun,” “firearm,” “patriot,” “freedom,” or similar, and they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, investigate, and audit. It happened before with nonprofits, and it will happen again with “for profit” small businesses. The true goal of CTA appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The federal government is moving quickly to implement the CTA, as millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists (only 13 percent of businesses in California, 5 percent in Ohio, and 4 percent in Pennsylvania have registered). Millions of businesses owners face becoming felons in three months unless they comply. There are currently seven separate lawsuits challenging the validity of the law. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bill to give businesses more time to comply, but the bill is sitting in the Senate going nowhere. A recent email from their accountant may have been the first time many businesses realized this law exists. The legal confusion and seeming lack of urgency to inform the public suggest that FinCEN’s true intent is to “catch” millions of small business owners in “non-compliance” so that they can be investigated and audited by Department of the Treasury and punished. Serious criminals will not be concerned about paperwork violations. Mandatory compliance is required by January 1, 2025, or business owners will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day (or up to 10 percent of a company’s annual receipts) and up to two years in federal prison. Unconstitutional Power Grab.. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, but his veto was overridden. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the feds are moving to collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem murky at best. And the information collected goes to FinCEN, the counterterrorism arm of the Treasury. Business owners have to register with a terrorism department. This seems to infer criminality on millions of law-abiding citizens. Under CTA, for-profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and under $5 million in revenue are in the crosshairs. But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

"By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added]. It seems to be the law of our general nature.” - Thomas Jefferson (Letter to Edward Carrington January 16, 1787)Pelosi: "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it." (non-FR; 6 sec.)Illegals are indeed getting immediate Social Security, contrary to Democrat claims (7.11.24)Arizona Sheriff: Illegal Immigrants Being Handed $5,000 Visa Gift Cards, Cell Phones, And Plane Tickets (12.7.23)Democrats [and RINOs] Are Terrified Of An Educated And Informed Public (3.12.23) Since Congress and likewise renegade states have repeatedly proven that they are enemies of the people imo, it is now up to Democratic and Republican Trump supporters to effectively "impeach and remove" ALL (exceptions?) state and federal lawmakers and executives in November. In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so. Finally, let's not allow the anti-Trump media try to fade our memories of what we witnessed on July 13. BREAKING!

"By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added]. It seems to be the law of our general nature.” - Thomas Jefferson (Letter to Edward Carrington January 16, 1787)Pelosi: "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it."

In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so. Finally, let's not allow the anti-Trump media try to fade our memories of what we witnessed on July 13. BREAKING!

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury. Such small businesses include limited liability companies, corporations, “and any other entities created by the filing of a document with a secretary of state or any similar office in the United States.” They will also be required to turn over personal data, which can include uploading their driver’s license, passport, marriage certificate, and other non-business related information, into this law enforcement database. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect more than 33 million small business owners, who employ 61 million Americans. The Department of the Treasury already has a history of targeting innocent Americans. During the Lois Lerner scandal, the IRS was forced to admit that it used political partisanship to specifically target conservative groups. The unelected bureaucracy was ultimately forced to settle with the innocent Americans they targeted. CTA is the for-profit equivalent of Department of the Treasury’s partisan overreach. With the IRS scandal, nonprofit organizations with the word “tea party” and “patriot” were targeted and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status. Under the CTA, an overly aggressive anti-Second Amendment bureaucrat could decide to do a word search for “gun,” “firearm,” “patriot,” “freedom,” or similar, and they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, investigate, and audit. It happened before with nonprofits, and it will happen again with “for profit” small businesses. The true goal of CTA appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The federal government is moving quickly to implement the CTA, as millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists (only 13 percent of businesses in California, 5 percent in Ohio, and 4 percent in Pennsylvania have registered). Millions of businesses owners face becoming felons in three months unless they comply. There are currently seven separate lawsuits challenging the validity of the law. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bill to give businesses more time to comply, but the bill is sitting in the Senate going nowhere. A recent email from their accountant may have been the first time many businesses realized this law exists. The legal confusion and seeming lack of urgency to inform the public suggest that FinCEN’s true intent is to “catch” millions of small business owners in “non-compliance” so that they can be investigated and audited by Department of the Treasury and punished. Serious criminals will not be concerned about paperwork violations. Mandatory compliance is required by January 1, 2025, or business owners will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day (or up to 10 percent of a company’s annual receipts) and up to two years in federal prison. Unconstitutional Power Grab.. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, but his veto was overridden. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the feds are moving to collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem murky at best. And the information collected goes to FinCEN, the counterterrorism arm of the Treasury. Business owners have to register with a terrorism department. This seems to infer criminality on millions of law-abiding citizens. Under CTA, for-profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and under $5 million in revenue are in the crosshairs. But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

"By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added]. It seems to be the law of our general nature.” - Thomas Jefferson (Letter to Edward Carrington January 16, 1787)Pelosi: "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it."

In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so. Finally, let's not allow the anti-Trump media try to fade our memories of what we witnessed on July 13. BREAKING!

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect more than 33 million small business owners, who employ 61 million Americans. The Department of the Treasury already has a history of targeting innocent Americans. During the Lois Lerner scandal, the IRS was forced to admit that it used political partisanship to specifically target conservative groups. The unelected bureaucracy was ultimately forced to settle with the innocent Americans they targeted. CTA is the for-profit equivalent of Department of the Treasury’s partisan overreach. With the IRS scandal, nonprofit organizations with the word “tea party” and “patriot” were targeted and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status. Under the CTA, an overly aggressive anti-Second Amendment bureaucrat could decide to do a word search for “gun,” “firearm,” “patriot,” “freedom,” or similar, and they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, investigate, and audit. It happened before with nonprofits, and it will happen again with “for profit” small businesses. The true goal of CTA appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The federal government is moving quickly to implement the CTA, as millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists (only 13 percent of businesses in California, 5 percent in Ohio, and 4 percent in Pennsylvania have registered). Millions of businesses owners face becoming felons in three months unless they comply. There are currently seven separate lawsuits challenging the validity of the law. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bill to give businesses more time to comply, but the bill is sitting in the Senate going nowhere. A recent email from their accountant may have been the first time many businesses realized this law exists. The legal confusion and seeming lack of urgency to inform the public suggest that FinCEN’s true intent is to “catch” millions of small business owners in “non-compliance” so that they can be investigated and audited by Department of the Treasury and punished. Serious criminals will not be concerned about paperwork violations. Mandatory compliance is required by January 1, 2025, or business owners will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day (or up to 10 percent of a company’s annual receipts) and up to two years in federal prison. Unconstitutional Power Grab.. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, but his veto was overridden. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the feds are moving to collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem murky at best. And the information collected goes to FinCEN, the counterterrorism arm of the Treasury. Business owners have to register with a terrorism department. This seems to infer criminality on millions of law-abiding citizens. Under CTA, for-profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and under $5 million in revenue are in the crosshairs. But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Department of the Treasury already has a history of targeting innocent Americans. During the Lois Lerner scandal, the IRS was forced to admit that it used political partisanship to specifically target conservative groups. The unelected bureaucracy was ultimately forced to settle with the innocent Americans they targeted. CTA is the for-profit equivalent of Department of the Treasury’s partisan overreach. With the IRS scandal, nonprofit organizations with the word “tea party” and “patriot” were targeted and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status. Under the CTA, an overly aggressive anti-Second Amendment bureaucrat could decide to do a word search for “gun,” “firearm,” “patriot,” “freedom,” or similar, and they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, investigate, and audit. It happened before with nonprofits, and it will happen again with “for profit” small businesses. The true goal of CTA appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The federal government is moving quickly to implement the CTA, as millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists (only 13 percent of businesses in California, 5 percent in Ohio, and 4 percent in Pennsylvania have registered). Millions of businesses owners face becoming felons in three months unless they comply. There are currently seven separate lawsuits challenging the validity of the law. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bill to give businesses more time to comply, but the bill is sitting in the Senate going nowhere. A recent email from their accountant may have been the first time many businesses realized this law exists. The legal confusion and seeming lack of urgency to inform the public suggest that FinCEN’s true intent is to “catch” millions of small business owners in “non-compliance” so that they can be investigated and audited by Department of the Treasury and punished. Serious criminals will not be concerned about paperwork violations. Mandatory compliance is required by January 1, 2025, or business owners will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day (or up to 10 percent of a company’s annual receipts) and up to two years in federal prison. Unconstitutional Power Grab.. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, but his veto was overridden. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the feds are moving to collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem murky at best. And the information collected goes to FinCEN, the counterterrorism arm of the Treasury. Business owners have to register with a terrorism department. This seems to infer criminality on millions of law-abiding citizens. Under CTA, for-profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and under $5 million in revenue are in the crosshairs. But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

"By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added]. It seems to be the law of our general nature.” - Thomas Jefferson (Letter to Edward Carrington January 16, 1787)Pelosi: "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it."

In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so. Finally, let's not allow the anti-Trump media try to fade our memories of what we witnessed on July 13. BREAKING!

I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added]. It seems to be the law of our general nature.” - Thomas Jefferson (Letter to Edward Carrington January 16, 1787)Pelosi: "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it." (non-FR; 6 sec.)Illegals are indeed getting immediate Social Security, contrary to Democrat claims (7.11.24)Arizona Sheriff: Illegal Immigrants Being Handed $5,000 Visa Gift Cards, Cell Phones, And Plane Tickets (12.7.23)Democrats [and RINOs] Are Terrified Of An Educated And Informed Public (3.12.23) Since Congress and likewise renegade states have repeatedly proven that they are enemies of the people imo, it is now up to Democratic and Republican Trump supporters to effectively "impeach and remove" ALL (exceptions?) state and federal lawmakers and executives in November. In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so. Finally, let's not allow the anti-Trump media try to fade our memories of what we witnessed on July 13. BREAKING!

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The true goal of CTA appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The federal government is moving quickly to implement the CTA, as millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists (only 13 percent of businesses in California, 5 percent in Ohio, and 4 percent in Pennsylvania have registered). Millions of businesses owners face becoming felons in three months unless they comply. There are currently seven separate lawsuits challenging the validity of the law. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bill to give businesses more time to comply, but the bill is sitting in the Senate going nowhere. A recent email from their accountant may have been the first time many businesses realized this law exists. The legal confusion and seeming lack of urgency to inform the public suggest that FinCEN’s true intent is to “catch” millions of small business owners in “non-compliance” so that they can be investigated and audited by Department of the Treasury and punished. Serious criminals will not be concerned about paperwork violations. Mandatory compliance is required by January 1, 2025, or business owners will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day (or up to 10 percent of a company’s annual receipts) and up to two years in federal prison. Unconstitutional Power Grab.. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, but his veto was overridden. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the feds are moving to collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem murky at best. And the information collected goes to FinCEN, the counterterrorism arm of the Treasury. Business owners have to register with a terrorism department. This seems to infer criminality on millions of law-abiding citizens. Under CTA, for-profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and under $5 million in revenue are in the crosshairs. But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

"By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added]. It seems to be the law of our general nature.” - Thomas Jefferson (Letter to Edward Carrington January 16, 1787)Pelosi: "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it."

"By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional.

If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added].

In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Unconstitutional Power Grab.. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, but his veto was overridden. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the feds are moving to collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem murky at best. And the information collected goes to FinCEN, the counterterrorism arm of the Treasury. Business owners have to register with a terrorism department. This seems to infer criminality on millions of law-abiding citizens. Under CTA, for-profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and under $5 million in revenue are in the crosshairs. But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

"By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added].

In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so.

But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

"By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added].

In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so.

With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

"By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added]. It seems to be the law of our general nature.” - Thomas Jefferson (Letter to Edward Carrington January 16, 1787)Pelosi: "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it."

In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so.

"16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added].

In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so.

Title: The U.S. leads on chips, but China has an underrated advantage in the race to adopt AI
URL: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/10/10/china-underrated-advantage-ai-data-centers-vs-us-semiconductors-chips/
Time Published: 2024-10-10T21:00:00Z
Full Content:
Grace Shao is founder of Proem, a strategic communications consultancy focused on helping tech and AI companies on their global expansion strategy. Who will win the AI arms race? The U.S. is clearly miles ahead of China when it comes to the sophistication of its chips. But an Nvidia processor is only part of what’s needed to adopt AI. AI relies on real-world infrastructure: servers, data centers and stable power. That needs energy, land, and other resources, not just GPUs. And that can be very costly. About a month ago, a consortium of investors including Microsoft and BlackRock pledged to mobilize as much as $100 billion to build data centers in the U.S. and partner countries. “The capital spending needed for AI infrastructure and the new energy to power it goes beyond what any single company or government can finance,” Microsoft president Brad Smith explained at the time. The U.S. will need an incalculable amount of time to build up its physical infrastructure in an economy with more expensive land, labor and power. U.S. democracy also has several bottlenecks and veto points—like local legislation, regulations, and community hearings—that will delay, if not outright halt, new data center construction. And that may mean a huge advantage for China and its state-driven “command economy.” The media and investors tend to focus on computing power, and thus miss much of the real-world work that supports AI. Beijing’s industrial policy and its ability to funnel public and private resources into growing sectors swiftly will make the country a major power in the world of AI, much like it already has proved to be in clean energy and electric vehicles. Being at the leading edge of a new technology means little if a country can’t figure out how to make it work at scale. Expensive infrastructure investments today are needed to support tomorrow’s AI demand. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recognizes this: In Meta’s most recent earnings call, Zuckerberg defended heavy investments in data centers by arguing the risk of underinvestment, and missing out on “the most critical technology for the next decade and a half” was far greater. “I’d rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new infra projects,” he told analysts. The long lead time isn’t due to bottlenecks at Nvidia, but instead something far more mundane. The lead time on new power transformers and generators, needed to power the increased electricity demands from data centers, can be as long as four years. Even if the power equipment is in place, data center operators still need to wait for them to be connected to the grid. Local zoning laws and land permits would also take time, often months or years for approval. Northern Virginia currently has the U.S.’s highest concentration of data centers. According to local power utility Dominion Energy, any data center that consume over 100 megawatts of power will now need to wait as much as three additional years, on top of the current three to four years wait, to get connected to the grid. Big tech firms thus need to spend big on infrastructure today long before they can enjoy a meaningful return on their investments. And if they don’t invest now, they risk falling behind their competitors in the future, or worse, not being able to provide the raw power needed to run faster and more powerful algorithms when the technology advances further. China may be able to ramp up its AI infrastructure faster and more cheaply than the U.S. can. That may not be enough to overcome China’s weakness in producing advanced chips. But if and when China does figure out how to make powerful semiconductors, it can catch up quickly to the U.S., if not potentially overtake it. China’s state-driven system can put resources and energy into infrastructure at a speed and scale unmatched by other countries. Since 2014, the province of Guizhou has been a pilot zone for China’s data center industry. By 2022, the province already had 23 key data centers in operation or under construction, including eight very large data centers. Guizhou is now one of the highest concentrations of large data centers in the world, hosing data for both local giants like Huawei, JD.com and Alibaba, and global companies like Apple and Microsoft. Officials could replicate Guizhou’s success in another province with ample land and little urbanization. Local governments would welcome data center investment, as it leads to new jobs and tax revenue, as well as finding a productive use for land that serves little agricultural purpose. Experts in the industry are starting to realize that China’s advantage in energy and land could help ameliorate China’s lag in chip development. Wang Jian, the founder of Alibaba Cloud, said at a recent conference that China’s ready access to renewable energy gives it a better foundation for AI development compared to the U.S. Zhang Ping’an, CEO of Huawei Cloud, has emphasized China’s strengths in bandwidth, network and energy, and suggested that architectural innovation, rather than reliance on advanced AI chips, could help Chinese cloud computing come out on top. China has previously leveraged scale to build new industries. The country’s command economy rallied clean energy companies, helping grow national and international champions in green energy. Just a decade ago, China had minimal renewable energy. But thanks to government policy and strategic investments in renewable technologies and supply chains, China is now adding more than 200 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity annually. The U.S. adds just 40. Chips—and China’s lack of access to them—are what gets attention today. But infrastructure and data centers could decide the final winner of the AI arms race. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Wall Street retreated from its records on Thursday following dual reports showing cooling inflation and climbing unemployment. U.S.: Stocks slide as eager investors scale back hopes of jumbo Fed rate cutsAfter setting a new all-time high, The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Thursday 0.14% alongside the S&P 500, which was down 0.21% at the end of trading. The Nasdaq composite was nearly unchanged, moving just 0.052% by the end of the day Thursday. Cooling markets follow a surprise increase in filings for unemployment in the wake of two hurricanes and the Boeing strike. Europe: Shares waver ahead of U.S. CPI as GSK soars on court settlementEuropean stocks slid slightly on U.S inflation data. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down a marginal 0.0073% at close, saved from steeper losses as GSK surged nearly 7% on news that the pharma giant had reached a $2.2 billion deal to settle thousands of claims in U.S. courts that linked cancer cases to its heartburn drug Zantac. Meanwhile, the STOXX Europe 600 was down 0.18%. China: Shanghai and Hong Kong markets rebound on renewed stimulus hopesFollowing a sharp decline in mainland China stocks, Shanghai’s SSE Composite gained 1.32%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index surged by 2.98%, driven by renewed optimism about economic stimulus. The rebound came after Beijing announced that the finance minister would hold another stimulus briefing on Saturday, sparking expectations of further measures to support the economy. Japan: Nikkei edges up as producer prices surpass expectationsThe Nikkei 225 saw a modest 0.26% increase, led by the financial sector, as traders awaited key U.S. economic data. However, gains were limited by a higher-than-expected 2.8% rise in Japan’s producer prices, exceeding the 2.3% forecast by economists, which tempered market sentiment. And earnings season continues… JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock on Friday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

By Blizzard Entertainment 1 day ago The WoW 20th Anniversary introduces a variety of new activities and ways to earn currency during the event which can be used to purchase myriad items including iconic Tier 2 transmog appearance sets. We’ve consulted top goblins and tallied it all up so that you know how to earn these currencies and where you can spend them. Players will also automatically be granted a 10% experience and reputation buff during the Anniversary and can add an additional 10% experience and reputation buff by completing the repeatable “Celebrate Good Fun” quest with Yllana. This buff will not countdown while offline and will be offered to you again once per day when it expires. There are a variety of currencies used at the fairgrounds to purchase armor, armor and weapon appearances, pets, mounts, toys, and more. Here’s what you should make sure you have on hand to spend on all the goodies. During the Anniversary, players will be able to earn anywhere from 1 to 3 Bronze Celebration Tokens per activity over the course of the event each week. Quests and activities can be completed on any character in your Warband and will count toward the weekly amount of (Warband Transferable) Tokens your Warband can earn each week. Activity completions are tracked Warband-wide so there’s no need to run the event with multiple characters every week (unless you want to spread the fun among your characters.) Players who collect 100 Tokens over the course of the event will unlock the ability to earn additional Tokens from 20th Anniversary activities. For those who are looking forward to buying all of the Tier 2 sets, take heart.
