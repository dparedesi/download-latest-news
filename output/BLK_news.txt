Dear friends, Welcome to the “Midsommar in Scandinavia” issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. Chip and I are enjoying a long-planned holiday in Sweden and Norway. We’re equally delighted that you’re here … and we’re there! Among other things (how would I know for sure? I’m in Gamla Stan), Lynn Bolin addresses the emerging threat of tariff-induced inflation with “Protecting Against Tariff Induced Inflation,” analyzing how widespread tariffs will likely be passed through to consumers and drive inflation to an estimated 3.4% peak next quarter. Drawing on five years of post-pandemic bond performance data, he demonstrates that shorter-duration and inflation-protected securities have significantly outperformed traditional intermediate-term bonds, leading him to rotate into funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index (VTAPX), Fidelity Inflation-Protected Bond Index Fund (FIPDX), and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset Fund (PZRMX). Bolin has reduced his stock allocation from 65% to 50% and now maintains approximately 7% of his bond allocation in inflation-protected securities, with another 40% in shorter-duration bonds, while also incorporating target-maturity TIPS ETFs like iShares iBonds Oct 2030 Term Tips ETF (IBIG) into his bond ladders. America’s premier Asian investment boutique, Matthews Asia, has fallen on hard times. Former CEO and portfolio manager Mark Headley has returned from retirement, intent on fixing that. Our hour-long interview is summarized in “Good Bones There.” Without any doubt, the most successful small-cap value fund in existence is Scott Barbee’s Aegis Value Fund. We last shared a full profile of the fund in 2013, but it has appeared in eight data-driven articles since then. We decided it was high time to catch up with Mr. Barbee and correct our oversight in a profile of Aegis Value Fund (AVALX). Three years ago, in the midst of a market meltdown (do you even recall the ’22 crash now), we offered advice on how to cope with a … ummm “spanked portfolio.” The whimsical accompanying graphic generated a surprising amount of site traffic. This month, we offer a three-year retrospective on our 2022 advice: keep calm and consider small-value funds with high-quality portfolios. The performance numbers seem promising. We also share a Launch Alert for Stewart Investors Worldwide Leaders Fund, the US launch of a successful non-US strategy focusing on a concentrated portfolio of high-quality, sustainable businesses. The launch was seeded by a US foundation, so the initial share class is institution with retail in the pipeline! Hedge funds are shifting to Asia. Goldman Sachs reports that hedge fund trading in Asian markets have a five-year high in June. “Hedge funds bought equities in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India last week, but were short selling onshore Chinese stocks,” Goldman said. Family offices are shifting to infrastructure and private debt. A BlackRock survey of 175 family offices, the investment manager for ultra-wealthy families, reports that one-third were planning to increase exposure to private debt this year and 30% were planning to commit more resources to infrastructure investments. Almost every smart beta (e.g., low volatility or fundamental valuation) strategy has failed to produce, according to new research from Research Affiliates (free registration required). The short version: RA has been tracking the performance of a series of factor-based portfolios since 2018, looking to see whether any provided the promised excess return. They did not. In every case, just investing in “the market” was a better bet. The good news: “the market” – defined by its large / growth / momentum subset, is now so egregiously overpriced that almost everything outside of that niche is dramatically underpriced. Source: Research Affiliates, 06/2025 The way to read that chart is to start by finding the little green diamonds. Those are the more-or-less current valuations of each strategy relative to its historic valuations. Green diamonds below the colored bar, which illustrates the historic range from 10th percentile to 90th, signals that the strategy is now cheaper than it has been 90% or 95% of the time. RA concludes that’s good news since valuation matters: … we believe there may be hope for all smart beta strategies. If markets receive a wake-up call and valuations revert, a multitude of systematic factor-based equity strategies could all have a field day. After eight years of going horribly wrong, smart beta investing may now go horribly right. AI is a lot dumber than we thought. A series of research reports, most recently from Apple, argue that while AI can execute certain tasks exceptionally well, reasoning is not among them. The researchers found that in simple reasoning tasks, including the Towers of Hanoi challenge, AIs underperform 7-year-olds. Their central argument is that even the most advanced LLMs do not think in any way that resembles us. Their conclusion is that AI “thinking” is not just different, it’s horrible. (Gary Marcus, “A Knockout Blow for LLMs? LLM ‘reasoning’ is so cooked, they turned my name into a verb,” Communications of the ACM, 6/16/2025). Source: Amazon.com As the complexity of demands rises, moving AI beyond its comfort zone, so does the frequency of hallucinations. One estimate is that 79% of responses from some of the newer AI contain hallucinated content (“A.I. Is Getting More Powerful, but Its Hallucinations Are Getting Worse,” New York Times, 5/6/2025, subscription required). A coda to that argument: ChatGPT just lost a chess match to an Atari 2600. If you’re, oh, under 50, you can be forgiven for the question “WTF is an Atari?” because the 2600 is a home video game console released in 1977. ChatGPT actually volunteered to play the old game system. Oops. One report of the match contained this summary: In fact, the Atari wiped the floor with ChatGPT when it came to chess. I don’t mean the near-half-century-old game console won. I mean that ChatGPT made blunders that would embarrass the greenest of beginners. On the upside, perhaps it thinks it won? “So I said ‘here, hold ma beer an’ gimme a knight an’ I kicked its little Atari keester all the way to …’”. AI is dirtier than we thought. Not “smutty dirt” (though that’s nice, too) but “energy- and water-gulping dirty.” MIT researchers found two troubling trends: AI data centers use more power and more power derived from fossil fuels than “normal” data centers: … more than half of the electricity going to data centers will be used for AI. At that point, AI alone could consume as much electricity annually as 22% of all US households. Meanwhile, data centers are expected to continue trending toward using dirtier, more carbon-intensive forms of energy (like gas) to fill immediate needs, leaving clouds of emissions in their wake. (“We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard,” MIT Technology Review, 6/2025) Part of the challenge is that AI companies seem desperately concerned with obscuring the magnitude of their energy and water use, which some suspect sounds like a guilty conscience at work. AI users are stupider than we thought. Folks have casually and constantly observed the tendency of people to be lazy, turning to AI to do their work and thoughtlessly passing it along as their own. The underlying phenomenon is called “cognitive offloading.” It’s driven by two biological imperatives: humans have a limited supply of energy each day and thinking requires a lot of energy. Our survival response is to think as little as necessary to get through the day. The polite term for us is “cognitive misers.” We rely on tricks, shortcuts, and habits – none of which require much energy – to muddle through. But we also offload tasks – we delegate – whenever possible. As a quick test, how many telephone numbers can you recite off the top of your head? (No, 9-1-1 doesn’t count.) When I was young, the answer was probably “dozens.” Today, it’s probably two or three (my own, Chip’s, and my son’s). I count on my phone to keep track of the rest. That’s cognitive offloading. A second set of MIT researchers, the Brain on Large Language Models team, has been doing fairly rigorous research on how our brains respond to the availability of AI/LLMs as an offloading option. (Spoiler alert: not well.) Most recently, they gave three groups of students the same task. One group had access to ChatGPT, one had access to Google, and the other had to think for themselves. (Yikes.) The study ran over four months and included both brain activity monitors and direct observation. Their findings: Brain connectivity systematically scaled down with the amount of external support: the Brain‑only group exhibited the strongest, widest‑ranging networks, Search Engine group showed intermediate engagement, and LLM assistance elicited the weakest overall coupling … The reported ownership of LLM group’s essays in the interviews was low. The Search Engine group had strong ownership, but lesser than the Brain-only group. The LLM group also fell behind in their ability to quote from the essays they wrote just minutes prior. (Your Brain on ChatGPT, 6/2025) The short version: the brains of Chat-dependent students literally powered down and while the students nominally completed the work themselves, they had little belief in their own written conclusions and couldn’t quite remember what they’d just said. Rather as we can’t quite remember our sibling’s phone number five minutes after we called them. The White House apparently has an opening for a new Best Billionaire Friend (BBF) after a spectacular fallout between Mr. Trump and the previous holder of the position, Mr. Musk. Mr. Musk, who invested heavily in Mr. Trump’s election campaign, left government service, such as it was, denounced Mr. Trump’s signature legislative package as “a disgusting abomination” and endorsed a call for Mr. Trump’s impeachment. He nonetheless affirmed his “love for the guy.” Two of Mr. Musk’s associates attribute the fallout to Mr. Trump’s failure to give Musk and Tesla favorable treatment under the bill. “Elon was butthurt,” according to one source. Musk threatened to decommission his fleet of Dragon spacecraft. Trump threatened to “terminate Elon’s Government Subsidies and Contracts” and to investigate his business practices. Musk caved. We’ve written a fair amount about the history and enduring psychology of these alliances (“If you’re so rich, why aren’t you smart?” LinkedIn, 4/2025). Two things to remember: Fortunately, the BBF position is likely to be swiftly filled. UBS reports (6/2025) that there are now 31 people with wealth in excess of $50 billion dollars. Queue forms to the right! To all of the folks helping to make our Scandinavian sojourn amazing! We asked, you answered! Thanks so much to all the folks who shared good wishes and travel advice for our upcoming Scandinavian adventure: Stuart, Leah, Marjorie, DGH, and Roger. Thank you, thank you!

The IPO was subscribed 16.69 times, powered by institutional interest signalling renewed investor appetite for large public offerings. Following a successful IPO, the company has fixed the issue price at ₹740. Qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) drove demand, with the reserved portion getting subscribed 55.47 times, while the non-institutional investor segment showed moderate interest with 9.99 times subscription. The quota reserved for retail investors was subscribed 1.41 times, with most opting for cut-off price bids. The employee category witnessed 5.71 times subscription, while existing shareholders (HDFC Bank) subscribed 4.26 times over their reserved quota. The overall issue size is ₹12,500 crore — compriseing fresh issue worth ₹2,500 crore and an offer-for-sale of up to ₹10,000 crore by HDFC Bank. The IPO is the largest in 2025 so far. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said after years of anticipation, HDB Financial Services is finally set to debut on the Indian stock exchanges, and early indicators point to a healthy 8–10 per cent listing gain, reflecting strong investor appetite. “The IPO garnered over ₹1.61 lakh crore in bids, underscoring massive institutional and retail interest. This makes HDB’s offering the second most subscribed IPO among ₹10,000+ crore issues, trailing only the record-breaking Tata Technologies listing. However, it did fall short of surpassing the all-time high ₹3 lakh crore+ subscription seen in the Bajaj Housing Finance IPO,” he added. “We believe the robust response signals market confidence in HDB’s business model, parentage (as an HDFC group company), and long-term growth potential in the NBFC space. If the listing meets expectations, it would reaffirm investor appetite for high-quality financial services plays, especially those backed by trusted legacy institutions,” he further said. In a recent interaction with businessline, G Ramesh, MD and CEO of HDB Financial Services, said the IPO proceeds would be used for on-lending, growth and strengthening the NBFC’s capital base. He clarified that HDB operates independent of HDFC Bank, not sharing business leads, office space or operational support. The company proposes using the fresh issue’s net proceeds to augment its Tier—I Capital base to meet its future capital requirements, including onward lending under any of its business verticals, i.e., Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance. Further, a portion of the proceeds from the Fresh Issue will be used to meet Offer Expenses His remarks came amid the RBI’s 2024 draft norms proposing that only a single entity in a bank group can engage in a specific line of business. HDFC Bank’s stake in HDB will reduce to 75 per cent from 94 per cent post the IPO, the MD said. Ahead of the issue opening, HDB Financial Services had rasied ₹3,368.99 crore from anchor investors. Some of the marquee investors include the Life Insurance Corporation of India, ICICI Prudential MF, Nippon Life India MF, BlackRock, Axis MF, Aditya Birla Sun Life MF, UTI MF, Schroder International Selection Fund, and Goldman Sachs Funds, among others. JM Financial Limited, BNP Paribas, BofA Securities India Limited, Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Private Limited, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Private Limited, IIFL Capital Services Limited (Formerly known as IIFL Securities Limited), Jefferies India Private Limited, Morgan Stanley India Company Private Limited, Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors Limited, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Private Limited, Nuvama Wealth Management Limited, UBS Securities India Private Limited are the Book Running Lead Managers to the offer. Mehta said: “Given the strong subscription momentum and prevailing bullish sentiment in the market, we recommend holding the stock for the long term, as HDB Financial Services is strategically positioned to benefit from India’s structural credit growth, especially within the retail and SME financing segments.” Published on July 2, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: CBS Documentary Decrying Oligarchs Omits Notorious Lefty Billionaires

All Rights Reserved. Text to Speech A CBS News documentary blasted America’s supposed transition to a so-called “Gilded Age” of oligarchs to attack President Trump and the tech leaders who stood with him at his inauguration. As if CBS stood for Channeling Bernie Sanders. The problem: The documentary conveniently excluded any mention about the most notorious left-wing billionaires in U.S. politics that have used their cash to either try to buy elections or drastically overhaul U.S. policy over the years. Coincidence? We think not. The CBS documentary released June 28, “Is America in a New Gilded Age? Wealth, Power and Democracy,” relied mostly on whiny anti-capitalist commentary from radical talking heads like millionaires Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Clinton stooge Robert Reich to slam American capitalism as the culprit for Trump’s return to the White House, and by extension X owner Elon Musk’s tenure as the overseer of DOGE. “[A]fter the last presidential election, tensions over wealth, power and democracy have only heightened,” sensationalized CBS senior business and technology correspondent Jo Ling Kent. She admitted during a CBS Mornings appearance the day prior to her documentary’s release that her work was inspired by millionaire President Joe Biden’s farewell address warning about a rising “oligarchy.” See where this is going? Kent propped up Sanders and like-minded leftist legislators like fellow socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) who “began the Fighting Oligarchy tour, holding rallies around the country to push back against what he argues is a corrupting influence of billionaires on U.S. politics.” But for all Kent and others’ grumbling over figures like Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Kent completely bypassed the ungodly political influence of other lefty billionaire titans who have built empires on the amount of political power they’ve gained during their lengthy careers. WATCH: CBS News Reporter Jo Ling Kent Hawks Her Anti-Billionaire Documentary on CBS Mornings (June 27, 2025). These include George Soros (and now his son Alex by extension) who has spewed $32 billion into his Open Society Foundations to foment racial strife, buoy climate change fanaticism, stoke LGBTQ political furor, push for open borders and undercut American sovereignty on the world stage. In addition, Soros spent hundreds of millions collectively on electing extremist political candidates and soft-on-crime prosecutors in order to shape politics to be the mirror reflection of his unhinged, anti-American worldview. His son Alex, who now controls his father's empire, openly promotes his enormous political pull with America's and the world's most powerful leaders on social media, including Biden. (Left to right: Michael Bloomberg, George Soros, Reid Hoffman) Other high-profile billionaires missing from the documentary included Michael Bloomberg, who spent over $1 billion trying to buy the 2020 election, pledged another $1 billion at least to wipe out the U.S. coal industry, and spent $47 million during the 2024 election alone to elect Vice President Kamala Harris and help Democrats maintain control over the House; and deranged LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman who spent millions to elect Harris in 2024 and who personally bankrolled the highly politicized sexual abuse lawsuit against Trump brought by leftist E. Jean Carroll. Reid Hoffman was specifically part of a cohort of left-wing billionaires like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, philanthropist Laurene Powell-Jobs and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz who spent fortunes on secretive political machines to help Biden get elected in 2020. These weren’t mentioned by Kent either, which is even more telling given she also cited leftist anti-Trump author Andrea Bernstein who chirped, “What are you going to do if you’re wealthy and you have a lot of money? You’re going to put some of that into the political system to try to influence outcomes so that you can hang on to even more money. That’s the way the system works.” Ironic. To Kent’s credit, she did interview four guests who rebuffed the idea that America was reentering a Gilded Age (including Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Riley and Competitive Enterprise Institute President Kent Lassman), but these were largely dwarfed by another eight commentators who were just attacking and smearing the billionaires who have coalesced around Trump. For example, Kent tee’d up Dartmouth Sociology Professor Brooke Harrington, whose antagonistic term “broligarchs” she defined as rich people who “decide that they get to keep all the money and that they’re not going to pay any of their fair share of the costs of the society that made them prosperous.” Harrington then used this term to go after Musk and his businesses, but not other powerful billionaires who share her anti-capitalist views, such as Soros. Hypocritically, Kent didn’t bother to mention the enormous ESG asset manager giants that represent three of the top four institutional shareholders of her parent company Paramount Global and her liberal competitor networks at NBC, ABC, and CNN: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, which manage over $26 trillion in assets. Sounds pretty oligarchy-adjacent, but apparently not for Kent. She had the audacity to cherry-pick Bezos’s purchase of The Washington Post and Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of social media giant Twitter as examples of the inherent problems in business tycoons owning media. “One of the real dangers of great concentrated wealth is that not only does it exert influence politically, but it also exerts influence through its ownership of the media,” Reich complained to Kent. The CBS journalist followed up by referring back to how “in the Gilded Age, the ultra-wealthy could buy almost anything. And one prize for many was the means to influence public opinion.” Pretty sure the C-suites at BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street were just tickled pink over that, eh Jo? “Owning a media company has always been viewed as an accessory for the very powerful,” pontificated Bloomberg Businessweek editor Brad Stone, who along with Kent apparently forgot that eco-activist Michael Bloomberg, worth $104 billion, owns his magazine. But Kent sure let him get in some digs at Bezos for daring to exercise his authority as The Post owner to shift the Opinion Page to a more free market position and ban the editorial board’s objectivity-wrecking tradition of endorsing political candidates. Riley, in one of his brief appearances in the documentary, slammed the hypocrisy of the left in fixating on billionaires when they seem to be oblivious to the special interests financing their own side. “Are people on the left complaining that other wealthy individuals decide to spend their money on electing people who want to go soft on criminals that are raising hell in low income communities?” He continued: “If you’re spending your money a certain way, you’re okay. If you’re spending it on free market ideas and principles — if you want lower taxes, if you want smaller government and so forth — somehow you are villainous.” Kent conceded that 80 billionaires donated to Harris’s campaign in 2024, while just over 50 billionaires did the same for Trump. But her documentary was clear in its implication that the only titans that matter to her and the CBS media giant are the ones that curry favor with Trump, while ignoring other, more dangerous political players on the left, including her own shareholder bosses.

Title: US dollar suffers worst start to a year since 1973 over Trump tariff concerns
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/01/business/us-dollar-suffers-worst-start-to-year-since-1973/

The US dollar suffered its worst first-half decline in more than 50 years as fears over President Trump’s tariff policies have driven down the world’s principal reserve currency. The greenback weakened 10.7% in the first six months of the year compared to a basket of currencies from major trading partners – the worst drop since 1973 when President Nixon stopped tying the dollar to the price of gold. But its decline could be part of Trump’s broader vision to devalue the dollar — an idea reportedly floated by Stephen Miran, recently appointed Chairman of the US Council of Economic Advisers in what has been dubbed the Mar-a-Lago Accord. Miran has denied this conspiracy in the past. A weaker dollar makes US exports much cheaper, and could aid Trump’s oft-stated goal of boosting manufacturing at home, as well as reducing the nation’s trade deficit, the thinking goes. When he was campaigning for a second term, an official in the first Trump administration told Politico that “currency revaluation is likely to be a priority” because of “the viewpoint that [an overvalued dollar] contributes to the trade deficit.” Trump has not weighed in on the speculation about devaluing the dollar. “President Trump has repeatedly affirmed his commitment to the dominance of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency,” White House press spokesman Kush Desai told The Post on Tuesday. “Ten-year Treasury yields rallying down nearly 40 basis points since Inauguration Day, four consecutive expectation-beating inflation reports, and the trillions in historic investment commitments that have poured into the United States since Election Day are all indicative of the confidence that investors and markets continue to have in our economy and currency.” But many experts claim Trump’s hefty tariffs are putting pressure on the dollar and forcing global investors to rethink their ties to the currency. “Trump is definitely playing with fire,“ Stephen Miller, a consultant for GSFM, a unit of Canada’s CI Financial Corp. in Australia, told Bloomberg. While a weaker dollar should theoretically help US exporters, there’s still a lot of uncertainty when it comes to global trade because of the Trump administration’s ongoing negotiations with key nations, which are staring down a fast-approaching July 9 deadline. The dollar’s fall comes after it soared on Trump’s re-election win and peaked in mid-January on hopes he would bring a pro-growth mindset to the White House. But in April, Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement revealed tariffs that were much stiffer than analysts and economists had predicted, spurring a broad shift away from US investments. “Full-scale de-dollarization, if it ever comes, is still a long way away,” Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said in the company’s most recent forecast. But the drop in confidence in the US dollar, which is typically seen as a safe haven asset, is concerning – and could worsen with a rise in government debt, according to Rieder. Trump’s massive budget bill, which is projected to add $3 trillion in national debt, narrowly squeaked through the Senate on Tuesday. It awaits final approval in the House. The concerns over higher inflation and debt have have pushed long-term Treasury yields lower. The 10-year yield started near 5% this year and has steadily fallen, reaching 4.267% on Tuesday. “I think we’re going to continue to have this higher pressure on the low end of the yield curve because we haven’t really dealt anything away with the deficit or inflation for that matter. In fact, there’s more risk now than anything,” Ben Emons, founder of FedWatch Advisors, said on CNBC’s “Fast Money” Tuesday. “I do think it’s related to Treasuries, that if Treasuries get more under pressure, the dollar will get weaker.” Advertisement

Title: Live From ETHCC Robinhood Launches Tokenized OpenAI Access

BySandy Carter BySandy Carter, Contributor. Robinhood is making significant headlines live from ETHcc in France (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty ... More Images) At the Ethereum Community Conference (ETHCC) in Cannes this week, I’ve been keynoting, speaking on panels, networking, and diving deep into topics like decentralized AI and next-gen blockchains. One announcement that truly stood out was Robinhood’s bold leap forward. They’re evolving from a retail brokerage into a next-gen financial super app—with blockchain at the core. Tokenized OpenAI shares? That’s the kind of real-world utility that actually moves the needle. From tokenizing over 200 U.S. stocks and ETFs to building its own Layer 2 blockchain, Robinhood is positioning itself at the convergence of traditional finance and decentralized finance. The implications could be transformative, not only for the company but for the future of digital assets globally. Vlad Tenev, Robinhood’s CEO, unveiled the launch of tokenized stocks for private companies like SpaceX and OpenAI—offered exclusively to eligible customers in the European Union. These digital assets are initially issued on Arbitrum, a layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution known for speed and low fees. Over time, Robinhood plans to migrate its offerings to a proprietary blockchain, currently in development. Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood, announcing the launch of tokenized stocks for private companies ... More like SpaceX and OpenAI, available to European Union customers. This announcement wasn’t just a headline moment—it marked the beginning of a broader integration between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). Robinhood’s move into tokenization is designed to provide 24/5 access to over 200 U.S. stocks and ETFs with no commissions, no added spreads, dividend support, and crypto wallet compatibility. In addition, Robinhood shared that tokenized shares of select privately held companies—most notably OpenAI and SpaceX—will be made available to eligible EU customers later this summer, expanding access to high-profile, previously inaccessible private equity. The timing is no accident. Robinhood recently secured new licenses in Europe, and unveiling this initiative at ETHCC underscores its ambitions to expand globally and deepen its footprint in the blockchain space. The regulatory contrast between regions is sharp. While U.S. customers are now gaining access to crypto staking (starting with Ethereum and Solana), European users are unlocking access to tokenized public and private equities. It’s a bold move that positions the EU as the first major market to experience tokenized real-world assets at scale, through a consumer-facing platform. For OpenAI specifically, this is a major milestone. It’s the first time equity exposure to the company is being offered in tokenized form to retail users—making an elite investment opportunity available to a broader population that would typically be shut out of private tech deals. The news triggered a powerful market response: Robinhood’s shares surged to a fresh all‑time high, climbing 11–13% on the day, reflecting investor confidence in this strategic pivot and the market’s enthusiasm for bringing high-value assets onchain. This move mirrors a similar announcement from Republic earlier in the week, yet the mechanics differ substantially. Republic issues equity‑backed Digital Asset Receipts (DARTs), representing true on‑chain ownership of shares held in trusts or SPVs. This approach is pure “on-chain equity”—combining legal rights with digital portability. The difference in tokenization of stocks between Robinhood and Republic By contrast, Robinhood’s offering appears to be more like synthetic exposure or broker‑held tokens. They grant economic participation—such as dividend gains and tradability—without conferring legal shareholder status. In short, Republic’s approach is “on‑chain equity,” while Robinhood’s may be closer to “on‑chain access.” Different infrastructural models, same goal: unlocking elite investment opportunities via blockchain. Tokenized equities are just the beginning. Robinhood has layered in multiple crypto and blockchain features across its platforms. Following its completion of the Bitstamp acquisition, EU users will soon gain access to perpetual futures with up to 3x leverage—a tool typically favored by advanced traders. These derivatives are slated to launch later this summer. In the US, Robinhood has introduced crypto staking for Ethereum and Solana, aligning with regulatory guidance clarifying staking doesn't qualify as a security. Eligible users in approved states can now earn yield directly within Robinhood’s platform. Additional user incentives include a 1–2% bonus on transferred crypto deposits, upcoming cashback-to-crypto conversion via the Robinhood Gold credit card, and advanced tax‑lot selection tools—giving retail traders greater control over capital gains and reporting. Robinhood is achieving what few other platforms can: operationalizing tokenized equity for the masses within a regulated, mobile‑first environment. Major financial players like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs explore similar blockchain models behind the scenes, but Robinhood is delivering real‑world asset tokenization directly to mainstream retail users. Industry estimates suggest tokenized assets could reach $13.55 trillion by 2030. With licenses secured and a product roadmap underway, Robinhood is racing against competitors like Coinbase, Kraken, and Republic to define how riders experience tokenized finance. Bankless co‑founder David Hoffman commented that Robinhood—armed with regulatory approval and pre‑IPO access—is well‑positioned to leapfrog crypto‑native platforms in this race. Robinhood’s long-term vision extends well beyond tokenized stocks. The company is stacking in features like an AI‑driven investing assistant (Cortex), smart order routing across liquidity pools, advanced mobile charting, and eventually a full-fledged Ethereum-compatible Layer‑2 optimized for real‑world asset tokenization. This next-gen blockchain infrastructure is designed for 24/7 trading, cross-chain asset bridging, and self‑custody—redefining retail access in the age of TradFi meets DeFi. Robinhood’s ETHCC 2025 announcements mark a pivotal moment in digital finance, not just product innovation. By bringing tokenized private equity like OpenAI into its mobile app, layering in staking and perpetual futures, and building blockchain infrastructure, Robinhood is staking a claim as a frontrunner in the financial super app space. As tokenized investing becomes a tangible reality for millions, the lines between centralized brokerages and decentralized protocols are blurring—setting a high bar for the next generation of financial platforms.

FORMER IRISH OLYMPIC swimming coach George Gibney has been arrested by US authorities in Florida this afternoon. He was taken into custody by US Marshals on foot of an Irish extradition warrant and is being detained pending a court appearance. Gardaí have been investigating fresh allegations that Gibney sexually abused multiple children in his care while working as a swimming coach in Ireland decades ago. The investigation was reopened in 2020 after several individuals made allegations on a BBC and Second Captains podcast titled ‘Where is George Gibney?’, prompting a specialist unit within the Garda National Protective Services Bureau to begin a detailed inquiry. After a three-year investigation, a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who recommended charging Gibney. In a statement today, gardaí said that they are”aware of the arrest of a male aged in his 70s in the United States” on the foot of an Irish international arrest warrant. “As this is currently a matter for the US authorities, An Garda Síochána will not be commenting further at this time,” a spokesperson said. Advertisement Gibney was the founder of the Trojan Swimming Club in Blackrock in Dublin, where he also worked as a coach. He was also the Irish national swimming coach until 1991. Now aged in his 70s, he was previously charged with 27 sexual offences in 1993. However, the charges of indecent assault and unlawful carnal knowledge were dropped in 1994 after he secured an injunction in the High Court preventing the DPP from prosecuting him. Gibney left Ireland and moved to Scotland where he continued to work as a swimming coach. He has lived in the United States since 1995. In 1997, a garda investigation into Gibney was opened after fresh allegations were made against him. This investigation did not result in a prosecution. In 2020, the ‘Where is George Gibney?’ podcast, a ten-part investigative series produced by BBC Sounds and Second Captains, gave an in-depth at look the circumstances and child abuse accusations surrounding Gibney. The series centred on the survivors of sexual abuse by Gibney, and it became one of the most impactful pieces of journalism of recent years – many new survivors came forward to tell their story, and gardaí commenced a new investigation after the podcast was broadcast. An appeal was issued for people with any information to come forward. A number of alleged victims did come forward with allegations. The DPP would be free to seek Gibney’s extradition from the US if it was to proceed with charges. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

UniCredit links investment certificate to BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, ensuring capital protection for clients. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. European banking behemoth UniCredit is entering the crypto arena with a structured product tied to BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), Bloomberg News reported on July 1, citing an internal memo. Under the plan, UniCredit will offer professional clients a five-year, U.S. dollar-denominated investment certificate linked to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The product will guarantee 100% capital protection at maturity. BlackRock launched its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe in March, listing under the ticker “IB1T” on Euronext Paris and Xetra, and “BTCN” on Euronext Amsterdam. The firm’s U.S.-listed IBIT fund has amassed over $73 billion in assets under management, making it the most successful crypto-linked financial product by investment capital to date. The move comes amid a sweeping embrace of digital assets by European banks, enabled by the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory regime becoming effective across the bloc. Deutsche Bank last week confirmed it will launch institutional crypto custody services in 2026. It follows a June announcement that the lender is also exploring stablecoin issuance and blockchain payment projects in step with MiCA guidelines. Simultaneously, Germany’s Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, comprising local savings banks with over 50 million customers, is preparing to roll out regulated crypto trading access for its retail clients by summer 2026, offering assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Meanwhile, Deutsche Boerse’s custody arm, Clearstream, began providing institutional clients with Bitcoin and Ethereum settlement and custody services earlier this year. France’s Societe Generale is also continuing its expansion into digital finance and launching a dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD CoinVertible, via its SG-FORGE subsidiary this month.dy. Spain’s BBVA, commonly cautious on crypto, now advises affluent clients to hold 3%–7% of their portfolios in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The lender has also secured approval to launch crypto trading services. However, European regulators remain cautious. ECB Governor Fabio Panetta recently reiterated concerns of reputational risks from crypto services inside regulated banks and stressed the need to manage investor expectations and consider a digital euro to preserve confidence in financial systems.

Title: Trump Is Setting the U.S. Economy Up for Another Great Financial Crisis
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/trump-financial-crisis-2008-deregulation-interview
Time Published: 2025-07-01T18:00:00Z
Full Content:
This story was originally published in Truthout. The financial system of the United States has always been prone to instability and crises. Now, however, under the new Trump administration, which is pushing for major cuts in regulation, including in the cryptocurrency sector in which the Trump family has a major financial stake, the financial system has become more vulnerable than ever, posing serious risks to the wider economy. Of course, this matters very little to Donald Trump, his family, and his billionaire friends. For Trump, the actual meaning of ​“America First” is ​“self-enrichment.” In the interview that follows, progressive economist Gerald Epstein, a leading expert in finance and banking, talks about the changing nature of the U.S. finance system under Trump 2.0. He argues that Trump is turning the entire financial system into ​“a Wild West of unregulated institutions and markets,” thus potentially setting the stage for a financial crisis of unprecedented proportions. Epstein is professor of economics and co-director of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the author of Busting the Bankers’ Club: Finance for the Rest of Us. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length. C.J. Polychroniou: The U.S. financial landscape is always evolving, but not necessarily in a desirable direction. Financial technology (fintech), artificial intelligence (AI), the shadow banking system, and deregulation are raising concerns about financial instability and even warnings of another financial crisis. Indeed, just recently, even The Economist—a champion of free markets, deregulation, and financialization — ran an article titled, ​“American finance, always unique, is now uniquely dangerous.” Can you briefly address the evolving nature of the U.S. financial system since the 2007-08 financial crisis and whether concerns about an increase in financial stability risks are valid? Gerald Epstein: The Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-2009 hurt millions of Americans and was costly to countless others elsewhere. Americans lost their jobs, their homes, and saw public services — such as resources for schools, health care, and subsidized child care — experience major cuts. As I show in Busting the Bankers’ Club: Finance for the Rest of Us, the roots of the GFC stem from radical financial deregulation by both Democratic and Republican administrations, and also joined by European governments, that permitted megabanks and their top personnel to take on huge risks and win large payoffs. And when the markets collapsed, they were bailed out by central banks and governments without penalty to themselves or their banks. More specifically, bankers and other operatives in the financial system, such as credit rating agencies, were able to profit from massive conflicts of interest; huge and often hidden levels of debt (leverage); deliberately overly complex and opaque financial products that their customers, and often themselves, did not understand; large-scale fraud and corruption that went largely unpunished; and, in the end, massive government bailouts that saved them and their institutions but came at the expense of the taxpayers and the overall economy, as the work of the late James Crotty has shown. The financial reform laws, in the United States known as Dodd-Frank, were hard-fought but ended up with only moderate improvements in the financial regulations. These reforms promised to make banking less risky by reducing leverage and by increasing bank capital and liquidity; they also promised to make banking activities less opaque by increasing regulatory monitoring of the largest banks. But the effectiveness of these rules eroded over time. This erosion occurred partly because, under Trump 1.0, they were rolled back and weakened in some important respects. And the rules became less effective because the financial markets innovated around them. These changes were well described in the Economist article and included increasing the size of the less regulated areas, increasing the roles of private credit, including asset management firms like BlackRock, hedge funds, and private equity funds, thereby increasing the financial footprint of relatively unregulated credit institutions. Of course, none of this was inevitable. Had there been governments serious about regulating finance in the U.S. and in Europe, they could have strengthened their restrictions, but they had no such interest in doing so. On the contrary, when there was a banking crisis in 2022 (Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, USB, etc.), the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury bailed out all of their depositors and some of their debt holders and shareholders. This gave a clear sense to these markets that they could keep growing. All of these trends have now gotten much, much worse because of the actions of Trump 2.0. The Trump administration and the Republican Congress with the help of the Supreme Court and some Democrats are trying to take down almost the entire edifice of financial regulation, including trying to eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, place finance-friendly regulators in all the key regulatory agencies, and mostly commit themselves to a free-for-all approach to regulation. The result is increasingly one of conflicts of interest, artificially created complexity and opaqueness, allowing large increases in debt (leverage) throughout the system and massive increases in the potential for fraud and corruption. In other words, they are turning the entire financial system into a ​“shadow” financial system, that is a system that is largely unmonitored and unregulated, a system of ​“private credit,” a Wild West of unregulated institutions and markets. Polychroniou: The private credit market has exploded in recent years, challenging the process of traditional lending. Does the growth of private credit in itself pose a risk to financial system stability? Epstein: As Lenore Palladino and Harrison Karlewicz among others have shown, there has been a massive growth of ​“private credit” as a share of the total financial market assets in recent years. As they point out, private funds have approximately tripled in size in the last decade to $26 trillion in gross assets (compared to the $23 trillion in the U.S. commercial banking industry). These funds include pension funds and insurance company assets which are now increasingly managed by private credit firms such as asset management firms with relatively less regulatory oversight. But as I suggested, even the megabanks themselves are finding many ways to avoid much oversight in this new era of deregulation. Even though The Economist issue you lead with points to some of these dangers, their warnings are almost always balanced off by suggesting that these financial ​“innovations” offer benefits to the clients and to the overall economy. But in fact, in most cases, there is little evidence for these benefits. Highly managed asset portfolios do worse than index funds that simply purchase a share of the whole (or a segment of) the financial markets; and one does not need private credit institutions to make these standard investments. More complex investments tend to have higher fees, less liquidity, more risk. Polychroniou: Trump and congressional Republicans, with the help of a number of key Democrats, are pushing legislation to make cryptocurrencies occupy a central position in the U.S. financial system. What problems will this create for the economy? Epstein: The poster child for the even more extreme risks coming down the road is the gigantic push being made now by Donald Trump, his family and a whole phalanx of billionaires, Republican politicians, and some Democrats. They want to place cryptocurrencies and assets at the center of the financial system and make tech capitalists such as Elon Musk and Trump himself the kingpins of the financial system. They also aim to transform tech firms into money and credit creators that will be able to print money — like the Federal Reserve and the banks — but will have virtually none of the regulation. In this way, these tech billionaires and Trump family members will be able to privatize the U.S. dollar and the U.S. financial system with virtually no oversight. The key legislative initiatives here are the so-called GENIUS Act, which was just passed by the Senate, and the CLARITY Act, which is set to go to the House of Representatives. Senate passage of the GENIUS Act on June 18, with 18 Democrats voting for it, illustrates the massive spending by cryptocurrency companies and lobbyists, first in primary elections to defeat anti-crypto Democrats, and then in the November election to elect pro-crypto Republicans and Democrats. We can expect them to spend even more in the 2026 election to push out sensible crypto-questioning Democrats. Polychroniou: Overall, Trump’s reckless policies are plunging the U.S economy into chaos and are negatively impacting global economies. Could they trigger a financial crisis? Epstein: Yes. These policies, and especially the cryptocurrency push, are very dangerous. And that was a point made implicitly by the Economist article. But there is an important point that is missed here: Even short of a financial crisis, these highly speculative, risky, exploitative, and fraud-ridden financial markets hurt workers, families, and communities on a daily basis. As Juan Montecino and I showed in our article, ​“Overcharged: The High Cost of High Finance,” this kind of financial system fails to provide the financial services that workers, small businesses, households, and communities need. Yes, there are the multitrillion-dollar costs of financial crises caused by such financial systems, but there is the huge cost of misallocation of human and financial resources in a speculative, wasteful, destructive, financial economy. Polychroniou: What can be done to prevent the implementation of the reckless finance reform policies undertaken by the Trump administration? Epstein: We have to defeat Trumpism, the leading edge of this crony financialized capitalism, as well as the neoliberal Democratic opportunists who support and benefit from these policies. C.J.

Title: Terry Savage: Private equity targets 401(k) plans

Terry Savage, Tribune Content Agency, Terry Savage Posted 07/01/2025 at 1:28 pm EST Wall Street has a new target. With nearly $9 trillion in assets, 401(k) plans have caught the eye of Wall Street insiders. For years, they have been investing in “private equity” and venture capital deals. They find small, promising companies and lend their capital and management expertise — hoping to sell out in the public stock markets for huge gains. But in recent years, there has been little opportunity for these insiders to cash in and realize profits to be distributed back to their investors. A slowing market for initial public offerings (IPOs) means many are “stuck” in their deals, with little liquidity. Stock market volatility, higher interest rates, and a preference for large tech companies have muted deal activity, and the chance to redeploy profits (and fees) into new deals. Those who need to sell out of these deals must take a huge discount because there are so few buyers. Ordinary investors aren’t aware of this dire situation for Wall Street tycoons, since individuals have been largely prohibited from investing in private equity, unless they can demonstrate they have significant risk capital and financial assets outside the value of their home. That’s all about to change. Now Wall Street is looking to let ordinary investor get in on these deals — by including them as investment options inside their 401k) plans. And they’re getting help from the current administration. The SEC’s Office of the Investor Advocate has named the inclusion of private equity and other alternatives in retirement plans as a top policy priority for 2026. Is the SEC protecting the small investor here, or the big boy investors who are stuck in their deals? Major asset managers like BlackRock are preparing to launch target-date funds for 401(k)s with a 5%–20% allocation to private investments, including PE and private credit, starting in 2026. But such investments come with concerns for plan sponsors, who are supposed to act as fiduciaries. In 2020 the Labor Department, which regulates retirement plans, cautiously opened the door to small amounts of private investments in 401(k) plans, while warning about valuation and liquidity risks. That is a sophisticated way of saying that no one really knows what these investments are worth — until they try to sell out and get their cash back. As private equity, there is — by definition — no public market to set prices for all to see. Even worse, there may be no buyers, leaving investors stuck. Huge public pension funds started investing in private equity many years ago, expecting easy and profitable liquidation of these assets in 6-10 years — just when they’d need the cash to pay our promised pensions. Now they’re scrambling to increase liquidity by selling other assets. Recent data show that the pace of private equity exits has fallen to a two-year low. And PE funds haven’t been making distributions to their pension fund investors, amid this “exit drought." Inside Wall Street, private equity is being compared to a “roach motel” — easy to get into, and almost impossible to get out! Now they are opening the doors of that roach motel to YOU via your retirement plan. And you’re supposed to be grateful for this unprecedented opportunity. You may soon find these private equity deals inside a target-date retirement plan, or as stand-alone investment choices offered by prestigious Wall Street firms. My advice is: Don’t take the bait. Investment firms are required to warn that past returns are no guarantee of future performance. That’s never been more true than today, despite huge wins in the past. Now the world of private equity is searching for liquidity and eyeing the unsuspecting trillions of dollars in company retirement plans. If you step into this roach motel, they won’t “leave the light on for ya.” And that’s The Savage Truth.

Title: UN report lists companies complicit in Israel’s ‘genocide’: Who are they?

Full Content:
UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese has issued a report naming several US giants among companies aiding Israel’s occupation and war on Gaza. Companies from other countries – from China to Mexico – are also named. The United Nations special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) has released a new report mapping the corporations aiding Israel in the displacement of Palestinians and its genocidal war on Gaza, in breach of international law. Francesca Albanese’s latest report, which is scheduled to be presented at a news conference in Geneva on Thursday, names 48 corporate actors, including United States tech giants Microsoft, Alphabet Inc. – Google’s parent company – and Amazon. A database of more than 1000 corporate entities was also put together as part of the investigation. “[Israel’s] forever-occupation has become the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech – providing significant supply and demand, little oversight, and zero accountability – while investors and private and public institutions profit freely,” the report said. “Companies are no longer merely implicated in occupation – they may be embedded in an economy of genocide,” it said, in a reference to Israel’s ongoing assault on the Gaza Strip. In an expert opinion last year, Albanese said there were “reasonable grounds” to believe Israel was committing genocide in the besieged Palestinian enclave. The report stated that its findings illustrate “why Israel’s genocide continues”. “Because it is lucrative for many,” it said. Israel’s procurement of F-35 fighter jets is part of the world’s largest arms procurement programme, relying on at least 1,600 companies across eight nations. It is led by US-based Lockheed Martin, but F-35 components are constructed globally. Italian manufacturer Leonardo S.p.A is listed as a main contributor in the military sector, while Japan’s FANUC Corporation provides robotic machinery for weapons production lines. The tech sector, meanwhile, has enabled the collection, storage and governmental use of biometric data on Palestinians, “supporting Israel’s discriminatory permit regime”, the report said. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon grant Israel “virtually government-wide access to their cloud and AI technologies”, enhancing its data processing and surveillance capacities. The US tech company IBM has also been responsible for training military and intelligence personnel, as well as managing the central database of Israel’s Population, Immigration and Borders Authority (PIBA) that stores the biometric data of Palestinians, the report said. It found US software platform Palantir Technologies expanded its support to the Israeli military since the start of the war on Gaza in October 2023. The report said there were “reasonable grounds” to believe the company provided automatic predictive policing technology used for automated decision-making in the battlefield, to process data and generate lists of targets including through artificial intelligence systems like “Lavender”, “Gospel” and “Where’s Daddy?” The report also lists several companies developing civilian technologies that serve as “dual-use tools” for Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory. These include Caterpillar, Leonardo-owned Rada Electronic Industries, South Korea’s HD Hyundai and Sweden’s Volvo Group, which provide heavy machinery for home demolitions and the development of illegal settlements in the West Bank. Rental platforms Booking and Airbnb also aid illegal settlements by listing properties and hotel rooms in Israeli-occupied territory. The report named the US’s Drummond Company and Switzerland’s Glencore as the primary suppliers of coal for electricity to Israel, originating primarily from Colombia. In the agriculture sector, Chinese Bright Dairy & Food is a majority owner of Tnuva, Israel’s largest food conglomerate, which benefits from land seized from Palestinians in Israel’s illegal outposts. Netafim, a company providing drip irrigation technology that is 80-percent owned by Mexico’s Orbia Advance Corporation, provides infrastructure to exploit water resources in the occupied West Bank. Treasury bonds have also played a critical role in funding the ongoing war on Gaza, according to the report, with some of the world’s largest banks, including France’s BNP Paribas and the UK’s Barclays, listed as having stepped in to allow Israel to contain the interest rate premium despite a credit downgrade. The report identified US multinational investment companies BlackRock and Vanguard as the main investors behind several listed companies. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is listed as the second largest institutional investor in Palantir (8.6 percent), Microsoft (7.8 percent), Amazon (6.6 percent), Alphabet (6.6 percent) and IBM (8.6 per cent), and the third largest in Lockheed Martin (7.2 percent) and Caterpillar (7.5 percent). Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, is the largest institutional investor in Caterpillar (9.8 percent), Chevron (8.9 percent) and Palantir (9.1 percent), and the second largest in Lockheed Martin (9.2 percent) and Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems (2 percent). The report states that “colonial endeavours and their associated genocides have historically been driven and enabled by the corporate sector.” Israel’s expansion on Palestinian land is one example of “colonial racial capitalism”, where corporate entities profit from an illegal occupation. Since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October 2023, “entities that previously enabled and profited from Palestinian elimination and erasure within the economy of occupation, instead of disengaging are now involved in the economy of genocide,” the report said. For foreign arms companies, the war has been a lucrative venture. Israel’s military spending from 2023 to 2024 surged 65 percent, amounting to $46.5bn – one of the highest per capita worldwide. Several entities listed on the exchange market – particularly in the arms, tech and infrastructure sectors – have seen their profits rise since October 2023. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange also rose an unprecedented 179 percent, adding $157.9bn in market value. Global insurance companies, including Allianz and AXA, invested large sums in shares and bonds linked to Israel’s occupation, the report said, partly as capital reserves but primarily to generate returns. Booking and Airbnb also continue to profit from rentals in Israeli-occupied land. Airbnb briefly delisted properties on illegal settlements in 2018 but later reverted to donating profits from such listings to humanitarian causes, a practice the report referred to as “humanitarian-washing”. According to Albanese’s report, yes. Corporate entities are under an obligation to avoid violating human rights through direct action or in their business partnerships. States have the primary responsibility to ensure that corporate entities respect human rights and must prevent, investigate and punish abuses by private actors. However, corporations must respect human rights even if the state where they operate does not. A company must therefore assess whether activities or relationships throughout its supply chain risk causing human rights violations or contributing to them, according to the report. The failure to act in line with international law may result in criminal liability. Individual executives can be held criminally liable, including before international courts. The report called on companies to divest from all activities linked to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory, which is illegal under international law. In July 2024, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion ruling that Israel’s continued presence in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem should come to an end “as rapidly as possible”. In light of this advisory opinion, the UN General Assembly demanded that Israel bring to an end its unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory by September 2025. Albanese’s report said the ICJ’s ruling “effectively qualifies the occupation as an act of aggression … Consequently, any dealings that support or sustain the occupation and its associated apparatus may amount to complicity in an international crime under the Rome Statute. “States must not provide aid or assistance or enter into economic or trade dealings, and must take steps to prevent trade or investment relations that would assist in maintaining the illegal situation created by Israel in the oPt.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Why The Pro-Crypto SEC Is Exploring Tokenized IPOs

ByChristopher Perkins ByChristopher Perkins, Contributor. UNITED STATES - JUNE 3: SEC Chairman Paul Atkins testifies during the Senate Appropriations ... More Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government hearing titled "A Review of the President's FY2026 Budget Request for the Securities and Exchange Commission," in Dirksen building on Tuesday, June 3, 2025. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Public markets are springing back to life. The crypto industry, considering its reputation for disrupting the legacy system, is actually breathing life back into it. The exuberance of the oversubscribed Circle ($CRCL) IPO, whose share price skyrocketed nearly 10x after its public debut, has catalyzed excitement for the crypto companies across Wall Street. It’s no surprise that Gemini, FalconX, and Bullish are among the crypto firms preparing for IPOs of their own. There’s a simultaneous flurry of special purpose acquisition companies and reverse mergers of public companies rushing to the market, especially those busily acquiring crypto assets on their balance sheets. Meanwhile, podcaster Eleanor Terrett reported the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is exploring ways to streamline crypto exchange-traded fund applications to forgo the required 19b-4 filing. When it comes to crypto companies, public markets are open for business. Despite this recent glimmer of hope, injected by crypto bull market excitement, overall public companies are struggling. In his 2024 letter to shareholders, JPM CEO Jamie Dimon said, “Our public markets have been shrinking dramatically, which I do not believe is a good thing. The number of public companies has gone from 7,300 in 1996 to 4,000 today – it should be 15,000 today.” Blaming overly zealous regulation, Dimon continued: “Regulations should encourage, rather than discourage, companies to go public.” In 2024, 176 companies in the U.S. raised a mere $33 billion through their IPOs. Just 20 years prior, in 2004, $43 million was raised across 233 companies. With the exception of the COVID anomalies of 2020-2021, where an unprecedented level of liquidity was injected into markets, the IPO market has been anemic at best. So far, in 2025, crypto companies (and companies investing in crypto) are proving to be the most resilient and adaptable players in an otherwise lethargic public market. This is not the first time that Wall Street has been swept up in blockchain mania. In 2017, Long Island Ice Tea Corp. rebranded to “Long Blockchain Corp.” and saw its share price surge 200%. The blockchain bubble eventually burst and the crypto industry entered a protracted bear market. While skeptics will suggest that this cycle is no different, there is a bigger change brewing beneath these headlines that could have an enduring impact on public markets. This is the metamorphosis of market structure itself--now made possible by integrating blockchain technology--and supported by a pro-crypto SEC. It’s expensive to go public. To IPO, companies work with investment bankers to build a syndicate of buyers and set an opening price. Underwriting fees can cost up to 7% of funds raised. Add compliance, audit and legal costs, and fees to go public typically reach into the millions of dollars. The costs do not stop there. It’s also expensive to stay public. Since a string of high profile accounting scandals, including Enron, rocked markets in the early 2000s, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 materially increased the ongoing compliance and reporting burden for public companies. According to a Harvard study in 2022, audit fees alone cost public companies an average of over $2 million per year. Former SEC Chair Gensler did not help matters. His relentless focus on enforcement actions, in addition to tighter disclosure rules on a range of corporate issues like climate change, added to the burden—and cost—of being public. It’s no surprise that companies are staying private. According to Blackrock, 81% of companies with over $100 million in revenue are privately held in the U.S. The issue with private markets is that they are indeed private, depriving ordinary people from investing in the most exciting and innovative companies. The new SEC is poised to address this. Last month at the Crypto Task Force Roundtable on Tokenization, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins noted, “A key priority of my Chairmanship will be to develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law.” When it comes to issuance, direct listings on blockchains could be the answer. Unlike traditional IPOs, which are supported by investment bank middlemen, direct listing is a form of going public that allows companies to issue shares directly and let market forces set the price. Blockchains are an obvious technology to support transfer agents, which are organizations that manage company stockholder records. By wrapping securities as tokens and issuing them on blockchains, anyone in the world with an internet connection could theoretically buy them 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The SEC would need to allow this in order for it to become the norm. Last month, the Solana Policy Institute, along with a consortium of crypto leaders, proposed a direct listing framework to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. Under this proposed model, issuers could issue “their token shares” directly on blockchains. Disclosures and registration would remain, and a series of exemptions from current regulations would be needed for the proposal to work. The markets seem to be ready. While memecoins, like dogecoin ($DOGE), have no intrinsic value or utility, there has been abundance of willing buyers. Last year, the combined market capitalization of memecoins soared to a whopping $140 billion . Robinhood ($HOOD) seems to think that those buyers would remain if it offered tokenized equities. This week it announced 24 hour-a-day stock trading for customers in Europe, supported by its own blockchain. If tokenized equity direct listings are allowed, this wouldn’t be the first time the SEC helped an innovative new product get off the ground. Equity tokens could be the new ETFs. In the 1990s, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden pushed a reluctant SEC staff to allow ETFs in the United States. By “wrapping” previously inaccessible (and, at times, sophisticated) assets as a security, retail investors could trade ETFs seamlessly from their brokerage account. By 2024, ETFs had grown to become a $13 trillion industry. When Breeden championed innovation through the launch of ETFs, he had an astute Chief of Staff. His name was Paul Atkins. It may be no coincidence that Atkins was sworn in as the new SEC chairman in April, nominated by the pro-bitcoin President Donald Trump. It remains to be seen whether this approach to fintech regulation will revive public markets.

Title: Is Crypto Ready for Q-Day?

Time Published: 2025-07-01T16:27:24Z
Full Content:
Are you ready for Q-Day? Do you even know what Q-Day is? If you don't, you're sleepwalking into a digital apocalypse that's not coming—it's already here. Q-Day isn't some distant theoretical event. It's the moment quantum computing shatters every lock, breaks every code, and renders every secret naked. While your most powerful supercomputer would need billions of years to crack modern encryption that currently secures crypto wallets, blockchains, digital banking assets, and WhatsApp chats, a quantum computer could do it over lunch. Every "secure" transaction, every "private" communication, every "protected" system becomes an open book. As Jay Gambetta, Vice President of IBM Quantum, warns: "The quantum threat isn't coming—it's here. Nation-states are harvesting encrypted data TODAY, betting they'll decrypt it tomorrow. If you're not quantum-safe now, you're already compromised." Let me be brutally clear: whether Q-Day arrives in one year, two years, or five years is completely irrelevant. Why? Because of "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attacks. Right now, as you read this, malicious nation states and criminal actors are vacuuming up encrypted data including medical records, financial transactions, state secrets, and your personal communications. They can't read it today, but they're betting on quantum to unlock it tomorrow. Computer scientist Deborah Frincke from Sandia National Laboratories doesn't mince words: "Pretty much anything that says a person is who they say they are is underpinned by encryption. Some of the most sensitive and valuable infrastructure that we have would be open to somebody coming in and pretending to be the rightful owner and issuing commands to shut down networks, influence the energy grid, or create financial disruption." In May 2025, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with $11.6 trillion under management, did something unprecedented. They added quantum computing as a critical risk warning to their Bitcoin ETF filing, warning that quantum advances could "undermine the viability" of cryptographic algorithms used not just in Bitcoin but across the entire global tech stack. Researchers warn that 4 million bitcoin—roughly 25% of all usable BTC—could be stolen once quantum computers advance enough to break their encryption. Leading quantum expert. It's not just Bitcoin. Ethereum and most blockchains today rely on Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and quantum will shatter that. Experts predict that Q-Day will come within the next five-to-seven years, but it could be sooner. Quantum is coming for bitcoin like meteors came for the dinosaurs. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has already proposed emergency hard-fork solutions for when quantum computers crack Ethereum accounts. The Ethereum blockchain would need to be paused for an unknown time until it's restored to a new quantum-resistant blockchain, a process that could take years. Behind closed doors at private crypto conferences, influential cryptographers and business leaders are concerned about a potential catastrophe where a computer strong enough to reverse engineer wallets' private keys could flood exchanges with ancient Bitcoin, sending prices spiraling. This isn't about losing your Netflix password. This is about the complete collapse of digital trust across Bitcoin wallets, Ethereum smart contracts, DeFi protocols, banking systems, power grids, military communications, healthcare records, and government secrets. By leveraging its computational power, a quantum miner could consistently solve the mathematical puzzles required to add new blocks to the blockchain, transforming mining from a decentralized global industry into an oligopoly controlled by quantum-capable entities. Some optimists say we have until 2030 before quantum computers can break encryption. They're missing the point entirely. The damage is being done today. Every piece of data transmitted now is a future casualty. According to a December 2023 Reuters report, Tilo Kunz of cybersecurity firm Quantum Defen5e told Defense Information Systems Agency officials that Q-day could come as soon as 2025. Google Quantum AI has already lowered the barrier to breaking widely used RSA-2048 encryption to fewer than one million qubits, dramatically reducing the resources needed for crypto-breaking quantum attacks. Forget patches, updates, or hoping someone else will solve this. Quantum resistance must be built into the foundation, not bolted on as an afterthought. We need post-quantum cryptography that can withstand both classical and quantum attacks, quantum-resistant digital signatures using hash-based and lattice-based cryptography, complete blockchain infrastructure overhauls, immediate migration from vulnerable crypto addresses, and action now, not committees discussing action later. QRL’s Iain Wood warns: "It is now no longer controversial to say that all blockchains that exist by 2035 will have to be post-quantum secure." Researchers at the University of Kent say that upgrading to post-quantum crypto-systems could take 75 days of downtime for Bitcoin, or over 300 days if the network operated at 75% capacity. Think about what that means for a trillion-dollar asset class. Q-Day isn't a future problem—it's a present crisis. While everyone's chasing AI dreams, the quantum nightmare is unfolding. The harvest is happening now. The decryption is coming. 2025 is probably our last chance to start migration to post-quantum cryptography before we are all undone by cryptographically relevant quantum computers. Stop asking when Q-Day will arrive. It's here. The only question is: will you be ready, or will you be roadkill on the quantum highway? In the quantum age, there are only two types of data: quantum-safe and future-compromised. For crypto holders, there are only two types of digital assets: post-quantum secured and future-worthless. Your Bitcoin, your Ethereum, your entire crypto portfolio hangs in the balance. The quantum clock is ticking, and every second you wait is another step toward total cryptographic annihilation.

Title: Circle Applies to Establish National Trust Bank in the U.S. to Manage USDC reserves, Switching from BlackRock
URL: https://zycrypto.com/circle-applies-to-establish-national-trust-bank-in-the-u-s-to-manage-usdc-reserves-switching-from-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-07-01T14:04:11Z
Full Content:
Circle, a crypto company that issues USDC stablecoin, has applied to establish a national trust bank to manage USDC reserves on the company’s behalf and abide by US regulations. Circle has applied for the trust from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). If the OCC approves, the trust would allow Circle to operate as a US-recognised trust institution. The announcement comes as US companies such as Circle try to integrate their services within traditional frameworks. Circle’s digital banking services would be better situated to provide USDC stablecoins to institutional investors, with the added benefit of custodial business services. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) can now decide whether Circle can operate a regulated trust institution. The trust will effectively allow Circle to manage its USDC holdings and validate its stablecoin issuing. This move would bolster USDC’s infrastructure and make it more competitive against larger stablecoins like Tether’s USDT. The new trust will also allow Circle to align its business practices with the new Genius Act, which has strict requirements for stablecoin issuers, to ensure that consumers get a fair go when investing in digital assets. There is another reason that Circle is taking the time to meet regulatory requirements. Circle is extending the reach of the US dollar to make it more powerful and to dominate foreign markets. The First National Digital Currency Bank, the name Circle gave to the new entity, would allow Circle to manage the custody of USDC for institutional clients. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, said that the approval would enable a financial network on the internet that is regulated yet accessible. In the meantime, BlackRock and BNY Mellon manage Circle’s USDC reserves. Allaire said the new currency bank would focus on digitising stocks and bonds. Circle maintains a strong relationship with BlackRock and BNY Mellon, wishing to use their services even with the new currency bank managing USDC reserves. Circle seems to be more interested in traditional services than working with Bitcoin or Ethereum. Circle may be trying to increase the dominance of the US dollar by seeking approval from federal and local authorities, one regulation at a time. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, commented that the company always sought the highest standards to build client trust. Allaire said that this was why he sought out a publicly listed company in the US, and now created a national trust company, to build trust by seeking high standards. Crypto was meant to be a trustless technology from the beginning. Who are these high standards built for, institutional investors or retail traders? There seems to be a demand for trust, even when trading trustless technologies, because crypto often has to be mediated through centralised exchanges. Stablecoins usually involve one-to-one pegging of a token with a real-world asset, such as Gold or USD. Many of these US stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar. Stablecoins were used to transfer tokens on exchanges, such as between Ethereum and USDT. However, institutional investors have recently discovered that stablecoins could enable cheap transfers and fast cross-border transactions. Circle currently holds treasury bills to back up its USDC tokens. Circle employs BlackRock to manage its treasury bills. JPMorgan said that many companies, such as Amazon, MasterCard, and Walmart, may decide to create stablecoins to compete with USDC. With its IPO, Circle had such a resounding success that it may have inspired other companies to engage in stablecoin reserves. The race has begun for stablecoin dominance. But there was a stablecoin market way before the US companies started to cotton on to their potential. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, has been around for a long time and dominates the stablecoin market. There are serious risks involved in starting a stablecoin market. USDC already has a low share of stablecoins compared to other major issuers. Circle, therefore, may struggle to maintain dominance when other companies enter the market. Circle, however, has the advantage of maintaining a good relationship with US authorities. They may be able to extend this advantage to engaging with European markets. Circle (CRCL), meanwhile, experienced an all-time high last week at $260 on the stock market.

Title: Circle Moves To Establish National Trust Bank In US Following $18 Billion IPO

Time Published: 2025-07-01T11:00:06Z

Circle (CRCL), issuer of the market’s second largest stablecoin, USDC, is applying to establish a national trust bank in the United States. This announcement follows Circle’s recent Initital Public Offering (IPO), which valued the company at nearly $18 billion. If approved by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the new entity, named First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., will allow Circle to serve as a custodian for its reserves and manage crypto assets on behalf of institutional clients. Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, emphasized the company’s commitment to trust, transparency, and compliance during an interview with Reuters. He stated, “Becoming a publicly traded company is a significant part of that, and becoming a national trust company is again a continuation of that.” Unlike traditional banks, this new charter will not permit the stablecoin issuer to accept cash deposits or issue loans, marking a distinct approach to banking within the digital asset space. Currently, Circle’s reserves are managed at BNY Mellon and BlackRock, backed by a mix of short-term Treasury bills, cash, and other liquid assets. The proposed national trust bank would primarily focus on custody services for tokenized assets, such as stocks and bonds, rather than traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). This initiative comes at a crucial time as Congress moves closer to enacting a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. The recently passed stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, mandates that stablecoins be backed by liquid assets and requires issuers to disclose their reserve compositions monthly. With the House of Representatives poised to vote on the legislation soon, and US President Donald Trump expected to sign it into law, the regulatory environment for stablecoins is on the verge of significant change. Allaire remarked on the transformative potential of this regulatory shift, stating, “We’re going from the early-adopter phase of this technology into the mainstream.” He expressed optimism that securing approval for the national trust charter would provide a solid foundation for institutions to build upon, further legitimizing the role of stablecoins in the financial ecosystem. Per the report, Wall Street’s initial response to Circle’s growth has been largely positive, with several major brokerages, including Barclays and Bernstein, issuing “buy” ratings and setting price targets above $200 for the company’s stock. However, some analysts have expressed caution regarding the stock’s valuation, which has more than doubled since its market debut. As of press time, CRCL closed Monday’s trading session at $180, representing a nearly 40% drop from its $299 record achieved last week. Allaire concluded by highlighting Circle’s approach in aligning with emerging US regulations. He noted that the establishment of a national digital currency trust bank represents a significant milestone in the quest to create a transparent, efficient, and accessible internet financial system.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs add $2.9B in last week of June ending month strong

Time Published: 2025-07-01T10:15:55Z

BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark lead ETF inflows, offsetting the outflows from Grayscale's GBTC. Spot Bitcoin ETFs added $2.92 billion in net inflows between June 23 and June 30, capping off the strongest eight-day streak since mid-May. After slowing inflows in early June, the market appears to have re-engaged with ETFs as geopolitical uncertainty flared again in the Middle East and broader risk appetite improved. The bulk of the inflows came on June 24 and June 25, when issuers saw a combined $1.14 billion enter products led by BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Ark’s ARKB. ARKB saw an unusual $70.2 million on June 25, its second-largest daily inflow in June, suggesting revived institutional positioning after three weeks of weak flows. In the last week of June, Bitcoin moved up from $105,415 on June 23 to a closing high of $108,382 on June 29 before retreating slightly to $107,210 on June 30. The price advance was relatively steady, with low volatility and rising support around $107,000. That stability likely encouraged renewed confidence in ETF allocations, especially following the $1.7 billion weekly inflow reported by CoinShares across global crypto funds. US-based spot ETFs appear to have accounted for most of that figure. June 27 also stood out with a nearly $500 million haul, as BlackRock and Fidelity saw daily inflows above $150 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC continued to leak assets, but outflows were limited to $8 million or less per day compared to the hundreds of millions seen in previous months. The diminishing GBTC bleed further supports the narrative that ETF rebalancing may be reaching maturity, with capital now flowing more directly into low-fee issuers rather than migrating from legacy trusts. According to CoinShares, the inflows also came amid a broader 11-week streak of positive inflows across all digital asset investment products. That broader macro context, relatively calm funding rates, and a subdued derivatives market helped steer attention back to ETFs as the more straightforward proxy for directional bets. The combination of stable prices and strong flows reinforces the growing role of spot ETFs as a barometer of investor sentiment and macro positioning. With June now closed, July begins with ETFs holding over $48.9 billion in assets.

Title: How AI is speeding up the slow investing game

It took an AllianceBernstein healthcare analyst just one afternoon to analyze what would have once taken her months: the potential impact of President Donald Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill" on specific drugs and insurance plans across state lines. Andrew Chin, the firm's chief artificial intelligence officer, said the analyst used one of the $790 billion asset manager's in-house tools to quickly interpret the legislation and identify which companies would be affected, allowing her to make a fast, confident investment call. "Because she was able to do that, she was able to make money for our client portfolios a lot faster," said Chin, adding that the analyst "locked in some of the alpha" in a way that was not previously possible. Fundamental investors take a slow and methodical approach to their investment decisions. Whether reviewing financial statements or talking to vendors and company executives, it can take months for a fundamental investor to reach a conclusion about what to invest in and at what price. Not anymore. Artificial intelligence is changing the slow investing game popularized by investors like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Peter Lynch of Fidelity. While asset managers have long used machine learning to crunch spreadsheets and detect trading signals—especially in quant and systematic strategies— these tools can also quickly digest and analyze vast reams of unstructured information, like earnings call transcripts, regulatory filings, and even emails. It's allowing large asset managers to make fundamental investing decisions faster than ever before. Here are three firms that are using AI to transform their investment processes: Two and a half years ago, JPMorgan Asset Management AI strategist Dillon Edwards sat down with upward of 50 portfolio managers to understand what they needed. He asked them about the screens they use, the questions they ask themselves throughout the day, and the common thread was, "Just get our attention to the right data, at the right time, in the right place." That request led to the creation of Smart Monitor, which Edwards described as "Spotify for the investor." It scans mountains of data to surface timely, relevant insights for the firm's portfolio managers and analysts. Smart Monitor is part of JPMorgan's broader AI build-out for its $3.7 trillion asset management arm, which is hosted on a platform called Spectrum. Another tool within this platform is Moneyball, which helps portfolio managers identify and correct potential biases in their investment decisions by analyzing historical data and market behaviors. Rather than building something new for investors to learn, Edwards and his team focused on AI directly into the process that investors have spent years perfecting. The bottom-up approach has helped to minimize AI skeptics: A handful of "champion" PMs worked closely with engineers during development and became in-house unofficial salespeople who market it to their own teams. "No one wants another tool, another thing to do, something that the AI team somehow thinks is going to be helpful for an investor without empathizing with what they're doing today," he said. Kristian West, JPMorgan Asset Management's head of investment platform, said the firm is also developing similar tools with the goal of seeing if they can continue to scale the quantitative process, or data-driven systematic investing. "That's an area where we think it is just pretty obvious, whereas technology and data capabilities improve, those two worlds collide a lot more," he said. For fundamental investors—portfolio managers and analysts who base long-term decisions on a deep understanding of individual companies—this marks a turning point: a chance to move faster and dig deeper, but also a moment to rethink how they work. Chin calls this evolution the rise of the "iron person": a human investor enhanced by AI armor. Not a replacement, but an upgrade. AB has developed an internal chatbot called AB AI, along with several tools to help pull from internal data, prep for company meetings, or conduct research tailored to the manager's investment philosophy. Chin said that many AB analysts often develop their own AI agents using ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot with specific prompts to, for example, run an analysis on the companies in their sector after an earnings call. "They're able to then analyze companies the way they want to, so they get a more tailored or customized version of what the tool can provide them," he said. Chin said about 75% of the firm's over 500 investment professionals are using their tools. People sharing stories like "it takes me a day rather than a month to do something, or I was able to get this insight that I did not get before," have driven others to try it, said Chin. For the remaining 25% who haven't picked up AI, he believes they "will just naturally come when they see the performance of their counterparts has gotten better." A big reveal from BlackRock's investor day last month shows just how fast the field is moving. The $11 trillion investing behemoth has launched Asimov, an agentic AI platform for its fundamental equity business. Agentic AI doesn't just answer questions following prompts — it can take action on its own. "While everyone else is sleeping at night, we have these virtual AI agents, they're scanning research notes, company filings, emails to generate portfolio insights," the firm's chief operating officer, Robert Goldstein, said. He hopes Asimov will be deployed across the firm by the next investor day, offering investors at the world's biggest asset manager a powerful teammate. Raffaele Savi, its global head of systemic investing, underscored how significantly AI is affecting the investing world. The speed and power of having "real-time, millions of stimulations a day happening in the background, developing situational awareness" that helps ensure the portfolio reflects the manager's intentions are "profound." "The world has changed tremendously," he said. Jump to

Title: Banking Comes Full Circle with First National Digital Currency Bank: Best Crypto to Buy?

Circle, the company behind the $USDC stablecoin announced on June 30 that it has applied for a national trust bank charter. With a blockchain banking revolution on the horizon, which altcoins could be poised to benefit? Circle’s trust banking license aspirations follow its landmark IPO that valued the company at approximately $18B. Circle’s USDC reserves, currently held and managed by BNY Mellon and BlackRock, would now benefit from in-house oversight, increasing credibility with institutional players. Compliance with the license demands that it not cross into deposit-taking or lending. This could be subject to change, of course, as the regulatory environment in the US clarifies. So far, meeting compliance standards has led Circle to prioritize seeking licenses: CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized Circle’s commitment to building ‘an internet financial system that is transparent, efficient, and accessible.’ The timing of the move isn’t just about the IPO; it also aligns well with US regulatory currents, including the GENIUS stablecoin bill now advancing through Congress. That bill mandates clear reserve structures and full transparency to help normalize stablecoin use within legacy financial institutions. TradFi is increasingly exploring blockchain as a remedy to its woes. Aave founder Stani Kulechov highlighted the benefits blockchain brings to TradFi: unmatched global reach, instant access to digital financial products, and a global customer base. Hurdles remain, of course. Fragmented interoperability between tokens and blockchains hampers liquidity and cross-chain transactions. There are proposed solutions, though, such as Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which aims to knit together disparate blockchains as logically as the internet connects different networks. Kulechov envisions a future where DeFi protocols like Aave serve as global financial utilities, unhindered by siloed systems. Reports that a banking consortium including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo is considering issuing its own stablecoin overlook a salient point: TradFi will also have to overcome an increasingly strong first-mover advantage wielded by Circle and others. As Todd Ruoff, CEO of Autonomys, said, ‘the rules were written by crypto natives.’ Circle is covered by licenses in 46 US states, plus by New York BitLicense, along with a $USDC market cap hovering around $61B. That’s a big hurdle for any new TradFi/crypto banks to overcome. While the banks plan their entry into blockchain, these three altcoins are poised to make big gains. The key to First National Digital Assets Bank could rest in your crypto wallet. That’s why you need the toughest crypto wallet around. Best Wallet provides a simple, secure, and straightforward way to store and use crypto. With MPC and biometric security and the ability to create multiple wallets, you can buy, store, and swap crypto securely, all within a single, powerful Web3 wallet. When you load it up with the native $BEST token, you get even more utility from your wallet, including: Select crypto presales are available directly within the Best Wallet app, making researching and purchasing the hottest crypto presales easier than ever. Learn how to buy Best Wallet Token and see why our own price prediction sees $BEST moving from its current $0.025265 to a potential $0.62 by 2026. Visit the presale page to buy or learn more. You want meme coins — the frenetic energy, crazy gains, and potential for wild swings that every degen craves. But you won’t find those on your mainstream CEXs – at least, not very often. Most of the time, the best action comes from low-cap tokens trading underground on sites like Telegram. But how do you find them? That’s where Snorter Bot and the $SNORT token come in. What is Snorter? It’s the best way to hunt down the best Solana meme coins, with all the tools you need to trade with confidence. This includes: And with the $SNORT token you’ll get lower trading fees and better access to new tokens. It’s one of the reasons our $SNORT price prediction sees the token climbing to $0.94 from its current $0.0967, delivering 872% gains by the end of 2026. Learn how to buy Snorter Token and visit the presale page. Donald Trump has gone big on crypto, both in his administration and personally. World Liberty Financial, his official crypto project, is one of his biggest moves. There was a World Liberty Financial presale for its governance token, $WLFI, a few months ago, but the biggest offering from the project so far has been $USD1, a dollar-based stablecoin. There’s no room for big gains with $USD1 itself, but the token could anchor a much more significant crypto ecosystem from a US president who already has a stablecoin and his own meme coin. In the meantime, $WLFI recently attracted a $100M investment from the UAE as international investors see the potential benefits of Trump’s global crypto aspirations. Circle’s trust bank charter application is under regulatory review; approval would mark a significant milestone in bridging the TradFi and blockchain worlds. With Circle’s bank charter bid, regulatory advances, DeFi’s global potential, and the rise of institutional stablecoins, all the elements are emerging for an intertwined financial ecosystem. These three altcoins could be in line to benefit, but always do your own research. This isn’t financial advice. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Bitcoin ETP With DeFi Yield Goes Live in Europe

A bitcoin BTC$109,112.62 exchange-traded product (ETP) that generates yield from decentralized finance (DeFi) markets has debuted on Tuesday, in what issuer Fineqia calls a first of its kind. The Fineqia Bitcoin Yield ETP (YBTC), listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange, targets a 6% annual yield by deploying investor capital into DeFi strategies. It is issued by Fineqia’s Liechtenstein-based subsidiary and advised by Psalion Yield, a digital asset investment firm focused on blockchain-based yield. Unlike existing crypto yield ETPs that rely on derivatives or structured notes, YBTC maintains one-to-one exposure to bitcoin while generating returns directly from DeFi protocols. “It allows investors to earn more BTC while they hold it, combining long-term conviction with compounding returns, all inside a regulated wrapper,” said Fineqia CEO, Bundeep Singh Rangar. The ETP also supports in-kind transfers, meaning that digital asset holders can contribute BTC directly to the product without the need to first convert into cash incurring a taxable event. YBTC arrives at a time when investor interest in crypto-focused investments is growing. These investment products has brought digital assets closer to traditional investors, allowing them to invest in digital assets in a familiar way through brokerage accounts without the need of crypto wallets and blockchain transactions. Bitcoin exchange-traded products enjoyed rapid growth over the past year and have gobbled up $150 billion of assets, Fineqia said.

Title: The Dollar Just Had Its Worst Start to a Year Since 1973

The US dollar has experienced its steepest decline at the start of a year since the early 1970s, sparking concerns about the nation's financial standing and the global economic order. The downward trend comes amid significant policy changes under President Trump, including aggressive tariffs and an increasingly isolationist approach, which have unsettled international investors and affected confidence in the US economy despite the strong stock market, the New York Times reports. The dollar's drop of more 10% against a basket of major international currencies over the past six months marks its worst first-half performance since 1973, and its worst half-year since the second half of 1991. The US dollar has experienced its steepest decline at the start of a year since the early 1970s, sparking concerns about the nation's financial standing and the global economic order. The downward trend comes amid significant policy changes under President Trump, including aggressive tariffs and an increasingly isolationist approach, which have unsettled international investors and affected confidence in the US economy despite the strong stock market, the New York Times reports. The dollar's drop of more 10% against a basket of major international currencies over the past six months marks its worst first-half performance since 1973, and its worst half-year since the second half of 1991. The weakening dollar makes overseas travel more expensive for Americans and discourages foreign investment in the US, while potentially benefiting exporters by making US goods cheaper abroad—though these effects are complicated by ongoing trade tensions, the Times notes. "Trump's tariffs, the fact that many investors view his administration as somewhat chaotic, along with concerns over US national debt have seen the dollar fall out of favor," Trade Nation market analyst David Morrison tells the Guardian. The dollar surged after Trump was re-elected but it peaked just before he took office and started to slide as hopes of a fully pro-business administration faded, the Times reports. Because the decline started when the dollar was at a relatively high level, it isn't especially weak by historical standards, but analysts say the "Big Beautiful Bill," which will add trillions to the deficit over the next decade, is likely to weaken it further. "Full-scale de-dollarization, if it ever comes, is still a long way away," according to Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. "But there is one dynamic playing out that could significantly raise that risk: increasing government debt."

Dear friends, Welcome to the “Midsommar in Scandinavia” issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. Chip and I are enjoying a long-planned holiday in Sweden and Norway. We’re equally delighted that you’re here … and we’re there! Among other things (how would I know for sure? I’m in Gamla Stan), Lynn Bolin addresses the emerging threat of tariff-induced inflation with “Protecting Against Tariff Induced Inflation,” analyzing how widespread tariffs will likely be passed through to consumers and drive inflation to an estimated 3.4% peak next quarter. Drawing on five years of post-pandemic bond performance data, he demonstrates that shorter-duration and inflation-protected securities have significantly outperformed traditional intermediate-term bonds, leading him to rotate into funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index (VTAPX), Fidelity Inflation-Protected Bond Index Fund (FIPDX), and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset Fund (PZRMX). Bolin has reduced his stock allocation from 65% to 50% and now maintains approximately 7% of his bond allocation in inflation-protected securities, with another 40% in shorter-duration bonds, while also incorporating target-maturity TIPS ETFs like iShares iBonds Oct 2030 Term Tips ETF (IBIG) into his bond ladders. America’s premier Asian investment boutique, Matthews Asia, has fallen on hard times. Former CEO and portfolio manager Mark Headley has returned from retirement, intent on fixing that. Our hour-long interview is summarized in “Good Bones There.” Without any doubt, the most successful small-cap value fund in existence is Scott Barbee’s Aegis Value Fund. We last shared a full profile of the fund in 2013, but it has appeared in eight data-driven articles since then. We decided it was high time to catch up with Mr. Barbee and correct our oversight in a profile of Aegis Value Fund (AVALX). Three years ago, in the midst of a market meltdown (do you even recall the ’22 crash now), we offered advice on how to cope with a … ummm “spanked portfolio.” The whimsical accompanying graphic generated a surprising amount of site traffic. This month, we offer a three-year retrospective on our 2022 advice: keep calm and consider small-value funds with high-quality portfolios. The performance numbers seem promising. We also share a Launch Alert for Stewart Investors Worldwide Leaders Fund, the US launch of a successful non-US strategy focusing on a concentrated portfolio of high-quality, sustainable businesses. The launch was seeded by a US foundation, so the initial share class is institution with retail in the pipeline! Hedge funds are shifting to Asia. Goldman Sachs reports that hedge fund trading in Asian markets have a five-year high in June. “Hedge funds bought equities in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India last week, but were short selling onshore Chinese stocks,” Goldman said. Family offices are shifting to infrastructure and private debt. A BlackRock survey of 175 family offices, the investment manager for ultra-wealthy families, reports that one-third were planning to increase exposure to private debt this year and 30% were planning to commit more resources to infrastructure investments. Almost every smart beta (e.g., low volatility or fundamental valuation) strategy has failed to produce, according to new research from Research Affiliates (free registration required). The short version: RA has been tracking the performance of a series of factor-based portfolios since 2018, looking to see whether any provided the promised excess return. They did not. In every case, just investing in “the market” was a better bet. The good news: “the market” – defined by its large / growth / momentum subset, is now so egregiously overpriced that almost everything outside of that niche is dramatically underpriced. Source: Research Affiliates, 06/2025 The way to read that chart is to start by finding the little green diamonds. Those are the more-or-less current valuations of each strategy relative to its historic valuations. Green diamonds below the colored bar, which illustrates the historic range from 10th percentile to 90th, signals that the strategy is now cheaper than it has been 90% or 95% of the time. RA concludes that’s good news since valuation matters: … we believe there may be hope for all smart beta strategies. If markets receive a wake-up call and valuations revert, a multitude of systematic factor-based equity strategies could all have a field day. After eight years of going horribly wrong, smart beta investing may now go horribly right. AI is a lot dumber than we thought. A series of research reports, most recently from Apple, argue that while AI can execute certain tasks exceptionally well, reasoning is not among them. The researchers found that in simple reasoning tasks, including the Towers of Hanoi challenge, AIs underperform 7-year-olds. Their central argument is that even the most advanced LLMs do not think in any way that resembles us. Their conclusion is that AI “thinking” is not just different, it’s horrible. (Gary Marcus, “A Knockout Blow for LLMs? LLM ‘reasoning’ is so cooked, they turned my name into a verb,” Communications of the ACM, 6/16/2025). Source: Amazon.com As the complexity of demands rises, moving AI beyond its comfort zone, so does the frequency of hallucinations. One estimate is that 79% of responses from some of the newer AI contain hallucinated content (“A.I. Is Getting More Powerful, but Its Hallucinations Are Getting Worse,” New York Times, 5/6/2025, subscription required). A coda to that argument: ChatGPT just lost a chess match to an Atari 2600. If you’re, oh, under 50, you can be forgiven for the question “WTF is an Atari?” because the 2600 is a home video game console released in 1977. ChatGPT actually volunteered to play the old game system. Oops. One report of the match contained this summary: In fact, the Atari wiped the floor with ChatGPT when it came to chess. I don’t mean the near-half-century-old game console won. I mean that ChatGPT made blunders that would embarrass the greenest of beginners. On the upside, perhaps it thinks it won? “So I said ‘here, hold ma beer an’ gimme a knight an’ I kicked its little Atari keester all the way to …’”. AI is dirtier than we thought. Not “smutty dirt” (though that’s nice, too) but “energy- and water-gulping dirty.” MIT researchers found two troubling trends: AI data centers use more power and more power derived from fossil fuels than “normal” data centers: … more than half of the electricity going to data centers will be used for AI. At that point, AI alone could consume as much electricity annually as 22% of all US households. Meanwhile, data centers are expected to continue trending toward using dirtier, more carbon-intensive forms of energy (like gas) to fill immediate needs, leaving clouds of emissions in their wake. (“We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard,” MIT Technology Review, 6/2025) Part of the challenge is that AI companies seem desperately concerned with obscuring the magnitude of their energy and water use, which some suspect sounds like a guilty conscience at work. AI users are stupider than we thought. Folks have casually and constantly observed the tendency of people to be lazy, turning to AI to do their work and thoughtlessly passing it along as their own. The underlying phenomenon is called “cognitive offloading.” It’s driven by two biological imperatives: humans have a limited supply of energy each day and thinking requires a lot of energy. Our survival response is to think as little as necessary to get through the day. The polite term for us is “cognitive misers.” We rely on tricks, shortcuts, and habits – none of which require much energy – to muddle through. But we also offload tasks – we delegate – whenever possible. As a quick test, how many telephone numbers can you recite off the top of your head? (No, 9-1-1 doesn’t count.) When I was young, the answer was probably “dozens.” Today, it’s probably two or three (my own, Chip’s, and my son’s). I count on my phone to keep track of the rest. That’s cognitive offloading. A second set of MIT researchers, the Brain on Large Language Models team, has been doing fairly rigorous research on how our brains respond to the availability of AI/LLMs as an offloading option. (Spoiler alert: not well.) Most recently, they gave three groups of students the same task. One group had access to ChatGPT, one had access to Google, and the other had to think for themselves. (Yikes.) The study ran over four months and included both brain activity monitors and direct observation. Their findings: Brain connectivity systematically scaled down with the amount of external support: the Brain‑only group exhibited the strongest, widest‑ranging networks, Search Engine group showed intermediate engagement, and LLM assistance elicited the weakest overall coupling … The reported ownership of LLM group’s essays in the interviews was low. The Search Engine group had strong ownership, but lesser than the Brain-only group. The LLM group also fell behind in their ability to quote from the essays they wrote just minutes prior. (Your Brain on ChatGPT, 6/2025) The short version: the brains of Chat-dependent students literally powered down and while the students nominally completed the work themselves, they had little belief in their own written conclusions and couldn’t quite remember what they’d just said. Rather as we can’t quite remember our sibling’s phone number five minutes after we called them. The White House apparently has an opening for a new Best Billionaire Friend (BBF) after a spectacular fallout between Mr. Trump and the previous holder of the position, Mr. Musk. Mr. Musk, who invested heavily in Mr. Trump’s election campaign, left government service, such as it was, denounced Mr. Trump’s signature legislative package as “a disgusting abomination” and endorsed a call for Mr. Trump’s impeachment. He nonetheless affirmed his “love for the guy.” Two of Mr. Musk’s associates attribute the fallout to Mr. Trump’s failure to give Musk and Tesla favorable treatment under the bill. “Elon was butthurt,” according to one source. Musk threatened to decommission his fleet of Dragon spacecraft. Trump threatened to “terminate Elon’s Government Subsidies and Contracts” and to investigate his business practices. Musk caved. We’ve written a fair amount about the history and enduring psychology of these alliances (“If you’re so rich, why aren’t you smart?” LinkedIn, 4/2025). Two things to remember: Fortunately, the BBF position is likely to be swiftly filled. UBS reports (6/2025) that there are now 31 people with wealth in excess of $50 billion dollars.

Title: Crypto Inflows Hit $2.7B in One Week, What Are Institutions Buying?

Crypto asset investment products saw continued momentum last week, with $2.7 billion in net inflows reported across major funds. According to data from CoinShares, this marks the 11th consecutive week of inflows, bringing the year-to-date total to $16.9 billion. The sustained interest has been led by institutional players such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, ProShares, and 21Shares, all of which have seen growing demand for their crypto-related products. The majority of last week’s inflows originated from the United States, which accounted for $2.65 billion of the global total. Minor contributions also came from Switzerland and Germany, at $23 million and $19.8 million respectively. Meanwhile, other regions, including Canada, Hong Kong, and Brazil, saw modest outflows. Notably, Hong Kong registered total outflows of $132 million for the month of June, despite having previously recorded strong inflow activity during regional price rallies. Bitcoin remained the primary recipient of institutional interest, attracting $2.2 billion, or roughly 83% of the week’s inflows. Short-Bitcoin products, however, experienced $2.9 million in outflows, bringing total year-to-date outflows for bearish bets on BTC to $12 million. This inverse movement highlights a broader market leaning towards long exposure, reflecting positive sentiment around Bitcoin’s current price structure and potential future performance. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noted that the mid-year performance closely tracks that of 2024, which ended June with inflows totaling $18.3 billion. Butterfill attributed the ongoing trend to a combination of macroeconomic factors, including geopolitical instability and shifting expectations around central bank policies. He emphasized that uncertainty surrounding interest rate cuts and broader economic signals has likely driven investors to consider digital assets as part of a diversified strategy. Ethereum also recorded meaningful inflows last week, with $429 million added to institutional products tied to the asset. Year-to-date, Ethereum-focused funds have now accumulated $2.9 billion in net inflows, positioning it as the second-most favored digital asset among institutional investors. The rise in ETH inflows comes amid continued growing activity in Layer 2 networks, which have contributed to the platform’s expanding utility. Solana, by contrast, continues to lag in investor interest, with only $91 million in inflows reported for the year so far. While Solana has gained traction in areas such as DeFi and NFT issuance, it appears to be attracting more speculative capital rather than large-scale institutional flows at this stage. The disparity between Ethereum and Solana suggests that investor confidence is still largely tied to the more established networks when allocating capital to altcoins.

In this edition of Inside RAI, Center for Revitalizing American Institutions Director Brandice Canes-Wrone outlines the continued decline in public trust in higher education and how it threatens universities. She also has produced new research highlighting how political campaign donors versus the voting public view Supreme Court appointments. RAI also sponsored several conferences, entertaining the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and social media applications in shaping democratic practice at home and abroad. Elsewhere, Andrew B. Hall applies the 19th-century concept of “liquid democracy” to modern times, and David L. Leal explores whether the Latino vote will continue to shift rightward during the second administration of President Donald Trump. Threats to Universities and What We Can Do At Princeton’s James Madison Center for Ideals and Institutions, RAI Director Brandice Canes-Wrone spoke about the attacks on the independence of American universities, in the context of the declining levels of trust they hold with the public. How can universities improve the public’s confidence in them and retain their independence? If universities fail, there’s a lot that America stands to lose. Eight of the ten universities with the largest number of Nobel laureates are in the United States. A tremendous amount of innovation emerges from the research performed at US universities. Canes-Wrone reminds us of what universities contribute to society and describes what universities can do to reverse the trend of public distrust. Watch the video here. Mass Versus Donor Attitudes on the Importance of Supreme Court Nominations In the American Political Science Review, Brandice Canes-Wrone and coauthors Jonathan P. Kastellec and Nicolas Studen report on their survey of 7,000 political donors and a sample of the general public, in which they asked members of each constituency how they prioritize Supreme Court justice nominations. They find donors “substantially more likely “than what they call their “general public co-partisans” to prioritize Supreme Court nominations. “Our unique survey data on donors shows that these differences are quite sizable; on average, donors from either [major] party are about 20 percentage points more likely to cite judicial appointments as a top-three priority compared to general population partisans,” Canes-Wrone and her coauthors write.

Scholars Meet at Hoover to Discuss Possibility of Ideologically Neutral AI in a Polarized World Recognizing the rising power of artificial intelligence to shape the public’s opinions and influence how information is created and consumed, scholars gathered at the Hoover Institution on March 21 to discuss ways to create generative AI models all Americans can trust in an increasingly polarized era. Convened by Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Andrew B. Hall, he said the meeting was meant to determine how the AI models and agents of the future would “reflect our values and earn our trust, given concerns that companies and governments might accidentally or intentionally engineer them to adopt some beliefs and preferences over others.” Sponsored by RAI, the conference is one of many efforts underway to push back on the root causes of declining public trust in institutions and the growing distance between the far points on America’s political spectrum. It brought together scholars on AI, free speech, and computer science, along with representatives from social media and AI firms themselves. Research presented during the day suggested developing ideologically neutral large language models will be a difficult task. Read more here. Building on the conference, a new paper from Hall and Hoover Institution fellows Justin Grimmer and Sean Westwood finds that most Americans perceive major large language models (LLMs) as biased and that small changes in how the LLMs are instructed could measurably reduce this sentiment. Exploring Liquid Democracy for the 21st Century On the latest episode of Policy Stories, Hall speaks of resurrecting a 19th-century concept known as liquid democracy and applying it to help make decisions in the 21st century. In liquid democracy, voters retain the option to vote for themselves, but those who feel insufficiently informed can give their vote to someone else to cast on their behalf. It's a hybrid between representative democracy and direct democracy. And digital technology makes it feasible to build this option at scale for the first time. Today, a variety of organizations are actively experimenting with different ways to delegate decision-making power to others. Major investment firms like BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard now allow shareholders to delegate their votes through voting-choice programs using blockchain. Hall is exploring whether systems that delegate decision-making power to randomly sampled citizen assemblies could provide guidance on what AI chatbots should and shouldn't say or what they can and cannot do. The real-world applications for liquid democracy are promising. In California, for example, ballot initiatives, which are chances for voters to make decisions together outside the legislative process, can be so numerous that it's difficult to be informed on each one. Delegating the call to better-informed citizens could be beneficial. Watch the episode here. Hoover’s RAI Asks How Social Media and AI Can Encourage Democratic Practice Some public commentators fear that social media and generative AI drive polarization and misinformation online, while others hope that they might counter polarization and help to restore public trust, according to scholars at a gathering at the Hoover Institution. The Social Media and Democratic Practice conference on March 17, 2025, sought to see how social media platforms and AI both positively and negatively impact public discourse and democracy. Earlier studies of legacy platforms like Facebook, Twitter (now X), and YouTube found little evidence of harmful effects produced by explicitly political content on social media. At the time, filter bubbles were largely nonexistent, and misinformation and disinformation had little or no discernible effect. The prevailing theory was simply that most people paid little attention to politics on social media and thus were immune to potential effects. In recent years, however, new platforms have proliferated. While not explicitly political, many of these might have important indirect political effects, such as the 2024 Joe Rogan podcast of a conversation with Donald Trump that has reportedly been streamed more than 50 million times. In addition, seemingly nonpolitical content on legacy social media (such as posts reflecting vaccine skepticism) can have political implications. Scant research has examined these new dimensions of the social media universe as yet. Senior Fellow Morris P. Fiorina, who organized the event, said the gathering was aimed at encouraging research about the ways new developments in social media and other online applications help and hinder democratic engagement and practice. “Today is a first step in measuring impact and reach of political content on social media, something academics have not paid enough attention to in recent years,” Fiorina said.

He is also a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin. He spoke with Chris Herhalt about how the Latino vote is moving to the right, and the misconceptions both major political parties hold about Hispanic voters. Chris Herhalt: Can you explain what you call the Latino assimilation paradox? David L. Leal: I created this term as a way to explain some of the big-picture dynamics involving the Latino vote, particularly the rumors, misunderstandings, and wishful thinking that have circulated within both Democratic and Republican circles. For many years, the common view of how demographic change would shape politics was the theory of “demography as destiny.” This predicted that as the Latino population grew and the American population more generally diversified, the Democratic Party would be the inevitable beneficiary. All it had to do was sit back and wait for an unstoppable demographic dividend at the ballot box. The flip side was that Republicans would eventually be reduced to permanent minority party status. The logic was that as California went, so would go the nation. This belief was shared by Democrats and Republicans, although it gave confidence—some would say complacency—to the former but heartburn to the latter. There have been good reasons to doubt this rather oversimplified view of how population change would shape politics. And by the Trump era, real-life electoral results and polling data were showing that Latinos—and also many immigrants and other minority groups—were starting to move toward the Republican Party in a slow but sure way. This was contrary to almost everything that activists, academics, journalists, pollsters, politicians, and pundits, Republicans included, were expecting. Many are now trying to understand why Latinos are moving toward the GOP. My answer is that this is just the latest chapter in the great American assimilation story. We do not have time here to review the scholarship, but to take one example, the 2005 book Italians Then, Mexicans Now studied socioeconomic progress among second-generation immigrants in two different historical eras, and the title says it all. Assimilation is complex, of course, but it was real and consequential then, and it is real and consequential now. Politically, across the last century, we find that new waves of immigrant groups often begin as strong Democrats, but over time, they slowly but surely move toward the Republican Party. This was true broadly for all of the White Catholic ethnic groups of the late 19th and early 20th centuries: Italian-Americans, Polish-Americans, Irish-Americans, and others. The White Catholic vote is today majority Republican, but when John F. Kennedy ran in 1960, it would have seemed self-evident that Catholics would overwhelmingly and indefinitely vote Democratic. But assimilation did its work, despite long-standing populist rumors to the contrary. Today, although the evidence for assimilation remains strong, both parties have denied, doubted, and disparaged its effects, although for very different reasons, and this is where we find the paradoxes—one for each party. Read more here. Renewing America’s Civics Education A story in the Stanford Report highlights the Stanford Civics Initiative (SCI), a joint endeavor between the School of Humanities and Sciences and the Hoover Institution that launched in the fall of 2020 and is led by RAI participant and Senior Fellow Josiah Ober. “The goal of civic education in a democracy is learning how to live in a world in which there are people who are very different from yourself,” said Ober. “A core part of teaching citizenship is showing students how to gain an understanding of where other people are coming from and figuring out a way to engage together to make policy and create civic bargains—the compromise and negotiation integral to democracy.” SCI provides Stanford students with advanced courses on democratic citizenship and is about to launch a senior honors program. The initiative builds on a long-standing tradition at Stanford of studying, in the words of the university’s founding grant, “the blessings of liberty regulated by law.” Read more here. Upcoming Events: More Than Red Vs. Blue: Stories, Struggles, and Strengths in Rural America Rural America is often reduced to a political talking point — red states, blue states, culture wars.

Title: Sen. Mike Lee removes public lands provision from Trump's "big, beautiful bill"
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sen-mike-lee-removes-public-lands-provision-from-trumps-big-beautiful-bill/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T21:03:50Z
Full Content:
Watch CBS News June 30, 2025 / 5:03 PM EDT / CBS/AP Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah announced over the weekend he was removing a provision from the Senate's "big, beautiful bill" that would allow the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands for affordable housing and infrastructure. "Because of the strict constraints of the budget reconciliation process, I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families—not to China, not to BlackRock, and not to any foreign interests," Lee said in a statement announcing the withdrawal of the provision. After the Senate parliamentarian ruled that Lee's original proposal, which encompassed millions of acres, would violate budget reconciliation rules, he had reduced the acreage. The bill, which contains President Trump's tax cuts, border and defense initiatives, is being considered under the special rules because it requires only a simple majority to pass, rather than the 60-vote super majority that is required for consideration of most legislation in the Senate. Under Lee's plan, land in 11 Western states from Alaska to New Mexico would have been eligible for sale. Montana was carved out of the proposal after its lawmakers objected. In states like Utah and Nevada, the government controls the vast majority of lands, protecting them from potential exploitation but hindering growth. Lee's revised plan would have excluded all U.S. Forest Service land from possible sale. Sales of sites controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management were to be significantly reduced, Lee said, so that only land within 5 miles of population centers could be sold. But in addition to opposition from Democrats, Republican senators in Idaho and Montana objected to the plan, too. Several House Republicans also said that if the provision were included in the Senate bill, they would vote against it when the bill received a vote in the lower chamber, threatening its passage. Lee said in his statement that he still believes the federal government "owns far too much land—land it is mismanaging and in many cases ruining for the next generation" and he complained that under Democratic presidents, "massive swaths of the West are being locked away from the people who live there, with no meaningful recourse." The House originally had a public land sales provision, too, one which would have allowed sales of acreage in Utah and Nevada. But GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, who served as interior secretary during President Trump's first administration, opposed the idea immediately. "I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands," Zinke said in a statement in May. "Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn't creating more land." Several other Western state Republican House members also rejected the idea, so the provision was stripped out of the budget bill before the House voted on it. Housing advocates have cautioned that federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing. Some of the parcels up for sale in Utah and Nevada under the House proposal were many miles from developed areas. New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, said before Lee withdrew his plan that it would exclude Americans from places where they fish, hunt and camp. "I don't think it's clear that we would even get substantial housing as a result of this," Heinrich said earlier this month. "What I know would happen is people would lose access to places they know and care about and that drive our Western economies." © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Private Lenders Pitch Restructuring for Stressed Pallet Company
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/private-lenders-pitch-restructuring-for-stressed-pallet-company-11751317379486.html
Time Published: 2025-06-30T21:02:59Z

(Bloomberg) -- Private lenders have proposed a potential debt restructuring for 48Forty Solutions, less than a year after Summit Partners acquired a majority stake in the pallet management company, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The company’s debt includes around $1.75 billion of private credit, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The lenders, which include Antares Capital, KKR & Co. and BlackRock Inc. provided the financing in a recapitalization deal in October, the people said. Representatives for Antares, KKR and BlackRock declined to comment, while representatives for 48Forty and Summit didn’t respond to requests for comment. The $1.7 trillion private credit industry has started to see more signs of stress, as companies grapple with persistently high interest rates and a weakening consumer. Investors are eyeing how the asset class would handle a potential downturn, as the market has not yet been tested by one after growing rapidly in recent years. FS KKR Capital Corp., a business development company jointly managed by KKR and FS Investments, marked down the value of the 48Forty loan to 76 cents on the dollar in the first quarter, according to a May regulatory filing. On a call discussing first-quarter earnings, Daniel Pietrzak, the chief investment officer of the BDC, said 48Forty had been affected by “labor costs and excess inventory.” 48Forty has also suffered from a pullback in consumer spending, the people said. 48Forty provides recycled wood pallets and pallet management services across the US and Canada. As of March 31, the company was paying the majority of the interest on its debt, priced at 6 percentage points over the base rate, in kind, according to regulatory filings. Payment-in-kind deals allow borrowers to defer making cash interest payments typically until maturity. The October recapitalization deal also saw Summit Partners, which first invested in the company in 2022, take a majority stake in 48Forty. If the restructuring happens, 48Forty would join a growing list of companies that have restructured their private credit loans over the past year, with others including Alacrity Solutions, Zips Car Wash and Pluralsight Inc. The default rate for US private credit ticked up slightly in May to reach 4.6%, according to a Fitch Ratings report. Fitch cited “weakening North American corporate credit environment and ongoing macroeconomic challenges such as higher interest rates and slowing growth” as a cause of the increase.

Title: Circle applies for national trust bank license to expand USDC reserve custody
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/circle-trust-bank-license-tokenized/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T20:37:26Z
Full Content:
Share this article The company’s move follows its June 5 IPO, which gave Circle an initial market cap of around $6 billion. With its stock now trading at $181, the company is currently valued at approximately $44 billion. The proposed entity, First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., would enable Circle to directly custody USDC reserves and provide digital asset custody services to institutional clients, though it would not handle cash deposits or lending. “Establishing a national digital currency trust bank of this kind marks a significant milestone in our goal to build an internet financial system that is transparent, efficient and accessible,” Circle Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO Jeremy Allaire said in a press release. BlackRock and BNY Mellon currently manage and custody Circle’s USDC reserves. While the new trust bank would take over reserve management, Circle intends to maintain relationships with major banks for portions of its holdings. Allaire indicated the bank would concentrate on tokenized stocks and bonds rather than digital assets like Bitcoin or Ether. The expansion comes as lawmakers advance legislation regulating stablecoins. The bill, which passed the Senate and is expected to clear the House this summer, would require stablecoins to maintain liquid asset backing and provide monthly reserve disclosures. President Trump is anticipated to sign the measure into law. Several brokerages initiated coverage of Circle stock this week, with Barclays, Bernstein, and Canaccord issuing bullish ratings and price targets above $200. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs expressed concerns about the company’s valuation following its post-IPO stock price doubling. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Business FILE PHOTO: Circle logo is seen in this illustration taken March 31, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Stablecoin firm Circle is applying to create a national trust bank in the U.S., a major move after its blockbuster IPO valued the company at nearly $18 billion earlier this month. If the charter is granted by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, it would enable Circle to act as a custodian for its own reserves and hold crypto assets on behalf of institutional clients. Unlike traditional banks, the license would not allow Circle to take cash deposits or make loans. "Circle has long sought to seek the highest standards of trust, transparency, governance, compliance," CEO Jeremy Allaire told Reuters in an interview. "Becoming a publicly traded company is a significant part of that, becoming a national trust company is again a continuation of that." Circle's national trust bank entity would be called First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading Crypto platform Anchorage Digital is currently the only digital asset company with a national trust bank charter.Circle issues the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC. Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value, usually a 1:1 dollar peg, are commonly used by crypto traders to move funds between tokens. Their use has grown rapidly in recent years, and proponents say that they could be used to send payments instantly.Stablecoins are backed by assets such as U.S. dollars and short-term Treasury bills in order to maintain their peg to the dollar. Currently, Circle's reserves - short-dated U.S. Treasury bills, overnight U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements and cash - are held in custody at BNY and managed by BlackRock. The new entity would manage Circle’s USDC reserves, although some reserves will continue to be held at major banks, Allaire said. The license would also allow Circle to provide custody services for digital assets on behalf of institutional customers. However, Allaire said it will focus on providing custody for assets like stocks and bonds that are represented via a token on a blockchain network, over traditional cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.GOING MAINSTREAMThe move from Circle comes as Congress gets closer to passing a bill to create a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. If signed into law, the bill would require tokens to be backed by liquid assets and for issuers to publicly disclose the composition of their reserves on a monthly basis.The Senate passed the bill earlier this month, and the House of Representatives is poised to pass the legislation early this summer. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill into law. He has sought to overhaul cryptocurrency regulation after courting cash from the industry during his presidential campaign. Once signed into law, the bill could pave the way for more traditional financial institutions and retailers to incorporate stablecoins into their businesses, experts and analysts say. Circle is preparing for that eventuality, Allaire said. "We're going from the early-adopter phase of this technology into the mainstream," said Allaire. "As a public company, and now, hopefully if we are successful in getting approval from the OCC as a national trust, that will give us a foundation that the world's leading institutions are going to be comfortable building on."Wall Street brokerages began coverage of Circle on Monday with broadly bullish ratings, although some analysts voiced concerns about its elevated valuation given that the stock has more than doubled since its market debut. Barclays, Bernstein, Canaccord Genuity and Needham launched coverage with the equivalent of "buy" ratings and price targets above $200, while JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs had more bearish outlooks. Crypto platform Anchorage Digital is currently the only digital asset company with a national trust bank charter. Circle issues the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC. Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value, usually a 1:1 dollar peg, are commonly used by crypto traders to move funds between tokens. Their use has grown rapidly in recent years, and proponents say that they could be used to send payments instantly. Stablecoins are backed by assets such as U.S. dollars and short-term Treasury bills in order to maintain their peg to the dollar. Currently, Circle's reserves - short-dated U.S. Treasury bills, overnight U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements and cash - are held in custody at BNY and managed by BlackRock. The new entity would manage Circle’s USDC reserves, although some reserves will continue to be held at major banks, Allaire said. The license would also allow Circle to provide custody services for digital assets on behalf of institutional customers. However, Allaire said it will focus on providing custody for assets like stocks and bonds that are represented via a token on a blockchain network, over traditional cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether. GOING MAINSTREAM The move from Circle comes as Congress gets closer to passing a bill to create a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. If signed into law, the bill would require tokens to be backed by liquid assets and for issuers to publicly disclose the composition of their reserves on a monthly basis. The Senate passed the bill earlier this month, and the House of Representatives is poised to pass the legislation early this summer. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill into law. He has sought to overhaul cryptocurrency regulation after courting cash from the industry during his presidential campaign. Once signed into law, the bill could pave the way for more traditional financial institutions and retailers to incorporate stablecoins into their businesses, experts and analysts say. Circle is preparing for that eventuality, Allaire said. "We're going from the early-adopter phase of this technology into the mainstream," said Allaire. "As a public company, and now, hopefully if we are successful in getting approval from the OCC as a national trust, that will give us a foundation that the world's leading institutions are going to be comfortable building on."

Digital assets should be among the go-to assets in an investor's portfolio, alongside stocks and bonds, he said on CNBC’s Crypto World, reiterating his comments from earlier this month at a Texas conference for wealth management professionals. At one point, Edelman, who co-founded Edelman Financial Engines, a $293 billion asset manager, advocated for a “low single digits” allocations to crypto, but he’s been swayed recently by “dramatically improved regulatory clarity and institutional engagement in crypto.” For conservative portfolios, Edelman recommended that at least 10% of assets be allocated to crypto, with a 25% allocation for moderate portfolios, and 40% for aggressive investors. Edelman, who is also founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, a trade group, cited advancements in technology leading to longer human lives as part of this basis for his recommendation, saying the average investor that’s alive today will live to be 100 years or older, requiring “portfolios to last far longer than most investors anticipate.” In addition, Edelman said that the “continued growth of blockchain technology will propel its levels five or 10 times its current size by 2030.” Whether an investor should only invest in Bitcoin, as opposed to other digital assets as well, should be between them and their advisor, Edelman told Decrypt on Monday. There could be other ways to get exposure to the digital assets industry, too, he added, pointing to stablecoin issuers, custodians, chipmakers, and exchanges. “There is now a very healthy and diverse infrastructure that represents blockchain and digital assets, and some argue that only owning Bitcoin deprives you of engagement in that broader community,” he said. As cryptocurrencies see continued adoption on Wall Street through products like exchange-traded funds, Edelman believes that Bitcoin will be worth $19 trillion by 2030. Today, the leading cryptocurrency is worth $2.1 trillion, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. With U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration reversing Biden-era restrictions on banks’ ability to offer services related to digital assets, the stage has been set “for massive engagement by the banking community,” Edelman added. Although most financial advisors increase investors’ allocation to bonds as they age, Edelman said that professionals should allocate no more than 30% of funds to U.S. debt. In some cases, it makes sense to allocate 100% of a portfolio to stocks and crypto, he said. Even a 90-year-old investor should have some exposure to digital assets, Edelman told Decrypt, saying their decision boils down to risk tolerance, as opposed to their age. The rationale, he said, could be that they’re investing with future generations in mind. “If you're in your 90s, you know that you're not going to spend all of your money. You're going to leave it to your children and grandchildren,” he said. “That means the money is not really yours. You're merely the steward of that money for the benefit of your heirs.” It was reasonable to wonder whether crypto would survive the regulatory headwinds that it faced not long ago, or whether the tech would be adopted by banks, Edelman noted. However, those questions have been settled, setting crypto up for a long-term future, he said. On Monday, Edelman’s recommendation turned heads within the cryptosphere. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on X, formerly Twitter, that Edelman’s remarks could be “the most important full throated endorsement of crypto from [the] TradFi world since Larry Fink.” The BlackRock CEO emerged as a Bitcoin backer last year after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. but touted tokenization’s prospects in 2022. More recently, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, has put his long-run skepticism aside. In May, he said that the bank’s customers would soon allow clients to purchase Bitcoin.

Title: GoFundMe is refurbishing a little-known financial tool in a bid to supercharge everyday giving
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/06/30/gofundme-giving-funds/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T17:30:55Z

By JAMES POLLARD, Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) — GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall. Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived. “It was just a bit of a thing,” he added. “If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.” Giving Funds are GoFundMe’s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company’s DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers — products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts. To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur’s circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site. “We’re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they’re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they’re coming in and they’re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,” Cadogan said. “That connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.” Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit. The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals. There’s since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements. GoFundMe’s Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company’s standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors. Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving — something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn’t occurred because DAFs have been framed as “wealth management products.” “This is a giving product,” Cadogan said. “It’s something for everybody. And you don’t need to know the words ‘donor advised fund.’ It doesn’t show up.” DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes — even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023. Cadogan believes GoFundMe’s culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends’ charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas. That “dynamic, alive community” is very different from the “fairly static, passive” financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan. “It’s essentially inspiring the money to move,” he said. Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning. Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative’s recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the “sweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.” The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it’s a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are “available-to-everyone vehicles” considering that half run balances under $50,000. “Givers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,” Williams said. “Anything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.” But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe’s entrance as “a game changer” that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years. Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a “savings account” for “good works.” “And GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,” she said.

Title: A public lands sell-off is struck from the GOP policy bill
URL: https://www.denverpost.com/2025/06/30/public-lands-sell-off-gop-policy-bill/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T17:21:44Z

By Maxine Joselow, The New York Times WASHINGTON — Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said late Saturday that he had dropped his contentious plan to sell millions of acres of public lands from the sweeping domestic policy package that the Senate will soon begin debating. Lee made the nighttime announcement on social media after it became clear that the plan faced insurmountable opposition from within his own party. At least four Republican senators from Western states had said they planned to vote for an amendment to strike the proposal from the bill. The plan had also triggered intense pushback from conservative hunters and outdoorsmen across the American West, who had warned that it threatened the lands where they hunted and fished. “Over the past several weeks, I’ve spent a lot of time listening to members of the community, local leaders and stakeholders across the country,” Lee wrote on the social platform X on Saturday. “While there has been a tremendous amount of misinformation — and in some cases, outright lies — about my bill, many people brought forward sincere concerns.” The provision would have required the Bureau of Land Management to sell as much as 1.225 million acres of public property in 11 Western states. Proponents had argued that the region has a severe shortage of affordable housing and that developers could build new homes on these tracts. In his post, Lee said that, because of the strict rules governing the budgetary process that Republicans are using to pass the bill, he was “unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families — not to China, not to BlackRock, and not to any foreign interests.” It was not immediately clear whether the budgetary process would have allowed Lee to prohibit certain businesses or foreign countries from purchasing land. The process, known as reconciliation, allows bills that affect government revenues to pass the Senate on a simple majority vote, avoiding a filibuster. A spokesperson for Lee did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The four Republicans who opposed the plan were Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy of Montana and Jim Risch and Mike Crapo of Idaho. While opponents acknowledged the housing shortage as a serious problem, they rejected a public lands sell-off as a solution. “One of the greatest gifts we’ve ever had in America is the public lands that have been passed down generation to generation,” Sheehy said in an interview Saturday before the proposal was struck from the package. “Especially for us in Western states, it’s our way of life for hunting and fishing,” he continued. “I believe Mike Lee knows that, too, and I don’t believe he’s acting in bad faith at all.” A previous version of Lee’s plan had called for the BLM and the U.S. Forest Service to sell between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres of public lands. But the provision was stripped from the bill by the Senate’s parliamentarian, the nonpartisan official who enforces the chamber’s rules. The latest version of the plan would have allowed individuals and companies to buy up to 2 square miles of land at a time, with no limit on how much property they could ultimately purchase. Only land within 5 miles of a population center would have been eligible to be sold. In addition to the four Republican senators who opposed the plan, five House Republicans said Thursday that the land sell-off was a “poison pill” that would cost their votes for the package. The opponents in the House included Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who led the Interior Department during Trump’s first term. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son and an avid hunter and outdoorsman, had been publicly silent on Lee’s plan while it was under consideration. But Sunday morning, he wrote on X that the proposal’s withdrawal was a “huge win for our public lands!” Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., celebrated the plan’s demise while warning other lawmakers not to attempt to resurrect it. “To those already plotting to go after our public lands another way: Don’t. Unless you like losing,” Heinrich said in a statement Saturday. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Title: June 2025 in Review

The Site How about now? Is the site loading performance any better now? I opened up a post about the site’s performance on the WP.com support forum and got a response from the team the next day that was basically, “Works on my machine, get lost,” which is honestly the level of support I have come to expect from WP.com over the years. They are absolutely in a mode to deflect all possible complaints on the first try. Still, I was disappointed. I thought I had them because their own speed test tool, which runs on their servers and not my local machine, was reporting problems. But if you run the test enough times eventually you will hit a good patch and it will work. (I finally got it to run, but its results include AI recommendations that were ludicrously wrong. Badly trained AI is worse than no AI.) So I started building up evidence to support a ticket, because I wasn’t giving up and when profiling the site loading it was always the initial response from the server that was the long pole. That is WP.com being bad, that long line I took measurements at different times of day over a few days and I was seeing time between 653ms (acceptable) and 22.4 seconds (WTF?) always backed up at the waiting for response marker. Every time. And then it stopped happening for a while. For about a week the biggest slow down on the profiles was loading the header image… which are not large images at all. So I suspect the JavaScript which does the random header selection is causing that issue, something they absolutely won’t fix because they don’t support their old themes and, as far as I can tell, none of their new themes support such a feature. That points, once again, to a need to change themes to something currently supported, work I am not thrilled to start. I went with a hosted plan rather than hosting the blog myself because I wanted to avoid all this sort of thing. But WP.com cares not for its customers. Then the delays started up again. Same routine. The problem is that “waiting for response” category is a bucket that could be covering for any number of things. It might just be their server being bad. But it could be something else. So I started down the final list of items I had yet to change, landing on the Blog Roll 8.0 sidebar RSS widget. That particular Rube Goldberg setup started as 3.0 back in 2014 as my second attempt to replace Google Reader as the RSS source. (Again, screw Google for killing that app.) I’ve had to patch it and rework it multiple times over the years, and it still had problems. Pinboard, which creates the RSS feed, has always been balky and goes through periods of unreliability, but WP.com used to load that widget after the first screen load. It seems that WP.com made a change and it looks like they won’t load the site unless all widgets have loaded or timed out. So when Pinboard chokes, the site is slow. Very slow. Or that was my theory. To fix that I am on to a new version of the blog roll, using Inoreader, a Feedly competitor, which does the Google Reader thing and lets you get an RSS feed out of a category group. It doesn’t let me format the output the way my Feedly to IFTTT to Pinboard route did, but it does seem more responsive. So I ask again, is the site loading any better now? Or do I need a new theory of the case? Also, a last minute gripe… I turned ads back on again and WP.com broke something because it shouldn’t be showing ads to people logged into WP.com… but the site was showing outlines of where ads should be… which was just as bad as having ads there, but zero revenue. So I turned them off again. Did you see any of that last week? Dammit WP.com, can you just stop screwing things up already? One Year Ago Playable Worlds announced Stars Reach. We also got a launch date for The War Within. The Janthir Wilds expansion for Guild Wars 2 was announced, promising player housing. In a Friday Bullet Points post I summed up the hot summer happenings including the Equinox expansion for EVE Online, the beta for The War Within, Valheim on MacOS, Pax Dei early access, the Tarisland launch, the coming Steam Summer Sale, and the imminent demise of ICQ. That was followed up by another Friday Bullet Points post where I covered Tarisland launching, the Valheim board game, the Throne & Liberty launch date, and the latest Hearthstone expansion that had something to do with ketchup packets. Then I tried Tarisland and said I hated it… mostly due to its control scheme. This upset a few people, so I gave it a try on the iPad. The Anashti Sul special server opened up in EverQuest II. I created some memes about various CCP projects… which were honestly not as harsh as I billed them. I say that because we got the Equinox expansion which was a whole lot of stuff that wasn’t really done yet… and wouldn’t be done for months. At least we got login rewards again and I made a lime green ship SKIN with SKINR. The May MER didn’t look bad, but would the expansion bump up activity? There was also the road to Alliance Tournament XX to consider. Also, the EVE Online app ecosystem seemed to be in decay. However, we did have Ser Fukalite’s ship spinning medal to celebrate. In WoW Classic it was Cataclysm time, and I was in the fragile submarine quest in Vash’jir. Then it was off to Mount Hyjal, and after that Deepholm. The group was doing its first run at Blackrock Caverns Civilization VII was announced. I was still poking around in Valheim looking for The Queen. I eventually found her after a long voyage and slew her… though I had set the server for easy mode at that point. That unlocked my journey to the Ashlands. In my ongoing telephone tales series I wrote about the great failure of VXML, the ascent of enterprise VoIP, Noted imbecile Lars Wingefors declared you couldn’t raise prices on video games. Amazon Games announced an update to New World by trying to make it sound like a brand new console title as they tried to pretend the PC game didn’t exist. I was leafing through the state of the Twitter alternatives. Over on X Elon decided to hide the ability to see who clicked on the like button so his white nationalist fan boys would stopped getting called out for being literal nazis. I was also vanity searching on AI to see if it knew anything about me. There was also a brief mention at the end of the month in review post of something called Fantasy Critic. Did that ever become something? And, as mentioned at the top of this section, there was a Steam Summer Sale. Five Years Ago Our daughter graduated from high school. It was a pandemic graduation, but we made do. My poll about voice chat indicated that Discord now rules that roost. Pokemon Go gave us remote raid passes since we all had to stay home. I was giving Minecraft Dungeons a try. I finished the main story fairly quickly and found the game to be light and fun, but not very deep or replayable. Other reviews were even less charitable. Daybreak was still having problems with their Aradune progression server. We were getting down to the final days of the Battle for Azeroth expansion in World of Warcraft and I was wondering how it would rank in the pantheon of expansions and how much the previous expansion plays into how people feel about the current or next expansion. WoW Classic was still going strong enough that Blizz had to turn layering back on for several realms. There was also the Summer Bowl and the campaign against bots. The instance group was still working on Zul’Farrak, failing the stairs when Sergeant Bly and his crew died. Then, the next time, Bly and his crew survived, but disappeared as we looted the field. My hunter became my first character to hit level 50 in WoW Classic. In EVE Online I was reminding people about why CCP gave Upwell structures asset safety… because they took it away with the Forsaken Fortress update. Another case of people foolishly believing in company promises. So we went out and shot our own abandoned state structures in Delve just to keep other groups from coming along and doing it. Meanwhile, the CCP mineral starvation plan was driving mineral prices to an all time high. (Which would seem comically low a year, two years, and even five years later.) We did, however, get new ships for the EDENCOM faction as part of the Triglavian invasion event as well as a Project Discovery update that moved its focus onto the coronavirus. And we got character log off! People had only been asking for that since forever. The CSM15 elections kicked off, with the results being announced by mid-month. Also a little something about how opaque the game UI can be. Actually in space the GEF was still up north fighting over various objectives. But that all came to a screeching halt when we we found out that most of null sec was planning to gang up against us and invade. They denied it, but then the evidence was found. Our deployment up north ended and we began consolidating the empire into our core space, pulling down the last Keepstar in Cloud Ring before the month was out. World War Bee was coming. We were playing some Minecraft and seeing how villages had changed. I was getting promotions for an Atari branded online casino complete with its own crypto-currency. I guess, as a brand, Atari still has some value. Ten Years Ago There was a cheer for the NBI class of 2015. I was wondering what Turbine would do after they cancelled Infinite Crisis. I was also looking for a summer game to play. After waffling before a live audience, Blizzard finally caved and said there would be flying in Draenor. Remember that time we killed a Mordus Angels Revenant? It seems like everybody has killed one by now. Also in EVE Online we got the Carnyx expansion, which had some of the initial Fozzie Sov features. So we were out sov-wanding station services, though Dominion sov quirks still ruled the day in our fight at ED-9LT. We then headed back north thinking maybe our friends in Querious would come visit us some day… *cough* The coming of Fozzie Sov also meant further consolidation of holdings to make sure we could defend our space. TNT got pushed out to Tribute to share space with the Circle of Two. Tensions between the two alliances started almost right away. And then there was Burn Amarr. I took some screen shots. And I splurged on ship skins. Over at Daybreak they were talking about special servers for EverQuest II at last. It looked like we might get some sort of progression server, for which there was a poll. And then another poll, looking for a name. Meanwhile, over in EverQuest, they were still working on how to deal with raiding on the Ragefire server, and the Ruins of Kunark unlock vote was upon us. I was playing Neko Atsume on the iPad… back when it was only in Japanese! I was also going on about 64-bit OS requirements finally coming to video games and an old grievance of mine. My daughter suddenly wanted to play The Sims. That lasted for about three days. This is why I make her wait a week on any sudden new fad she want to follow. The Steam Summer sale came and went and I bought nothing. That turned out to be the last sale with the traditional daily specials format. I brought up the F2P business model yet again based on a quote over at Massively OP which, if nothing else, got a long comment from Brad McQuaid on the subject. And, finally, I played Minecraft with my daughter for Father’s Day, which led to a whole new adventure in gaming. Fifteen Years Ago Warhammer Online, whose game tips I previously mocked, was out soliciting user written game tips with the most boring video game related video ever. Really, I was embarrassed for them. Meanwhile, there were comical tips to be found in another game. CCP was telling people that the steep learning curve in EVE Online was just part of the game, and Hulkageddon III was on the way. FrontierVille came along, evoking the whole Oregon Trail thing… for which they recently were sued. And a good thing to, as they are a bunch of lying bastards there at Zynga. They never sent me my FarmVille magnet. There was the big news from Turbine with Lord of the Rings Online going Free to Play. I wondered is Lifetime Subscribers like myself would get the shaft in this transition. But Turbine made me a perm VIP instead and put out one of those charts that seems to accompany these multi-level subscription scams structures. But I was winning LOTRO lotteries, so I was happy for the moment. In Pokemon SoulSilver I had beat all the gym leaders, but we were having Pokewalker problems. Then there was Blizzard. Where to start? They were selling WoW Gold straight from the main page. Really. It just isn’t what you think. They screwed up the parental controls interface… in my opinion… along with compromising the security of it. The whole RealID thing was just getting warmed up. One of the accounts in our guild was compromised and the guild bank was looted. That had happened so many times to so many people that wasn’t even news any more. And during all this, the instance group was working its way through The Burning Crusade content with our Horde alts, but we weren’t really feeling it. Ennui had set in and our only hope was Cataclysm. And there were plenty of offers to get us into the beta. Twenty Years Ago In EverQuest II we got the Splitpaw Saga adventure pack. Those of us with Station Access got it as part of the package, while those without had to pay… ten bucks I think. I actually ended up playing through that quite a bit. As early experiment with content that scaled with your levels, it was good from level 20 to level 50. Unfortunately, it never progressed and now every time I end up in the Thundering Steppes with my newer characters the intro quest pops up. Twenty-Five Years Ago Diablo II launched. It enlarged on its predecessor with more classes and a four act storyline that played out over different environments. A pre-digital distribution title, it was awarded a Guinness Book record as the fastest selling video game ever, having shipped and sold one million boxes over the course of the first month. For comparison its 2012 successor, Diablo III, sold 3.5 million copies in the first 24 hours, also setting a Guinness Book record. Shogun: Total War launched, setting down a template that would become the Total War series that is still getting new titles. Microsoft acquired Bungie… and then later spun them off. Then some years later Sony acquired them. Sony’s SOE acquired Verant Interactive, something that simplified the “who is running EverQuest?” question which, at launch, was possibly some sub-group within Sony, 989 Studios, or Verant, a situation reflected in gaming press coverage of the time, where various companies were named, often in the same article. It was all SOE after that… until Daybreak then EG7.

We haven’t played since early November. Meanwhile, some travel meant I only played Pokemon Go for the last few days of the month. It is the only game I play on my phone. (Balatro is iPad only for me, though you can play it on the iPhone. I just need my glasses to do so.) Enshrouded I meant all month to write something about Enshrouded… but never quite got to it. Part of that is because we’re moving forward a bit slowly and because we’re covering some of the same ground about which I have already written. But the latest big update has changed the game enough that I want to cover how much it has changed. I’ll get there. But we are playing it regularly. EVE Online What happens when you have a war and the other side declines to show up? More move ops! I spent quite a bit of time in the game, but not very much of it in combat. I mean, I got on my share of kill mails… but at last check I went on 17 fleets, most of which were moving things, scooping things, or covering people moving and scooping things. War is logistics I guess. Lord of the Rings Online Onward to Mordor! I left off at the very gates of the black land. Soon I will be there. (Well, I have already been at this point, but that post has gone line. Soon!) I played a lot of LOTRO in June, though not as much as May, largely due to increased activity in EVE Online and there being only so many hours in the day. Still, I did log in daily and use up my blue bar and do my tasks. Pokemon Go Since hitting level 48 my main focus has been on completing the tasks required to unlock level 49. Specifically, the 35 platinum medals. I managed to get one more since I leveled up, but I still need 13 more. I am going to need a plan. Meanwhile, my play time was up because it was Pokemon Go fest and we were at the airport waiting for a delayed flight, so we spent quite a bit of time doing raids and tasks. Coming Up I will undoubtedly make it fully into Mordor in Lord of the Rings Online. That will be kind of a big deal for me. Expect a post or three. Meanwhile, WoW Classic might liven up a bit as we’re running down the clock to the long awaited arrival of the Mists of Pandaria expansion. We stopped playing WoW Classic on November 3, 2024, having grown tired of Cataclysm. Will pandas revive our spirits? Am I still subscribed? Find out in July! In New Eden I expect more move ops and such as the Imperium continues to slide east, nestling up against long time rival and foe PanFam. Could sparks fly? But we’ll also be into the Icelandic summer vacation season, so EVE Online might be otherwise quiet. We’ll also be half way through the year, so that will probably get at least one “the year so far…” sort of post out of me. Otherwise I guess it is just hot hobbit summer.

Bet that helps! LikeLiked by 1 person And as an additional data point, I just clicked on Tuesday’s FCL post and it took as long for the page to load as I’ve seen for a while.

Title: UK Government Pushes Green Finance as Banks Rethink Climate Goals

Both platforms cover financial and business news as well as sport and… More Info The City minister has reaffirmed the government’s ambition for a green transition across the financial services sector, despite the industry pivoting on climate priorities. Speaking at City Week on Monday, Emma Reynolds said: “The UK has a world leading financial and related professional services ecosystem and the research that is needed to integrate sustainable finance.” Reynolds said the Treasury’s upcoming Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy – a key pillar in the government’s economic agenda – will help foster the UK’s push to “transition finance” through honing in on skills as one of five key areas. But this comes amid a widespread retreat from the financial services sector. The banking industry has been at the forefront of a green row back, with Barclays and Natwest dropping climate targets from their annual bonus schemes for senior executives. Meanwhile, Europe’s biggest lender HSBC slapped a 20-year delay on its net zero target. Energy secretary Ed Miliband has touted plans to “transform” the UK’s financial services sector “into a global hub for green investment”. Whilst London is a leader in the area, City AM reported earlier this year green finance ratings across financial sectors were dramatically reducing. Despite topping the 15th edition of Z/Yen Global Green Finance Index, London’s rating reduced 36 points to 598. The Treasury has said the financial services growth strategy, set to be published on July 15, will “shape the type of growth being pursued, and support net zero, regional growth, and economic security and resilience”. Reynolds, who is steering the Treasury’s plans, said the upcoming COP30 in Brazil will be crucial to green ambitions following last years agreement where governments pledged to scale up climate finance into developing countries to $1.3 trillion per year by 2035. “We think that in order to make this a success, the road map must ensure that it’s based on several principles. It must be inclusive, it must have stability, and it must have focus,” the City minister added. But top names across the sector have vocalised concerns efforts in green finance have stalled. Sandra Boss, the UK Chair at Blackrock, said during a at City Week panel whilst “the need” for investing in renewable energy was “undeniable,” the energy transition was progressing “slower than hoped”. The waning commitment to green finance is being witnessed on a global scale and many have pointed to President Donald Trump’s return to the White House as a key catalyst. One of Trump’s first executive orders following his inauguration in both 2017 and 2025 was to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. The document encourages global co-operation to limit the causes of global warming. The World Bank – an international development organisation owned by 187 countries – softened its climate approach after the US took a chainsaw to climate programs.

Title: ETF Expert Says Ripple Closing This Chapter Clears The Way For XRP ETF, BlackRock To Join The Race?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-move-strengthens-xrp-etf/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T15:30:19Z

Nate Geraci, the president of the ETF store, has weighed in on what Ripple’s decision to drop its cross appeal could mean for XRP ETFs. He also raised the possibility of BlackRock joining the ETF race now that the lawsuit is ending. In an X post, Nate Geraci stated that a closed chapter on the XRP lawsuit clears the way for a spot XRP ETF. His statement suggested that the SEC could now move to approve the applications for issuers to offer this fund. Geraci was reacting to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement of his firm’s decision to drop its cross-appeal against the SEC. Bitcoinist reported that Garlinghouse stated that Ripple is dropping its cross-appeal and that the SEC is expected to drop its appeal, which will put an end to the XRP lawsuit. He added that they are closing this chapter and focusing on building the Internet of Value. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart had earlier in the year mentioned how the lawsuit impacts an XRP ETF. In an X post, Seyffart opined back then that there is unlikely to be an XRP ETF until the whole XRP lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple is settled. He added that the Commission needed to “untangle that mess” before it possibly proceeds to approve these ETFs. Indeed, the SEC has, up till now, continued to delay its decision on these funds and has yet to provide comments. This is unlike the Solana ETFs, which the Commission had asked issuers to amend, as it prepares to approve these funds. However, once the SEC drops its appeal and formally ends the XRP lawsuit, this could change, with the Commission communicating with XRP ETF issuers on the next steps. Nate Geraci also stated that the end of the XRP lawsuit also clears the way for the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, to file to offer an XRP ETF. Despite already offering Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the asset manager has yet to file for other crypto ETFs, including one for XRP. This is unlike other Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers, such as Bitwise, which has filed to offer ETFs for XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, among others. However, as Geraci predicts, that could change soon enough, with BlackRock filing for an XRP ETF. The asset manager would be the eighth to do so if they file for this fund anytime soon. Bloomberg analysts Seyffart and Eric Blachunas predict a 95% chance that the SEC will approve these funds this year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.19, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.
