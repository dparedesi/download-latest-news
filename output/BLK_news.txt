Title: French wealth management fintech RockFi garners €18m funding

Time Published: 2025-03-25T09:41:39Z

RockFi, a fintech company specialising in private wealth management, has raised €18m ($19.45m) in a Series A funding round led by Partech. The round also saw participation from existing investor Varsity and business angels, including Aurthur Waller and Félix Blosser, co-founders of Pennylane, and Mark Ransford, former managing director of Apax UK. With this fresh capital, RockFi aims to fast-track its expansion and reach its target of managing €1bn in assets by the close of 2026. The company secured fresh funding less than a year after raising €3m in its initial fundraising round. Based in France, the fintech was established in 2023 by Pierre Marin, Marie Bedu, and Maxime Durand—alongside former private banking executives such as Stéphane Carles (formerly of SG Private Banking) and Vincent Pagny (formerly of HSBC Gestion Privée). RockFi aims to transform private wealth management with its technology-driven platform and network of independent private bankers. The company serves a diverse clientele of entrepreneurs, senior executives, “top” athletes, and artists, offering a blend of human expertise and digital solutions for wealth management. Marin, who is also the CEO, said: “We want to breathe new life into private wealth management, to the careers of those who shape it and the assets of their clients. “This financing will enable us to scale up to serve our customers even better, in France and – eventually – across Europe, with the ambition of rapidly establishing ourselves among the leaders of next-generation wealth management.” RockFi said its family office approach provides clients with dedicated private advisors who craft comprehensive investment strategies covering financial investments, taxation, and estate planning. The platform offers 3,000 financial instruments across various asset classes, with an emphasis on private equity through partnerships with firms such as Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs. The fintech’s proprietary technology platform is said to enable clients to access “real-time” asset tracking and analytics. Less than a year after launching its commercial offering, RockFi claims to have attracted 500 clients, achieving a monthly business growth of over 25%. The company has expanded its workforce to 50 employees, including 25 private bankers, across six offices in France. Over the next year, RockFi plans to recruit 50 additional private bankers and open one new office per month in cities such as Nice, Cannes, Toulouse, Rennes, and Strasbourg. The company also plans to double its team of 12 engineers to enhance its monitoring and reporting capabilities. As part of the funding, Philippe Collombel, co-founder and general partner at Partech, is joining the board of directors. Collombel added: “We are delighted to support RockFi in this new phase of its growth. Its model – combining a technological platform with human expertise – addresses a strong demand in the wealth management sector. “The traction gained in just a few months shows RockFi’s potential to become a key player in an industry that is about to transform.”

Title: Canada's Conservative Party Promises to Cut Mass Economic Migration
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/03/25/canadas-conservative-party-promises-to-cut-mass-economic-migration/
Time Published: 2025-03-25T09:12:16Z
Full Content:
Canada’s conservative leader wants to win the nation’s April 28 national elections and is hammering Justin Trudeau’s replacement for supporting the massive legal immigration that has caused massive pocketbook damage to ordinary Canadians. The Conservative Party candidate is Pierre Poilievre. He is campaigning against Mark Carney, an international banker and Goldman Sachs executive who replaced the disgraced Justin Trudeau as head of Canada’s Liberal Party. The two parties are close in the polls as Poilievre slams Carney for supporting Trudeau’s very unpopular immigration policy. In 2015, the investor-led Century Initiative persuaded Trudeau to grow the economy by inflating the nation’s population from 36 million to 100 million by 2100. Since then, Trudeau has imported four million migrants — or 10 percent of the nation’s population, which is the equivalent of 33 million migrants in the United States. That huge population of legal migrants — which includes many Indians and migrants who are too old to work — inflicted an economic shock and massive economic damage to 30 million ordinary Canadians. It cut wages, exacerbated healthcare shortages, and spiked housing costs. It dropped workplace productivity and reduced corporate research. It also imported criminals, unexpected sanitary habits, unfamiliar foreign conflicts, and strange ethnic resentments. But the pocketbook and civic damage also wrecked Trudeau’s political career. So the party replaced Trudeau with Carney the international banker, who is now promising to continue the nation-wrecking immigration policy. However, Canada’s major investors and older citizens gained enormously. Trudeau’s mass migration inflated the stock market by 40 percent with a flood of consumers, renters, and low-wage workers. In the run-up to the April 28 national election, Poilievre is wrapping the Century Initiative around Carney’s political neck. On Monday, he told a student journalist: I will stop the insanity. I’m against of the Century Initiative. I voted against the Century Initiative in the House of Commons when it came up. It’s a radical, crazy idea meant for multinational corporate elites to bring in people from poor countries in large numbers, to take away Canadian jobs, drive wages down and profits up. Poilievre also promised lower migration: I want people to come here to numbers that can actually be housed, employed, and cared for — like we used to have. We used to have a great system. You know, people from around the world came here with nothing but a dream and a suitcase, and it worked. But in the last 10 years of the liberals, it’s got totally out of control. They’re growing the population by 1.2 million people a year and we’re only building 200,000 homes [a year], so our population is growing three times faster than our housing stock … I’m going to slow immigration down, and I have a very simple mathematical formula. The numbers we will let in this year will have to be lower than the number of homes we built in the previous year. So we’re always going to be adding homes faster than we add people. That focus on migration’s economic damage is more aggressive than Trump’s 2024 focus on migrant crime. Poilievre is also spotlighting Carney’s pro-migration advisor, Mark Wiseman who founded the Century Initiative. “By bringing on Mr. Wiseman, it shows that Mark Carney supports the liberal Century Initiative to nearly triple our population to 100 million,” Poilievre said on March 21. Wiseman is a former investor for the Canadian government, then a top banker at BlackRock until he was forced out, and is now a top advisor to Carney. In 2020, Wiseman touted mass migration as a way to offset government deficits, preserve government welfare spending, and expand business: “We have to invest in this country [via mass migration] … In fact, I believe that the vast majority of growth that we’ve had in Canada since the Second World War has come from the fact that we have brought new Canadians into our economy … Those Canadians pay taxes, those Canadians start businesses, those Canadians are entrepreneurial, and those Canadians are consumers, the new Canadians … I would personally advocate increasing our current immigration levels to somewhere closer to 500,000 [a year] … Keep in mind, these are consumers, these are taxpayers. These are people who are going to help us grow. In May 2023, Wiseman retweeted an op-ed that urged more migration, saying “100 million Canadians by 2100 may not be federal policy, but it should be – even if it makes Quebec howl.” The article justified mass migration by saying: Larger populations mean lower fixed costs, per capita, and other economies of scale. At higher population density, transportation costs are lower. Larger economies typically generate more companies, meaning more competition for consumers. More startups and more innovators mean more chances of coming up with a “unicorn” product that conquers export markets. And so on. Wiseman’s policies were repeatedly praised by President Joe Biden’s pro-migration border czar, Alejandro Mayorkas. In September, the Cuban-border Mayorkas said: We look to the north, with Canada. Canada takes a look at its market needs, and it says, “You know what? We need 700,000 foreign workers to address our labor needs domestically.” And, so, they build a visa system for that year to address the current market condition. And they say, “We’re going to bring in a million people.” And it’s market sensitive. We [in the United States] are dealing with numerical caps on labor-driven visas that were set in 1996. It’s 2024. The world has changed. It is remarkable how there can be [elite] agreement that [the visas system] is broken and not have an agreement on a solution. The country is suffering as a result of it. Mayrokas and his pro-migration business allies imported at least 12 million legal, semi-legal, and illegal migrants, so helping cause the political defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democrats’ myriad interest groups. Since November, President Donald Trump’s Vice President, JD Vance, has repeatedly spotlighted the economic damage caused by mass migration. More Canadians are recognizing the damage. “Per capita output in 2022 was roughly the same as in 2017,” The Globe and Mail newspaper reported on March 23. “Benjamin Reitzes, a macro strategist at Bank of Montreal, recently noted that the average annual growth in real GDP over the past 10 years was 1.8 per cent, but only 0.6 per cent after adjustments were made for population gains.” Carney, however, is trying to dodge the damage caused by mass migration by touting support from movie actor Mike Myers, spotlighting President Trump’s tariff plans, offering a complex economic plan and a rival tax cut, and promising to deregulate the economy and help Canadians: But he is being forced to talk about immigration. On March 23, for example, he promised to raise immigration and lamented the pocketbook damage to migrants — not Canadians — when he was asked if he would lower or raise migration inflows. Carney answered: Yeah, this is an important question. So the way I would characterize the situation is that post-Covid, there was a surge in immigration, both in temporary foreign workers and in foreign students, as well as permanent immigration. [But] we have not lived up to the bargain with those [immigrant] people. There’s not adequate housing [for immigrants], not everyone who came here for an education could get an education they would expect. And a consequence of that and many other aspects, but a [political] consequence of that is new caps that have been put in place on much lower levels of immigration, including temporary foreign workers, including foreign students. Those caps, or something similar to those levels, in my judgment, need to remain in place until we’ve expanded housing, [until] we’ve reabsorbed the levels of immigration that have happened in our country. Meanwhile, Canadians continue to suffer from mass migration. This month, a Canadian woman bitterly complained that she has to wait 13 months to get an MRI for a suspected brain tumor: I need an MRI to see if I have a fucking brain tumor. And go ahead, cuess what [date] it is? Go ahead. Guess! It is in 2026. 2026! … Cool. Canada, where healthcare is free, but only If you can afford to wait.

BlackRock (BLK), the global asset manager behind the largest U.S. spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF), listed a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe on Tuesday, its first crypto ETP outside North America. The iShares Bitcoin ETP started trading on Xetra and Euronext in Paris under the ticker IB1T and on Euronext Amsterdam as BTCN, according listing details on iShares' website. The company's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is by far the largest of the 12 spot bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S., with net assets worth over $50 billion and cumulative net inflows of just under $40 billion, according to data tracked by SoSoValue. An equivalent product listed in Canada in January. Although the listing of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. at the start of 2024 was considered a watershed moment for the crypto industry, similar products have existed in Europe for several years as ETPs. Digital asset managers CoinShares and 21Shares have led the way, accounting for nine of the top 20 ETPs by assets between them, according to data tracked by ETFbook. CoinShares Physical Bitcoin ETP is the largest, with $1.3 billion under management and a 0.25% fee. Coinbase (COIN), which provides custody for IBIT, will do the same for the BlackRock's European product. The fee for the European ETP is temporarily reduced by 10 basis points to 0.15% until the end of 2025. BlackRock's ETP introduction was reported earlier by Bloomberg. UPDATE (March 25, 11:34 UTC): Adds trading started in first paragraph, Canada ETF in third, European industry in fourth.

Business FILE PHOTO: The BlackRock logo is pictured outside its headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., May 25, 2021. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo LONDON : BlackRock has launched its first bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe, in a bid to tap growing demand for cryptocurrency exposure in new markets after attracting more than $50 billion into similar products in the United States. The world's largest asset manager has launched its 'iShares Bitcoin ETP', according to a BlackRock product page online, which is domiciled in Switzerland and listed in Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. Reuters previously reported on the planned launch last month. BlackRock declined to comment. BlackRock was one of the first institutional investors to offer exchange-traded products in the U.S. to track the spot price of bitcoin after the Securities and Exchange Commission first approved them in January 2024. It has partnered with Coinbase as custodian and Bank of New York Mellon as administrator on the latest product, the page said.

Title: Fidelity, Schwab Won’t Let You Trade Money Market ETFs (That Aren’t Theirs)

Time Published: 2025-03-25T08:33:28Z

My Money Blog In case you aren’t aware that a huge profit source for every broker is your idle cash, Bloomberg reports that Fidelity and Schwab are blocking all new purchase trades of new money market ETFs (gift article) from Blackrock and Texas Capital. Here’s what Fidelity and Schwab say about it: A Schwab spokesperson said its decision is consistent with the firm’s “long-standing approach” of only making available Schwab affiliate money-market mutual funds, while a Fidelity spokesperson said this is an extension of the company’s policy to “generally restrict” third-party money-market mutual funds. The inflows to those new ETFs weren’t even that big, making this an interesting development: Yet, the move stands out because trading platforms like Schwab and Fidelity typically don’t restrict exchange-traded funds, even if those funds are in competition with existing in-house offerings. Indeed, I hope this doesn’t start a trend of more bans of competitor ETFs. Fidelity and Blackrock have worked very closely together in the past, so this is probably rather awkward. For now, I still own lots of shares of iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and probably soon Vanguard 0-3 Month Treasury Bill ETF (VBIL). Fidelity and Schwab haven’t banned those, yet. Of course, Vanguard continues to not play funny games with their money market sweep funds. C’mon Vanguard, time for your own money market ETF to create even more tension… I know that these brokers have to make their money somewhere, but they may have to become more transparent about it soon.

Title: BlackRock rolls out Bitcoin ETP in Europe after US ETF success, offers temporary fee cut

Share this article BlackRock, a leading global asset manager, has introduced a Bitcoin ETP in Europe, building on the success of its US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has amassed $50.6 billion in assets under management as of the latest data. According to a March 25 report from Bloomberg, the iShares Bitcoin ETP will trade on Xetra and Euronext Paris as IB1T and on Euronext Amsterdam as BTCN. The product features a temporary fee waiver of 10 basis points, bringing its expense ratio to 0.15% through the end of the year. The fund is BlackRock’s first crypto-linked ETP outside North America. BlackRock previously launched IBIT and iShares Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Canada. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of iShares Product for Europe and the Middle East, said that a mix of strong retail demand and growing interest from professional investors is driving real momentum. She added that BlackRock’s move into the European market both reflects this shift and helps push it forward. While Europe has long established a market for crypto ETPs, with over 160 products tracking various digital assets, its scale remains smaller than that of the US, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated in February. US spot ETFs, despite being only a year old, have captured approximately 91% of global market share, largely attributed to their competitive cost structures and high liquidity. The analyst suggested that if BlackRock could successfully replicate the US market’s dynamics, substantial market growth is plausible. However, he noted that risk tolerance among European investors is generally lower compared to their counterparts in the US and certain Asian regions. Europe barely on leaderboard of spot bitcoin ETFs by size.. US spot ETFs only year old and have 91%(!) share of world. We kick so much ass when it comes to cost and liquidity. If BlackRock brings even some of the US Terrordome over there, should see success, altho keep in mind… pic.twitter.com/fwFDE84rhS — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 5, 2025 Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: US Private Equity Is Making Interesting Moves in the Indo-Pacific
URL: https://thediplomat.com/2025/03/us-private-equity-is-making-interesting-moves-in-the-indo-pacific/
Time Published: 2025-03-25T08:00:00Z
Full Content:
Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Have recent acquisitions by major U.S. firms been made on the basis of commercial considerations, or is there a geopolitical motive at play? The check-in hall at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I recently wrote about the de-listing of Malaysia Airports from the Malaysian stock exchange. It was taken over by a consortium of investors led by two government-linked investment vehicles: sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional and employee savings fund EPF. One of the other big partners is an investment fund called Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). GIP is an American investment fund that specializes in infrastructure. As of 2024, it had around $100 billion in assets under management across a range of industries including energy, digital infrastructure, logistics, and transportation. Its portfolio was mainly concentrated in Europe and America. There have been some big developments over the last year. At the end of 2024, American private equity giant BlackRock completed a $12.5 billion acquisition of GIP. Combined with BlackRock’s existing infrastructure portfolio, the deal brings their total infrastructure assets under management to more than $150 billion. We’ve also seen that since the deal was announced, GIP has made some interesting shifts in its investment strategy. First, in March 2024, GIP announced it had raised over $2 billion with an inaugural emerging markets fund. The purpose of this fund is to invest in 11 markets in Asia and Latin America that display “favorable demographic, economic, and regulatory conditions coupled with a rapidly growing demand for private infrastructure investments.” The press release does not specify what the 11 countries are. We can make some educated guesses though. In June 2024, GIP announced that they would be joining a coalition focused on increasing investment (potentially as much as $25 billion over several years) into emerging markets that are members of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. This includes India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. GIP is being joined in this effort by other private equity heavy hitters like KKR, as well as big sovereign wealth funds from the region like Temasek and GIC. I don’t usually pay attention to press releases like this, because they tend to be drafted in such a vague way as to be meaningless. But GIP has wasted no time putting their money where their mouth is, pushing through the privatization of Malaysia Airports in partnership with Khazanah and EPF and in the process becoming a major shareholder in Malaysia’s entire national airport network. The deal was valued at around $4 billion. The pivot to Indo-Pacific infrastructure took an even bigger turn when it was announced in the last few days that a consortium including GIP and BlackRock were acquiring Hong Kong-based port operator Hutchinson Port Holdings for almost $23 billion. If not blocked by regulators, this deal will see the BlackRock-led group acquire total or partial ownership of 43 ports in 23 countries including Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea, as well as along the Panama Canal. Hutchinson operates ports in China and Hong Kong which will not be part of the deal. It’s difficult not to interpret this blockbuster deal through a geopolitical lens. It’s clear at this point that China has been quicker on the draw than the United States in investing in critical infrastructure in regions like Southeast Asia. They’ve built or are building high-speed rail projects in Thailand and Indonesia, and have been willing to integrate countries in the region into clean energy value chains, investing in local production of things like batteries, EVs, solar panels and nickel. By comparison, American companies like Tesla have been slow to enter the Southeast Asian market and there’s been little indication Elon Musk wants to set up any significant manufacturing in the region. Meanwhile, Apple had to be browbeaten into making a modest amount of investment in exchange for being allowed to sell the latest iPhone in Indonesia. The obvious take-away is that the U.S. has little power to compel private companies like Apple or Tesla to expand their footprint in a region like Southeast Asia if they don’t want to, even if doing so might be beneficial to U.S. geopolitical interests. Which is why it’s interesting that we are suddenly seeing a flurry of private equity activity being funneled into critical infrastructure in and around Southeast Asia (and other parts of the world that have potential geostrategic value). Two years ago, GIP had fairly limited exposure in the Asia-Pacific region, especially Southeast Asia. Within the last year, the fund has become a major shareholder in Malaysia’s national airport network, and in one of Indonesia’s largest container terminals (assuming the Hutchinson deal goes through). And they seem keen on pursuing more opportunities in the region, especially related to digital infrastructure and data centers. Are these decisions being made purely on the basis of their commercial considerations, and the returns that BlackRock and GIP expect to generate by investing in energy, transportation and digital connectivity in a fast-growing region with ballooning demand for infrastructure? Or are there broader geopolitical considerations behind this pivot to the Indo-Pacific? I don’t know the answer. But it certainly seems like something worth keeping an eye on.

State-backed media says Lee Ka-shing's firm should 'think again,' and consider the Chinese national interest. By Dawn Yu for RFA Cantonese 2025.03.24 -- Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee has criticized the "bullying tactics by foreign governments" in the wake of the controversial US$23-billion sale of dozens of port facilities -- including those in the Panama Canal -- by homegrown conglomerate CK Hutchison to U.S. investment giant BlackRock. BlackRock and CK Hutchison, which is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Lee Ka-shing, announced earlier this month that they had reached an agreement in principle for BlackRock to acquire CK Hutchison's 90% interests in Panama Ports, which owns and operates the Panama terminals Balboa and Cristobal. BlackRock will also buy CK Hutchison's 80% controlling interest in a further 43 ports in 23 other countries, the companies said in a joint statement dated March 4. The sale came amid growing calls in Washington for action to loosen Beijing's influence stemming from Chinese and Hong Kong companies' control over key infrastructure on the Panama Canal and other port facilities in the Western hemisphere. On Feb. 3, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatened Panamanian leader JosÃ© RaÃºl Mulino with potential American retaliation if his country didn't immediately reduce Chinese influence over the canal. Lee said concerns about the deal "deserve serious attention," possibly hinting at some form of legal action. "We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international, economic and trade relations," Lee told journalists in Hong Kong on Tuesday, adding that Hong Kong would handle any commercial transaction "according to the law." "The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises, including enterprises from Hong Kong," he told journalists at a regular briefing on Tuesday. The ruling Chinese Communist Party responded by sending a delegation to Panama led by Ma Hui, vice-minister of the Central Committee's International Department, state news agency Xinhua reported. "China is willing to strengthen exchanges with Panamanian political parties and think tanks, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and solidify public support for friendly relations between China and Panama," it quoted Ma as saying on March 17. The visit came as Communist Party-backed media criticized the CK Hutchison port sale, citing a "close personal relationship" between BlackRock and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper said the Trump administration had "directly and blatantly intervened and manipulated the deal without scruple, using it as a way to promote their global hegemony." "Now that the Panama Canal has been Americanized and politicized, the United States will definitely be using it to promote its own political agenda," the paper said, citing "huge risks" for Chinese companies' shipping costs and supply chains. It said plans to charge Chinese ships bigger docking fees could affect China's shipping industry, foreign trade and President Xi Jinping's "Belt and Road" global supply chain, infrastructure and influence program. "This is power politics packaged as commercial behavior," the paper said in an editorial that was posted to the official website of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (in Chinese). It said accusations on social media that CK Hutchison had engaged in "spineless grovelling and profit-seeking while disregard the national interest" were "completely understandable." "The company concerned should think twice ... and think carefully about what side it's on," the paper said. Neither China's State Administration for Market Regulation nor the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council had responded to requests for comment by the time of publication. Financial analyst Simon Lee said Lee Ka-shing was caught between a rock and a hard place. "If he sells, he's done for. If he doesn't sell, he's done for," Lee said. "It seems that it's no longer possible to be just a business, whether in China or the United States." "Now you have to pick a side -- you can't just do business like you could before."

Title: Aoife Wafer’s ‘bring it on’ attitude a formidable force for Ireland

It’s Aoife Wafer’s birthday on Tuesday and it really is hard to credit that she’s only turning 22 given all she has already achieved. Ireland’s Player of the Tournament in last season’s Six Nations and, after scoring twice in the WXV1 win over New Zealand, was named in the World Dream Team at the 2024 World Rugby Awards in Monaco. “I didn’t even realise it was my birthday until after the game on Saturday,” said Wafer, referring to Ireland’s 27-15 loss to France in the opening game of this year’s Six Nations on Saturday. “I was so focused on France I completely forgot.” The squad will be preparing for their second game against Italy in Parma on Sunday (kick-off 3pm Irish) and having her birthday in the middle of the tournament restricts celebrations. But, recalling her 18th birthday three seasons ago, she said it has its benefits too, not least as she shares a birthday with squad captain Edel ‘Tricky’ McMahon. “Brian O’Driscoll had come in to present jerseys so we had an absolute selection of cakes and Tricky and I were celebrating away the night before the Wales game. It’s pretty cool to have a birthday in the middle of a campaign.” In her final game as a 21-year-old last Saturday, Wafer made the most carries (17) of any Irish player, won three turnovers, beat three defenders (joint most), scored two of Ireland’s three tries and made 11 tackles (second only to Niamh O’Dowd). And yet she was a marked woman. Ireland head coach Scott Bemand saying after the game: “You could see they were naming her”. As befits her style of play Wafer’s attitude is to ‘bring it on’, and even if her red headguard makes her a more identifiable target, which she partly wears to help her grandmother Cathy to pick her out, she has no intention of removing it. “If they want to put two, three, four people on me to try tackle me I’ve no problem putting a team-mate through a hole and letting them go over because it doesn’t matter who goes over, it doesn’t matter who makes the metres, as long as it’s a good thing for the team. “If the girls want me to run into three Frenchies I’ve no problem to put my head down and try to burst through a wall.” On being named by the opposition, she added: “To be honest I can’t even hear my mother when I’m playing down in Blackrock. I’m quite deaf as well, so I’m very bad at hearing stuff.” The Wexford woman made her Irish debut off the bench soon after her 18th birthday in a 29-8 win over Italy in the 2022 Six Nations at Musgrave Park, before a ruptured hamstring delayed her second cap for over 18 months. She was also part of the team that suffered a second successive defeat to the Azzurri last year. “Italy are a mixed bag. They have players who are absolutely outstanding. You look at (Beatrice) Rigoni, she’s a phenomenal rugby player, but they are beatable and last year that was a game that got away from us in the RDS. “It’s something that we fixed because you look at that Italy game and it got away from us. We had a lot of chances to put them away. We had most of the possession and most of the territory, but it was our own mistakes that let Italy into the game, whether that be we gave away a penalty [or] they kicked for the corner and mauled us over. That kind of thing. “But then you also look at the next result that we had after Italy, which was Wales, and we went out and pummelled Wales because we’re a group that learns fast and that is reflected in our honesty with each other. “I have played Italy twice and we obviously lost in the RDS last year but in my first cap we also won at a time which probably wasn’t the best for Irish women’s rugby but we got our result. “It will be interesting but I’m backing our girls.” ♦ Aoife Wafer has been unveiled as Energia’s newest brand ambassador, “further enhancing their commitment to powering the future of Irish rugby”.

Title: Housing land dezoned in Dundalk despite regulator’s intervention
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/housing-planning/2025/03/25/housing-land-dezoned-in-dundalk-despite-regulators-intervention/
Time Published: 2025-03-25T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
Councillors in Co Louth have voted to confirm the dezoning of residential land in Dundalk, potentially blocking hundreds of new homes in defiance of formal recommendations from the planning regulator. As the housing crisis worsens, the vote prompts questions as to whether Niall Cussen, the chief executive of the Office of the Planning Regulator, asks Minister for Housing James Browne to consider issuing a direction to the county council to revoke the dezoning of the lands at Haggardstown, Blackrock. Mr Cussen’s office provided no guidance on his likely course of action. “We decline to comment at this point in time,” it said. The “new residential” land owned by builder Glenveagh was previously earmarked for some 500 new homes when Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Green and Sinn Féin councillors voted at the beginning of the general election campaign in November to rezone it as “strategic reserve” land. The planning regulator intervened in January, telling Co Louth planners the recommendation to maintain residential zoning related to “clear breaches of the relevant legislative provisions, of the national or regional policy framework and/or the policy of Government, as set out in the Ministerial guidelines”. The regulator noted Dundalk was classified as a regional growth centre and said up to 700 housing units could be built on the lands, adding that such homes “would lessen the pressure for development in other less sustainable areas”. In a report to councillors in February, council chief executive David Conway said he agreed with the regulator “that a residential zoning is appropriate”. At a meeting this month, 11 councillors voted to reject the chief executive’s recommendation to keep residential zoning and six were in favour. Another 11 councillors were absent from the vote and one abstained. The rejection of Mr Conway’s recommendation was, in effect, a vote to endorse the earlier vote to dezone the land. [ Nimbyism or valid objection: the fight over one Dundalk housing schemeOpens in new window ] The voting majority comprised four Fianna Fáil councillors, three from Fine Gael, three Independents and one Green. The vote came despite the Coalition led by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael repeatedly citing the delivery of housing as its top policy priority in domestic politics. Those voting to keep the residential zoning included five Sinn Féin councillors, who reversed previous party support for dezoning the land. One Fianna Fáil councillor, John Sheridan, voted to keep residential zoning. The reasons cited in the council minute of the vote included the view that residential zoning on the lands “do not follow a sequential pattern of development”. The minute also said there were “deficiencies” in water services infrastructure in the area. Citing deficiencies in sewerage services in a June 2024 ruling, An Bord Pleanála refused Glenveagh permission for 502 homes on the lands. In his letter, however, Mr Cussen said his office recently consulted Uisce Éireann and understood the subject lands “while not currently serviced, can be serviced during the lifetime” of the 2024-2030 local area plan. The lands were also identified as “serviceable” in a capacity audit that informed the draft local area plan, the regulator said. Housing development would “directly benefit” from proposed bus routes, cycle networks and a greenway, he said. “Having regard to all of the above and also to the fact that there are no flooding concerns with respect to the subject lands, the office is strongly of the view that the new residential land use zoning objective should be retained as it represents compact, sequential, sustainable growth for the town of Dundalk.” Such plans aligned with the principles of the national planning framework, regional development strategies and the county development plan “particularly in relation to the delivery of housing at sustainable, serviceable locations”.

Title: ‘Critically Important’: Iran Allegedly Used China As Golden Ticket To Quietly Operate In Panama Canal

China’s growing foothold over the Panama Canal isn’t just fueling its own commercial interests, it also appears to be helping America’s adversaries engage side-step sanctions, court documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show. China has expanded its presence considerably in the Panama Canal since former President Jimmy Carter sold the shipping lane to Panama for $1 in 1977, and is funding multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects in the surrounding countryside while buying up ports to solidify its foothold. It’s also been a boon to American adversaries, like Iran. Panamanian court documents obtained by the DCNF show how Iran appeared to have used proxy firms based in Hong Kong, China, to register ships in the Panama Canal and attempted to reap the benefits of chartering its ships. “Given the presence of Chinese companies in port operations and infrastructure near the canal, U.S. officials worry that Beijing may seek commercial or strategic leverage in the region,” Dr. Umud Shokri, senior visiting fellow at George Mason University with expertise in foreign policy, told the DCNF. “The Trump administration’s efforts to regain influence over the canal reflect Washington’s broader view of the waterway as a critical national security asset.” The documents center on various cases involving three Hong Kong-based shipping companies — Grace Shipping, Expander Shipping and Grandest Shipping — all of which have been accused of being subsidiaries of the state-owned Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), a Tehran-based company owned by the Iranian government. IRISL was sanctioned under the first Trump administration, with the State Department describing the company as the “preferred shipping line for Iranian proliferators and procurement agents.” The EU went into more detail than did the Panamanian courts. The EU Council, charged with overseeing security, defense and diplomacy said that for years, IRISL has been “involved in shipping military related cargo,” while the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) “converts container ships owned by IRISL into drone carriers.” Iran has clandestinely operated in the Panama Canal for years, as the Latin American country is considered to be the world’s biggest supplier for “flags of convenience,” which allow shippers to register their vessels under Panamanian colors in exchange for a fee to conceal their port of origin, according to Reuters. Panama took away its flag usage privileges from 136 ships alone over their links to Tehran in 2023. In 2018, the Hong Kong-based companies were looking to sell three separate medium-range tanker ships through an agreement known as a bareboat charter to a Greece-based shipping company. But President Donald Trump announced sanctions on Iran that same year, effectively killing the deal and forcing the Iranian-backed companies to sell the ships outright to avoid penalties. (RELATED: Trump Reportedly Directs Military To Draw Up Plans Increasing Panama Canal Troop Presence) The Greek company went on to use the ships unimpeded for two years after the 2018 sale. However, in 2020, the Hong Kong companies filed a lawsuit in Panamanian court to reclaim the ships from firms under the Greek company’s management that bought the vessels, alleging that the initial selloffs were invalid. The Panamanian court ordered the Greek company to return two of the ships to Grandest Shipping and Expander Shipping, respectively, or pay off the multi-million dollar valuation of the ships to the plaintiffs, according to the legal documents. The case involving Grace Shipping has yet to be resolved. Though the companies now deny their association with IRISL, they have yet to disclose what third parties they were sold to and the nature of the supposed sales. The only people who have appeared as witnesses in the case for the companies are Iranians related to IRISL, according to court documents. The Hong Kong-based firms are represented by Arias B. & Associates in Panama, court documents show.

(Photo by MARTIN BERNETTI / AFP) (Photo by MARTIN BERNETTI/AFP via Getty Images) “China has become unabashed in its unwillingness to comply with U.S. efforts to stop Iranian illicit behavior, and has, in fact, enabled it,” Rebeccah L. Heinrichs, senior fellow and Director of the Keystone Defense Initiative at the Hudson Institute, told the DCNF. “China is the one of the most effective enablers of Iran’s ability to evade US sanctions.” The U.S.’s ability to curtail China-based front companies is partly a function of America’s willingness to potentially strain the U.S.-China business relationships, Heinrichs told the DCNF. “So some of this is just implementing the sanctions, finding the front companies that pop up and not giving China any plausible deniability,” Heinrichs told the DCNF. “All of this is endorsed by and facilitated by the [Chinese Communist Party].” Iran has long made moves to avoid Western sanctions, especially in its oil trade. President Donald Trump sanctioned Iranian minister of petroleum Mohsen Paknejad Thursday for allowing “the export of tens of billions of dollars worth of Iranian oil and has allocated billions of dollars’ worth of oil to Iran’s armed forces for export,” according to the Treasury Department. The Iranian government operates so-called “shadow fleets” that export primarily to Beijing. An entire shadow market for Iranian oil has emerged with China and Russia’s help. Beijing and Moscow have both taken steps to obfuscate the origins of the oil, according to the Atlantic Council. “I think we need to be very serious about Iran sanctions,” Michael Singh, managing director and Lane-Swig Senior Fellow at The Washington Institute, told the DCNF. “But being serious about Iran sanctions does not mean just listing more entities, listing more boats. I’m a former senior Treasury official. I’m all in favor of doing that. Can you do that without enforcement? It’s meaningless.” Panama has been more than happy to accommodate China in its expansion of maritime power. China’s Landbridge Group acquired Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. The acquisition was in conjunction with Beijing’s “Belt and Road” initiative (BRI), a global infrastructure project that has already made its way into a myriad of developing nations. The BRI has been criticized for often giving China undue leverage over the target countries with debt, dubbed “debt-trap diplomacy,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Panama formally joined the Belt and Road initiative in 2017. Moreover, Panama gave a 25-year no-bid renewal to the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports to operate two ports on either end of the canal, covering both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, American investment giant Blackrock agreed to purchase the ports from the China-based firm on March 5 for $22.8 billion. U.S. officials and congressmen, such as Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Republican Utah Sen. John Curtis, have levied criticism at the Panama Canal Authority for allegedly not doing enough to enforce sanctions, especially against China. The Panama Canal Authority has vehemently pushed back against the accusations, saying they are “not a haven for sanctions evasion.” “The United States has found that Iranian vessels are sometimes flagged by Panama in order to avoid sanctions so that they could sell the fuel that they have and then they can take that money and then use it as they wish,” Louis Sola, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), said during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in January. Cruz also echoed the sentiment during the Commerce Committee hearing, saying the U.S. could not be “idle” while China grows its foothold. “China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction by the US. The international community, including China, has conducted normal cooperation with Iran within the framework of international law,” a Chinese Embassy spokesperson told the DCNF. “This is reasonable and lawful without harm done to any third party, and deserves to be respected and protected.” “All of this is primarily about control of sea lanes,” Heinrichs told the DCNF. “So it’s critically important, and I credit the Trump administration for recognizing that and for understanding it, that you cannot let the Chinese take over the Panama Canal.” The Iranian Foreign Ministry and Arias B. & Associates did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Courtesy PsiQuantum/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo SAN FRANCISCO :Quantum computing startup PsiQuantum is raising at least $750 million at a $6 billion pre-money valuation, according to two people familiar with the matter. BlackRock is leading the fundraising effort, which has not yet been completed, one of the people said. Unlike some quantum computing startups using exotic materials, PsiQuantum is aiming to modify traditional manufacturing techniques from the semiconductor industry.

Title: Panama Canal: A Short History of Its Operation and Chinese Interest In It

Send an email to Virginia. PANAMA CITY, Panama—A Chinese cultural center on the outskirts of Panama City was busy with people coming and going on a Wednesday afternoon in March, a reminder of China’s long history in the region. The first Chinese immigrants arrived in Panama in 1854 to help build the railroad to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Groups of Chinese continued to migrate to Panama in the 1800s and to help with large constructions projects, including the Panama Canal. Today, the concern from President Donald Trump and some other policy leaders is that China’s influence in the region has extended far beyond culture and is aimed at “increasing Chinese government presence” in the Latin American country, according to Victoria Coates, vice president of the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation. During his inauguration speech on Jan. 20, Trump said, “China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” When Trump returned to office in January and saw the ways China was building infrastructure around the Panama Canal and that a Hong Kong-based company was operating ports on either side of the canal, “He said, ‘No, this can’t go on,’” Coates told The Daily Signal. The Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison recently agreed to sell port holdings on both ends of the Panama Canal to BlackRock, an American global asset manager. The situation in Panama involving China’s influence is critical to the “national security interest of the United States,” Coates said, adding, “There is no need for China to be here.” The security of the canal is vital to the U.S. as American military vessels use the Panama Canal to move between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. “We have a long history of partnership with Panama,” Coates said, adding that the U.S. has “a very friendly president in President [José Raúl] Mulino right now, so I think it’s a great time to really build that relationship and make sure the United States’ national security interests are protected.” The Panama Canal has drawn increased attention in the news following Trump’s claim that China is “operating” the canal. Today, about 8,500 people work at the canal, none of whom are Chinese, according to Miguel Lorenzo, vice president for infrastructure and engineering at the Panama Canal. “I need to be completely clear with the facts,” Lorenzo told The Daily Signal while standing just outside one of the command centers overlooking the canal’s locks. “I think there’s eight non-Panamanian people who work in the canal,” he said, adding, “There’s a Colombian. There’s a couple of Americans that are still working for the canal. The other one, I think, is Chilean. No Chinese.” In 2015 or 2016, Lorenzo said, the canal had “one construction contract with a Chinese contractor,” but “it turned out not to be a good experience” and has since ended. “As far as supplies go, we do get some things that come from China. It’s unavoidable,” he said. Over the years, China has engaged in infrastructure projects around the canal—and continues to do so. Panama established diplomatic ties with China in 2017, and the following year, Panama announced that China Communications Construction Co. Ltd. and China Harbour Engineering Co. Ltd. had won a bid to construct a fourth bridge over the Panama Canal. In February, the BBC reported that the China Railway Tunnel Group Co. is building an extension to the Panama City Metro under the south side of the canal. The French started construction of the Panama Canal in the 1880s, long before the U.S. took over the massive engineering project in 1904. The canal, which connects the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, was completed in 1914. The canal created opportunity for an economic boom in America because goods could now travel more easily and quickly between the East and West coasts of the U.S. The U.S. operated the canal for decades, but over time, the Panamanians began to view American control of the canal as an infringement on their sovereignty. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama to gradually transfer control of the 51-mile canal to the nation it bisects, and on Dec. 31, 1999, Panama assumed full control of the canal. What’s the Big Deal With the Panama Canal?President Donald Trump says he wants the canal back in the hands of the U.S. for economic and national security reasons, but the president of Panama says ownership of the canal is not open for negotiation. The Daily Signal's… pic.twitter.com/cmrqtCBjbp Originally only two locks, the canal was later expanded to add a third lock lane that is longer and wider. A complex system of switches and levers operated the canal until the early 2000s, when a digital system was put in place to run the canal. Between 36 and 38 ships pass through the canal each day, the majority of which are commercial container ships. Container ships are “our bread and butter,” Lorenzo told The Daily Signal, adding that about 60% of the ship that pass through the canal are commercial container ships. “And then the second segment of the market, that it’s probably about 30%-35%, is energy,” he said. Military ships, including U.S. Navy ships, also use the canal. Traveling from one side of the canal to the other takes about 10 hours, but saves vessels between 10 and 22 days from having to traverse down and around Cape Horn at the tip of South America. The lock system on the canal operates like stair steps through multiple lock chambers. Each chamber holds millions of gallons of water. Water levels are raised and lowered to bring each ship above sea level to meet the water level of the Gatun Lake before lowering the ship back down. The lock system at the Panama Canal operates like stair steps. There are multiple lock chambers within each lock and it takes about 10 minutes for 27.5 million gallons on water to enter a chamber, raising it to the level needed for ships to move between each chamber. pic.twitter.com/M6x4xpHh2n When at its lower level, the water in the lock chamber is about 40 to 45 feet deep, and 70 feet deep when the water level is raised all the way to the top. When raising or lowering the water levels in a lock chamber, 27.5 million gallons of water are moved in about 10 minutes, Lorenzo explained. The original locks are 110 feet wide and can accommodate ships up to 106 feet wide, leaving only 24 inches of space on each side of the vessel. When a ship is ready to traverse the canal, the ship’s captain steps aside, and a specially trained canal pilot enters the ship with a crew of about 20 who will guide the vessel from one end of the canal to the other. ?The Panama Canal is an incredible engineering feat to behold. Each lock chamber in this part of the canal is 1,000 feet long by 110 feet wide. The largest ships that can enter through this lock are 106 feet wide, giving only 24 inches of space on each side. pic.twitter.com/4j6GHmgFWk Dive into the brilliant mind of Victor Davis Hanson, renowned classicist, historian, and Senior Contributor at The Daily Signal.

Title: Shiba Inu ETF Proposal—Could This Be SHIB’s Breakout Moment?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A Shiba Inu marketing executive has sparked talk about a possible ETF for the popular meme cryptocurrency. Her recent statements come as the token saw its burn rate jump by more than 8,000% in a single day, according to market watchers. Lucie, who serves as a marketing lead for Shiba Inu, posted on X that SHIB has the right qualities to become an ETF. She highlighted that the cryptocurrency is currently available on over 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs. This wide availability, she says, makes SHIB a strong candidate for an exchange-traded fund. Her comments have gained attention as investors look for signs that meme coins might follow the path of Bitcoin and Ethereum in securing ETF approval. SHIB is listed on over 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs—including all the major platforms. It’s basically everywhere: easy to access, easy to trade. Is SHIB good for an ETF? YES. Will boomers invest in a “doggy coin”? Also yes. Because SHIB isn’t just a meme—it’s… — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) March 23, 2025 The conversation around a possible Shiba Inu ETF follows several developments in the cryptocurrency ETF space. According to reports, Canary Capital recently filed an S-1 form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission seeking approval for a SUI ETF. The SEC has also acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for a Dogecoin ETF, which has increased talk about similar opportunities for other meme coins. Some market watchers have suggested that BlackRock might file for a Dogecoin ETF, though this remains unconfirmed. These developments have created an atmosphere where investors are considering which cryptocurrencies might next receive ETF treatment. As ETF discussions picked up steam, SHIB saw its burn rate increase by 8,457% on Monday. Based on data from tracking sites, more than 1 billion SHIB tokens were permanently removed from circulation in a 24-hour period. The burn mechanism works by sending tokens to a specific address where they can never be retrieved, effectively reducing the total supply. After this large burn, the circulating supply stands at 584.35 trillion coins. Cryptocurrency markets often react positively to supply reductions, following basic supply and demand principles that suggest fewer available tokens might lead to price increases. Despite the excitement around potential ETF developments and the dramatic burn rate increase, SHIB’s price movement has been relatively small. The meme coin saw just a 1% price increase, reaching $0.00001303 at the time of writing. The price ranged from $0.0000128 to $0.00001309 over the previous 24 hours, showing limited volatility despite the news. Meanwhile, market data from Coinglass shows growing interest in SHIB derivatives. The open interest in Shiba Inu futures increased by 3.5% to $120 million, while trading volume jumped 20% to $70 million. These indicators suggest one thing: traders are now paying close attention to the meme coin — even if the price hasn’t yet reflected the optimism expressed by community figures and some investors. While a Shiba Inu ETF would provide some boost to the appeal of Shiba Inu, regulatory approval remains up in the air. The SEC has only recently approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs after years of applications, suggesting that meme coins may face a long road to similar recognition.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: RWA protocols cross $10B in TVL for the first time, sector leads YTD performance

BlackRock's BUIDL leads the RWA market, propelled by over $1 billion investment from Ethena Labs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The tokenized real-world assets (RWA) sector surpassed $10 billion in total value locked (TVL) for the first time on March 18, registering an all-time high on March 21 at nearly $10.4 billion TVL. Along with the growth in TVL, the RWA sector has become the best-performing segment of the crypto market year-to-date. The TVL of RWA protocols jumped 30% in 2025 and almost 140% year-on-year. The leap is even more significant compared to March 2023, when RWA protocols had less than $1 billion in TVL, reaching 1,054% growth. Tokenization represents an asset from the real world in the blockchain’s digital environment. BlackRock’s tokenized money fund BUIDL leads the market with over $1.4 billion in TVL, growing 140% in the past 30 days. BUIDL is followed closely by MakerDAO’s RWA vault and its $1.3 billion market size despite its 30% decrease in the same period. Ethena Labs’ stablecoin USDtb is the third-largest RWA protocol by TVL, surpassing $1 billion almost three months after its launch and reaching almost $1.2 billion as of press time. USDtb’s total value locked in the past month soared by 1,222%. DefiLlama head of growth Patrick Scott highlighted that most RWA protocols are tokenizing treasury bills. Yet, he believes that bonds, equities, “and the entire financial markets” will eventually move on-chain. Scott added: “Hyper-tokenization isn’t a theory, it’s already happening. The question isn’t if more assets will be tokenized, but how fast it will scale.” The growth of BUIDL and USDtb is directly related. The stablecoin issued by Ethena Labs holds 90% of its backing in BUIDL shares. According to USDtb’s transparency page, over $1 billion of its backing consists of BUIDL. As a result, nearly 76% of BlackRock’s fund TVL is propelled by a DeFi application. Additionally, BUIDL could soon receive a $500 million boost from MakerDAO’s Spark protocol. BlackRock, along with Centrifuge and Superstate, won the Tokenization Grand Prix competition, earning an investment intention from Spark. However, the allocation remains subject to Sky (formerly MakerDAO) governance approval, with a vote scheduled for April 3. According to Artemis data, RWA-related tokens are down 1% year-to-date. Despite this negative performance, the sector outperformed the average year-to-date crypto market performance of negative 39%. Mantra (OM) is the best-performing RWA token, with its price climbing over 83% this year. Meanwhile, the recently launched Plume (PLUME) is up 30% over the past 30 days, making it the second-best-performing token in the sector. Furthermore, the RWA sector’s performance is even more remarkable than other popular crypto narratives. Memecoins have fallen roughly 47.5% on average this year, while AI-related tokens lost nearly 58% of their value over the same period.

Title: Bitcoin flashes ‘buy’ as Binance, Metaplanet accumulate: Good news for BTC?

Time Published: 2025-03-24T20:00:17Z

Bitcoin could be headed north following a rise in global liquidity, institutional buying, and a reduction in selling pressure. Logarithmic measurement of the price of Bitcoin [BTC] and global liquidity within the same scale showed intriguing dynamics. Historically, this combination has seen green buy signals emerge when Z-Score reached -3 below zero and red sell signals developed as Z-Score climbed above +3. For instance, Bitcoin saw its substantial price rise from below $500 to above $1,000 during the period starting in early 2016 when a transaction signal appeared. The red warning sign emerged in late 2017 before Bitcoin reached its maximum value at $20,000, which triggered a swift price decrease. Source: Alpha Extract In early 2020, the buying indicator triggered as Bitcoin surpassed the $10,000 level, which would later result in reaching its highest price point ever. The current green signal revealed an opportunity for a Bitcoin price rise because of growing market liquidity. Institutional investors like Binance and Metaplanet also participated in BTC purchases following a buy indicator appearing in the market suggesting potential for a rise in BTC value. Binance keeps purchasing Bitcoin with the last 24 hours, seeing tokens worth $250 million being purchased and sent to the market maker, Wintermute, as the cryptocurrency continues to gain market presence. Besides Binances’s strategic buy, Metaplanet also made additional purchases of 150 Bitcoin as per their post on X (formerly Twitter). The purchase activities of institutions could drive BTC price growth through elevated market demand and thus both create more buying power and strengthen market trust. Extended purchases showed potential to drive the BTC price higher because they might attract additional investors to join this rising market. The buying coincides with other institutions like BlackRock and MicroStrategy also accumulating BTC during the recent dip to $80K. The cumulative net taker volume also indicated how aggressive BTC selling has decreased since February through lower net taker volume changes. Since February 24 to mid-March, Bitcoin has faced massive selling pressure that reduced its price from $95K to nearly $75K. However, BTC prices have seen stabilization upon each major sell-off event and then started to recover slowly. The negative net taker volume reached a point of decline during mid-March, which indicated a reduction in market selling activity. Source: CryptoQuant Subsequently, Bitcoin experienced its price rebound above $85K as the green cumulative net taker volume surfaced in the market on the 20th of March. The absence of major economic slowdown together with controlled asset liquidation points toward reasonable BTC price expansion according to current market patterns.

Title: RWA News: China Pacific Insurance Rolls Out $100M Tokenized Money Market Fund on HashKey Chain

China Pacific Insurance (CPIC) Investment Management, a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of one of China's largest insurance groups, rolled out a tokenized U.S. dollar money market fund as the asset tokenization trend is expanding to Asia. The eStable Money Market Fund (MMF) was launched on the HashKey Chain, a permissioned blockchain for institutional users developed by digital asset group HashKey, and has secured $100 million in subscription on the first day, according to a Monday press release. The product is only accessible for professional and institutional investors and invests in U.S. dollar-denominated short-term fixed income assets and money market instruments. The PAC serves as the tokenization issuance platform for the fund, while Standard Chartered Bank provides registration and fund administration services. Asset managers around the globe are increasingly putting traditional financial instruments such as government bonds, credit, and funds on blockchain rails, a process often referred to as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). By doing so, they seek to achieve operational and efficiency gains and faster, around-the-clock settlements. U.S.-based issuers like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock have been spearheading the tokenization efforts of U.S. Treasury securities as a blockchain-based facility to manage cash holdings, similar to a money market fund. Last week, Fidelity Investments also filed for regulatory approval to enter the market with a fund built on the Ethereum network. This is a fast-growing market: the total market value of yield-generating some 500% over the past year to almost $4.8 billion, rwa.xyz data shows. "The essence of finance is the flow of value across time and space, and blockchain is the new infrastructure for this process," said Dr. Xiao Feng, chairman and CEO of HashKey Group. "Integration with traditional finance is an important direction for future Web3 development and one of the directions with the greatest certainty," CG Zhou, CEO of CPIC Investment Management, said in a statement, adding that the company will seek to tokenize more traditional assets using compliance-driven blockchains.

As the market's US exceptionalism narrative wanes this year, there are two places investors may want to look to for returns. Amid trade uncertainty and dimming economic prospects, US markets have been rattled in 2025. The recent stock market correction has spurred talk that investors may be better off looking abroad than hoping for US equities to regain their footing. After years of underperformance, international stocks are suddenly in the spotlight as they surpass US peers. According to BlackRock, there are two markets in particular where investors should look to park some money. The world's largest asset manager thinks the earnings outlook has improved for Japanese companies. Corporate reforms and mild inflation will help, and have resulted in companies' returns on equity hitting a peak. Corporate profitability for Japanese firms recently reached a four-decade high, BlackRock said. Last week, Japan's Topix exchange rose 3.3%, shooting past the S&P 500's 0.5% weekly gain. However, the possibility of a stronger yen could diminish the earnings outlook, BlackRock added. While the currency's appreciation has slowed, traders will have to watch the economic data in the country and the actions of its central bank. BlackRock is also modestly overweight on the world's second-largest economy, encouraged by recent artificial intelligence and tech developments. A flurry of competitive AI projects out of China has ratcheted up the competition to US tech dominance, pushing the tech-heavy Hang Seng index up 20% year-to-date. "That contrasts with the onshore benchmark CSI 300, roughly flat this year, showing how the AI theme in China has been centered in tech as it initially was in the US," the note said. Yet, this also means that the country remains susceptible to tariff risks and structural macro challenges, and BlackRock remains "ready to pivot" on its outlook. Analysts have told Business Insider that the nation's government is looking to correct course after a period of stringent regulation of the country's tech sector scared investors away in 2024. To be sure, US stocks are getting a respite from the downturn, and commentators say American exceptionalism could soon see a revival. Morgan Stanley wrote on Monday that a resurgence of US equities led by fresh gains for the Magnificent Seven could be a catalyst to restart the broader rally. Reports that the next wave of tariffs would be softer than expected sent the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher in Monday's session. For its part, BlackRock still holds an overweight on the US market, betting on upside from the AI theme and broadening earnings growth. Yet a surge in long-term bond yields or further escalations in a global trade war are looming risks. Jump to

Send an email to Virginia. PANAMA CITY, Panama—The lack of a strong U.S. presence in Panama has opened a door for America’s adversaries, according to Kevin Roberts. Standing on the edge of the Panama Canal, Roberts, president of The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal that the absence of the U.S. in Panama and “not having control of the Panama Canal” created an opportunity, “particularly [for] our greatest adversary, China, to step into that vacuum, and that of course is precisely what they’ve done.” Roberts visited Panama as part of a weeklong Heritage Foundation delegation to Latin America in mid-March. The delegation, which included Victoria Coates, vice president of the Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, and Andrés Martínez-Fernández, a senior policy analyst focused on Latin America, among others, met with Panama Foreign Minister Javier Martínez-Acha and Panama President José Raúl Mulino to discuss growing concerns over China’s influence in the region. Roberts said he and the Heritage delegation of policy experts “were able to convey to [Mulino] and the foreign minister, both of whom are great public servants, that for the United States, especially for those of us who are conservatives, any country that does business with China is not a friend of the United States.” Panama’s leaders “recognize where we as Americans are coming from and where President [Donald] Trump in particular is coming from,” Roberts said. “But I don’t think that they comprehend fully how significant a problem [China] is in Panama and across Latin America.” Trump and Mulino have had indirect public disagreement over China’s influence on the Panama Canal. During his inauguration speech on Jan. 20, Trump said, “China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” Mulino denies China is operating the canal and says ownership of the Panama Canal is not open for negotiation. The U.S. built the Panama Canal in the early 1900s, but President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama in 1977 to transfer ownership and control of the canal to Panama. The transfer of the canal from the U.S. to Panama, which was completed on Dec. 31, 1999, was “one of the most egregious decisions in the history of geopolitics since our country was founded,” Roberts said. Panama, not China, operates the Panama Canal, but China has been, and remains, involved in projects related to the canal. China has “more control than they should” in Panama, Roberts said. “Most of that control comes in the form of economic interests, investing companies, and so on.” Panama established diplomatic ties with China in 2017 and the following year, Panama announced China Communications Construction Co. Ltd. and China Harbour Engineering Co. Ltd. had won a bid to construct a fourth bridge over the Panama Canal. In February, the BBC reported that the China Railway Tunnel Group Co. is building an extension to the Panama City Metro under the south side of the canal. China is “infringing upon American national security by building massive infrastructure here,” Roberts said. A recent large canal port deal between an American-based company and a Hong Kong-based company has called further attention to China’s influence in the region. The Chinese government has been critical of a deal for a Hong Kong conglomerate, CK Hutchison, to sell port holdings on both ends of the Panama Canal to BlackRock, an American global asset manager. Trump has praised the deal, but CK Hutchison says the agreed-upon deal is “purely commercial” and has nothing to do with Trump’s recent comments on the canal. As conversations regarding the canal and China’s presence in the region continue, Roberts said, “President Mulino, I think, can be a really rational partner, certainly for his country’s interest, but also for ours.” It may be helpful, Roberts said, for Mulino and Trump to meet because they are both economically and socially conservative and the two leaders would likely “get along.” Trump and Mulino are both “very successful business owners, both really proud fathers and grandfathers. That comes across when you’re in the presence of both of them,” Roberts said. “And while I can see some near-term challenges, and there are some near-term challenges in Panama, I also can see some real medium-term, long-term opportunities if President Mulino and his Cabinet sees them.” Asked to explain the “near-term challenges” in Panama, Roberts said while there are others, most do relate to China’s interest in the region. “There are too many otherwise aligned policymakers, heads of state across Latin America, with the United States who don’t understand fully the threat that China is, not just to the United States, but to their own people,” Roberts said. “And if Heritage could wave a magic wand and get them to understand one thing, it would be that.” Dive into the brilliant mind of Victor Davis Hanson, renowned classicist, historian, and Senior Contributor at The Daily Signal.

Title: Mag 7 Returns Would Improve With Bitcoin Replacing Tesla: StanChart
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/24/mag-7-returns-would-improve-with-bitcoin-replacing-tesla-stanchart

While bitcoin (BTC) proponents commonly view the largest cryptocurrency as a digital version of gold, a new report from global bank Standard Chartered argued investors should see it more like a tech stock with some extra benefits. Led by Geoff Kendrick, the StanChart team said bitcoin's correlation with the Nasdaq has "almost always" been stronger than with gold, the old-school safe haven asset. While BTC may have a role as a place to hide in instances of financial instability like the 2023 regional banking crisis or what might be the unsustainable U.S. debt trajectory, the report said, the reality is that there's rarely a need for such hedges, thus its increasing behavior as more like a traditional tech stock. "Investors can view BTC as both a hedge against traditional finance and as part of their tech allocation," said Kendrick. But, at least "in the short term, BTC may be better viewed as a tech stock than as a hedge against TradFi issues," he added. Playing with the idea of bitcoin as part of a tech portfolio, the report proposed a remodel of the index of the so-called Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) stocks — the mega-cap tech names that have driven overall market returns of late, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta and Tesla (TSLA). This new "Mag 7B" would swap out Tesla for bitcoin. The result? The Mag7B produced consistently higher risk-adjusted returns than the original group over the past seven years, reinforcing BTC's role in a tech-focused portfolio, said Kendrick. The Mag7B outperformed the Mag7 on average by around 1% with nearly 2% lower volatility on an annual basis, a key benefit to institutional investors and large asset allocators, he continued. "BTC should be seen as serving multiple purposes in investor portfolios. This would open up the possibility of even more institutional buying," Kendrick noted. Asset managers have been advocating for including bitcoin in investment portfolios for diversification purposes. For example, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, recommended considering an up to 2% BTC allocation in traditional stock and bond portfolios. Meanwhile, asset managers like 21Shares and Bitwise have launched exchange-traded funds (ETFs) combining gold and bitcoin as complementary assets.

Title: The Stablecoin Trap: The Backdoor to Total Financial Control

Editor Crypto Aaron Day, Brownstone Institute The walls are closing in on your financial freedom—but not in the way most Americans believe. While the debate rages over the future threat of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), a far more insidious reality has already taken hold: our existing financial system already functions as a digital control grid, monitoring transactions, restricting choices, and enforcing compliance through programmable money. For over two years, my wife and I have traveled across 22 states warning about the rapid expansion of financial surveillance. What began as research into cryptocurrency crackdowns revealed something far more alarming: the United States already operates under what amounts to a CBDC. The Federal Reserve processes over $4 trillion daily through its Oracle database system, while commercial banks impose programmable restrictions on what you can buy and how you can spend your own money. The IRS, NSA, and Treasury Department collect and analyze financial data without meaningful oversight, weaponizing money as a tool of control. This isn’t speculation—it’s documented reality. Now, as President Trump’s Executive Order 14178 ostensibly “bans” CBDCs, his administration is quietly advancing stablecoin legislation that would hand digital currency control to the same banking cartel that owns the Federal Reserve. The STABLE Act and GENIUS Act don’t protect financial privacy—they enshrine financial surveillance into law, requiring strict KYC tracking on every transaction. This isn’t defeating digital tyranny—it’s rebranding it. This article cuts through the distractions to expose a sobering truth: the battle isn’t about stopping a future CBDC—it’s about recognizing the financial surveillance system that already exists. Your financial sovereignty is already under attack, and the last off-ramps are disappearing. The time for complacency has passed. The surveillance state isn’t coming—it’s here. To fully grasp how deeply financial surveillance has already penetrated our lives, we must first understand the terminology being used—and often deliberately obscured—by government officials, central bankers, and financial institutions. The following key definitions will serve as a foundation for our discussion, cutting through the technical jargon to reveal the true nature of what’s at stake: Before diving deeper into the financial surveillance system we face today, let’s establish clear definitions for the key concepts discussed throughout this article: A digital form of central bank money, issued and controlled by a nation’s monetary authority. While often portrayed as a future innovation, I argue in “Fifty Shades of Central Bank Tyranny” that the US dollar already functions as a CBDC, with over 92% existing only as digital entries in Federal Reserve and commercial bank databases. A type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by pegging to an external asset, typically the US dollar. Major examples include: The process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain or database. This applies to both currencies and other assets like real estate, stocks, or commodities. Tokenization enables: A proposed financial infrastructure that would connect central banks, commercial banks, and tokenized assets on a unified digital platform, enabling comprehensive tracking and potential control of all financial assets. Cryptocurrencies specifically designed to preserve transaction privacy and resist surveillance: Currency that contains embedded rules controlling how, when, where, and by whom it can be used. Examples already exist in: Regulatory frameworks require financial institutions to verify customer identities and report suspicious transactions. While ostensibly aimed at preventing crime, these regulations have expanded to create comprehensive financial surveillance with minimal oversight. US laws mandate financial surveillance, eliminate transaction privacy, and grant government agencies broad powers to monitor financial activity without warrants. These laws form the legislative foundation of the current financial control system. Proposed legislation would restrict stablecoin issuance to banks and regulated entities, requiring comprehensive KYC/AML compliance and effectively bringing stablecoins under the same surveillance framework as traditional banking. Understanding these terms is essential for recognizing how our existing financial system already functions as a mechanism of digital control, despite the absence of an officially designated “CBDC.” The greatest sleight of hand in modern finance isn’t cryptocurrency or complex derivatives—it’s convincing Americans they don’t already live under a Central Bank Digital Currency system. Let’s dismantle this illusion by examining how our current dollar already functions as a fully operational CBDC. When most Americans picture money, they imagine physical cash changing hands. Yet this mental image is profoundly outdated—92% of all US currency exists solely as digital entries in databases, with no physical form whatsoever. The Federal Reserve, our central bank, doesn’t create most new money by printing bills; it generates it by adding numbers to an Oracle database. This process begins when the government sells Treasury securities (IOUs) to the Federal Reserve. Where does the Fed get money to buy these securities? It simply adds digits to its database—creating money from nothing. The government then pays its bills through its account at the Fed, transferring these digital dollars to vendors, employees, and benefit recipients. The Fed’s digital infrastructure processes over $4 trillion in transactions daily, all without a single physical dollar changing hands. This isn’t some small experimental system—it’s the backbone of our entire economy. Commercial banks extend this digital system. When you deposit money, the bank records it in their Microsoft or Oracle database. Through fractional reserve banking, they then create additional digital money—up to 9 times your deposit—to loan to others. This multiplication happens entirely in databases, with no new physical currency involved. Until recently, banks were required to keep 10% of deposits as reserves at the Federal Reserve. Covid-19 legislation removed even this minimal requirement, though most banks still maintain similar levels for operational reasons. The key point remains: the dollar predominantly exists as entries in a network of databases controlled by the Fed and commercial banks. Those who fear a future CBDC’s ability to program and restrict money use miss a crucial reality: our current digital dollars already have these capabilities built in. Consider these existing examples: These aren’t theoretical capabilities—they’re operational today, using the exact same digital dollar infrastructure we already have. The surveillance apparatus for our digital dollars is equally established. The Bank Secrecy Act mandates that financial institutions report “suspicious” transactions, while the Patriot Act expanded these monitoring requirements dramatically. The IRS uses artificial intelligence to scrutinize spending patterns across millions of accounts, while the NSA bulk collects financial data through programs revealed by Edward Snowden. This surveillance enables active censorship, as demonstrated during Canada’s trucker protests in 2022, when banks froze accounts of donors without judicial review. Similar account freezes have targeted individuals ranging from Kanye West to Dr. Joseph Mercola—all using the existing digital dollar system. In March 2025, the Treasury intensified this framework, lowering the cash transaction reporting threshold from $10,000 to $200 across 30 ZIP codes near the southwest border, subjecting over a million Americans to heightened scrutiny under the guise of curbing illicit activity. When politicians and central bankers claim we don’t have a CBDC, they’re playing a game of definitions. The substantive elements that define a CBDC—digital creation, central bank issuance, programmability, surveillance, and censorship capability—are all present in our current system. The debate over implementing a “new” CBDC is largely a distraction. We’re not discussing whether to create a digital dollar—we’re discussing whether to acknowledge the one we already have and how to modify its architecture to further enhance surveillance and control. Understanding this reality is the first step toward recognizing that the battle for financial privacy and autonomy isn’t about stopping some future implementation—it’s about confronting and reforming a system already firmly in place. The government justifies financial surveillance under the guise of fighting terrorism, money laundering, and organized crime, but the data tells a different story. Since the passage of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) in 1970 and the Patriot Act in 2001, the US government has accumulated trillions of financial records on ordinary Americans, yet these laws have failed to curb financial crime. Instead, they have been used to target political dissidents, seize assets without due process, and criminalize cash transactions. These financial laws were never about stopping crime—they were about controlling the people. Meanwhile, the same government that demands total visibility over our money has lost track of trillions and even funneled taxpayer dollars directly to terrorist groups. If financial transparency is so important, perhaps the US Treasury should be the first to comply. Before we delve deeper, let’s cut through the noise and define the true stakes—because the focus on banning a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and vilifying the Federal Reserve misses the bigger picture. President Trump and others have zeroed in on the Federal Reserve as the architect of digital tyranny, with a public blame game unfolding as the Fed, federal government, and commercial banks point fingers at each other like squabbling overlords. But this distraction obscures the real enemy: a government surveillance apparatus that already tracks, programs, and censors our money, paving the way for digital tyranny—social credit systems, digital IDs, vaccine passports, and more. The Federal Reserve is just one cog; the government’s machinery, backed by the banks that own the Fed, is the true enforcer. My two-year crusade against Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) stems from a chilling realization: the endgame isn’t just controlling our money—it’s digitizing all our assets—money, stocks, bonds, real estate, and more—under a global ledger with the same tracking and programmability as CBDCs. As I detail in my book The Final Countdown, this vision involves CBDCs paired with Regulated Liability Networks (RLNs), systems designed to tokenize every financial instrument—stocks, bonds, and beyond—settling only in CBDCs. Countries like the US, those in Europe, the UK, and Japan are developing their own RLNs, engineered to interoperate, creating a seamless global ledger. The ultimate aim, rooted in the technocracy movement since the 1930s, is a single digital currency backed by energy credits, tying our wealth to resource consumption and a social credit system. This isn’t speculation—it’s a deliberate blueprint. RLNs enable central banks and governments to monitor and program every asset, ensuring compliance with policies like carbon limits or social scores. The technocracy movement, founded by figures like Howard Scott in the 1930s, envisioned energy as the basis of economic value, a concept now resurfacing in digital form. This global ledger threatens to erase ownership and freedom, a reality already taking shape as governments and banks tighten their grip. This sets the stage to uncover how the US government’s surveillance machine, already in motion, accelerates this dystopian future. The US government has perfected financial surveillance long before any CBDC label was applied, as I detailed in my Brownstone Institute article “Fifty Shades of Central Bank Tyranny.” The National Security Agency (NSA) bulk collects financial data on domestic and international transactions, a revelation from Edward Snowden exposing its access to phone calls, internet communications, and undersea cable intercepts—turning your bank account into a government peephole. The IRS, wielding artificial intelligence, scrutinizes spending patterns with chilling precision, as seen in Rebecca Brown’s 2015 case, where $91,800 was seized via civil asset forfeiture for no crime, or the IRS’s recent mandate forcing Venmo and PayPal to report transactions over $600, ensnaring even the smallest earners. These AI tools transform every purchase into a potential target for government scrutiny. The Patriot Act amplifies this overreach, authorizing warrantless wiretapping and data collection, while National Security Letters (NSLs)—like the one silencing Nick Merrill in 2004, gagging him from consulting a lawyer about FBI demands—ensure silence under threat of law. The Bank Secrecy Act compels banks to report “suspicious” activity, fueling Operation Chokepoint 2.0, where commercial banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America froze accounts of dissenters—Kanye West, Melania and Barron Trump, Dr. Joseph Mercola—often exceeding federal directives. Congress, not the Fed, drives this surveillance juggernaut, embedding it through bipartisan laws like the Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, CARES Act, and the addition of 87,000 armed IRS agents poised to audit the average citizen. Focusing solely on the Federal Reserve as the villain is a distinction without a difference. The Fed, a private entity veiled in secrecy, is owned by the largest commercial banks—JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and others—forming a cartel that profits from the system, as G. Edward Griffin’s The Creature from Jekyll Island exposes. Its digital money creation feeds these banks, which multiply it through fractional reserves. Eliminating the Fed and letting the government issue currency directly, as Senator Ron Wyden advocates—a stance I challenged at a conference where he opposed CBDCs but endorsed government control—wouldn’t end surveillance; it would intensify it. Wyden’s vision centralizes power further, removing the Fed’s buffer and amplifying government oversight with no accountability. The real threat lies in the system’s design: digital money is already tracked and censored by government decree. Whether it’s the Fed’s Oracle databases or banks’ Microsoft systems, the infrastructure is programmable, enabling control without new laws—just new rules, crafted daily in backrooms. This surveillance machine, not the Fed alone, drives us toward a dystopian future where every transaction fuels tyranny. With this system already entrenched in the US, the global race for CBDCs—and the US’s pivot to stablecoins under the STABLE and GENIUS Acts—only accelerates the spread of this control, amplifying the threat both abroad and at home. We must confront this escalating reality head-on to grasp the full scope of the battle for our financial freedom. Even with President Trump’s Executive Order (EO) 14178, signed on January 23, 2025, banning the Federal Reserve and other US agencies from pursuing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the global race to develop CBDCs has not slowed down—it’s actually speeding up. Before the EO, 134 countries and currency unions, representing 98% of global GDP, were actively exploring CBDCs, according to the Atlantic Council’s Central Bank Digital Currency Tracker. With the US stepping back from explicit CBDC work, that number drops to 133 countries. The US accounts for approximately 26% of global GDP (based on 2024 World Bank estimates of a $105 trillion global GDP, with the US contributing $27 trillion). Subtracting the US share, the remaining 133 countries still represent about 72% of global GDP—a massive portion of the world economy—continuing their CBDC efforts. Meanwhile, the US has shifted its focus to a backdoor approach through stablecoins, empowering commercial banks and the Federal Reserve to extend digital control at the expense of privacy and decentralized finance (DeFi). The US pivot isn’t just about stablecoins like Tether and USDC—it’s a broader strategy codified in two legislative proposals: the STABLE Act (House, February 6, 2025) and the GENIUS Act (Senate, February 4, 2025). These bills restrict stablecoin issuance to insured depository institutions, federal nonbanks, and state-regulated entities, effectively handing the reins to big banks like JPMorgan Chase and the Federal Reserve’s network of member banks. The STABLE Act bans unauthorized issuers, while the GENIUS Act prohibits unapproved payment stablecoins, ensuring only the financial elite can play. Both mandate strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, turning every transaction into a surveillance opportunity. Algorithmic stablecoins used in DeFi platforms, which thrive on anonymity and decentralization, are effectively sidelined, as banks and the Fed tighten their grip on the digital dollar ecosystem. This isn’t innovation—it’s a power grab, cloaked as financial stability. The pace of global CBDC development remains striking. In May 2020, only 35 countries were exploring CBDCs. By early 2025, that number had ballooned to 134 before the US exit, with 65 in advanced stages—development, pilot, or launch. Every G20 country except the US is now involved, with 19 in advanced stages and 13 running pilots, including Brazil, Japan, India, Australia, Russia, and Turkey. Three countries—the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria—have fully launched retail CBDCs, and 44 pilots are ongoing worldwide. This momentum persists despite Trump’s ban, as other nations see CBDCs as a way to modernize payments, enhance financial inclusion, and compete geopolitically, especially with China’s digital yuan (e-CNY) pilot, the largest globally, reaching 260 million people. Recent developments underscore this acceleration. In Israel, the Bank of Israel released a 110-page design document in early March 2025, detailing plans for a Digital Shekel. This follows years of research and aligns with Israel’s participation in a 2022 project with the Bank for International Settlements to test international retail and remittance payments using CBDCs. The Digital Shekel aims to improve transaction efficiency and financial access across its tech-savvy population, marking a significant step toward implementation. In the European Union, the European Central Bank (ECB) is pressing forward with its digital euro, targeting a rollout by October 2025. ECB President Christine Lagarde has been vocal about this timeline, stating in a recent address, “We are on track to introduce the digital euro by October this year, offering a secure and programmable complement to cash that ensures financial inclusion while maintaining privacy standards.” This follows the ECB’s October 2023 decision to enter the preparation phase for a digital retail euro, with a focus on both retail and wholesale applications. The EU’s push reflects a broader European trend, with countries like Sweden and the UK also advancing CBDC pilots, aiming to reduce reliance on US-dominated payment networks like Visa and Mastercard. Across the Atlantic, Canada’s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, who assumed office in March 2025, brings a pro-CBDC stance to the table. Carney, a former Governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, has long advocated for digital currencies as a tool for financial innovation. During his tenure at the Bank of England, he oversaw early CBDC research, including the July 2019 CBDC Technology Forum, which laid the groundwork for the digital pound. Carney’s alignment with the World Economic Forum (WEF), where he has been a prominent figure pushing for sustainable finance and digital transformation, further underscores his support for CBDCs. The WEF has been a strong advocate for CBDCs, hosting roundtables through 2023 to promote interoperable designs. Under Carney’s leadership, Canada is likely to accelerate its CBDC efforts, building on the Bank of Canada’s 2023 analytical note emphasizing offline payment functionality—a move that could deepen digital control over Canadian finances. Despite Trump’s EO, the global CBDC train is charging ahead, with the US taking a detour through stablecoins that empower banks and the Fed while stifling privacy and DeFi. The Digital Shekel, the EU’s October rollout, and Canada’s new leadership under Carney show that the world isn’t waiting for the US to catch up—it’s forging a digital future where control, not freedom, may be the ultimate prize. The STABLE Act and GENIUS Act, introduced in early 2025, represent a significant pivot in US financial policy. Rather than directly pursuing a CBDC, these bills create a framework for privately issued digital dollars that would achieve the same surveillance and control objectives while appearing to maintain separation between government and the digital currency system. While President Trump’s Executive Order 14178 explicitly banned the Federal Reserve from developing a CBDC, his administration has simultaneously championed these stablecoin bills. This isn’t a contradiction—it’s a calculated strategy to implement the same control mechanisms through different channels. Under both bills, if you bought a stablecoin through an exchange like Coinbase, your transaction would be: 1) tied to your verified identity, 2) reported to the Treasury Department’s FinCEN database, 3) subject to freezing if flagged by surveillance algorithms, and 4) potentially programmable to restrict certain purchases. This mirrors the control mechanisms of a CBDC but through private intermediaries. The distinction between the bills is largely one of scope and timing. The STABLE Act, sponsored by Representatives French Hill (R-AR) and Bryan Steil (R-WI), takes a more comprehensive approach, covering all stablecoins and giving the Federal Reserve primary authority. The GENIUS Act, introduced by Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), focuses specifically on payment stablecoins and preserves some role for state regulators. What neither bill does is protect financial privacy or enable true peer-to-peer transactions. Both require strict Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, ensuring every digital dollar is tied to a verified identity. Both mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, guaranteeing ongoing surveillance of transactions. And neither contains provisions preventing the implementation of programmable restrictions on how these digital dollars can be used. These bills would fundamentally transform existing stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC): Tether (USDT), currently the largest stablecoin with a $140 billion market cap as of early 2025, would face significant challenges under both bills. Based outside the US in the British Virgin Islands, Tether would likely be forced to either register as a US entity (bringing it under direct regulatory control) or potentially lose access to the US market altogether under the STABLE Act. The GENIUS Act might allow continued operation with strict compliance requirements. USD Coin (USDC), the second-largest stablecoin ($25 billion market cap), is better positioned for compliance given its US-based issuer, Circle, and its backing from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. However, even USDC would face enhanced surveillance requirements, likely resulting in more transaction reporting and potential restrictions on transfers to non-KYC addresses. The likely outcome is a stablecoin ecosystem dominated by large financial institutions—the same banks that own the Federal Reserve—with comprehensive tracking of all transactions and programmable controls available to government agencies. The GENIUS Act is more likely to pass, given its bipartisan Senate support and alignment with the Trump administration’s priorities. With backing from influential figures like David Sacks (Trump’s Crypto/AI Czar) and Howard Lutnick (Commerce Secretary), the bill has momentum for passage before April 2025—well within Trump’s first 100 days. The Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the bill (18-6) on March 13, 2025. While proponents frame these bills as innovative alternatives to CBDCs, the reality is they implement the same surveillance capabilities through private intermediaries. In some ways, this approach could be even more dangerous than a direct CBDC, as it creates the illusion of market-driven money while embedding government control mechanisms throughout the system. Understanding these bills reveals why Trump’s Executive Order banning CBDCs while promoting stablecoins isn’t the victory for financial freedom it appears to be. The same surveillance infrastructure is being built—just with different logos on the digital dollars controlling your financial life. At first glance, the STABLE and GENIUS Acts appear to simply regulate stablecoins. But in reality, they are part of a coordinated effort to centralize financial control under a permissioned, government-approved digital system. This system is designed to: This isn’t just speculation. The foundation for this system is already being built: Together, these initiatives lay the groundwork for a fully digitized, permissioned economy where financial freedom is an illusion. Stablecoins, far from being an alternative to CBDCs, are simply the stepping stones to the exact same outcome—one where every transaction is monitored, every asset is controlled, and dissent can be silenced with a keystroke. This is no different from past government moves to strip financial autonomy from the people. In 1933, Executive Order 6102 made it illegal for Americans to own gold, forcing citizens to turn in their gold in exchange for rapidly devaluing paper money. Today, stablecoins serve the same purpose: they lure users into digital systems that the government and banks can easily control—until the day they decide to seize or restrict access to funds, just like they did with gold. The history of government intervention in money should serve as a stark warning: whatever financial tool the state encourages is likely designed for its benefit, not yours. Government financial control is not just a historical pattern—it is happening in real time. The same tactics used to demonetize gold in 1933 and remove cash from circulation today are being deployed through digital assets. The following case studies prove that stablecoins are already being used as tools for financial censorship—demonstrating exactly why privacy-preserving alternatives are necessary. Stablecoins are often marketed as a decentralized, private alternative to fiat currency—but real-world examples prove that they are not censorship-resistant and can be frozen at any time by issuers or regulators. In August 2022, the US Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, a privacy protocol used on the Ethereum blockchain. This led to immediate censorship by stablecoin issuers: This demonstrated that stablecoins are not censorship-resistant and can be weaponized just as easily as bank accounts. When FTX imploded in late 2022, authorities quickly pressured stablecoin issuers to freeze assets tied to the platform. This proves that stablecoins are not self-sovereign money—they are corporate-controlled assets that can be frozen, blacklisted, or seized at any moment. Trump’s executive order sounds like a win for liberty. It bans the Fed from creating or promoting a new CBDC, citing risks to privacy and financial stability. It even revokes Obama-era plans for digital dollar experiments. But dig deeper, and it’s not so simple. The order doesn’t touch the Fed’s existing digital system—because it’s not seen as a “new” CBDC. So, the control we already have stays intact. Worse, the order cheers on “dollar-backed stablecoins” like Tether and USDC, private digital currencies pegged to the dollar, as a means to maintain global financial dominance. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a vocal advocate for Trump’s tech-driven agenda, has been clear about the administration’s enthusiasm. At the White House Digital Assets Summit, he stated, “Technology is at the foundation of the Trump presidency. He understands technology, he embraces technology, and he’s going to use technology to drive America forward.” Specifically on stablecoins, Lutnick added, “The blockchain and Bitcoin technology are a key part of that thinking and embracing that.” The message is unmistakable: stablecoins are a strategic tool to extend the dollar’s global reach, but they come with significant risks to privacy and autonomy. David Sacks, Trump’s Crypto/AI Czar and chair of the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, is overseeing this regulatory push. While he hasn’t directly commented on these bills, his focus on balancing innovation with oversight suggests support for a controlled stablecoin ecosystem. Sacks’ role implies a stance like, “We’ll foster stablecoins, but only under strict rules.” Both bills mandate stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, meaning every transaction is tracked and monitored. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a Wall Street veteran, reinforces this approach. Though Bessent has been reserved in public statements, his alignment with financial stability suggests he’d back these measures, likely echoing the administration’s line: “Stablecoins must be secure and compliant to protect the dollar’s global standing.” The administration’s support is unequivocal. Lutnick has emphasized the strategic importance of stablecoins, stating, “We’re going to use digital assets to pound forward, and Donald Trump is leading the way.” He’s also targeted offshore issuers like Tether, noting, “America will set the standards, and the world will follow.” The GENIUS Act reflects this by allowing offshore stablecoins to operate in the US only if they comply with American regulations, while the STABLE Act takes a harder line, likely restricting their use entirely. This isn’t just about competition—it’s about control. Here’s the rub: Tether and USDC aren’t saints. Tether’s reserves are murky—some say it’s not fully backed by dollars, just a mix of assets. USDC is clearer, but it’s still Circle’s word, not the Fed’s guarantee. If these become our digital money, we’re trading central bank control for corporate control—or both, if banks and the Fed team up. The Fed, after all, is owned by its member banks—think JPMorgan Chase and Citibank—blurring the line between public and private power. Whether it’s Fed Chair Jerome Powell or JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon issuing a digital dollar, the result is the same: pervasive tracking and control. The STABLE and GENIUS Acts amplify this risk by enforcing KYC/AML compliance, effectively killing algorithmic stablecoins, and stifling decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that thrive on anonymity. Innovation is curtailed, as only bank-approved stablecoins can flourish. The order’s push for “open access” to blockchain sounds promising, but stablecoins can freeze funds just as easily. In 2022, USDC blacklisted wallets tied to sanctions. Programmable? Check. Censorable? Check. It’s the same beast, a different logo. My article flagged CBDCs as tools for “technocratic control”—tracking us, nudging behavior with coded rules. Stablecoins do that already, and Trump’s order, backed by these bills, could supercharge them. The Fed’s digital reserves are at least predictable; private stablecoins add a wild card. If they dominate, we’re not dodging tyranny—we’re outsourcing it to corporate interests under the guise of innovation. The Trump administration’s embrace of stablecoins as a key element of its financial strategy, formalized in Executive Order 14178 (signed January 23, 2025), leverages the expertise of figures tied to USDC and Tether, marking a stark contrast to the Biden administration’s less decisive approach. Unlike Biden’s team, which struggled to advance coherent stablecoin regulation despite years of discussion, Trump’s administration draws on a network of current and former officials with deep fintech experience, capable of shaping and executing a robust stablecoin framework. Both USDC and Tether, dominant stablecoins with billions in circulation, have established operational ties to this administration, equipping it with the technical and financial know-how to integrate these assets into broader economic policy, far beyond what Biden’s tenure achieved. David Sacks, appointed as Trump’s Crypto/AI Czar and chair of the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, has ties to USD Coin (USDC) through its issuer, Circle Internet Financial. A former PayPal executive, Sacks shares a history with Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire as part of the “PayPal Mafia,” a network of early PayPal leaders who have shaped fintech. Sacks served as PayPal’s COO until 2002, while Allaire joined briefly via the 2000 X.com merger, though no direct collaboration between them is documented. Circle’s $1 million USDC donation to Trump’s Inauguration Committee on January 9, 2025, aligns with this network, with Allaire stating, “We are excited to be building a great American company, and the fact that the Committee took payment in USDC is an indicator of…the potential and power of digital dollars.” Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s Treasury Secretary from 2017 to 2021, deepens the USDC connection through his extensive ties to Goldman Sachs and fintech networks. Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs, leaving in 2002 as a partner and executive, years before the firm invested $50 million in Circle in 2018 and additional funds in 2022. While he had no direct role in those investments, Goldman’s backing of Circle—confirmed by Circle’s Series E funding announcement—links Mnuchin’s Wall Street orbit to USDC’s growth. Circle’s other major investor, BlackRock, contributed $8 million in April 2022 and manages a portion of USDC’s reserves, further tying the stablecoin to Trump’s financial sphere, where BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has served as an informal advisor since the 2024 election. Mnuchin’s ties to USDC extend through his collaboration with Brian Brooks at OneWest Bank, where Mnuchin was chairman and Brooks served as chairman from 2014 to 2015, per corporate records. Brooks later became Coinbase’s chief legal officer from 2018 to 2020, during which he worked with Circle on USDC’s development as co-founder of the Centre Consortium, which managed the stablecoin until its dissolution in 2023. Brooks’ advocacy for private-sector digital currencies—articulated in a July 2020 Yahoo Finance article where he argued the private sector should lead US digital dollar efforts—directly supported USDC’s rise. Appointed Acting Comptroller of the Currency under Mnuchin in May 2020, Brooks issued guidance (e.g., OCC Interpretive Letter 1174) allowing national banks to hold stablecoin reserves, a move that benefited Circle’s operations. This interplay between Mnuchin’s Treasury tenure, his prior Goldman Sachs network, and Brooks’ regulatory actions illustrates a revolving door between government and fintech that bolstered USDC. Lutnick’s ties to Tether are even more direct and controversial. Cantor Fitzgerald, under Lutnick’s leadership, has been Tether’s primary US banking partner since 2021, managing billions in US Treasury bills that allegedly back USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin with a $140 billion market cap as of early 2025. Cantor earns tens of millions annually in fees for this role and, according to a November 2024 Wall Street Journal report, acquired a 5% stake in Tether for $600 million last year. Lutnick’s firm also agreed to collaborate with Tether on a $2 billion Bitcoin-backed lending program, announced in November 2024, further entwining their interests. His vocal defense of Tether—claiming at the 2024 World Economic Forum, “From what we’ve seen…they have the money they say they have”—has drawn scrutiny, especially given Tether’s history of opacity. Investigative journalist Whitney Webb and YouTuber Coffeezilla have raised questions about Tether’s solvency and financial transparency. Webb, in her 2022 book One Nation Under Blackmail, critiques Tether’s opaque reserve practices, while Coffeezilla, in his 2023 video “Tether: The Stablecoin Scandal,” highlights its reliance on attestations rather than independent audits. He points to Tether’s reserves including non-Treasury assets like gold and Bitcoin, as well as loans to third parties, raising doubts about its ability to maintain a 1:1 dollar peg under stress. Both note Tether’s partnership with Cantor Fitzgerald, which has managed its US Treasury holdings since 2021, though the firm’s role doesn’t fully resolve concerns about the stablecoin’s backing Lutnick’s influence extends beyond finance. Tether’s $775 million investment in Rumble, a conservative streaming platform, in December 2024—reportedly facilitated by Lutnick’s ties to the Trump camp—illustrates how stablecoin profits intersect with political agendas. Rumble, previously taken public by Lutnick’s associate and Trump ally Peter Thiel, benefits from Tether’s capital, further aligning crypto with Trump’s political network. The STABLE Act (House, February 6, 2025) and GENIUS Act (Senate, February 4, 2025) exacerbate this control, restricting stablecoin issuance to banks and Fed-aligned entities, with KYC/AML mandates ensuring pervasive tracking. This benefits Circle and Tether, whose investors—like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock for Circle, and Cantor Fitzgerald for Tether—profit while the Fed extends its influence. DeFi platforms are sidelined, as Lutnick pushes the agenda: “We’re going to use digital assets to pound forward, and Donald Trump is leading the way.” The ties to USDC and Tether—from Sacks, Lutnick, Mnuchin, and Brooks—illustrate a pattern of cronyism. These stablecoins, already used for surveillance and censorship, enable the same control a CBDC would, but under a private label, cloaking digital tyranny in innovation while consolidating power for banks and the Fed at the public’s expense. Fiat currencies are not designed to last. Their very structure—money created from debt, backed by trust rather than tangible assets—ensures an eventual collapse. Governments exploit fiat to expand their power, printing limitless money to fund wars, social programs, and bailouts, all while devaluing the savings of everyday citizens. This isn’t speculation; it’s historical fact. Across centuries, fiat systems have crumbled under their own weight. Whether through hyperinflation, political mismanagement, or shifts in global influence, fiat currencies inevitably deteriorate. The only question is how long before the breaking point is reached. The US dollar, despite its dominance, is following the same trajectory. The following table outlines the recurring patterns of fiat currency collapse, offering a roadmap for what awaits the dollar: While the dollar remains the world’s reserve currency, its long-term survival is far from guaranteed. The same forces that have toppled past fiat systems—debt expansion, declining trust, and technological disruption—are accelerating. Below is a snapshot of the dollar’s mounting vulnerabilities: The US government and financial institutions are building a system where transactions can be monitored and controlled, using tools like stablecoins and digital IDs. Privacy coins offer a way out. Monero (XMR), Zano (ZANO), and Kaurma aren’t just for extreme cases—they’re for anyone who values financial independence. Without them, every payment and asset risks being tracked or restricted. “Privacy isn’t a luxury—it’s a tool for self-reliance.” Using these coins means choosing economic freedom in a world leaning toward centralized control. Financial surveillance is advancing, even without central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Stablecoins, backed by laws like the STABLE Act and GENIUS Act, require identity tracking. Decades-old rules—like the Bank Secrecy Act and Patriot Act—already monitor transactions, while the Treasury flags small payments like $600. This isn’t hypothetical—it’s active policy. Privacy coins provide an alternative to a system where money is permission-based. Reforming this from within isn’t an option. State-linked money—be it CBDCs, stablecoins, or bank deposits—comes with oversight. True sovereignty lies in decentralized, private systems: These aren’t theories—they’re working solutions for trading and storing value without interference. That’s why they’re under pressure from regulators. Cash is increasingly suspect. Stablecoins can be frozen instantly. Privacy coins like Monero and Zano face scrutiny—not for flaws, but for restoring confidentiality lost to modern finance. The choice is clear: full surveillance or real autonomy. In a world where money shapes power, this is about practical survival. Picture your accounts locked—not for fraud, but for a flagged donation. Your stablecoins are useless, cards declined. Only the Monero or Zano you secured earlier remains. This has happened globally—thousands have lost access overnight. As surveillance tightens, exiting gets harder. Act while the path is open. The stakes are real, and the time is now.

(Bloomberg) -- Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab Corp. are prohibiting clients from investing in money-market ETFs on their trading platforms, an unusual move for the financial powerhouses who typically permit easy access to funds that already trade on an exchange. The two firms are blocking purchases of three exchange-traded funds offered by BlackRock Inc. and Texas Capital, the first to track money—market securities such as Treasury bills and other government-backed debt in an ETF structure. The new funds serve as a direct challenge to mutual-fund providers, who have long been big, established players in money-market products. Fidelity and Schwab alone manage trillions of dollars in money-market assets, and just last week, Schwab filed plans to launch its own government money-market ETF. A Schwab spokesperson said its decision is consistent with the firm’s “long-standing approach” of only making available Schwab affiliate money-market mutual funds, while a Fidelity spokesperson said this is an extension of the company’s policy to “generally restrict” third-party money-market mutual funds. Yet, the move stands out because trading platforms like Schwab and Fidelity typically don’t restrict exchange-traded funds, even if those funds are in competition with existing in-house offerings. “I’ve never seen this with any other ETFs,” said Mike Younkman, CIO at Ankerstar Wealth, a firm with roughly $110 million in assets under management, who had been investing in Texas Capital’s MMKT for his advisory clients, and was “disappointed that earlier this year, it went into a sell-only mode with Schwab, likely because they’re having a competitor product.” Younkman’s firm sold out of his MMKT position due to the platform ban, and instead shifted client assets back into the short-term bond ETF he held before money-market ETFs began trading. He said the move caused some operational headaches but shouldn’t ultimately weigh on investor returns. The restriction underscores how the growth of the ETF and race to put even more novel strategies into the fund is creating more competition throughout the asset management world and introducing wrinkles for issuers seeking to distribute funds. Under the banner of democratizing access to strategies through the tax-efficient vehicle, ETF issuers have managed to list their offerings with relative ease on both Fidelity and Schwab, which are two of the largest brokerage firms in the US. The ease of listing is changing, though, as ETFs grow. Last year, Fidelity imposed new fees on some ETF firms, in return for listing and maintaining the products on its massive platform. The latest move has taken some investors by surprise. “It was pretty shocking to have them come out and say you can’t buy this anymore,” said Jeremy Ingram, CEO and CIO at Beacon Harbor Wealth Advisors, who had invested in MMKT for his advisory clients. “It’s not like some exotic investment — it’s a money market.” Texas Capital in a statement said “it is unfortunate and surprising that Schwab and Fidelity would restrict their clients’ ability to purchase MMKT,” adding the fund “remains an important tool for investors to manage their cash, one we believe should be available in the same way that investors can purchase any NYSE-listed security.” A BlackRock spokesperson noted that the firm’s iShares money-market ETFs “unlock access to professional grade cash management strategies in the convenience of the ETF wrapper, providing additional choice and flexibility for investors.” Investors have flocked to money markets over the last several years, in large part due to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate-hiking cycle that sent short-term rates above 5%. While the US central bank has begun to ease monetary policy, these rates are still high enough to keep pulling cash toward money-market funds, which saw their assets rise to an all-time high of more than $7 trillion recently. Fidelity has roughly $1.5 trillion in registered money-market fund assets under management, while Schwab is home to about $650 billion. Texas Capital’s fund was the first ETF to follow the so-called Rule 2a-7 — a provision of a 1940s Securities and Exchange Commission law that governs money-market funds. In February, BlackRock followed up by launching its Government Money Market ETF and Prime Money Market ETF. The ETFs aren’t required to maintain a stable net asset value of $1, meaning investors can be exposed to some downside risk. Texas Capital’s fund has seen relatively little inflows this year, after pulling in about $40 million last year. BlackRock’s prime money-market fund has taken in roughly $43 million in inflows since launching in February. Its government offering has taken in a net $8 million.

Title: Is The AI Boom Headed For Its ‘Dark Fiber’ Moment?

ByDan Runkevicius ByDan Runkevicius , Senior Contributor. LAS VEGAS, USA - JANUARY 06: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addresses participants at the keynote of CES ... More 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 6, 2025. During the presentation, Huang unveiled a range of new chips, software, and services, reinforcing Nvidia's leadership in artificial intelligence computing and its continued innovation across industries. (Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The late ’90s internet gold rush wasn’t just one giant bubble of flashy startups; it was an intertwined cluster of smaller bubbles that fed off each other. The poster children of the dot-com bust were household names like Pets.com and eToys.com — early e-commerce pioneers. Beneath them were telecoms that burned through hundreds of billions to provide internet access. But peel back another layer, and you’ll find a little-known frenzy that fizzled a few years after the dot-com crash — fiber optic companies that promised to build the rails for telecoms. Fiber optic cables weren’t a new invention in the 1990s. They’ve been around since the 1970s, but earlier-generation fiber could transmit only a fraction of the bandwidth they can today. The breakthrough was a technology called Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), which allowed multiple wavelengths — or data streams — to travel through a single fiber instead of just one. That dramatically increased the bandwidth and cost-efficiency of fiber optic infrastructure. Ciena was the first company to commercially deploy WDM. In 1996, it landed a massive $200 million contract with Sprint — then America’s third-largest carrier — to upgrade its fiber network to carry 16 wavelengths instead of one. Kevin Kimberlin, co-founder of Ciena, called it “the real dawn of the internet.” The advances in fiber optics marked a turning point, convincing investors the internet was real — and that its applications could scale far faster than previously imagined. After Ciena’s IPO in 1997, the stock surged 10x in a few years on projections pointing to an explosion in internet bandwidth. At the time, Forbes reported, “the total bandwidth of communications systems will triple every year for the next 25 years.” Meanwhile, fiber optics conferences — once-niche engineering gatherings — became must-attend events for the tech world. In the lead-up to the dot-com bust, attendance at the Optical Fiber Communications (OFC) conference — the world’s largest optics event — grew more than fivefold in just a few years. Excitement over WDM’s potential helped usher in a massive infrastructure boom in the late '90s. In the five years following the Telecommunications Act of 1996, telecoms poured over $500 billion — mostly financed with debt — into laying fiber optic cables, adding switches, and building wireless networks. Not only was most of that spending debt-financed, it was also frontloaded, meaning demand hadn’t caught up yet. After the dot-com bust, dreams of internet bandwidth tripling every few months quickly unraveled, exposing massive overinvestment in fiber. As demand for fiber collapsed, so did the companies that built it. Many fiber firms went bankrupt. Those that survived shed nearly all their pre-dot-com value. Corning — then the world’s largest producer of optical fiber — saw its stock crash from nearly $100 in 2000 to around $1 by 2002. Meanwhile, Ciena’s revenue fell from $1.6 billion to $300 million almost overnight, and its stock plunged 98% from its peak. Both companies are still around today. Although not a household name, Ciena’s fiber optics hardware and software remain one of the main building blocks powering the modern internet. But even two decades later, its value hasn’t come close to its dot-com peak. The crash also left behind a glut of unused fiber that was later dubbed “dark fiber.” By various estimates, 85% to 95% of fiber laid in the '90s remained unused after the bubble burst. The dot-com bubble burst, dragging down companies like Ciena, not because the internet was a fad. The internet did change the world. It just didn’t happen as fast as its early pioneers promised it would. Fast forward 25 years, another multi-hundred-billion-dollar infrastructure boom is underway — this time to power AI, a technology once again promised to change the world for good. Over the past year, Big Tech has gone full throttle on capital expenditures (capex) — much of it aimed at building massive data centers packed with specialized AI chips known as “AI accelerators.” America’s hyperscalers — Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft — have pledged to spend a record $320 billion on capex this year alone, a massive 40% jump from last year’s record-setting $230 billion. For perspective, that’s roughly two-thirds of all inflation-adjusted capital spent on telecom fiber optics during the entire 1990s — over a single year and driven by just four companies. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg threw down his own marker this year. On the company’s most recent earnings call, he unveiled plans for Meta’s largest AI data center yet the size of Manhattan. “I announced last week that we expect to bring online almost 1GW of capacity this year, and we're building a 2GW — and potentially bigger — AI data center so large it could cover a significant part of Manhattan,” he said. But it’s not just the hyperscalers racing to build AI factories. The Stargate Project — a $500 billion initiative first proposed during the Trump administration and now backed by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX — aims to develop a nationwide network of AI data centers and energy facilities. Then there’s the United Arab Emirates with a recently unveiled plan to invest $1.4 trillion in U.S. AI infrastructure in partnership with BlackRock, Nvidia, and Microsoft. At the core of all this multi-trillion-dollar spending is one single goal: build as many AI-ready data centers as possible before the competition beats you to it. As Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during his 2025 GTC keynote, hand-coded software running on general-purpose CPUs is giving way to machine learning models powered by data centers filled with GPUs and AI accelerators — or as Huang calls them, “AI factories.” This paradigm shift, according to Huang and many experts, will demand orders of magnitude more computing power. But just like in the 1990s — when no one could accurately predict how fast the internet would grow — no one really knows how fast AI will be adopted. And much like the fiber buildout of that era, today’s multi-trillion-dollar AI spending is FOMO-driven and frontloaded on the assumption that AI’s exponential growth curve will hold. Even Big Tech execs admit as much. No line captures this “blank check” AI spending better than Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s remark during Alphabet’s earnings call last August: “When you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting.” Nvidia isn’t the only company developing AI-specific hardware and software, but it’s by far the biggest — thanks to its near-impenetrable moat in GPUs and AI accelerators. By various estimates, including from Mizuho Securities, Nvidia holds between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market. That dominance is reflected in Nvidia’s market cap. Since the release of ChatGPT — when the world suddenly realized AI is real — Nvidia’s value has ballooned from $400 billion to $2.8 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world. But this isn’t just about hype. Nvidia’s sales exploded from $27 billion in 2022 to $130 billion in 2024, while profits rose from $9.8 billion to $72.9 billion over the same period. At the 2025 GTC event, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Nvidia shipped 1.3 million Hopper GPUs during peak sales to top cloud providers — AWS, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle. For comparison, Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell chips already hit 3.6 million units in their first year. And just like Hopper, Blackwell is already sold out until October, according to the company’s Q3 2024 earnings. Wall Street doesn’t expect the sales to stop here. Nvidia’s current valuation is pricing in 56.7% revenue growth this year, pushing projected sales to just over $200 billion. In 2026, Wall Street analysts expect another $50 billion on top of that. That’s a lot of chips to sell, but Huang says we haven’t even hit peak data center spending yet. According to Dell’Oro Group — a market research firm Huang cited at GTC 2025 — annual data center capex could top $1 trillion within five years, largely driven by U.S. hyperscalers. “We project that data center infrastructure spending could surpass $1 trillion annually within five years. While AI spending has yet to meet desired returns and efficiency improvements, long-term growth remains assured, driven by hyperscalers’ multi-year capex cycles and government initiatives such as the $500 billion Stargate Project,” said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell’Oro Group. Why do we need so much computing power, considering AI — like any technology — should become more efficient over time? After all, 400 million people use ChatGPT, and it works just fine on legacy data centers. It’s because AI is getting smarter. We’ve entered what Huang calls the “agentic AI” era — where models reason, plan, verify results, and solve problems step by step. That means burning through way more tokens. To illustrate, Huang showed two models solving the same task: creating a wedding seating arrangement for 300 guests, factoring in tradition, photogenic angles, and family tensions. A traditional LLM (Llama 3 in this case) solved it in under 500 tokens but missed key social dynamics. DeepSeek’s R1, a Chinese “budget” reasoning model, nailed the task after a multi-step analysis but used 8,859 tokens. “Now we have AIs that can reason step by step by step using a technology called chain of thought, best of end, consistency checking, a variety of different path planning, a variety of different techniques, we now have AI’s that can reason,” Huang said. Ironically, it was DeepSeek R1 that sowed fears AI might require less compute, but Huang believe those fears were overblown. “Last year, this is where almost the entire world got it wrong,” Huang said, referring to the DeepSeek scare. He argued that AI now requires 100 times more compute than it did a year ago, largely due to reasoning models like DeepSeek R1. “The computation requirement, the scaling law of AI is more resilient and, in fact, hyperaccelerated. The amount of computation we need at this point as a result of agentic AI, as a result of reasoning, is easily a hundred times more than we thought we needed this time last year.” Some industry insiders go as far as saying AI is moving so fast it might break Moore’s Law. “The amount of compute AI needs is doubling every three months,” said Nick Harris, CEO of Lightmatter, a $4.4 billion chipmaker. “That’s far faster than Moore’s Law. It’s going to break companies and economies.” Ross Sandler, who leads internet sector research at Barclays, thinks current capex spending may fall short of what compute-hungry models will need. “Consensus estimates currently call for a little over $300 billion in total capex for these hyperscalers, about $100 billion of which is going into the AI semiconductor portion of that capex… that’s probably not enough to satisfy the overall compute required.” Sandler’s team projects AI workloads could quadruple between 2025 and 2028. By then, inference — or AI reasoning — might make up more than half of all industry compute. There’s just one catch: that projection assumes AI models will continue burning through tokens like they do today. On January 20, a then-obscure Chinese AI company released DeepSeek R1 — an open-source AI model that could reason on par with what was previously considered incomparable to OpenAI’s models. National news spun it as a Sputnik moment for America — a global superpower beating the U.S. in the next frontier of technology — but Wall Street got spooked by something else. In the released paper, DeepSeek showed how it trained models at a fraction of OpenAI’s costs — and using old-generation chips at that. That was a wake-up call that the economics of AI training might be overblown. What followed was what Wall Street dubbed AI’s “Black Monday” — a $600 billion sell-off in Nvidia, marking the biggest single-day crash for a U.S. company in history. At the core of the DeepSeek scare are reasoning AI models — the kind Nvidia spotlighted at the last GTC conference. Although they use more tokens, as Huang noted, these models are often much easier to train. What DeepSeek showed is that AI models like R1 don’t rely on brute-force scale. Instead, they learn how to think and know where to look for data rather than memorizing everything. That can drastically reduce the cost of AI training. “The idea of spending $10 billion on a pre-training run on the next base model, to achieve very little incremental performance, would likely change,” Sandler’s Barclays analysts wrote in a recent note. Not only that, new AI models are becoming more efficient. Gil Luria, Davidson’s head of technology research, told me that DeepSeek — while handling up to one-third of OpenAI’s queries — can squeeze much more out of older-generation Nvidia chips. “On the final day of releases, DeepSeek disclosed that its inference stack, running on just 2,224 H800s, is serving 608B tokens per day, ~1/3 of what OpenAI is doing, but on a small fraction of the infrastructure. The number of tokens they are able to squeeze out of each H800 is roughly an order-of-magnitude improvement over leading open-source models running on H100s, and it highlights this emerging reality that algorithmic/architecture-level optimizations are now an equally critical frontier of development,” his analysts wrote in a note. These efficiencies, while good for the advancement of AI technology and its adoption, aren’t what chipmakers like Nvidia want to see because a lot of its growth is banking on continuous investment in capex by major tech players. UBS estimates that nearly all of Nvidia’s data center revenue growth this year and next is tied to hyperscaler capex spending. Then there’s the question of ROI because the economics of AI still don’t quite add up. Even OpenAI isn’t breaking even on compute costs, according to CEO Sam Altman, despite charging $200 a month for its pro-tier plan. By Luria’s estimates, America’s largest software companies — including OpenAI, Salesforce and Adobe — have only generated $10–20 billion in revenue from their AI products this year. “The reality is that the revenue from selling actual AI products to a customer is still minuscule compared to the magnitude of the capex invested… We have invested almost half a trillion dollars and are still only getting around $10–20 billion of actual product sales off of that investment,” Luria told me. Meanwhile, MIT Institute Professor and Nobel Laureate Daron Acemoglu predicts that AI will add just 1% to GDP growth and affect only 5% of jobs in the U.S. over the next 10 years. He’s not saying the technology lacks potential. In fact, he thinks it can replace 20% of jobs in the U.S. workforce — assuming replacement costs are excluded. But once you factor in those costs, only 5% of tasks can be profitably automated in the next decade. Not only that, he notes that those profitably replaceable tasks are mostly concentrated in small and mid-sized businesses — not in Big Tech plowing hundreds of billions into AI. Nobody doubts AI will change the world. The real question isn’t whether it’s a fad, but whether it can grow fast enough to close the gigantic mismatch between capex spending and revenue. After all, the poster children of the dot-com crash weren’t wrong. We do buy pet food and toys online — and much more. They were just too early. Chipmakers powering AI aren’t fiber-optic companies, and the AI revolution isn’t the internet revolution. As Mark Twain said, history doesn’t repeat itself; it rhymes. But the semantics that have driven both spending sprees bear a striking resemblance.

Title: Best Presales to Buy as BlackRock’s Ethereum Holdings Cross Record $1B

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum is currently in a major support zone. It’s trading around the $2K level, which happens to be the bottom of a prominent trendline. If the scenario repeats this time around, we can expect $ETH to reach $3.5K in the next few weeks. In addition to the upward trendline, $ETH currently happens to be between its strongest support and resistance zones – highlighted in the image by the blue rectangle. Read on as we’ll discuss which institutional investors see this as a ripe opportunity to add $ETH to their portfolios and how you can match their ROI by buying the best presales. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) added $155M in $ETH investments over the last week, taking its total $ETH holdings to more than $1.145B. Although BUIDL has a diversified portfolio across various chains, such as Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Aptos, Ethereum is still one of its major bets in this dicey crypto market. This vote of confidence from institutional investors is surely a positive sign for $ETH in the long term. Speaking of the long haul, our detailed $ETH price prediction for 2025 laid out why the token can reach $6K before the end of the year. Although investing directly into $ETH is the simplest way to capitalize on the crypto’s upcoming bull run, it’s not necessarily the very best. The best cryptos on presale could be more profitable due to their current low capitalization. New cryptocurrency typically follows the larger crypto trend but can potentially make you more money than $ETH (or $BTC). If you don’t know which meme coins on presale to consider, here are our top three suggestions. After a long-drawn consolidation, $BTC is finally showing signs that it wants to rally higher. If you wish to make the most of $BTC’s growth, consider investing in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). It’s worth noting that even though $BTCBULL follows the coattails of $BTC, it’s based on the Ethereum blockchain thanks to the network’s large liquidity pool. By directly linking its $BTC giveaways to the actual King Crypto’s price, BTC Bull Token has ensured the price of its own token, $BTCBULL, will also keep rising. Another reason why BTC Bull Token can be the next crypto to explode is its token burn mechanism. Essentially, the developers will shave off a part of the total $BTCBULL supply every time $BTC’s price rises by $50K. With one token currently available for just $0.002425, $BTCBULL’s presale is ongoing and has raised over $4M. Here’s how to buy BTC Bull Token. Built to unleash the true potential of Solana, Solaxy ($SOLX) will be the first-ever Layer-2 solution on the memecoin-friendly blockchain. Solana has been battling with network congestion and scalability issues ever since its popularity among investors skyrocketed thanks to $TRUMP and no-code launchpad Pump.fun. Solaxy will reduce the burden on Solana by processing a sizable portion of the network’s total transactions on its sidechain. Additionally, Solaxy will jack up Solana’s affordability, seeing as it will process transactions in bulk and not one by one. Given that Solaxy could be one of the biggest catalysts behind Solana’s rise to new all-time highs, it could easily be among the top trending cryptos once it launches. The token is currently in presale, which is why it’s available for just $0.001672. Speaking of Solaxy’s presale, it’s comfortably one of the hottest new cryptos on the market right now – over $27.7M in funding is nothing to sniff at, after all. For more info on Solaxy’s purchase process, check out our detailed guide on how to buy Solaxy. Lightchain AI is a fantastic crypto project built on Ethereum, which is why it enjoys industry-leading efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, like $BTCBULL and $SOLX, $LCAI, is currently in presale – where it has already amassed a whopping $18M in funding. What’s so special about $LCAI, you ask? Well, it’s a much anticipated AI-crypto partnership. For those unaware, investments in AI+crypto projects (as well as AI agent coins) have skyrocketed in recent times thanks to this niche’s unprecedented potential. Lightchain AI, for example, plans to combine AI and blockchain technologies to build more user-friendly and secure blockchain networks. Furthermore, its whitepaper suggests that it’ll reward users who make meaningful contributions to AI development while keeping the network’s security intact. If you wish to benefit from $LCAI’s growth, consider becoming an early investor in the project. As mentioned earlier, the token is currently in presale, where it’s available for a low price of $0.007125. $ETH will be right alongside $BTC when the next crypto rally gains steam. Although the above-mentioned tokens could make you a lot of money, don’t dive into crypto headfirst. Always have strong risk management in place. This means investing only a sensible portion of your total net worth and taking crypto’s volatility into account. Last but not least, you must always do your own research before investing.

Title: ONDO forms ‘strong low’ at $0.58 – Mapping its road to $1.20

ONDO’s price action signals a potential trend reversal as it forms a higher low. Backed by strong fundamentals and strategic partnerships, its market sentiment suggests… The Ondo [ONDO] daily chart indicates a potential higher low forming around the $0.6500 level, a key accumulation zone. After rallying to a peak near $1.4000 in late 2024, ONDO underwent a correction, falling to $0.83216, at press time. A crypto analyst highlights a “Strong Low” at $0.5800, with the price now testing support between $0.6500 and $0.83216. Source: x The formation of a higher low indicates weakening selling pressure and suggests a potential trend reversal. If ONDO surpasses the $0.9500 resistance level, bullish momentum could propel its price toward $1.20. This pattern mirrors ONDO’s previous rebounds from accumulation zones, further supporting its potential for upward movement if market sentiment strengthens. ONDO’s partnership with BlackRock to tokenize U.S. Treasury assets underscores its strength as a leading crypto project. Tokenization enables fractional ownership and improves liquidity, effectively bridging traditional finance and blockchain. BlackRock’s involvement adds significant credibility, drawing institutional interest and bolstering ONDO’s role in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. By offering on-chain access to stable, yield-generating assets, ONDO addresses the growing demand for DeFi solutions that integrate traditional financial instruments. Its regulatory compliance and institutional-grade infrastructure further enhance its appeal. As RWA adoption grows and DeFi evolves, the altcoin is well-positioned for sustainable long-term growth. ONDO’s Long/Short Ratio revealed balanced sentiment among investors. At the time of writing, the ratio stood at 0.90 on Binance, with perpetual contracts slightly higher at 1.00. The past week saw fluctuations between 0.70 and 1.15, reflecting market indecision as ONDO consolidates near its accumulation zone. Source: Coinglass A slight increase in long positions reflects cautious optimism, aligning with the higher low formation on the price chart. However, the lack of a clear directional bias indicates that traders are waiting for confirmation of a reversal before committing to significant positions. This mirrors the broader market’s consolidation phase, highlighting the importance of clear breakout signals for a decisive trend to emerge. Overall, ONDO’s price movement, strong fundamentals, and investor positioning suggest the project is at a critical juncture. The formation of a higher low points to a potential trend reversal, while its partnership with BlackRock reinforces its long-term viability. If ONDO maintains support and breaks resistance, it could gain renewed momentum, consistent with historical trends and broader market dynamics.

Title: Female executives are fighting back against alpha male CEOs

Good morning. Baby boomers' hopes for a comfortable retirement could be at risk if the stock market keeps falling. Financial experts shared key strategies with BI to help protect their savings. In today's big story, female executives are fed up with alpha male CEOs acting like "billionaire boys in the sandbox." Now, they're fighting back. What's on deck Markets: Faith-based investing is having a moment. (And we don't mean confidence.) Tech: Cybersecurity researchers are role-playing with ChatGPT. Business: The rich are taking to the skies for their commutes — Ubers be damned. But first, deprogramming the bro-code. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Lately, boardrooms are brimming with the bro-ish bravado you'd expect to find in a locker room. A buff Mark Zuckerberg wants Meta to celebrate a culture of "aggression." He also likes martial arts and butchering his own meat. 200 push-ups while wearing a weighted vest? No problem. Jeff Bezos (also now buff) laid down the hammer at The Washington Post, demanding editors give him a "hell yes" to affirm they're all in on "personal liberties and free markets." Let's not forget Elon Musk, who over the last several years, has been challenging anyone from Zuckerberg to Vladimir Putin to single combat. Not in the least surprised by all this chest-thumping: women in business. The return of the alpha male CEO has engendered a new opponent, BI's Amanda Hoover writes. Female executives are fed up with the "billionaire boys in the sandbox," as one sociologist put it — and instead of waiting to be let in, some are building their own arenas. Fabrik founder Jaclyn Pascocello told BI that she is seeing a collective of women coming together and starting to build companies to address issues sometimes ignored by men. When companies won't offer the flexibility that working parents need, it can embolden people to become more entrepreneurial and build under their own terms. "Oftentimes the easiest way to find that is to build it yourself," Pascocello said. Amanda spoke with female founders, psychologists, and sociologists about the resurgent machoism in corporate America — and how female executives are fighting back. 1. Praying for returns? Look no further than religious ETFs. Faith-based investments are a small part of the ETF world, but rising religious fervor and President Trump's leadership are driving interest. However, these funds can be picky about what to include. 2. President Trump could be making the same mistake as Biden. Trump's economic policies have some worried about a potential recession, and the stock market has taken a hit. With the 2026 midterms not far off, Trump risks political damage by continuing to ignore the elephant in the room. 3. Has bitcoin already peaked this year? Betting markets seem to think so. They expect the cryptocurrency to reach $110,000, barely above its record price. Wall Street bulls beg to differ. 1. Jensen made a joke, but who's laughing? At Nvidia's big AI conference, CEO Jensen Huang joked that new Blackwell GPUs would render the company's older chip models obsolete. Its cloud giant customers might not find that very funny, though, since it would cost them billions. 2. You can get ChatGPT to make password-stealing malware. Just play pretend. Researchers cracked some LLMs' security features to generate code that could breach Google's password manager. The key? Make the chatbot pretend to be a superhero. 3. A former Point72 exec's new data startup wants to level the playing field. Kirk McKeown's Carbon Arc allows small funds and businesses to purchase private data by the megabyte — sometimes for less than $1. The startup's goal is to make it more accessible for anyone looking to trade or feed AI models. 1. Out: Ubering. In: Blading. The wealthy are ditching hired cars for helicopter services like Blade, where a nine-minute ride from Manhattan to JFK airport starts at $95. When a rush-hour Uber in the city can cost more than $100, that sounds like a deal. 2. Law firms split over Trump's attack. Elias Law Group rebuked Trump's Friday memo that warned firms against "frivolous" suits against his administration. Marc Elias said in a statement on Saturday that there would be "no negotiation" about the clients his firm represents. Meanwhile, after Paul Weiss struck a deal with Trump on Friday, its chairman, Brad Karp, sent an email to staff addressing their unease over the decision. 3. Freebies for federal workers. DC businesses are offering perks like free workout classes and financial planning sessions to federal employees as they navigate the uncertainty around their jobs. BI heard from five businesses on why they're stepping up. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave). Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.
