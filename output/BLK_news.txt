As you may already know, late October 2008 was an extremely ugly time in the world of finance and money. Most famously, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, and the global economy was teetering into recession. Governments and central banks were scrambling to contain the cataclysm. On Oct. 31, 2008, the Bitcoin white paper came out — now 16 years ago to the day. “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party,” pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto famously stated in the opening sentence while sharing the groundbreaking Bitcoin white paper with a cryptography mailing list before linking the document entitled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” The document described the concept of the decentralized P2P cash, which Satoshi called Bitcoin (BTC). 16 years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin's Whitepaper and the rest is history. pic.twitter.com/ilprfjzikW On Thursday, the foremost crypto slid below the $71,000 mark, now trading 4% below the current all-time high of $73,737 it reached in March 2024. Still, Bitcoin’s current value is well above the fraction of a penny where it first started trading — and its ardent believers who invested early are insanely wealthy because of it. In the early days, mainstream media painted Bitcoin as just a tool for criminals to launder funds, sell drugs, and conduct other nefarious activities. However, that narrative has continued to evolve. Bitcoin is now increasingly being adopted around the world by nation-states such as El Salvador, which adopted BTC as a legal tender in September 2021. Wall Street titans, including BlackRock (the world’s largest asset manager) and its peers, have since launched easy-to-trade spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, which have brought in a flood of investment into the apex crypto. These ETFs recently smashed the 1 million BTC holdings milestone, further underscoring Bitcoin’s evolution from a niche digital asset to a major financial asset. The Wall Street stockpile has grown by $24 billion worth of inflows since the products went live in January while nibbling away at the heels of Bitcoin’s founding father. Perhaps the most confounding thing about Bitcoin is its creator. Satoshi Nakamoto vanished completely from the internet in 2011 after releasing Bitcoin’s founding white paper a decade ago on Halloween in 2008. The conspiracy theories and clues as to who Satoshi really is are endless. For instance, an HBO documentary recently claimed that the elusive crypto creator was early Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, who has since refuted the claims — and many crypto community members have also criticized the film. Now, a British-Asian macroeconomist named Stephen Mollah, claimed that he is Satoshi at a London event Thursday. One way that Mollah can prove he is indeed Satoshi is by moving the BTC from the Genesis block. However, he said today that he would do that later. “Genesis block Bitcoin cannot be moved as simply as you think,” Mollah told a BBC journalist in the audience. “It can be moved, but I need to prepare for it. I’ll do it. Very soon.” The identity of Bitcoin’s creator continues to be one of the greatest mysteries in modern finance. For some Bitcoiners, however, the world is better off not knowing who he, she, or they were or is.

Title: The Philosophy of Volatility

ERIC KIM Podcast A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “Would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance?” Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼For me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, with even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about microstrategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, there might be discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown can now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset. The reason why this is a big deal is for so long, bitcoin was considered fake money, and that a company could not add it to her balance sheet, proving proof of funds and reserves in the traditional sense. Now, all of these nerds who become accounting will have to learn all of these new rules, figuring out how to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets to accounting principles. The reason why this is such a big deal is that once again, people still think that bitcoin is fake money! Yet look at the Janet Yellen talk on Satoshi, and even look at Larry Fink, CEO of blackrock who owns over $10 trillion worth of assets, Larry Fink even now says that bitcoin is legitimate asset class, and I think that black rock has actually recently invested and bought a bunch more micro strategy stock. ￼Watch the CNBC interview with Larry Fink on Bitcoin. Oh and also, a pro tip; definitely get the $20 a month ChatGPT pro, it is now the ultimate financial investment research tool; when you want to search any financials or anything, this is an insanely big deal. ￼Anyways, once Harvard Yale and Ivy League schools start to purchase bitcoin, or maybe even there investors, the ones that handle the endowment start to purchase microstrategy, which is essentially a conduit for purchasing bitcoin, with indirect exposure to the asset class of bitcoin, ￼this will be a big deal￼. If UCLA were smart, she would purchase BTC and Bitcoin and or microstrategy, not real estate. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 foolish way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero sum; they think that your success means my failure, that your big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, the ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use microstrategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling microstrategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. MSTR Microstrategy as the engine in order to accumulate more Bitcoin? MSTR -> BTC Introducing BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL: ￼ Currently, my new direction in my life — obviously I’ll still be doing photography workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in life and passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft launch of BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in participating, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com To be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite money machine, you essentially leverage MSTR microstrategy stock, and then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Just download Coinbase to your iPhone, from the App Store, connected with your JP Morgan Chase or Bank of America checking account, and start buying bitcoins, you could just buy 10 bucks, 25 bucks, $100, $500, $1000, 10,000, $100,000, if you like. The good thing on Coinbase is that they recently increased the limit i’m a $50,000 a day in instant limit, to now doubling that to $100,000! Thank god. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million a bitcoin, the price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 a bitcoin, 200,000 a bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 a bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin!. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his two sons, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto. Which is good for us, because if you have a president that loves bitcoin crypto and also the US dollar, this will be very very good news for us Americans. And also, good for any holders of bitcoin on the planet. I also personally ethically believe that bitcoin can promote peace because it don’t matter what country you’re from, as long as you own bitcoin, we are all part of the same monetary network. I think bitcoin is a threat to the international monetary fund, Jerome Powell and the FED, which prints money like cotton candy. Even Donald Trump in his interview with Joe Rogan is talking about paying off the $35 trillion debt America has, and also Donald Trump says we will never sell our bitcoin. And also I would not be surprised if maybe, an interesting national strategy; a nation or a nation to purchase bitcoins, which backs their own fiat monetary supply? Like imagine if America owned 1 million bitcoins, or 2 million bitcoins whatever, and assuming that the US dollar was pegged to the bitcoin or back, then, the US dollar would actually be worth something. People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin miners are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid, for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the hydro power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more efficient, because contrary to popular belief, bitcoin mining is less about electricity — it is more about computer efficiency. For example in the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into ASICs, ASIC computers, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything. For example you do not want to live in your fake virtual reality metaverse, With your fake virtual reality Lamborghini, having sex with your virtual reality girlfriend, with access to your virtual reality money. For anyone who played Diablo II, you know very well that gold is not worth anything in the universe of Diablo; everyone wants the rare weapons. Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing BAAL runs, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that BAAL would drop some sort of mythical item or weapon, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analogue energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin — nothing else is powered by proof of work and has a hard cap and supply. And derivatives, don’t forget Ethereum was essentially a bitcoin copycat. Ethereum is not worth anything, don’t buy it, sell your Ethereum and buy bitcoin. The best analogy is that Ethereum is Pepsi. Nobody likes Pepsi. The only reason anyone would drink Pepsi was because somebody gave it to them for free. Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has always been the best and will always be the best or bitcoin is like the iPhone Pro, everyone wants the iPhone, nobody wants a Google pixel, nobody wants a Samsung. And certainly nobody wants a Huawei, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a Huawei phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing YEEZY sneakers, with the newest iPhone Pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; they would prefer to live in and own property in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, Calabasas, Beverly Hills, Culver City￼, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping mainland Chinese is capital controls– ￼ if you have $1 billion worth of Chinese yuan, you cannot take it out of the country even if you wanted to. Don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially pegged to the US dollar, and I think time has shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol and the international business language. As long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the tariffs, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, words weep. What does that means is China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ the rich Chinese oligarchs are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy. Anyone who thinks that China is going to take over the planet is either anti-American, a communist, likes to give fellatio to Karl Marx, is a fakeass woke plant based hippie, spends too much time on Reddit, and pirateBay, spent too much time torrenting and streaming Maria Ozawa pornography (on Google incognito, brave browser incognito), maybe they have an apple Vision Pro and they￼ watch virtual reality pornography on their $4000 Apple Vision Pro in private. They might be single, they might not be, maybe own a dog, they have no intention of having kids or girlfriends or a serious relationship. And also they don’t own bitcoin.

ERIC KIM Podcast Video Audio A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “Would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance?” Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼For me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, with even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about microstrategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, there might be discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown can now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset. The reason why this is a big deal is for so long, bitcoin was considered fake money, and that a company could not add it to her balance sheet, proving proof of funds and reserves in the traditional sense. Now, all of these nerds who become accounting will have to learn all of these new rules, figuring out how to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets to accounting principles. The reason why this is such a big deal is that once again, people still think that bitcoin is fake money! Yet look at the Janet Yellen talk on Satoshi, and even look at Larry Fink, CEO of blackrock who owns over $10 trillion worth of assets, Larry Fink even now says that bitcoin is legitimate asset class, and I think that black rock has actually recently invested and bought a bunch more micro strategy stock. ￼Watch the CNBC interview with Larry Fink on Bitcoin. Oh and also, a pro tip; definitely get the $20 a month ChatGPT pro, it is now the ultimate financial investment research tool; when you want to search any financials or anything, this is an insanely big deal. ￼Anyways, once Harvard Yale and Ivy League schools start to purchase bitcoin, or maybe even there investors, the ones that handle the endowment start to purchase microstrategy, which is essentially a conduit for purchasing bitcoin, with indirect exposure to the asset class of bitcoin, ￼this will be a big deal￼. If UCLA were smart, she would purchase BTC and Bitcoin and or microstrategy, not real estate. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 foolish way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero sum; they think that your success means my failure, that your big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, the ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use microstrategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling microstrategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. MSTR Microstrategy as the engine in order to accumulate more Bitcoin? MSTR -> BTC Introducing BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL: ￼ Currently, my new direction in my life — obviously I’ll still be doing photography workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in life and passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft launch of BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in participating, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com To be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite money machine, you essentially leverage MSTR microstrategy stock, and then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Just download Coinbase to your iPhone, from the App Store, connected with your JP Morgan Chase or Bank of America checking account, and start buying bitcoins, you could just buy 10 bucks, 25 bucks, $100, $500, $1000, 10,000, $100,000, if you like. The good thing on Coinbase is that they recently increased the limit i’m a $50,000 a day in instant limit, to now doubling that to $100,000! Thank god. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million a bitcoin, the price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 a bitcoin, 200,000 a bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 a bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin!. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his two sons, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto. Which is good for us, because if you have a president that loves bitcoin crypto and also the US dollar, this will be very very good news for us Americans. And also, good for any holders of bitcoin on the planet. I also personally ethically believe that bitcoin can promote peace because it don’t matter what country you’re from, as long as you own bitcoin, we are all part of the same monetary network. I think bitcoin is a threat to the international monetary fund, Jerome Powell and the FED, which prints money like cotton candy. Even Donald Trump in his interview with Joe Rogan is talking about paying off the $35 trillion debt America has, and also Donald Trump says we will never sell our bitcoin. And also I would not be surprised if maybe, an interesting national strategy; a nation or a nation to purchase bitcoins, which backs their own fiat monetary supply? Like imagine if America owned 1 million bitcoins, or 2 million bitcoins whatever, and assuming that the US dollar was pegged to the bitcoin or back, then, the US dollar would actually be worth something. People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin miners are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid, for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the hydro power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more efficient, because contrary to popular belief, bitcoin mining is less about electricity — it is more about computer efficiency. For example in the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into ASICs, ASIC computers, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything. For example you do not want to live in your fake virtual reality metaverse, With your fake virtual reality Lamborghini, having sex with your virtual reality girlfriend, with access to your virtual reality money. For anyone who played Diablo II, you know very well that gold is not worth anything in the universe of Diablo; everyone wants the rare weapons. Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing BAAL runs, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that BAAL would drop some sort of mythical item or weapon, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analogue energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin — nothing else is powered by proof of work and has a hard cap and supply. And derivatives, don’t forget Ethereum was essentially a bitcoin copycat. Ethereum is not worth anything, don’t buy it, sell your Ethereum and buy bitcoin. The best analogy is that Ethereum is Pepsi. Nobody likes Pepsi. The only reason anyone would drink Pepsi was because somebody gave it to them for free. Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has always been the best and will always be the best or bitcoin is like the iPhone Pro, everyone wants the iPhone, nobody wants a Google pixel, nobody wants a Samsung. And certainly nobody wants a Huawei, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a Huawei phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing YEEZY sneakers, with the newest iPhone Pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; they would prefer to live in and own property in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, Calabasas, Beverly Hills, Culver City￼, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping mainland Chinese is capital controls– ￼ if you have $1 billion worth of Chinese yuan, you cannot take it out of the country even if you wanted to. Don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially pegged to the US dollar, and I think time has shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol and the international business language. As long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the tariffs, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, words weep. What does that means is China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ the rich Chinese oligarchs are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy. Anyone who thinks that China is going to take over the planet is either anti-American, a communist, likes to give fellatio to Karl Marx, is a fakeass woke plant based hippie, spends too much time on Reddit, and pirateBay, spent too much time torrenting and streaming Maria Ozawa pornography (on Google incognito, brave browser incognito), maybe they have an apple Vision Pro and they￼ watch virtual reality pornography on their $4000 Apple Vision Pro in private. They might be single, they might not be, maybe own a dog, they have no intention of having kids or girlfriends or a serious relationship. And also they don’t own bitcoin.

ERIC KIM A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside?

So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person?

The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile.

Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about microstrategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, there might be discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown can now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset. The reason why this is a big deal is for so long, bitcoin was considered fake money, and that a company could not add it to her balance sheet, proving proof of funds and reserves in the traditional sense. Now, all of these nerds who become accounting will have to learn all of these new rules, figuring out how to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets to accounting principles. The reason why this is such a big deal is that once again, people still think that bitcoin is fake money! Yet look at the Janet Yellen talk on Satoshi, and even look at Larry Fink, CEO of blackrock who owns over $10 trillion worth of assets, Larry Fink even now says that bitcoin is legitimate asset class, and I think that black rock has actually recently invested and bought a bunch more micro strategy stock. ￼Watch the CNBC interview with Larry Fink on Bitcoin. Oh and also, a pro tip; definitely get the $20 a month ChatGPT pro, it is now the ultimate financial investment research tool; when you want to search any financials or anything, this is an insanely big deal. ￼Anyways, once Harvard Yale and Ivy League schools start to purchase bitcoin, or maybe even there investors, the ones that handle the endowment start to purchase microstrategy, which is essentially a conduit for purchasing bitcoin, with indirect exposure to the asset class of bitcoin, ￼this will be a big deal￼. If UCLA were smart, she would purchase BTC and Bitcoin and or microstrategy, not real estate. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 foolish way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero sum; they think that your success means my failure, that your big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, the ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use microstrategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling microstrategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. MSTR Microstrategy as the engine in order to accumulate more Bitcoin? MSTR -> BTC Introducing BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL: ￼ Currently, my new direction in my life — obviously I’ll still be doing photography workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in life and passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft launch of BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in participating, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com To be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite money machine, you essentially leverage MSTR microstrategy stock, and then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Just download Coinbase to your iPhone, from the App Store, connected with your JP Morgan Chase or Bank of America checking account, and start buying bitcoins, you could just buy 10 bucks, 25 bucks, $100, $500, $1000, 10,000, $100,000, if you like. The good thing on Coinbase is that they recently increased the limit i’m a $50,000 a day in instant limit, to now doubling that to $100,000! Thank god. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million a bitcoin, the price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 a bitcoin, 200,000 a bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 a bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin!. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his two sons, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto. Which is good for us, because if you have a president that loves bitcoin crypto and also the US dollar, this will be very very good news for us Americans. And also, good for any holders of bitcoin on the planet. I also personally ethically believe that bitcoin can promote peace because it don’t matter what country you’re from, as long as you own bitcoin, we are all part of the same monetary network. I think bitcoin is a threat to the international monetary fund, Jerome Powell and the FED, which prints money like cotton candy. Even Donald Trump in his interview with Joe Rogan is talking about paying off the $35 trillion debt America has, and also Donald Trump says we will never sell our bitcoin. And also I would not be surprised if maybe, an interesting national strategy; a nation or a nation to purchase bitcoins, which backs their own fiat monetary supply? Like imagine if America owned 1 million bitcoins, or 2 million bitcoins whatever, and assuming that the US dollar was pegged to the bitcoin or back, then, the US dollar would actually be worth something. People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin miners are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid, for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the hydro power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more efficient, because contrary to popular belief, bitcoin mining is less about electricity — it is more about computer efficiency. For example in the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into ASICs, ASIC computers, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything. For example you do not want to live in your fake virtual reality metaverse, With your fake virtual reality Lamborghini, having sex with your virtual reality girlfriend, with access to your virtual reality money. For anyone who played Diablo II, you know very well that gold is not worth anything in the universe of Diablo; everyone wants the rare weapons. Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing BAAL runs, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that BAAL would drop some sort of mythical item or weapon, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analogue energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin — nothing else is powered by proof of work and has a hard cap and supply. And derivatives, don’t forget Ethereum was essentially a bitcoin copycat. Ethereum is not worth anything, don’t buy it, sell your Ethereum and buy bitcoin. The best analogy is that Ethereum is Pepsi. Nobody likes Pepsi. The only reason anyone would drink Pepsi was because somebody gave it to them for free. Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has always been the best and will always be the best or bitcoin is like the iPhone Pro, everyone wants the iPhone, nobody wants a Google pixel, nobody wants a Samsung. And certainly nobody wants a Huawei, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a Huawei phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing YEEZY sneakers, with the newest iPhone Pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; they would prefer to live in and own property in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, Calabasas, Beverly Hills, Culver City￼, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping mainland Chinese is capital controls– ￼ if you have $1 billion worth of Chinese yuan, you cannot take it out of the country even if you wanted to. Don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially pegged to the US dollar, and I think time has shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol and the international business language. As long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the tariffs, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, words weep. What does that means is China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ the rich Chinese oligarchs are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy. Anyone who thinks that China is going to take over the planet is either anti-American, a communist, likes to give fellatio to Karl Marx, is a fakeass woke plant based hippie, spends too much time on Reddit, and pirateBay, spent too much time torrenting and streaming Maria Ozawa pornography (on Google incognito, brave browser incognito), maybe they have an apple Vision Pro and they￼ watch virtual reality pornography on their $4000 Apple Vision Pro in private. They might be single, they might not be, maybe own a dog, they have no intention of having kids or girlfriends or a serious relationship. And also they don’t own bitcoin.

Title: The Philosophy of Volatility ￼

ERIC KIM A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “Would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance?” Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼For me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, with even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about microstrategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to.

I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, the ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use microstrategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling microstrategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. MSTR Microstrategy as the engine in order to accumulate more Bitcoin? MSTR -> BTC Currently, my new direction and past life, obviously I’ll still be doing guitar workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in fine passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft lunch of black eagle capital, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in doing a call, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com. It’s actually to be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite love machine, you essentially leverage micro strategy style, And then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million of bitcoin, The price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 of bitcoin, 200,000 of bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his Tucson, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto. Which is good for us, Because if you have a president that loves bitcoin crypto and also the US dollar, this will be very very good news for us Americans. And also, good for any holders of bitcoin on the planet. I also personally ethically believe that bitcoin can promote peace because it don’t matter what country you’re from, as long as you own bitcoin, we are all part of the same monetary network. I think bitcoin is a threat to the international monitor fund, Jerome Powell and the vet, which prints money like cotton candy. Even Donald Trump in his interview with Joe Rogan is talking about paying off the $35 trillion debt America has, and also Donald Trump says we will never sell our bitcoin. And also I would not be surprised if maybe, an interesting national strategy; a nation or a nation to purchase bitcoins, their Caranci? Like imagine if America owned 1 million bitcoins, or 2 million bitcoins whatever, and assuming that the US dollar was pegged to the bitcoin or back, then, the US dollar would actually reward something. People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin minors are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid,for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the high ball and power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more deficient, because country popularly, bitcoin mining is less about electricity it is more about computer efficiency. For example the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into basic, ASIC, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides Solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything. For example you do not want to live in your fake virtual reality meta-verse, With your fake virtual reality Lamborghini, having sex with your virtual reality girlfriend, with access to your virtual reality money. For anyone who played Diablo too, you know very well that goal is not worth anything in the universe of Diablo; everyone wants the rare weapons. Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing bail rents, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that bail would drop some sort of mythical by Vince, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analyze energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin Nothing else is part by proof of work. And derivatives, don’t forget Ethereum was essentially a bitcoin copycat. Ethereum is not worth anything, don’t buy it, sell your Ethereum and buy bitcoin. The best analogy is that Ethereum Pepsi. Nobody likes Pepsi. The only reason anyone would drink Pepsi was because somebody gave it to them for free. Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has always been the best and will always be the best or bitcoin is like the iPhone Pro, everyone wants the iPhone, nobody wants a Google pixel, nobody wants a Samsung. And certainly nobody wants a Jui, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any Person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing easy sneakers, with the newest iPhone pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; property in Palo Alto,, Los Angeles, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping is control don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially to the US dollar, and I think time is shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol as long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the terrorist, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, work week. What does that means China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ The rich Chinese all the guards are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy. Anyone who thinks that China is going to take over the planet is either anti-American, a communist, Likes to give fellatio to Carl Marx, is a fake woke plant based hippie, spent too much time on Reddit, and pirate Bay, spent too much time quarantine Maria Ozawa pornography, maybe they have an apple Vision Pro and the watch virtual reality pornography on their $4000 Apple Vision Pro in private. They might be single, they might not be, my own dog, they have no intention of having kids or girlfriends or a serious relationship. And also they don’t own bitcoin.

Title: Search BlackRock investment into MicroStrategy.

ERIC KIM As of recent updates, MicroStrategy and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) hold significant Bitcoin reserves, although their rankings have fluctuated over time. MicroStrategy currently holds approximately 205,000 BTC, valued over $14 billion given recent price surges. BlackRock’s IBIT, launched in early 2024, quickly accumulated around 198,000 BTC, positioning it as a close competitor to MicroStrategy’s holdings. This competitive dynamic underscores a shift in the institutional approach to Bitcoin, with ETFs like IBIT offering a regulated, mainstream option for investors, while companies like MicroStrategy continue to expand their direct holdings. This highlights the growing adoption of Bitcoin in traditional financial products, pushing more institutions toward cryptocurrency exposure through structured financial instruments. For further details on recent acquisitions and strategy shifts, see sources like The Block and ETF.com. .. BlackRock recently expanded its investment in MicroStrategy, holding approximately 1.02 million shares, which accounts for a 7.5% stake as of early 2024. This marks a notable increase from their previous position, representing a significant institutional endorsement of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-centric strategy. MicroStrategy, under CEO Michael Saylor, has strategically accumulated large Bitcoin reserves, which have appreciated significantly as Bitcoin’s institutional appeal grows. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) launched in early 2024 and has grown rapidly, surpassing MicroStrategy in Bitcoin holdings, with 196,088 BTC compared to MicroStrategy’s 193,000 BTC. This dynamic between MicroStrategy’s direct Bitcoin holdings and BlackRock’s ETF signals a shifting landscape, where institutional Bitcoin investments are increasingly facilitated through regulated products like ETFs. The competition underscores the increasing role of major financial institutions in the cryptocurrency space and the mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as an institutional asset .

Spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $893 million Wednesday, per data from Farside Investors, pushing the funds' collective Bitcoin holdings to over 1 million BTC. The Wall Street trove has grown by $24.2 billion worth of inflows since the products were approved in January, while nipping away at the heels of crypto’s founding father. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, who vanished from the internet in 2011, still holds a whopping 1.1 million Bitcoin worth $79 billion at present. At the current rate that spot Bitcoin ETFs are sucking up coins, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimated that the crypto pioneer could be overtaken by the group of eleven Wall Street products in terms of holdings soon. “At this rate, they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks,” Balchunas wrote on Twitter (aka X) Wednesday. He noted the “Joey Chestnut-level pace” that ETFs are eating up Bitcoin’s supply, referencing the champion competitive eater. The milestone was reached just short of the 16th anniversary for Bitcoin’s white paper. On Halloween in 2008, Bitcoin’s creator laid the blueprint for his now-preeminent “peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” publishing his nine-page thesis for Bitcoin’s design online. As Bitcoin tests an all-time high price of $73,737, set back in March, spot Bitcoin ETFs have had two of their best days on record. Representing spot Bitcoin ETFs’ fourth best day of inflows, $870 million worth of allocations on Tuesday were followed by Wednesday’s jump to $893 million. According to Bitwise Head of Research Ryan Rasmussen, institutional investors are leading the charge. While a first wave of inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs was driven by retail investors, wealth managers making investments on behalf of clients are currently catching up. Large institutions like Merrill Lynch or Wells Fargo have lengthy due diligence and compliance processes, alongside investment committees that vet new types of investments a few times a year, he said. Those companies are now “unlocking their wealth managers,” Rasmussen said. “Even after ETFs make it through those different committees, [institutions] go through a process of educating their advisors on how to talk to clients about Bitcoin or new assets,” he added. “We saw signs of the second wave entering the market earlier this week.” Wednesday’s avalanche of allocations included a high watermark for BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). Some $872 million worth of Bitcoin flowed into the product Wednesday, per data from Farside, topping the asset manager’s previous daily peak of $849 million from March. Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF saw the second-largest inflows Wednesday at just $12.6 million, while Bitwise's BITB was the biggest loser with almost $24 million in outflows. BlackRock’s stunning Wednesday performance brought its ETF’s Bitcoin holdings to around 429,000, towering over the world’s largest corporate treasury reserve holder of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, at 252,000 BTC. While MicroStrategy, the self-proclaimed Bitcoin development company, has institutional investors holding its shares, Rasmussen said that the BlackRock brand has ultimately proved more palatable among Wall Street’s wealth management crowd. “They trust BlackRock,” he said. “They can say, ‘Look, the largest institution in the world is backing Bitcoin in a big way,’ and so it's no longer this contrarian view in the way that it was.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Abu Dhabi firms to launch tokenized US Treasuries fund
URL: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/abu-dhabi-firms-launch-tokenized-us-treasuries-fund-4715786

Business NEW YORK :Abu Dhabi firms Realize and Neovision Wealth Management have launched an investment vehicle that will buy units of exchange traded funds (ETFs) focused on U.S. Treasury bills and convert these assets into digital tokens that can be held, traded and transferred on a blockchain. The fund is called Realize T-BILLS Fund and it will buy BlackRock's iShares and State Street's SPDR, tokenize units from these ETFs, and incorporate them within the fund, Dominik Schiener, co-founder of technology company Realize, told Reuters in an interview. It hopes to grow to a $200-million fund. Realize will tokenize the units of the T-BILLS Fund, while Neovision will manage it. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT Tokenized Treasuries are a growing segment of the crypto market, with a market capitalization of $2.4 billion on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum, according to data platform rwa.xyz. They are effectively digital tokens created on a blockchain and backed by U.S. government debt, and issued both by blockchain-native firms and traditional institutions, notably BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. In March, BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund called BUIDL on the Ethereum blockchain, investing 100 per cent of its assets in cash, U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements or repos. The BlackRock fund has a current market cap of $530 million. FUND DETAILS The Realize fund, the first tokenized fund to be domiciled out of the Abu Dhabi Global Market, will issue the $RBILL token and will serve as the digital representation of the units of the fund. They will initially launch on both the IOTA and Ethereum blockchain networks. KEY QUOTES "The goal is to bring fungible assets onchain. T-Bills are the most liquid asset today in the real world," said Schiener. "They're also the best form of collateral, paying around 5 per cent." Dr. Ryan Lemand, co-founder and chief executive officer of Neovision, said it makes sense to buy T-Bill ETFs and tokenize them, instead of outright purchasing Treasury bills in the market. He noted buying cash Treasuries in the market would involve continuous transaction costs because they will have to be bought again and again.

Title: Race For Spot Solana ETF Heats Up As Yet Another Firm Files Application With SEC
URL: https://zycrypto.com/race-for-spot-solana-etf-heats-up-as-yet-another-firm-files-application-with-sec/
Time Published: 2024-10-31T13:09:35Z

Canary Capital Group, a new digital asset-focused investment firm created by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg, has become the latest investment firm to apply for a Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). Canary Capital joins a growing list of prestigious asset managers seeking to list a SOL ETF in the United States, including VanEck and 21Shares. Despite Bitcoin (BTC) ETF leader Blackrock opting out of the Solana ETF race, some other firms are not shying away from filing to introduce an investment vehicle that would give investors exposure to SOL without having to purchase and store the cryptocurrency themselves. According to an S-1 registration statement filed on Oct. 30, Canary Capital’s proposed spot SOL ETF would let traditional investors access the Solana market via brokerage accounts without the potential hurdles to entry or risks. It’s worth mentioning that Canary Capital recently submitted S-1s for a spot XRP ETF on Oct. 8 and then a spot Litecoin ETF just seven days later on Oct. 15. With its latest filing, the firm has not named the custodian and administrator for the SOL ETF, nor did it say what ticker symbol the fund would be listed under. SOL is currently the fifth-largest crypto on the market. The Solana blockchain is used for decentralized applications (dapps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and is home to a slew of meme coins. It’s considered a key competitor to Ethereum as it offers cost-effective and faster transactions. “Despite the hyper-competitive L1 and EVM landscape, Solana has emerged as a battle-tested front-runner for decentralized applications,” Canary wrote in the statement. “Solana’s robust DeFi ecosystem has led to strong sustained on-chain analytics as measured by transactions per day, active addresses, and new addresses, while maintaining a low fee environment for all consumers. Future growth in native on-chain stablecoin deployment will also likely further accelerate the commanding lead Solana maintains over its peers.” Solana has been considered the next digital asset to have a spot ETF greenlighted by the SEC, following Bitcoin and Ethereum approvals in January and July, respectively. Solana ETF anticipation has spurred huge investor attention since VanEck submitted paperwork to launch the VanEck Solana Trust in June 2024. 21Shares followed VanEck’s lead, filing with the SEC to debut its own spot Solana ETF. Asset manager Grayscale recently filed to convert a multi-asset fund into an ETF on the New York Stock Exchange, which features Solana exposure alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, and Avalanche. These filings suggest a rising confidence in Solana’s potential among institutional investors. Franklin Templeton is also eyeing a spot SOL ETF, though it has yet to file an application. In the SEC’s pending lawsuits against digital asset exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, the agency claims that SOL satisfies the Howey Test, thus making it a security. Some industry insiders now think SOL ETFs have a near-zero chance of approval due to the SEC’s concerns over Solana’s classification as a security. However, others believe that with BTC and ETH ETFs already trading on U.S. exchanges, making a logical case to deny Solana the same product is a steep uphill battle for the regulator.

Now, as the Federal Reserve grapples with a "nightmare" scenario, Larry Fink, the chief executive of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock, has warned he doesn't think the Fed is going to cut rates at the pace expected by markets. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has embraced bitcoin and crypto this year, helping the bitcoin ...

"We're not going to see interest rates as low as people are forecasting," Fink, who oversees BlackRock's $10 trillion in assets, said during a Bloomberg panel that was part of Saudi Arabia’s annual flagship investment conference, the Future Investment Initiative. Fink predicted just one Fed interest rate cut before 2025 against market expectations of two. "I think it’s fair to say we’re going to have at least a 25 (basis-point cut), but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we’ve ever seen," Fink warned. Last month, the Fed surprised traders with a 50 basis point cut to interest rates, kicking off a reduction cycle after interest rates were ramped up at a historical clip as lockdown-induced inflation threatened to spiral out of control. Expectations that interest rates will come down sharply this year have fueled a bitcoin price boom through 2024, with bitcoin and the wider crypto market bouncing back along with stock markets. Sky-high interest rates have pushed up payments on the $35 trillion U.S. debt pile, with Tesla billionaire Elon Musk last week warning "the interest payments on the debt are 23% of all federal tax revenue" and declaring the situation a "financial emergency."

Meanwhile, SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci has predicted the Fed will allow inflation to run hotter than it has previously to escape its "tremendous debt crisis"—with the bitcoin price soaring as a result. "There's a lot of people who think that the U.S. is about to enter into this tremendous debt crisis. And I believe that we're going to solve ... that and we're going to stop that from happening," Scaramucci told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. Scaramucci said he expects the bitcoin price to hit $170,000 by mid-2026, which would give bitcoin a market capitalization of around $3.3 trillion, due to bitcoin's "fixed limited supply, and what I think is very high demand." That demand has been boosted this year by the long-awaited arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wall Street, led by BlackRock's bitcoin fund. On Wednesday, BlackRock's bitcoin ETF saw $872 million worth of net inflows, marking the fund’s largest inflow since its January launch and surpassing the previous record high on March 12. "The recent surge in BlackRock’s IBIT inflows is driven by several key factors, including central banks’ global shift towards reducing interest rates, which has boosted liquidity and made capital more accessible for investors," Rachael Lucas, crypto analyst of BTCMarkets, told The Block.

Vincent Phelan, the 98-year-old Dubliner who campaigned for the liberation of his son Bernard when Bernard was arbitrarily imprisoned in Iran, has died. Mr Phelan’s son Bernard was released from a six and-a-half year jail sentence in Iran in May this year, after an international campaign for his release spearheaded by his father Vincent, and assistance from the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Paris-based tourism consultant had been arrested in Mashhad in northeastern Iran and had been charged with offences related to sending information to a foreign state, which he denied. He suffered poor physical and mental health while in prison but in response to his father’s plea, he gave up a hunger strike. [ ‘I’ve enjoyed having a pint of Guinness, seeing family and friends, and Irish humour’Opens in new window ] Vincent Phelan lived to see his son go on to write a bestselling book, You Will Die in Prison (Ériu), which is named after a comment made by an Iranian Judge when Bernard refused to sign papers written in Persian, while in prison. Bernard and Vincent were received by President Michael D. Higgins at Áras an Uachtarain earlier this year. Vincent Phelan died on Wednesday at Belmont Nursing home in Stillorgan. He had previously lived with his wife and three children in the Dublin suburb of Blackrock.

Title: U.S. Not Out Of The Woods Yet When It Comes To Inflation, According To BlackRock CEO

Larry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock (Photographer: Tolga Akmen/EPA/Bloomberg) Wall Street is sounding the alarm about stubbornly high inflation and the likelihood of interest rates remaining elevated for an extended period. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has notably predicted that the United States Federal Reserve's interest rate reductions will fall short of market expectations, challenging the prevailing optimism among investors, CNBC reported. “Today, I think we have governmental policies that are embedded inflationary, and, with that being said, we’re not gonna see interest rates as low as people are forecasting,” Fink said Tuesday at a panel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The CEO of BlackRock, which oversees more than $10 trillion in assets, anticipates a single interest rate cut by the close of 2024. This forecast diverges from the broader market consensus, which generally expects two rate reductions during the same period. “I think it’s fair to say we’re going to have at least a 25 (basis-point cut), but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we’ve ever seen,” Fink stated. At a separate panel discussion during the event, featuring top executives from major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, Carlyle, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and State Street, the moderator posed a question about potential Federal Reserve actions. When asked to indicate by raising their hands if they believed the Fed would implement two more rate cuts this year, none of the CEOs present did so, according to CNBC. Wall Street business leaders tend to have a more cautious outlook on inflation's staying power. Their direct involvement in various sectors of the economy provides these executives with a distinctive insight into price trends, allowing them to gauge the persistence of inflation more acutely than those less directly engaged with market fluctuations. Although, analysts from JPMorgan and Fitch Ratings forecasted last month that the Fed would implement two more interest rate cuts by the end of 2024, with expectations for these reductions to extend into the following year. Additionally, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has expressed optimism that the Fed will reach its 2% inflation goal by 2025. "I do expect inflation to come down, and as we get into next year, I believe that inflation will go back to the Fed’s 2% target," Yellen stated in a June interview with Yahoo Finance. In September, the Fed took a major step by lowering its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points, bringing it down to a range of 4.75% to 5%. This substantial cut was the first reduction since March 2020, signaling a dramatic pivot from the central bank's prolonged campaign of rate hikes. The decision reflected the Fed's growing confidence in taming inflation and its renewed focus on supporting the job market. Pressure had mounted after the U.S. unemployment rate increased to 4.3% in July, marking its highest level since October 2021. Moreover, recent labor market data suggests a gradual "cooling" trend, despite unemployment remaining relatively low by historical standards. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey revealed on Tuesday a decrease in job openings, with 7.4 million unfilled jobs at the end of September, down from August's revised 7.86 million. This decline was particularly noticeable in sectors that have been driving job growth in recent years, such as healthcare, social assistance and government. The drop in job openings was more significant than economists anticipated, with FactSet estimates projecting around 7.9 million openings, CNN reported. This reduction in available positions suggests a normalization of the job market following the post-pandemic boom, potentially signaling a more balanced employment landscape. One Community.

Title: Crypto Boom: US Treasury Latest Report Reveals Major Expansion In These Key Sectors
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-boom-us-treasury-latest-report-reveals/
Time Published: 2024-10-31T09:30:30Z
Full Content:
In a recent report, the US Treasury Department detailed significant growth in key areas of the crypto ecosystem, emphasizing how this expansion has influenced demand for short-term Treasury bills (T-Bills), which are viewed as a safe investment backed by the US government’s credit. The Treasury report asserts that digital assets, while still emerging from a small base, have seen rapid growth. This expansion includes native cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as stablecoins. However, the department notes that despite the increased market activity, household and industry adoption of cryptocurrencies remains limited, primarily for investment purposes. Notably, the report states that the digital asset market cap remains relatively low compared to other financial and real assets. This growth has not appeared to detract from the demand for Treasuries, indicating that crypto assets have not yet “cannibalized” traditional safe-haven investments. The report highlights two primary tracks of interest in digital assets. Firstly, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a store of value, often referred to as “digital gold,” in a decentralized finance (DeFi) context. Secondly, the report alleges that speculation has played a significant role in the growth of various digital tokens including stablecoins, as they have rapidly gained traction, appealing to investors looking for assets with stable, cash-like characteristics. The US Treasury further asserts that stablecoins have become integral to digital asset markets, with over 80% of all crypto transactions involving a stablecoin. The report estimates that approximately $120 billion in stablecoin collateral is directly invested in Treasuries, indicating a strong link between the cryptocurrency and traditional finance sectors. Tokenization – the process of digitally representing assets on a blockchain – has also been identified as a transformative force in finance, particularly with the growth and adoption seen over the past year, with asset managers such as BlackRock investing in the sector via the Ethereum blockchain. The report outlines several benefits of tokenizing US Treasuries, including: improved clearing and settlement, enhanced transparency, increased accessibility, liquidity and innovation. While the potential benefits of tokenization are considerable, the Treasury report emphasizes the need for a cautious approach. The department explains that current financial stability risks remain low, given the relatively small size of the tokenized asset market. However, the report alleges that rapid growth and adoption in the tokenization sector could introduce “instability” if not managed properly. Finally, the report calls for a unified ledger or highly interoperable systems to streamline transactions and reduce inefficiencies. It also highlights the importance of a central authority, such as a central bank for the tokenization sector, in terms of regulatory compliance. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $72,790. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock's Entry Into Crypto Matters More Than U.S. Election, QCP Capital's Darius Sit Says

Election 2024 coverage presented by HONG KONG — The winner of next week's U.S. presidential election doesn't really matter to Darius Sit, the chief investment officer of QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm. While there may be some short-term volatility in crypto markets depending on whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris becomes the leader of the world's largest economy, what's more important is the broader integration of crypto, especially bitcoin (BTC), into American finance. For example, the widespread adoption of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset-management firm, running the biggest. "The biggest change this year has been BlackRock," Sit said in an interview. "Suddenly we have bitcoin being distributed in BlackRock’s extensive network. Read more Consensus Hong Kong-related coverage here. "When you have [BlackRock CEO] Larry Fink on CNBC talking about how bitcoin is a store of value, that's when you know crypto has become a part of the American investing narrative," he said. "BlackRock has brought crypto from frontier to mainstream." Trump has made part of his election campaign ensuring that U.S. crypto rules are attractive to projects so they can stay onshore, which earned his crypto policy a rare endorsement from CoinDesk. Bettors on Polymarket give Trump a more than 60% chance of winning the election. One might wonder if a U.S. without a hostile Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) led by Gary Gensler might raise concerns in jurisdictions like Hong Kong, which have courted American companies to set up shop in places where rules are more certain. It's not just East Asia. Earlier this year, QCP opened in Abu Dhabi, and Sit says he's a fan of the regulator's approach to crypto, explaining that the regulator there “didn’t see crypto as a carve-out of capital markets.” Instead, he said, Abu Dhabi views "digital assets as part of the capital market." Still, a rising tide lifts all ships. “Bitcoin becomes even more of a cornerstone asset if Trump comes in and has more friendly policies,” Sit said, arguing that U.S. growth would likely fuel global opportunities rather than stifle them. Bitcoin is currently trading above $72,000, up 19% from a month earlier, according to CoinDesk Indices data, coming close to challenging its all-time high.

By Aditya Kalra and Indranil Sarkar NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Big investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund Norges and Fidelity have placed bids worth more than $15 billion in Swiggy's India IPO, 25 times the $605 million portion reserved for such investors, four sources told Reuters on Thursday. Swiggy, a SoftBank-backed Indian food and grocery delivery giant, will next week launch its $1.35 billion IPO that will be country's second-biggest stock offering this year. The bidding process is ongoing. After a recent correction in stock markets, the company has reduced its estimated valuation from the IPO to $11.3 billion, 25% less than an earlier estimation of $15 billion. Signalling growing interest in India's food delivery and "quick commerce" space - where goods are delivered in 10 minutes - the IPO anchor book reserved for big investors has already received bids worth more than $15 billion, said the sources, who declined to be named as the process is confidential. Top investors include Norway's sovereign wealth fund Norges Bank Investment Management, Fidelity International and U.S.-based Capital Group, said three of the sources. The fourth source said BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board are also among investors. None of the investors or Swiggy immediately responded to a request for comment. Research firm Datum Intelligence expects quick commerce sales in India to hit $6 billion this year, up from $100 million in 2020. Indian companies including Swiggy, main rival Zomato and billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance are betting big on the quick commerce concept as they jostle to deliver everything from milk to cosmetics to iPhones within minutes, outpacing peers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on delivery times.

Title: BREAKING: Canary Capital Files For Spot Solana ETF

Asset manager Canary Capital has officially filed for a spot Solana ETF in the United States, following in the footsteps of investment firm VanEck, which introduced its own application four months ago. The Solana ETF move was confirmed minutes ago by Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Despite not having a live exchange-traded fund in the US, unlike established issuers such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, Canary Capital’s filing signals its continued intent to enter the crypto ETF space following the significant uptake seen in recent months. The asset manager, based in Sydney and established in 2017, has been proactive in pursuing a variety of crypto-related ETFs. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, just weeks ago, it submitted similar S-1 form applications for XRP and Litecoin ETFs. This move comes as in January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a series of Bitcoin ETFs, marking a major milestone for crypto investment products in the country. The approval of 12 Bitcoin funds was followed by the green light for Ethereum-based ETFs in July, further legitimizing the cryptocurrency market. Despite these advancements, the paths for cryptocurrencies like XRP, Solana, and Litecoin remain fraught with uncertainty due to ongoing debates about their classifications as either securities or commodities—a critical factor in the SEC’s approval process. It is yet to be seen whether additional investment firms will pursue similar spot Solana ETF applications or wait for clearer regulatory guidance, especially in light of the upcoming US presidential election. The current contrasting positions of pro-Bitcoin candidate Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris could influence the trajectory of cryptocurrency regulations, potentially affecting the approval process for these ETFs in the upcoming year.

Title: Matt Mullenweg talks about Automattic’s staffing issues and financials at TechCrunch Disrupt

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us WordPress co-creator and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg talked about his fight with WP Engine, Automattic’s staffing issues, and the company’s financials at TechCrunch Disrupt on Wednesday. Mullenweg repeated a lot of stuff from the past month about the trademark fight, WP Engine not contributing to the community, and misleading customers to believe it was associated with WordPress.com. If you need a refresher on the WordPress community drama, we have an article that will help you catch up. He said the company was short-staffed after the exodus of 159 employees, who took a six-month severance offer earlier that month. Since then, Automattic has been aggressively hiring and had already recruited 26 people this month. Mullenweg said that the second offer — which had nine months of severance and lost access to WordPress.org as part of the package — was designed to catch a leaker within the company giving out confidential information. He added that the company had to ask others who took the offer to stay until the next year as they were short-staffed. Talking about trademark issues, Mullenweg said in the initial days of Automattic, he gave the WordPress Foundation the WordPress trademark as investors were in control of Automattic. While the foundation still owns the trademark, Automattic has the exclusive license to use it commercially. Plus, Mullenweg said he has 84% of vote control at the company. When asked about what the other WordPress Foundation board members think about this battle, he said they are incredibly supportive and referred to the minutes of the meetings published on the foundation site — the post doesn’t mention anything about the trademark. Automattic CEO also talked about the legal battle with WP Engine and said that it might take a few years to resolve it. “Estimates I have heard from Neil [Katyal, the lawyer representing Automattic] in the case and others is that worst case scenario, if we lose everything, it would be kind of happening in 2026 or 2027,” he said. Earlier this year, Blackrock, one of the investors in Automattic, marked down their investment to almost half the value from the time they bought the shares in 2021. While Mullenweg didn’t directly address that markdown, he said the company generates around half a billion dollars in annual revenue, running at “break even or better,” and hiring aggressively. “We haven’t raised any primary capital and have no plans to,” Mullenweg said. Talking about the possibility of a WordPress fork because of ongoing tension in the community, Mullenweg said that would be fantastic. “There might be a fork. I mean, we’ve had WordPress forks before — probably about three or four times in the history [of WordPress]. That’s one of the beautiful things about open source is that there can be a fork,” he said.

Title: Bloomberg Analyst Attributes Surging Bitcoin ETF Inflows to FOMO Frenzy

Time Published: 2024-10-30T19:06:07Z

Spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have performed well in recent weeks, with consecutive inflows attributed to the recent surge in Bitcoin prices. At press time, these ETFs had $72.55 billion in net assets, equivalent to 5% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. On October 29, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF had its best day in terms of trading volumes in six months after recording $3.3 billion in value traded. During the day, the IBIT ETF posted $642M in inflows. The other Bitcoin ETFs also saw positive flows, apart from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which had $17M in outflows. Fidelity and Bitwise saw $133M and $52M inflows, respectively, while VanEck and Ark Invest posted $16M and $12M inflows. The total inflows by the US spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $870M, marking the highest inflows since June. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, the spike in volumes for BlackRock’s IBIT ETF was “a bit odd” given the slight gains in Bitcoin prices, Therefore, the high volumes could be a result of “FOMO-ing frenzy.” “IBIT is not alone – although by far the most – as all the main BTC ETFs saw elevated volumes in the past two days. If this is a FOMO Frenzy, we’ll see it show up in the flows next few nights,” Balchunas said. The inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs have made these products hit a crucial milestone. Following Tuesday’s massive trading volumes, these products have 995,663 coins. These ETFs are now inching closer to surpassing the total assets held by the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto holds 1.1M Bitcoin, and if these inflows continue, the products could cross the 1M mark by the end of the week. Balchunas noted that the Bitcoin ETFs had a “legit shot” of surpassing Satoshi’s holdings by the end of November. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has also surpassed another milestone after hitting $30 billion in assets after the recent inflows following the recent price surge. The analyst stated that the product reached the $30 billion mark in under 300 days, marking a record high. Data from the IBIT website shows that the product holds around 417,000 coins, making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders. Bitcoin traded at $71,953 at press time after a slight 0.7% gain in 24 hours. In the last seven days, Bitcoin has gained by around 8%.

Title: Bitcoin Price Primed For Monumental Surge To $100,000 By January 2025 — Market Researchers Explain Why
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-price-primed-for-monumental-surge-to-100000-by-january-2025-market-researchers-explain-why/

The wider crypto market has been abuzz following Bitcoin’s recent impressive performance, which has resulted in the premier crypto getting precariously close to revisiting its current all-time high price. Crypto research firm 10X Research has suggested that Bitcoin’s price could trade at least $100,000 by January 2025. The Bitcoin price prediction comes as Bitcoin enjoyed a rapid march above the $73,000 level, nearing the March ATH during late trading on Tuesday, before retreating slightly today. Analysts foresee Bitcoin at $100,000 by early next year. According to 10x Research, the six-figure target for the leading cryptocurrency is based on its model that recently produced two buy signals, with the recent one being on Oct. 14. The analysts claim that their prediction model has a track record of around 87% accuracy based on the previous 15 signals. 10X Research explained the rationale for the upbeat Bitcoin projection: “When Bitcoin sets a new six-month high for the first time in 6 months like it did recently, we typically see a median return of 40% over the next 3 months.” Given the analysts’ calculations, a 40% growth from the current market price of $72,200 would propel Bitcoin above $100,000 by Jan. 27, 2025. Soaring demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which now nearly hold 1 million BTC in assets under management, indicates massive institutional interest. These ETFs, launched in January 2024, attracted approximately $4 billion in fresh investor money in October alone. Moreover, institutional investors like BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, now consider BTC a viable long-term investment or digital gold. “Gold has always been seen as a safe haven asset, so if Bitcoin is the new digital gold, it makes sense that institutions would be interested,” 10X Research asserted. Meanwhile, the researchers also forecasted that Republican Party frontrunner Donald Trump would win the United States presidential election next week, which could be a considerable boon for the crypto market. Trump, who is known for his U-turn on Bitcoin in recent years, has promised to make America “the crypto capital of the world”. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted a hostile stance on crypto companies, prompting many in the industry to see the Democrats — who currently control the White House — as anti-crypto. The former president has also vowed to oust current SEC chair Gary Gensler on his first day of office. However, some pundits have maintained that the cryptosphere’s growth is inevitable regardless of who wins the election.

Title: Increasing Ways To Get AI Investment Exposure

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has clearly been the dominant investment theme of 2024 and is the next major technology wave. According to IDC, spending on AI will be in excess of $631 billion by 2028. With ever increasing interest and spending in AI, there are also a rising number of ways to participate in this massive theme. ETF baskets are a great way to gain exposure. Just this week, the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, launched two new ETFs, the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI) and the iShares Technology Opportunities Active ETF (TEK). There are likely many more on the way. However, not all are created equal. Some of the beneficiaries of AI may not be immediately obvious. These include Data Center REITs like Digital Realty Trust (DLR) and Equinix (EQIX) as well as companies that are involved with the construction the infrastructure for data centers as represented in the ETF PAVE. Also, the need to generate increased electrical production in the U.S. has had a positive effect on Utilities. In addition, nuclear power is making a comeback in the U.S. Hence, uranium stocks are performing better as one can see in the performance of URA. Stronger Performing AI Beneficiary ETFs: Figure 1: Weekly Charts of Leading AI-Related ETFs Weaker Performing AI Beneficiary ETFs: Figure 2: Weekly Charts of Lagging AI-Related ETFs Broad Market ETFs: Figure 3: Weekly Charts of the Above Two ETFs There are many use cases for AI, most relating to costs savings and efficiency/productivity gains across nearly every sector. Some of the larger being search assistance, automated machine learning, data-driven marketing, fraud/network intrusion detection, financial robo-advisory, supply chain optimization, factory automation, self-driving technology, drug discovery, and more recently generative AI, among others. There will be many opportunities in those companies that can harness the technologies. But we would like to now take a closer look at some of the beneficiaries of all of the spending happening to create the necessary infrastructure, in particular the powering of all of the growing use cases: data centers. In terms of data centers, according to industry estimates, the market size could rise from around $200B in 2022 to nearly $450B by 2028. McKinsey notes that electricity demand from data centers is expected to rise by over 150% by 2030. It usage will rise from under 2% compared to total installed capacity to >4% over the period. While it is a small portion, it is still a huge amount of new power needed. Hyperscalers like Alphabet, Meta, Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft, and Oracle (ORCL) account for around 40% of the data center capacity. Non-hyperscalers (colocation) account for ~25% and on premise for the remainder. Figure 4: Growth in Data Center Electricity Demand As we mentioned in our May Forbes article, “Power Up Your Portfolio With Utilities,” United States overall electricity demand should rise +1 to 3% a year for the next decade. Current estimates could continue to rise. Other more aggressive estimates put the percentage of electricity consumption from data centers in the high-single digits by 2030. Recent power supply deals from Microsoft and Alphabet underscore the coming growth, as well as the continued need to shift towards clean energy sources. Although the Nasdaq 100 and Mega Cap growth groups were huge outperformers over about an 18-month period from the beginning of 2023, they have trailed off in relative terms recently. There has been a shift in leadership from the spenders (hyperscalers) as the leaders to the infrastructure product and services, and energy providers, particularly related to data centers. Below are 25 O’Neil Industry Groups related in some way to data centers, detailed with some price performance and other metrics. Nearly all have been winners over the trailing 52 weeks, however, over eight to 13 weeks, there is a large separation between the top few and the rest. Figure 5: List of O’Neil Industry Groups Related to Data Centers In Conclusion The AI revolution offers many exciting investment opportunities beyond simply semiconductors and software. In particular, companies that construct, operate, and power data centers are likely to be strong beneficiaries of this massive trend. We encourage investors to explore these areas in greater detail as we believe many of these stocks will be market leaders over the next decade.­­ Kenley Scott, Director, Global Sector Strategist at William O’Neil + Co., made significant contributions to the data compilation, analysis, and writing for this article.

The BusConnects corridor linking Tallaght and Clondalkin to Dublin city centre, has been approved by An Bord Pleanála, almost a year after the decision was initially due. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has sought permission for 12 dedicated bus lanes as part of its programme to overhaul the capital’s bus system. The Tallaght/Clondalkin core bus corridor is the ninth scheme approved to date. The NTA submitted the Tallaght/Clondalkin application in April 2023. The board had been due to issue its decision in November 2023, but despite determining there was no requirement for an oral hearing, permission was not granted until this month. The 15.5km corridor will run from The Square Shopping Centre, Tallaght and Nangor Road, Clondalkin, to Nicholas Street near St Patrick’s Cathedral in the city centre. The route passes through Ballymount, Walkinstown, Drimnagh, Crumlin and Dolphin’s Barn, and is expected to remove more than 100,000 daily car trips from the roads. The BusConnects programme has two strands: a network redesign and the 12 bus corridors. Unlike the redesign project, which involves the reorganisation of services on existing road infrastructure, the corridors require construction to achieve segregation of bus and cycle lanes from traffic. In some instances this necessitates road widening, and the acquisition of property, including parts of front gardens, and felling of trees. An Bord Pleanála received 55 submissions on the Tallaght/Clondalkin project, mostly from local residents along the route, as well as 19 objections to compulsory purchase orders (CPOs) for land acquisition, the majority of which came from commercial property owners. The 55 submissions varied from residents concerned about the loss of privacy, green space and safety concerns in relation to road widening; to the reduction in space for cars and the requirement for private motorists to take more circuitous routes. Other submissions said insufficient provision had been made for cyclists, with bicycles required to share space with buses and cars over parts of the route. Most CPO objections related to loss of parking for customers and deliveries. One homeowner objected to the acquisition of 3m of his driveway, leaving him with 10m, which was insufficient, he said, as “parking is required for at least six cars and space to turn in the driveway”. In recommending permission be granted the board’s inspector Donal Donnelly said the scheme would “make a significant contribution to carbon reduction, the easing of congestion and the creation of more sustainable travel patterns for the growing population”. It was also “essential to bring about improved connections, particularly for non-car users, the disadvantaged and vulnerable road users”. [ Blanchardstown route is latest BusConnects corridor to be challenged in High CourtOpens in new window ] The impact on private car users had “been kept to a minimum”, he said. “The fact that two-way general traffic has been retained throughout most of this core bus corridor, indicates to me that the proposed scheme may have gone further to accentuate modal shift from the private car to bus transport/active travel. “Had the proposed scheme been designed at the present time, when climate change is becoming increasingly apparent, rather than a number of years ago, it may have been more radical in tackling car dominance.” However, he said, “on balance, I have concluded that the overall benefits of the proposed scheme considerably outweigh the negatives”. The eight other schemes approved by the board run to the city from Liffey Valley, Clongriffin, Belfield/Blackrock, Ballymun/Finglas, Swords, Ringsend, Blanchardstown and Lucan. Routes from Templeogue/Rathfarnham, Kimmage and Bray await the decision of the board. Three of the approved schemes, Clongriffin, Belfield/Blackrock and Blanchardstown, are the subject of ongoing judicial review proceedings. Construction of the first schemes is due to start next year.

The last quarter of the year has historically led to significant price increases for cryptocurrencies. With only two months left in 2024, investors are moving towards promising crypto projects. ETFSwap (ETFS) has gained the interest of the crypto community, with several industry observers regarding it as the hottest investment of 2024. ETFSwap (ETFS) is a groundbreaking crypto project that aims to add exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to the blockchain through tokenization. ETFSwap (ETFS) will allow its users to convert between cryptocurrencies and a range of ETFs, including Currency ETFs, Crypto ETFs, Index ETFs, Commodity ETFs, and more. Notably, the crypto project’s team will work closely with Mica-Compliant investment banks to guarantee the legitimacy and financial integrity of its tokenized assets. Thanks to its blockchain-based foundation, ETFSwap’s ETF transactions will be faster, safer, and more cost-effective, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks. The ETFSwap platform is also built on the ERC20 standard, which will allow for staking, token swaps, liquidity provision, and more. ETFSwap (ETFS) will redefine ETF trading further by providing market-making and perpetual trading capabilities, with round-the-clock market coverage and margin options of up to 10x. The platform will also feature the ETF Screener and ETF Tracker, which are AI-based tools that will conduct various analyses to give user-specific investment recommendations. To access the ETFSwap platform, users will require the ETFS token. This criterion gives the ETFS token utility and makes sure its holders use the complete set of ETF services and advantages offered on the platform. The ETFS token will also be used for other functions, including governance, fee payment, conversion, and interoperability. ETFSwap (ETFS) began with a private fundraising round, securing $750,000 from investors who share the crypto project’s vision. The presale round was then initiated to offer the opportunity for broader participation, with 40% of the fixed 1 billion ETFS token supply set aside for distribution. Since the presale launch, ETFSwap (ETFS) has achieved several key milestones. Most notably, the platform went live on the testnet on October 9, with its core functionality and UI thoroughly tested. Additionally, CyberScope and SolidProof audited the crypto project’s smart contracts and team KYC. ETFSwap (ETFS) was also successfully listed on CoinMarketCap, further boosting its credibility. The ETFSwap presale has also seen remarkable progress, with the ETFS price increasing by more than 350% from its Stage 1 value of $0.00854 to its current $0.03846 in Stage 3. This stage is already 62% complete, with less than 28 million ETFS tokens remaining and more than $5.61 million raised, reflecting strong investor confidence in the crypto project. Crypto ETFs have been rising in popularity in 2024, driven by major investment firms like BlackRock entering the space and the emergence of new options like Solana ETFs. ETFSwap (ETFS) is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this growing interest by offering a decentralized and more versatile platform for ETF trading and investing. The crypto project is also set to launch its own ETF in 2025, making it among the hottest investments of 2024. Additionally, ETFSwap (ETFS) includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, which also ranks among the hottest investments in 2024. The inclusion of AI-driven tools reduces human error, speeds up decision-making processes, and empowers users to make informed choices, ensuring a more robust and profitable trading experience. This gives ETFSwap (ETFS) a significant edge over many ETF trading platforms, potentially attracting more users over time. Furthermore, the massive investments and positive comments from crypto experts suggest that ETFSwap (ETFS) is gaining significant popularity while in its early stages. Low-cap tokens like ETFSwap (ETFS) are usually among the hottest investments because they have the ability to multiply in value rapidly as demand increases. This, coupled with a relatively low entry price, means that even small investments could yield substantial profits for investors, making ETFSwap (ETFS) one of the hottest investments of 2024. While investment varies depending on individual goals and risk tolerances, the technology, potential, and massive investments in the ETFSwap (ETFS) crypto project suggest that it could be one of the hottest investments of 2024.

Title: Ray Dalio doesn't like the choice between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump

Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio isn’t too thrilled about the prospect of either a Kamala Harris or (second) Donald Trump administration. “Both of the candidates worry me,” Dalio told CNBC in an interview at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. “This left, right and fighting each other is a problem as it becomes more of the extremes,” he said. “I think there needs to be a bringing of Americans together, that middle of that, and making great reforms. … There needs to be a strong leader of the middle, I believe, that makes great reforms. ... Neither of the candidates does that for me.” Dalio, who has previously criticized the worsening divisions in U.S. politics (going so far as to warn that the country may be “on the brink” of a civil war back in May), said he is concerned about a number of issues facing the country that he feels neither candidate is ready to address. “The debt is concerning, the internal conflict is concerning, the external conflict is concerning, and certainly the climate and the cost of the climate is concerning,” he said. National debt, which is nearing the $36 trillion mark, has become a major area of concern for Dalio, as well as several other business leaders, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM+1.22%) CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock (BLK+0.47%) CEO Larry Fink. “We have a real debt problem,” Dalio said. “I think one man’s debts is another man’s assets.” Dimon has similarly warned that the debt problem could be a thorn in the side of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to keep inflation down. The JPMorgan chief has said he is “a little more skeptical that inflation is going to go away so easily.” Although inflation has been trending downward, Dimon government deficits as a major inflationary risk that could cause price growth to spike again in coming years. Although Dalio said Trump will likely be better for domestic capital markets, both candidates’ plans will likely add to the ballooning debt. That’s in line with a recent report from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). The analysis found that both candidates’ proposed economic agendas are almost guaranteed to raise the federal debt by at least a couple trillion dollars — but Trump would add nearly double what Harris would contribute. While Harris would add $3.5 trillion in debt through fiscal year 2035, Trump is expected to add $7.5 trillion, according to the CRFB. According to a Goldman Sachs (GS+0.71%) report from September, a Harris win and a Democratic sweep would be the best-case scenario for the overall U.S. economy, noting that her middle-class tax credits would outweigh any downward pressure on investment from higher corporate taxes.

Here's how the company performed, compared with analysts' expectations based on a survey by LSEG: Revenue increased 16% year over year in the quarter, which ended Sept. 30, according to a statement. Net income rose 11% to $24.67 billion from $22.29 billion in the year-ago quarter. For the current quarter, Microsoft called for revenue in the range of $68.1 billion to $69.1 billion. That implies 10.6% growth at the middle of the range. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for $69.83 billion in revenue. Outside suppliers are late in delivering data center infrastructure to Microsoft, meaning the company won't be able to meet demand in the fiscal second quarter. "I feel pretty good that going into the second half of even this fiscal year, that some of that supply-demand will match up," CEO Satya Nadella said on a conference call with analysts. In August, Microsoft said it would revise the reporting of business segments to reflect its management approach. Mobility and security services, along with some Windows revenue, are now part of the productivity and business processes unit, which includes Office software. Revenue from productivity and business processes rose 12% to $28.32 billion in the quarter, topping the $27.9 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. It's 38% higher than the $20.45 billion midpoint of the forecast that management gave in July, because the actual total accounts for the changes. Investors received a clearer picture of cloud computing consumption at Microsoft. For the first time, the Azure and other cloud services revenue growth metric excludes mobility and security and Power BI data analytics sales. Azure growth for the quarter came in at 33%, or 34% at constant currency, with 12 points coming from artificial intelligence services. CNBC's consensus for Azure growth was 32.8%, while StreetAccount's was 29.4%. "Demand continues to be higher than our available capacity," Amy Hood, Microsoft's finance chief, said on the call. Hood called for 31% to 32% Azure growth at constant currency for the fiscal second quarter. The full intelligent cloud segment, including Azure, Windows Server and enterprise services, generated $24.09 billion in revenue. That's up 20% and slightly more than the $24.04 StreetAccount consensus. On Tuesday, Google reported 35% annual growth in its rival cloud business to $11.35 billion. Amazon, which leads the cloud infrastructure market, is scheduled to report results Thursday. Microsoft has shrunken the size of its segment called more personal computing through the reporting changes. In the latest quarter, it contributed $13.18 billion in revenue, up about 17% from a yeaer earlier and above the $12.56 billion StreetAccount consensus. The company saw 2% growth in sales of devices and sales of Windows operating system licenses to device makers. Industry researcher Gartner estimated that quarterly PC shipments declined 1.3%. Microsoft's AI investments continue to be a major focus for investors, as the company builds out its infrastructure and ramps up chip spending to handle heftier workloads. Microsoft is the main investor in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which was valued at $157 billion in a financing round earlier this month. As of Sept. 30, Microsoft had racked up more than $108 billion in finance leases that had not started, which UBS analysts have said might include third-party cloud spending to meet AI demand. At the same time, Microsoft has been spending more cash on property and equipment. In the first quarter, spending grew 50% year over year to $14.92 billion. The consensus among analysts polled by Capital IQ was $14.58 billion. As of Wednesday's close, Microsoft was up about 15% for the year, while the Nasdaq gained around 24% during the same period.

Title: Jefferies: Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) Is A Crowded Short Software Stock Among Institutional Investors
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jefferies-palantir-technologies-inc-nyse-154141255.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently made a list of Jefferies’ Top Crowded Software Short Positions: Top 9 Stocks. In this piece, we will take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) ranks on the list of crowded software short positions. With the close of 2024 approaching fast, artificial intelligence continues to set the narrative on Wall Street. The tail end of October marks the start of another highly anticipated earnings season, which for the most part, will continue to be dominated by AI. On the hardware front, investors will be on the lookout for whether the demand for AI GPUs is sustaining and if the firm that is the market leader is also improving its margins and profitability. For software stocks, investors will pour over profitability data to determine whether the billions of dollars invested in training and testing AI as well as in business partnerships are yielding results. For software stocks, their exposure to AI is so strong that it has divided the 2024 stock performance of some firms into neat halves determined by investor sentiment about their AI products. One such AI software stock ranked 5th on our recent list of AI stocks that insiders are selling. Looking at its year-to-date share price performance, it’s rather neatly divided into two halves that converge on June 13th. Year to date on June 13th, the shares were down 19.8% even though the firm’s fiscal 2023 revenue was a cool $19.4 billion and had grown by 10% annually. Before that eventful day, the firm’s first quarter had seen it grow revenue by 11% annually but struggle to keep costs low and profit margins high. Yet, the investor bearishness surrounding this well-known provider of productivity software tools such as Photoshop and Reader, would change in the blink of an eye. From June 13th to the third week of October, the shares have reversed course and gained 8.5%. In fact, between the 13th and September 12th, the stock had gained 27.9%. June 13th was the day that this firm reported its second-quarter earnings. The results led to its shares jumping by 13% in aftermarket trading, with investors impressed by the fact that the firm increased full-year guidance to range between $21.40 billion and $21.50 billion from an earlier $21.30 billion $21.50 billion. The optimism was driven in part by the firm’s Creative Cloud business which includes products such as Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, and Express. The AI addition to Creative Cloud was the firm’s set of generative AI models dubbed Firefly. Management shared that Firefly was at the heart of the ARR guidance bump to $1.95 billion as they shared: “We’re excited about the accelerating pace of innovation across the Digital Media business and pleased with the adoption of AI functionality as well as its early monetization across Document Cloud and Creative Cloud, including our flagship applications, Firefly Services and Express. We’re pleased to raise our annual net new ARR target to $1.95 billion and excited to deliver on our rich product roadmap in the second half.” With AI profitability driving the second-quarter earnings season, investors were naturally ecstatic and sent the stock higher. However, the June respite would be short-lived as the shares tanked by 13.4% in September. As usual, AI was the culprit. The downward trend started in the form of a 9.2% drop in after-market following the firm’s third-quarter report. It saw the company guide Q4 revenue at a midpoint of $5.525 billion which fell below the $5.61 billion analyst consensus. While this firm is a consumer and professional software stock, the broader software as a service (SaaS) industry hasn’t been spared by the AI-driven Wall Street trends either. SaaS and software stocks are predominantly valued through two metrics: the Rule of 40 and EV/Sales (or variants such as EV/EBITDA or Price to Sales). These multiples are somewhat unique to the software and SaaS stock narrative as they evaluate the firms based on their ability to grow. This is key since one of the main reasons behind SaaS stock popularity is that they do not have to deal with inventory, logistics, or supply chain issues like other businesses. In the AI era, SaaS valuation multiples and revenue growth estimates have been severely compressed. Data shows that the median price to forward sales SaaS multiple is 5.5x right now. The valuations are driven by lower growth expectations. After AI and the decimation ushered in by high interest rates, just 1% of SaaS and software companies have a 12-month future revenue growth rate higher than 30% as of June 2024. Digging deeper, investors have also placed a higher premium on growth as while firms with a Rule of 40 score greater than 40 have a median EV/Sales multiple of 8.9x, those with a growth rate greater than 30% but a Rule of 40 score lesser than 40 have a median multiple of 11.6x. These AI-driven software shifts, precipitated by worries of a reduction in SaaS demand due to businesses self-developing software using AI have also affected investor sentiment. According to Jefferies’ latest Trading Positioning Survey, 19% of institutional investors were overweight on software stocks as of October 2024, a sharp drop over July’s reading of 28% and January’s 51%. Yet, investors have also tempered their short positions as Jefferies shows that 54 software stocks were shorted as of October compared to 73 in July. Our Methodology To make our list of Jefferies’ top overcrowded software short positions, we ranked the top nine crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). An international stock trader intently watching the markets on a floor of monitors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 44 Shares Short % Of Outstanding: 4.36% Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) is a data analytics software provider that caters to the needs of the public and private sectors. It is one of the best-known players in the national security software market, and the firm has also been growing its presence in the US commercial market. On the commercial front–and particularly in today’s AI era–Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) benefits from the fact that it has set up teams that work directly with customers to assess their needs and develop specific solutions. This is important for software firms particularly in the AI era as firms might find it difficult to tailor AI to their specific needs. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR)’s approach has yielded results as well since the software company grew its commercial revenue by 70% in the second quarter. This was on the back of lucrative deals, with Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) adding 96 contracts worth more than $1 million each and 27 contracts worth more than $10 million each. Scout Investments mentioned Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “The top contributor to return for the quarter was Palantir Technologies. Sentiment improved on Palantir after it reported stronger than expected commercial customer revenue and free cash flow. U.S. commercial growth was especially encouraging, as U.S. commercial revenue was up by a large percentage year over year for the fourth quarter and U.S. commercial customer count grew nearly as much. We expect Palantir to become one of the premier artificial intelligence (AI) software providers, built on its Foundry and AIP platforms.” Overall PLTR ranks 2nd on our list of crowded software shorts according to Jefferies. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Long Bitcoin, Short Bonds: The New Billionaire Investors’ Strategy

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 30: Larry Fink on stage at the 2022 New York Times DealBook on ... [+] November 30, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Thos Robinson/Getty Images for The New York Times) Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin as an alternative to the fiat money system, and it increasingly embraces this role. In what may be the clearest signal of the bitcoin-fiat rivalry, more billionaire investors are turning to bitcoin as a hedge. Wall Street titans Larry Fink (BlackRock), Stanley Druckenmiller (Duquesne Family Office), and Paul Tudor Jones (Tudor Investment Corporation) have recently voiced their skepticism over U.S. monetary policy. At the same time, they acknowledge bitcoin as a modern-day substitute for gold, with real potential to shield their portfolios against inflation. Yes, inflation expectations persist, despite the official reports of a 2.4% inflation rate in September. These legendary investors warn that inflationary government policies and the escalating national debt may prolong inflation beyond current forecasts. This would make bitcoin, with its finite supply and decentralized nature, an attractive diversification asset. Speaking last week at Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative, Larry Fink reaffirmed his expectations for lasting inflation. BlackRock's CEO believes that "we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we’ve ever seen" due to the governmental inflationary policies. He added that we’re not going to see interest rates as low as forecasted, predicting only a modest 0.25% rate cut this year. Such an environment is not the best for investing in government bonds. Inflation will erode real returns, and with no sizable rate cuts, current higher-yield bonds won't appreciate enough to outperform. Stanley Druckenmiller takes an even more skeptical stance, openly betting against the Fed. "We shorted bonds the day the Fed cut 50 [basis points] because we thought it was a mistake," he said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this month. The veteran investor is known for achieving an average annual return of 30% over three decades at Duquesne Capital. He now notes that while the Fed is pushing a restrictive narrative, the market is signaling otherwise. “Equities at a record high, gold at a record high, GDP above trend, credit tight, bank earnings and forecasts look good... crypto going crazy. We don’t see any restrictions whatsoever.” Paul Tudor Jones tackled another persistent U.S. problem: the enormous $35 trillion national debt that seems to spiral out of control. The billionaire hedge fund manager told CNBC that inflation risks loom after November's election, as both Harris and Trump pledged to increase spending and cut taxes, worsening the debt outlook. Jones believes the only viable path forward is to inflate and grow out of the debt burden. This means maintaining low interest rates and allowing inflation to rise, "inflating away" the real value of debt. This would ease the debt burden while avoiding immediate austerity measures, notoriously difficult for any politician to implement. From this perspective, betting against bonds looks like a wise move indeed. However, does it mean that bitcoin can truly fulfill its role as an inflation hedge? The “digital gold” narrative is among bitcoin’s most famous ones. Yet, it is often challenged by people arguing that such a volatile asset cannot fulfill a safe haven role. In the past, this argument used to stand. Bitcoin volatility fluctuated between 50% and 140% in 2017-2020, but has since been on a steady downward trend. Since 2023, it has been ranging from 23% to 65%, making it comparable to equities and even gold. For context, the VIX (S&P 500 volatility index) has been 16-33% in recent years. The GVZ (CBOE gold volatility index) was 10-30%. As bitcoin adoption and its market cap grow, analysts expect the coin to experience fewer dramatic price swings. Bitcoin volatility from 2017 to 2024 compiled by The Block Skeptics also argue that bitcoin’s performance in past crises casts doubt on its reliability as a safe haven. At the peak of U.S. inflation in May-June 2022, when the Fed began raising rates aggressively, BTC dropped 55%. At the same time, risk-on equities of the S&P 500 fell by 15%, and the risk-off gold fell only by 6%. Market stress usually determines whether an asset is risk-on or risk-off. From this view, bitcoin has failed the test. However, it’s important to consider factors unique to the crypto market. In May 2022, the algorithmic Terra collapsed dramatically, wiping out $50 billion in valuation. Though not directly related to bitcoin, Terra’s crash caused significant reputational and financial damage to the crypto ecosystem, triggering a wave of bankruptcies. Another bitcoin particularity is its four-year halving cycle, which also affects its price dynamics. As investors grow more discerning, bitcoin may be seen as a standalone asset, less affected by the broader crypto market’s turbulence. Billionaire investors appear to have already grasped bitcoin’s subtleties and its potential as a hedge against inflation. Once an outspoken skeptic, Larry Fink now believes that "bitcoin is asset class in itself," considering it an alternative to other commodities like gold." Thus, he thinks that the application of this form of investment will be expanded. Under Larry Fink’s guidance, BlackRock’s bitcoin spot ETF has accumulated $28 billion in assets. In the words of the firm’s Head of Digital Assets, Robbie Mitchnik, bitcoin is an “emerging global monetary alternative." It is a “scarce, global, decentralized, non-sovereign asset” with no country-specific or counterparty risk. Mr. Mitchnik believes that these properties make bitcoin fundamentally different from risk-on assets. Paul Tudor Jones is even more direct: "I'm long gold. I'm long bitcoin. I think commodities are so ridiculously under-owned, so I'm long commodities." As to Stanley Druckenmiller, he famously said in 2023: “I don’t own bitcoin, but I should.” It is unknown if the legendary investor owns any coins today. However, he did say that crypto could play a big role in a renaissance because "people just aren't going to trust the central banks." Whether bitcoin can truly hedge inflation is a question only time can answer. Unlike short-term investments, inflation hedges need decades to prove their effectiveness. So far, bitcoin has beaten inflation: in the past ten years, the U.S. dollar lost 33%, while BTC gained 22,208%. Whether this continues is anyone’s guess, but it seems as if Wall Street has made its decision. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

NEXT | Does the Pre-Release Tavern Brawl add enough value to Blizzard's He... World of Warcraft’s 20th Anniversary Celebration is well underway, and if you’re hoping to acquire all of the collectible items from the event then you’ve got your work cut out for you. It will cost you nearly 500 Bronze Celebration Tokens if you want to snag all of the mounts, pets, toys, and cosmetics. Luckily, the event currency rewards for many quests and activities has been significantly increased from the amounts given at the start of the event. We’re talking a 400-800% boost from week one, which should allow players to earn all the bronze they need without spending the next two full months trudging to Tanaris at every log-in.The blue post that came along with the drop rate buff explains that players should be able to get all the tokens they need by playing the content they enjoy. The result is that a massive amount of event currency drops from all of the weekly activities in The War Within. You can earn easy tokens from these events, now in higher quantities:10 for Weekly Quests in Dornogal – Delves, Call of the Worldsoul, Archive, Bonus Holiday weekly8 for the weekly activities around Khaz Algar – that’s the Theater Troupe, Awakening the Machine, Spreading the Light, Azj’Kahet Pact, Special Assignments, Khaz Algar world bosses, and Wax Collecting15 for killing Queen Ansurek in Nerub-ar PalaceIf you’re not opposed to switching over to your PVP gear, you can also grab 15 tokens from the Conquest and Rated PVP weekly and 8 from the Honor, War Mode, and Brawl weeklies.If you’re interested in the rewards but not the celebration itself, it is now possible to set foot in the event grounds just once — to spend all of the Bronze Celebration Tokens that you acquired back on Khaz Algar over several weeks of running end-game content that you were going to do anyway. However, you can speed things up by actually participating in the activities outside of the Caverns of Time.There is just the one daily quest, Celebrate Good Fun!, which rewards 3 tokens. There are also several weekly event quests, each of which also rewards 3 tokens:Event World BossesChromie’s CodexClassic Timewalking DungeonsDefeating Emperor Thaurissan in Blackrock DepthsEarning 500 Honor in Korrak’s RevengeOnce you have earned 100 tokens across all sources, you’ll unlock the Token Collector achievement. This will enable further tokens to drop from the repeatable event activities, including:Classic Timewalking Dungeon completionsTimewalking Blackrock Depths bossesEvent World BossesCodex of Chromie competitionsDaily quests in Korrak’s RevengeIn essence, the new buffs to the currency drop rate take the edge off of getting your first 100 tokens. There isn’t one best strategy for getting all of the bronze you’ll need as quickly as possible. Instead, you can keep to your play style and still earn enough currency for a respectable amount of anniversary souvenirs without getting stuck in a months-long event grind.Is the 20th anniversary celebration not really your thing? Just make sure you keep up on your Khaz Algar weekly checklist. Take advantage of the experience boost to level some alts, and don’t forget things you might have started skipping over if you’ve already out-geared the rewards (like Special Assignments). Well before the end of the event you’ll have enough bronze saved up to buy out the event vendors.Do you need a break from spelunking through the same old weekly activities from The War Within? Once you collect your first 100 tokens, it will be much easier to feel like you’re earning enough event currency just by timewalking, slaying out-of-time world bosses, and helping Chromie repair the damage from her timeway shenanigans (yet again).Blizzard Watch is made possible by people like you.Please consider supporting our Patreon!Filed Under: 20th Anniversary, Bronze Celebration Token, Weekly Rewards, World Of Warcraft 20th AnniversaryAdvertisement The blue post that came along with the drop rate buff explains that players should be able to get all the tokens they need by playing the content they enjoy.

Title: BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF hits $30 billion, sets new record in 293 days

Full Content:
BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has hit $30 billion in assets setting a new record of 293 days, showcasing rising interest in crypto investments. The milestone from BlackRock comes 10 months after the company launched its spot Bitcoin ETF in January. Then, it was reported that BlackRock had traded $7.5 million shares within the first 10 minutes of launching. Now, BlackRock holds more than 417,000 Bitcoin, valued at $30.4 billion, according to iShares data. Taking to X, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, said what BlackRock has achieved is an “all-time record,” adding “the old record was $JEPI which did it in 1,272 days. $GLD took 1,790 days. Unreal.” Also $IBIT has crossed the $30 billion mark in assets after monster flows and price appreciation yesterday. It hit this milestone in just 293 days, an all time record.

At the time of publishing, the number sits around 983,000. If such a milestone is reached Balchunas believes that the combined spot Bitcoin ETFs could surpass Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet, which holds 1.1 Bitcoin, by mid-December. “That said, anything can happen, eg a violent selloff and all this is delayed albeit still inevitable,” he added. “On flip, if prices keep going up, Trump wins, we could see FOMO could kick in and it all happens faster. Stay tuned.” COUNTDOWN: US spot ETFs are scheduled to hit 1 million bitcoin held by next Wed and pass Satoshi by mid-December (before their first birthday, amazing). They've been adding about 17k btc a week.

Title: Bitcoin nears all-time high, but THIS concern rises – Is a pullback likely?

If investors cash out, BTC’s bull rally can likely lose momentum. Bitcoin [BTC] is on the verge of making history yet again in 2024. AMBCrypto recently reported that this week would be crucial for dictating BTC’s prospects, determining whether it would align with the cyclical trend and climb higher or lean toward the monetary outlook and decline. Well, looks like the king coin has taken the former path. On the 29th of October, the leading cryptocurrency surged past the crucial $70,000 mark, for the first time since June. It reached a peak of $73,620 on Binance—just over a hundred dollars shy of its all-time high of $73,777. At press time, BTC was exchanging hands at $72,350, up by approximately 2% over the past day. This impressive rally reignited bullish sentiment among investors. Yet, it also raised a pressing question: Will this breakthrough trigger a wave of profit-taking? Recent activity suggests potential sell-offs may be underway. According to Lookonchain, following Bitcoin’s surge past $71,000, a whale wallet holding 749 BTC (worth $53.23 million) became active after remaining dormant for 12 years. This whale originally accumulated BTC back in 2012 when Bitcoin was priced at just $11, totaling an investment of $8,151 at the time. Now, it has transferred out 159 BTC ($11.32 million). Another major player potentially preparing to cash out is the Government of Bhutan. Blockchain intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence revealed that crypto wallets linked to Bhutan’s Royal Government moved $66.55 million worth of BTC to Binance. Notably, their last exchange deposit was four months ago, in early July. At the time of writing, Bhutan held 12.47K BTC, valued at $904.34 million. Source: Arkham Intelligence While sell-offs loom, BlackRock remained firmly committed to Bitcoin. As noted by Lookonchain, the asset management giant purchased another 4,528 BTC worth over $322 million on 28th October. Furthermore, in the past two weeks, BlackRock significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, adding 34,085 BTC to its portfolio. This addition was valued at approximately $2.3 billion. The latest purchase brought its holdings to 408,253 BTC, valued at a staggering $29.09 billion, signaling strong institutional interest in the asset. Despite Bitcoin’s remarkable price performance, retail appeared to be sleeping on the asset. Google Trends data revealed that search interest for “Bitcoin” scored just 17 out of 100, last week. At press time, the value was slightly up at 23. Source: Google Trends Meanwhile, CryptoQuant’s latest report indicated that retail participation was overshadowed by larger investors. While retail investors were gradually re-entering the market, their holdings, however, were growing at an unusually slow rate. Additionally, Bitcoin transfer activity among retail investors remained relatively low. Daily transfers totaled just $326 million on September 21, marking the lowest level since at least 2020. Historically, low transfer activity by retail investors often precedes price rallies for Bitcoin, a trend seemingly playing out now. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 Therefore, as Bitcoin approaches record highs, the interplay between whales, institutes, and retail could shape its short-term trajectory—one that may set the stage for either unprecedented highs or a profit-taking pause.

Title: Florida CFO advocates adding Bitcoin to state pension funds for strategic growth

Patronis champions Bitcoin as a hedge and diversifier for Florida pensions, aligning with DeSantis's anti-CBDC stance. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis has urged the State Board of Administration (SBA) to consider adding Bitcoin to the state pension funds. On Oct. 29, Patronis sent a letter to Chris Spencer, the executive director of the Florida State Board of Administration, highlighting Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold.” He emphasized how Bitcoin could diversify the state’s portfolio while offering a protective hedge against the volatility of other major asset classes. Patronis stressed that protecting the financial stability of Florida’s pension funds for teachers, police officers, and firefighters requires securing the best possible returns. He argued that Bitcoin could be a strategic addition, offering a compelling opportunity within the crypto sector. The CFO pointed out that his proposal aligns with Governor Ron DeSantis’s stance against central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which contrasts with the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. According to him: “[Bitcoin] is the antithesis of a central currency, providing decentralized digital currencies managed on blockchain technology, not issued or controlled by any government agency.” Considering this, Patronis asked the SBA to prepare a report analyzing the feasibility, risks, and benefits of investing state retirement funds into Bitcoin. He suggested that this report would help lawmakers make informed decisions ahead of the next legislative session. Patronis added: “The State Board of Administration maintains a Florida Growth Fund that allows for more innovative and emerging investments, and a Digital Currency Investment Pilot Program could be a perfect fit, offering potential benefits we cannot afford to overlook.” As of Jan. 2024, the Florida Growth Fund has authorization to allocate up to 1.5% of the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund toward high-growth investments. This fund invested around $998 million from 2022 through 2023. Patronis noted that other states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, have started investing a small percentage of their pension funds in crypto. Earlier this year, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board invested $164 million to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offered by Grayscale and BlackRock. Similarly, the State of Michigan Retirement System owns around $6.6 million shares in ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Influence Media Partners Are Redefining Music Rights

Lylette Pizarro, founder and co-managing partner Influence Media Partners. Influence Media Partners, founded in 2019 by Lylette Pizarro, is revolutionizing music rights management by investing in and actively managing high-value music catalogs of diverse artists. The company differentiates itself through strategic partnerships, a focus on diversity, and active management of music properties to enhance value and promote artists' legacies. Pizarro's extensive experience and understanding of the evolving music rights landscape led to the company's formation. Influence Media Partners has secured $750 million in funding from prominent entities like BlackRock and Warner Music Group, enabling its expansion. Since its inception, the company has grown substantially, expanded its portfolio across diverse genres, and launched new ventures like SLANG, a frontline label focused on nurturing emerging talent . NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - SEPTEMBER 18: Stevie Frasure, Lylette Pizarro, Ben Vaughn, Jesse Frasure, ... [+] Spencer Nohe, Lynn Hazan and Phil May attend the Jesse Frasure Return to Calm Springs Listening Experience in Partnership with Rhythm House, Influence Media Partners and Warner Chappell at Soho House Nashville on September 18, 2023 in Nashville, Tennessee. Influence Media Partners is disrupting the music industry by not just investing in but actively managing high-value music catalogs and has raised $750 million for two funds and is currently raising for its third fund. Founder Pizarro is a seasoned music and entertainment strategist who gained extensive experience working with Fortune 50 companies. In her role at RPM, she negotiated transformative music partnerships with artists, record labels, and songwriters. Influence Media focuses on diverse artists with the potential to create enduring cultural impact. The firm targets active artists and songwriters with a history of engaging their fans and creating music across various genres who want to continue building their legacy and intellectual property. ““Lylette is a force that brings a sense of power and prestige to a songwriter in my shoes,” describes Nicolle Galyon, Grammy Nominated singer, songwriter and producer. “Having her invested in my copyrights and my creativity gives me a posture that I didn’t previously have.” For many folks investing in music, “it is just a buy and sell strategy," Pizarro explained. "The way Influence has thought about it is invest and build—invest, partner, and build. We're in constant dialog with the managers and artists directly, and thinking about new ways to unlock value, which is truly different to the marketplace." This commitment to partnership and building value sets Influence Media apart. Rather than simply acquiring catalogs and waiting for returns, the company leverages its team's expertise to actively enhance the value of its music properties through strategic marketing and brand building. This approach, combined with a strong emphasis on diversity and strategic alliances, has enabled the company to identify a unique position in the industry. Pizarro's deep understanding of the evolving music rights landscape honed over 20 years in the business, has been key to the company's success. She recognized a shift in the market and saw an opportunity to build a new platform that champions the artists and holds their catalogs. Influence Media’s unique approach has attracted significant investment from industry heavyweights like Warner Music Group. "Lylette has a fresh and thoughtful approach to acquiring and working culturally and commercially impactful catalogs which is delivering real results,” said Temi Adeniji, Managing Director of Warner Music Africa and SVP of Sub-Saharan Africa at Warner. “We're collaborating on exciting projects with artists as varied as Enrique Iglesias, Future, and Tainy, who have all placed their trust in Lylette and her team to help build their musical legacies." The firm also attracted investment from BlackRock. “Lylette's vision for the industry, ability to create meaningful and long-lasting relationships, and unyielding work ethic underpin her success,” explained Paul Braude, chief investment officer and head, direct private opportunities at BlackRock. These partnerships provide crucial financial backing and strategic support, enabling the company to expand its portfolio and reach. Warner Music Group, in particular, was instrumental in establishing early credibility and trust for the first-time fund. Since its launch, Influence Media has achieved remarkable growth. The company has secured $750 million in funding, expanded its portfolio across diverse genres with catalogs from artists like Enrique Iglesias and Blake Shelton, and launched new ventures like SLANG, a frontline label and publisher focused on artist development. Slang has signed Will Smith, Future, Truththebull and RaiNao along with Grammy-winning producers such as 30 Roc and Camper who have worked with the likes of Big Sean, Mary J. Blige, Cardi B, and Roddy Ricch. Lylette Pizarro, founder and co-managing partner at Influence Media Partners, Lex Borrero, a ... [+] prominent music executive, producer, and co-founder of NEON16, and Melissa Vargas, Brand Manager at Parkwood Entertainment attend Influence Media toasts René McLean at GRAMMY Week at The Maybourne Beverly Hills on February 02, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. Fundraising for a new venture is always challenging, and Influence Media was no exception. The team pitched their vision to 200 investors, a testament to their dedication and perseverance. As a first-time fund manager, Pizarro lacked the established track record that institutional investors typically seek, making the process even more difficult. To overcome this, she strategically assembled a team with a unique blend of expertise in both music finance and traditional investment. This ensured that her strategy was clearly articulated and her execution plan was solid, increasing the confidence of potential investors. The Influence Media management team boasts a wealth of experience besides Pizarro’s. Co-managing partner Lynn Hazan brings 25 years of experience as CFO at Sony Music Group, while partner Rene McLean has a strong background and creative experience in music and entertainment strategy and licensing. Founding advisor and investor Jon Jashni offers expertise in media investment and content production while Danny Klotz, head of underwriting, possesses deep experience in finance and analytics. “Making sure that the investment team was both a mix of music FP&A [financial planning and analysis] and classic investor DNA was critical,” Pizarro explained. This diverse team was laser-focused on strategically investing in music rights, differentiating themselves in a crowded marketplace filled with institutional capital. Their strong point of view on recorded music and songwriter rights, combined with a clear articulation of their strategy, helped them stand out. Pizarro also had to overcome the hurdle of being a woman and a minority—Latina—in a predominantly male industry. “Her [Lylette] drive is matched only by her passion for music and by the care she has for those around her, whether it be the team she has built at Influence, the partners for whom she delivers or the artists with whom she partners, said Pam Chan, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of Mosaic at Lingotto.” Influence Media is a diverse company, with women and minorities comprising a significant portion of its leadership. “We were 66% female leadership and 66% diverse,” Pizarro shared. Perhaps because of this, Pizarro and her team faced skepticism and questions about their ability to succeed. However, they persevered and ultimately secured major investments. “Ultimately, we found the right partners, and they have been fantastic partners to us,” Pizarro affirmed. These strategic partnerships not only provided financial backing but also enhanced the firm's credibility, demonstrating to other investors that Influence Media could achieve its ambitious goals. Warner Music Group's involvement, in particular, signaled trust and credibility, while BlackRock's investment brought significant financial weight and further solidified the company's industry standing. How have you overcome doubts about your ability to succeed?
