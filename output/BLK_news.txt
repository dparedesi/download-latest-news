Share this article On the macro level, crypto markets have been thrown into turmoil as geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran escalate, challenging the notion of “Uptober” and raising questions about digital assets’ role in times of global crisis. As the conflict unfolds, its ripple effects are being felt across financial markets, with various cryptocurrencies and ETFs experiencing significant volatility and substantial liquidations. The immediate aftermath of Iran’s missile attack on Israel saw Bitcoin plummet to $60,200, marking a sharp 6% decline from recent highs around $64,000. This downturn wasn’t isolated to Bitcoin, as Ethereum and other major altcoins also suffered losses, with Ethereum dropping over 4% and Solana falling more than 5%. The market turmoil led to massive liquidations, with Coinglass reporting $523.37 million wiped out in just 24 hours. Long positions bore the brunt of the impact, with $451 million liquidated, compared to $71 million in short positions. This volatility resulted in the liquidation of 154,011 traders, highlighting the widespread impact of the geopolitical crisis on crypto markets. The rapid market decline has significantly altered investor sentiment. The crypto fear and greed index, a key metric for gauging market sentiment, plummeted from a “greed” level of 61 to a “fear” level of 42 in just two days. This dramatic shift underscores the market’s sensitivity to external geopolitical events and their profound influence on investor behavior. Moreover, US spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced substantial outflows, with aggregate withdrawals of $242.53 million on October 1 alone. This marked the largest outflow in nearly a month and the third-largest in five months, indicating a broader retreat from crypto assets amid heightened global uncertainty. The current crisis challenges the narrative of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a safe haven during global turmoil. While some proponents have long argued that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it an ideal hedge against geopolitical risks, its recent performance alongside traditional risk assets suggests otherwise. However, not all analysts view this downturn as a long-term setback. André Dragosch, European head of research at Bitwise, suggests that Bitcoin has historically shown resilience in recovering from geopolitical shocks. “Geopolitical news should generally be faded,” Dragosch noted, implying that the current market reaction might be overblown. Supporting this perspective, a recent BlackRock report posits that Bitcoin’s decentralized and non-sovereign characteristics could actually protect it from the economic uncertainties that often plague traditional assets during global crises. This viewpoint suggests that while short-term volatility is inevitable, Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition remains intact. The crypto market’s decline mirrors movements in traditional financial markets, with major stock indices also experiencing losses. This correlation raises questions about cryptocurrency’s ability to act as a diversifier in investment portfolios during times of global instability. Investors’ shift from cryptocurrencies to gold amid the conflict reflects a broader risk-off sentiment pervading financial markets. This movement challenges the notion of Bitcoin as “digital gold” and highlights the ongoing debate about its role in a diversified investment strategy. As geopolitical tensions escalate in the Middle East, the crypto market faces a complex landscape of challenges and opportunities. Regulatory scrutiny is likely to intensify, with authorities potentially focusing on crypto’s role in sanctions evasion and illicit transactions. This heightened oversight could coincide with shifting institutional perceptions of digital assets as a viable investment class, potentially impacting long-term adoption trends. Simultaneously, the crisis may accelerate technological innovations in blockchain, driving the development of solutions aimed at enhancing financial sovereignty and resilience against global shocks. The current turmoil serves as a critical test of the crypto market’s maturity, potentially catalyzing more sophisticated risk management strategies and market structures. While cryptocurrencies currently show high correlation with traditional assets, future crises may reveal a growing decoupling as digital assets’ fundamental value propositions gain broader recognition. How the market navigates these challenges could significantly influence its trajectory, potentially solidifying crypto’s role in the global financial ecosystem or exposing vulnerabilities that could hinder wider adoption. As the situation unfolds, market participants will be closely watching for signs of the crypto market’s resilience and adaptability in the face of geopolitical uncertainty. The coming weeks and months could be crucial in shaping perceptions of digital assets’ role in a diversified investment strategy and their ability to weather global storms.

Title: Fidelity now 22,000 BTC away from top 10 Bitcoin holders replacing US Government

Institutional Bitcoin adoption highlighted as Fidelity nears major milestone. Fidelity is on the verge of joining the top 10 Bitcoin holders, needing just 22,000 BTC to surpass the US government’s holdings, according to data from TimechainIndex. Currently holding 182,757 BTC or 0.9248% of the total supply, Fidelity stands at the 11th position. In contrast, the US government holds 204,302 BTC, accounting for 1.0338% of the supply. As of press time, Fidelity’s holdings amount to around $11.1 billion; an additional inflow of approximately $1.3 billion would take it to the top 10. On Sept. 27, it saw $227 million in inflows in a single day. However, it has mostly seen flat flows over the past month, with just 22 days of net outflows since its launch in January. This shift highlights the increasing involvement of traditional financial institutions in the crypto market. Fidelity’s potential move into the top 10 illustrates a broader trend of institutional adoption of Bitcoin. The company’s holdings are primarily through its US ETF and custody services. The top Bitcoin holders include entities like Coinbase and Binance, with unspent Coinbase rewards from 2009 leading the list at over 1 million BTC. MicroStrategy is also a significant holder, though it has been surpassed by BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, which holds 365,310 BTC.

Title: Bitwise Investments Prepares for Potential US-Listed XRP ETF, Filing in Delaware Sparks Speculation
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/10/bitwise-investments-prepares-for-potential-us-listed-xrp-etf-filing-in-delaware-sparks-speculation/
Time Published: 2024-10-02T08:03:33Z
Full Content:
Bitwise Investments has taken its first steps toward a potential XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), with a filing on 30 September 2024 in Delaware. Listed under the State of Delaware’s Division of Corporations, the filing was confirmed by a Bitwise spokesperson to Cointelegraph. However, this move appears to be part of preliminary preparations, and it could be months before a formal application is submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), if at all. According to a report by Ana Paula Pereira for Cointelegraph, this development aligns with previous comments from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who predicted in May during an interview at the Consensus 2024 conference that an XRP ETF was only a matter of time, especially after the successful introduction of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the United States. If approved, an XRP ETF would provide institutional investors with a secure, regulated avenue to invest in the cryptocurrency, potentially increasing trading volume and adoption. The Cointelegraph report pointed out that although the Delaware filing is a significant early step, it doesn’t indicate an imminent SEC application. According to the report, the process could still be in the preparatory stages, and a formal filing could take months if it happens at all. This news also stirs memories of the fake filing in November 2023 when an application for a “BlackRock iShares XRP Trust” briefly fueled XRP price gains of 12% before being debunked. Delaware authorities are still investigating that incident. Meanwhile, Ripple continues to grapple with its legal battle against the SEC. Though the July 2023 ruling deemed XRP not a security in public exchanges, a recent September 2024 appeal has put the final decision on hold, delaying the ultimate outcome of the case. Update on 2 October 2024 at 1:30 p.m. UTC Earlier today, Bitwise issued a press release to confirm that it has indeed filed an initial registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. SEC for a spot XRP ETP. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley had this to say: “At Bitwise, we believe blockchains will usher in new, apolitical monetary assets and permissionless applications for the 21st century. It’s why for the past seven years we’ve helped investors access the opportunities in the space, and we’re excited to continue that work with our filing for a Bitwise XRP ETP.“ The press release went on to say: “XRP is the digital asset that powers the XRP Ledger (“XRPL”) public blockchain. XRPL is best known for its role in facilitating cross-border payments and remittances, as well as newer capabilities that enable institutional participation in Decentralized Finance (“DeFi”), real-world asset tokenization, and EVM interoperability. XRPL typically processes transactions in seconds with fees under $0.01. It also has more than five million active wallets and a decade-long track record of reliability.“ Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, explained on social media platform X why he found this move by Bitwise noteworthy: Point being that XRP ETF prob coming at some point…Bitwise just early.Politics clearly matter here in short-term, but I think this is all inevitable over time.IMO, Bitwise longer-term roadmap is to offer this in an ETF wrapper.Next step will be full tokenization. pic.twitter.com/xQUD1wfiAm Featured Image via Pixabay The views and opinions expressed by the author, or any people mentioned in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.

Title: Malaysia bags another cloud deal from U.S. Big Tech with $6.5 billion pledge from Oracle
URL: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/10/02/oracle-invests-malaysia-cloud-computing-big-tech-ai/

Full Content:
The Southeast Asian country of Malaysia is getting another multibillion-dollar investment from U.S. Big Tech, the latest in the region’s drive to capitalize on the AI boom. On Wednesday, Oracle announced it would invest at least $6.5 billion toward a public cloud region in Malaysia. A cloud region is the real-world location where cloud facilities are located. Oracle said the new facilities would enable its customers in Malaysia to leverage AI services, and help Malaysian organizations modernize their digital applications. “Malaysia offers unique growth opportunities for organizations looking to accelerate their expansion with the latest digital technologies,” said Garrett Ilg, Oracle’s executive vice president and general manager for Japan and Asia Pacific, in a statement. Malaysia’s minister of investment, trade, and industry said Oracle’s investment will support the country’s ambitious plan to create 3,000 smart factories by 2030. Oracle’s cloud investment follows a similarly sized pledge from Amazon. In late August, the U.S. company’s cloud computing division promised $6.2 billion in investment for Malaysia. Microsoft and Google have also announced multibillion-dollar investments in Malaysian cloud infrastructure. Malaysia is working to position itself as a tech hub in Southeast Asia. In addition to data centers, Malaysia is courting semiconductor investments in a bid to move up the chip supply chain. The country is working on a national cloud office and AI strategy, Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Tuesday at the groundbreaking ceremony for Google’s new $2 billion data center complex. The U.S. company claims the investment will create 26,500 jobs and generate $3.2 billion in economic activity by 2030. Other Southeast Asian economies are attracting cloud-related investments. In May, Amazon pledged to invest $9 billion into its existing cloud infrastructure in Singapore by 2028. The Southeast Asian city-state has been a regional data hub for the U.S. company since 2010. On Monday, Google said it will invest $1 billion in Thailand to build a new data center and expand the country’s cloud infrastructure. Microsoft also says it has a “significant commitment” to build new cloud and AI infrastructure in Thailand, according to CEO Satya Nadella in May. Microsoft is promising $1.7 billion in cloud- and AI-related investment in Indonesia, as well. The investment in Southeast Asia’s data centers is part of a global push to invest in computing capacity to fuel new AI services. Last month, a consortium of companies including Microsoft and BlackRock pledged to mobilize $100 billion in capital to invest in new data centers. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bitcoin Falls 3.5% Amid Rising Middle East Tensions After Israeli PM Promises Iran Will ‘Pay’ for Its ‘Big Mistake’

As tensions rise in the Middle East, commodities like gold and crude oil are seeing notable price increases, while Bitcoin has taken a downturn. This divergence has reignited debates over Bitcoin’s role as a safe-haven asset. According to a report by Martin Young for Cointelegraph, on Tuesday, gold surged by 1.4%, reaching $2,665 per ounce, close to its all-time high. Meanwhile, crude oil prices spiked by 7% to $72 per barrel. These gains came after airstrikes across Israel, with Israeli air defenses intercepting most of the 180 missiles launched. Bonds and the U.S. dollar also saw gains, further signaling investor anxiety. “Investors are seeking refuge in gold amidst the uncertainty in the Middle East,” commented Li Xing, Financial Markets Strategist at Exness. Contrary to its usual label as a “safe haven,” Bitcoin dropped more than 3% over the same 24 hours, falling from an intraday high of $64,000 to a low of $60,315 before slightly recovering to $61,800. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $61,693, down 3.5% in the past 24-hour period. Coinglass data reported that around 154,770 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations amounting to $521 million. According to Reuters, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that Iran’s missile attack on Israel was unsuccessful and promised a response. He remarked that Iran had made a significant miscalculation and would face consequences. Netanyahu emphasized that the Iranian regime underestimated Israel’s resolve to defend itself and retaliate against its adversaries. This isn’t the first time Bitcoin has reacted negatively to geopolitical conflict. A similar drop occurred in April following a drone attack by Iran on Israel. Some analysts, like Jeroen Blokland of Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, believe that investors are selling Bitcoin to buy gold. Meanwhile, Adam Cochran and Jesse Colombo have questioned Bitcoin’s reliability as a safe haven, although the former’s comments may have been partly made in jest. Precious metals, by contrast, tend to perform better during such crises. Colombo argued that Bitcoin behaves more like a risk asset similar to tech stocks, which also fell. The best analyses are based on one day of data Now, juxtapose Bitcoin's intraday chart with gold:https://t.co/VmrayqxDNn However, it is worth noting that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested in July 2023 that Bitcoin could still serve as an alternative hedge against inflation. Larry Fink today said he hopes SEC “looks at their ETF filing as a way to democratize crypto and make it cheaper.” Also says bitcoin is international asset, new gold. Seems all-in, wants to work w regulators to get approval. altho unsure of timetable.

Title: BlackRock's CEO says China is the biggest supporter of Russia's economy amidst the Ukraine war

China is Russia's biggest war backer, BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink said on Tuesday. Fink spoke at a panel at the Berlin Global Dialogue conference when he said that Western businesses need to re-evaluate their relationship with China. "Russia's biggest supporter and fundamental supporter of the Russian economy is China. And that has to be at least discussed," Fink said. "Each country, each company, has to reassess what that means, and I'm not here to make any judgments, but I don't believe there's been enough assessment." Earlier in the panel, Fink expressed surprise that there hasn't been a "larger questioning or demanding" of China's support for Russia amid the latter's war with Ukraine. "You're supporting our enemy, we're putting billions and billions of dollars into supporting the survival of Ukraine, and there should be a cost to that," Fink said of China. Fink told dialogue attendees that China's continual backing of the Russian economy also means BlackRock may need to review its operations in the Chinese market. "We have businesses in China, I'm sure everybody here has some businesses in China," Fink said. "We all have to re-evaluate that, like we have to re-evaluate a risk in liquidity traps, a risk in everything," he added. Representatives for Fink at BlackRock did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours. China has been a critical lifeline for Russia as it continues to struggle under the West's crippling economic sanctions since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. In 2023, Russia and China's bilateral trade hit a record $240 billion, per Chinese customs data. "Russia's economy is suffering long-term setbacks, and the country is sealing its fate as China's economic vassal," CIA director William J. Burns wrote in an opinion article for Foreign Affairs in January. To be sure, China has been trying to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine. China has claimed to be neutral when it comes to the war in Ukraine. In February 2023, China unveiled a 12-point peace plan, but that was rejected by Russia. In July, Finland's President Alexander Stubb told Bloomberg in an interview that Russia's reliance on China means the Asian giant could end the Ukraine war if it wanted to. "I argue that Russia is so dependent on China right now that one phone call from President Xi Jinping would solve this crisis," Stubb told the outlet. "If he were to say, 'Time to start negotiating peace.' Russia would be forced to do that. They would have no other choice," he continued. Jump to

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot parent company is looking to grow in the U.S. after scaling back in China. editor PARIS — SMCP has named Ida Simonsen as president and chief executive officer for North America, effective immediately. Simonsen, previously president at Stella McCartney, joins a French group that houses contemporary brands Sandro, Maje, Claudie Pierlot and Fursac. Simonsen had been at the McCartney company since 2012, and previously held roles at Marni and Dries Van Noten. Simonsen will succeed Paul Griffin, who is leaving the group. “Ida’s dynamic leadership, extensive industry expertise, and passion for people make her the perfect fit to lead our North American team. She has a proven track record of successfully navigating transitions and driving growth, and I am confident that she will inspire our teams and help us achieve new milestones in the region,” SMCP chief executive officer Isabelle Guichot said, disclosing the hire exclusively with WWD.

Simonsen also helped guide Stella McCartney through its shareholder transition, when McCartney exercised her option to buy back Kering’s 50 percent stake in her brand in 2018, then sold a minority stake to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton a year later. SMCP is in the process of restructuring its operations and global network balance. It is looking to grow its business in new territories including India, Indonesia and the Philippines after retreating from China following several quarters of declining sales there. The SMCP group operates about 1,600 stores in 46 countries. Business in the U.S., Canada and Mexico has been stronger, with sales up nearly 9 percent in first-quarter results reported earlier this year. It is expanding its footprint in the region, including opening a new Sandro store in Montreal later this month. SMCP itself is undergoing a shareholder change. Holding company Glas, which is serving as the trustee for creditors including funds BlackRock, Carlyle, Anchorage, Boussard and Gavaudan, was just given the green light to sell its shares by the London High Court. The anticipated Glas sale would position SMCP as ripe for a potential takeover bid.

Title: Big Tech’s Undersea Cable Empire is Building Tomorrow’s Digital Economy

Innovation can’t exist without foundational infrastructure networks to support it. Last week, PYMNTS reported that the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership, which is spearheaded by Microsoft, BlackRock and others, is planning to spend up to $100 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, ensuring that the plumbing is in place for the connected economy’s future. After all, the digital infrastructure being built right now isn’t just for the tech elite — it’s the foundation for how the world will do business. But data centers alone won’t enable the future of global connectivity. Internet access requires the internet, which is traditionally delivered around the world via undersea cables. Today, a network of these active undersea cables spans the oceans in a literal internet services value chain, connecting continents and facilitating the high-speed transfer of data essential for everything from video streaming to cloud computing to financial transactions. Traditionally, telecom companies and consortiums of government-backed entities have built and maintained undersea cables. But this has shifted as Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon expand their role in infrastructure. Google is a part or sole owner of around 33 subsea cables, Meta owns more than a dozen, Microsoft counts five and Amazon four. In the past 10 years alone, the amount of international cable capacity used by just that same quartet of tech giants has surged from 10% to 71%, according to a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. As businesses and consumers demand faster, more reliable connections to conduct transactions, Big Tech’s investments in these undersea cables are becoming essential for everything from online banking to cross-border trade. These cables are about more than just data transfer and cloud capacity. They’re the unseen threads stitching together the fabric of a connected economy. Read more: How 10 Payments Executives ‘Do’ Digital in the Post-Pandemic Age The global economy relies on digital infrastructure to support commerce and payments. As consumer habits shift toward digital transactions and as businesses expand into international markets, the importance of robust, secure data infrastructure becomes paramount. Global payments, for example, are facilitated by real-time data transfers that cross national borders instantaneously, supported by undersea cables. More than $150 trillion in cross-border payments are made every year, and the volume is expected to grow as digital commerce continues to expand. Payment networks require low latency to ensure that these transfers happen quickly and securely, especially as transactions are increasingly verified through real-time risk assessments powered by AI and other data-intensive tools. The quicker and more reliably data can be transferred, the smoother and more secure the world of commerce becomes. For example, as more businesses migrate their operations to the cloud, they can benefit immensely from fast, uninterrupted data connections across the globe. And as the world moves toward more digital and real-time payment solutions, the underlying infrastructure becomes even more critical. Technologies like blockchain, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and instant payment platforms depend on low-latency, high-capacity networks. These innovations have the potential to transform cross-border commerce by reducing friction, lowering fees and speeding up settlement times. Read more: Meta Says It’s Solving AR Experiences — Who Will Solve AR Payments? Yet, all of these improvements rely on a physical layer of infrastructure — particularly undersea cables — that can support the demands of these payment systems. At the same time, as global trade and eCommerce expand, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, the need for fast, secure connectivity grows exponentially. Big Tech’s investment in undersea cables in these regions opens up new avenues for expanding digital economies, enabling even remote regions to participate in global commerce seamlessly. Data from PYMNTS Intelligence finds that consumers in the U.S. alone engage in an average of 14 different digital activities each month: paying bills online, conducting telehealth visits, streaming music and videos, and shopping and paying for groceries and retail products using digital payments and apps. PYMNTS’ Karen Webster covered last month (Sept. 3) how, as digital becomes the DNA of business, success won’t be measured by the products a business makes or sells, but how well they create and monetize ecosystems that connect activities across traditional industry sectors. “As I have written many times, payments is the cornerstone for this digital transformation,” she wrote.

Title: BREAKING: First XRP ETF Filed By Crypto Asset Manager Bitwise In Delaware

Time Published: 2024-10-01T21:18:46Z

As Ripple approaches a resolution in its ongoing legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), crypto asset manager Bitwise Invest has taken a significant step by filing the first application for an spot XRP ETF in Delaware. This filing, reported by Fox journalist Eleanor Terret, was officially submitted on September 30, and sources within Bitwise have confirmed the authenticity of this development. The approval of this ETF could have considerable implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. The filing comes at a pivotal moment for Ripple, as the company is awaiting the SEC’s decision on whether to appeal a recent court ruling that could potentially pave the way for greater regulatory clarity around XRP. Should the SEC choose not to appeal, it may bolster the case for XRP as a viable investment option, making the timing of Bitwise’s application particularly strategic. However, the path to approval is not straightforward. Like previous applications for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs—which were approved in January and July of this year, respectively—Bitwise’s filing will need to undergo rigorous scrutiny and meet various regulatory requirements set forth by the SEC. The agency’s review process can be lengthy, and approval may not come until next year. The filing of an XRP ETF could also signal a shift in the regulatory landscape, potentially opening the door for other financial institutions, such as BlackRock, to pursue similar applications. Moreover, this development may create a ripple effect for other cryptocurrencies seeking to enter the ETF space. Speculation is already growing around the possibility of a Solana ETF, which could be the next asset to attract interest from investors. It remains to be seen what other information can be revealed in the coming days by the asset manager, but the first filling of the first US spot XRP ETF is official. At the time of writing, the XRP price has shown no change from the broader market, posting losses of 3% in the 24-hour time frame, resulting in a current trading price of $0.6028. However, a potential XRP ETF market could have a notable price impact as more institutions could flock to invest in the token.

Title: Coinbase exec hopes for better crypto regulations after the election

With less than 35 days until the U.S. presidential election, the crypto industry seems to be hoping for more favorable regulations in the near future. At Messari’s annual Mainnet conference in New York City, Shan Aggarwal, the vice president of corporate and business development at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) Ventures, touched on the industry’s regulatory uncertainties. “We’re hoping for the best,” he said in an exclusive interview with Quartz. His remarks highlight the sector’s anticipation that the coming election could lead to clearer, more supportive legislation. “The current SEC, it’s hard to go down from here,” Aggarwal said. “[Gary Gensler] has taken a regulation-by-enforcement approach towards the entire crypto industry, including Coinbase.” Aggarwal is scheduled to speak at the conference Wednesday, where he will discuss Coinbase’s investments, mergers, and acquisitions over the years, as well as its future strategic direction. This year, Coinbase partnered with traditional financial giants such as BlackRock to offer a platform for the tokenization of funds. Of that collaboration, Aggarwal said, “Coinbase acts as the bridge between traditional finance and crypto that touches different customer segments including retail customers, institutions, businesses.” Messari is a leading provider of market intelligence for the crypto and Web3 sectors. Its three-day conference brings together prominent crypto leaders, investors, and industry professionals to explore the rising trend of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) and integrating traditional financial instruments on blockchain — a signal of decentralized technologies moving toward mainstream adoption. This year, Messari made headlines when CEO Ryan Selkis resigned after a series of controversial tweets about U.S. immigrants, violence toward Trump opponents, and civil war. During 2021’s Mainnet event, the SEC served two subpoenas to the speaker of the event, Terraform Labs founder and then-CEO Do Kwon. Kwon, once a crypto king, was arrested in March 2023 for forging travel documents while trying to flee Montenegro. He is currently awaiting extradition to either the U.S. or South Korea, where he faces potential charges. At this year’s conference, Messari introduced Messari Copilot, an AI assistant designed for the crypto industry. This tool delivers text-based answers to user queries based on Messari’s research and data, providing a comprehensive view of the crypto landscape.

Title: BREAKING: Bitwise files for XRP ETF via Delaware trust

Share this article Crypto asset manager Bitwise has taken a step toward launching an XRP ETF. According to a filing with the Delaware Division of Corporations, the company has established a trust that could serve as the foundation for a potential XRP ETF. As of this writing, no corresponding documentation has appeared in the SEC’s EDGAR database, which is the typical repository for official ETF proposals. This action follows a pattern seen in the crypto ETF sector, where asset managers create trusts before seeking approval from the SEC for an exchange-traded product. The filing has drawn attention within the crypto community, particularly among those interested in XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple. XRP has been a subject of regulatory scrutiny in recent years. The path to an approved XRP ETF may face challenges. The SEC has approached crypto-based ETFs with caution, only recently approving Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs after a lengthy process of applications and regulatory discussions. Bitwise’s action follows the launch of Bitcoin ETFs by firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity earlier this year. These approvals marked a shift in the regulatory landscape for crypto investment products. A potential XRP ETF would represent another development in the integration of digital assets into traditional finance. However, regulatory approval is not assured, and the process could be lengthy. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Bitwise’s filing for an XRP trust via Delaware is a development that market participants are watching. It could potentially lead to new investment vehicles for XRP, a crypto that has been the subject of ongoing regulatory and market debates. Last month, Grayscale introduced an XRP trust in the US targeting accredited investors, potentially paving the way for an ETF conversion, amidst Ripple’s ongoing legal confrontations with the SEC.

Title: Defense Stocks Hit All-Time Highs Amid Middle East Escalation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/01/defense-stocks-hit-all-time-highs-amid-middle-east-escalation/

In a predictably grim phenomenon tied to outbreaks of global violence, aerospace and defense stocks climbed to record prices in an otherwise down day for the stock market, as Wall Street reacted to the latest escalation in the Middle East by anticipating larger contracts for military suppliers. Lockheed Martin stock rose Tuesday to a record high. The stocks of several major U.S. defense contractors rallied Tuesday, as Lockheed Martin, RTX (previously Raytheon), Northrop Grumman and L3Harris all gained more than 2.6%, rising as the Israeli military reported missile strikes from Iran a day after Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon in its conflict against Hezbollah. Both Lockheed Martin and RTX shares booked all-time highs Tuesday, while L3Harris and Northrop Grumman tallied their top share price since 2022. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense exchange-traded fund rose 1.2% as the BlackRock-managed fund indexing the sector hit a new all-time high of its own, extending its 12-month gain to 43%, beating the baseline S&P 500’s 33% rise over the period. The defense stock rally came as the broader market slid, with the S&P falling 0.8%, tracking toward its worst loss since Sept. 6. The decreased risk appetite tied to the war was one of several negative catalysts for the broader market, as investors digested inflation concerns tied to the dock worker strike and shares of Apple, by far the largest company in the world by market value, fell 3% on reports of light iPhone 16 demand. 5%. That’s how much prices for international oil benchmark Brent crude oil rose Tuesday by about 1:15 p.m. EDT, which would have been by far the largest single-day gain of 2024, according to FactSet data. The oil surge moderated quickly, with Brent up less than 1% by 3:15 p.m. EDT. Defense stocks typically gain during times of heightened conflict as the companies’ revenues rely heavily on U.S. government contracts, which often grow when allies like Israel and Ukraine are at war. Tuesday’s market backdrop evoked unpleasant memories of the setup in late 2021 and 2022, when supply chain issues and military conflict (Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) caused global inflation to surge and stocks to fall as central banks rolled out growth-stifling interest rate hikes to slow price increases. But economists largely believe the U.S. port strike won’t have the same impact on inflation as the 2021-22 supply chain snags. Wall Street’s fear gauge rose to its highest level in three weeks Tuesday, as the CBOE volatility index (VIX) climbed 10% as traders dealt with new concerns in addition to fears about a potential U.S. economic slowdown. But “although the VIX is edging higher it remains sufficiently just below 20 to suggest that markets…do not yet envision an all-out military scenario” in the Middle East, noted LPL Financial’s chief global strategist Quincy Krosby in a Tuesday note to clients. ​​ One Community.

The U.S. had warned earlier that a ballistic missile strike from Iran was being prepared against the foreign ally. Later, the Iranian Mission to the United Nations said on Twitter (aka X) that Tehran's response “has been duly carried out.” Bitcoin’s price fell 3.2% to $61,300 amid the volley, hitting its lowest price in two weeks, though it has ticked back up to $62,200 as of this writing. The dip reflected a lackluster start to so-called Uptober, a period of historically seasonal strength for “risk assets” like stocks and crypto. Is the Uptober in the room with us right now? pic.twitter.com/FAzk7quFkI — Pop Punk (@PopPunkOnChain) October 1, 2024 While Bitcoin has gained traction among investors as a “store of value asset” against inflation, the coin hasn’t consistently performed well as a “flight to quality asset” during times of geopolitical conflict, Grayscale Investment’s Managing Director of Research Zach Pandl told Decrypt. “Investors who are concerned about high geopolitical risks are, for now, still reaching for the traditional instruments,” he said, pointing to physical gold and U.S. Treasury bonds. Despite Tuesday’s dip, Pandl added that Bitcoin’s correlation with risk assets could shift alongside Bitcoin’s adoption by countries in the coming years. “In the longer term, when Bitcoin is widely held around the world and a reserve asset for central banks and governments, it may also be a common flight-to-quality asset,” Pandl said. “But Bitcoin is still much earlier in its journey than treasury bonds or gold.” While bursts of geopolitical conflict have previously dented Bitcoin’s price, asset managers like BlackRock have recently highlighted Bitcoin’s ability to serve as a hedge. This month, the firm said Bitcoin can diversify against “geopolitical tensions, concerns over the state of U.S. debt and deficits, and increased political instability.” President Joe Biden said Sunday that an all-out-war in the Middle East must be avoided as Israeli airstrikes battered Lebanon, killing dozens of people, per the Associated Press. The strikes followed last week’s killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a major blow to the Iran-backed militant group and political party in Lebanon. Bitcoin: “We’re a global reserve of value like digital gold, that you want to hold in uncertain times” Bitcoin during WWIII: *Dumps* https://t.co/vVVLXMuhYG — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) October 1, 2024 The escalation between Israel and Iran caused Bitcoin to sell off “sharply,” according to André Dragosch, Bitwise’s European Head of Research. But he said on Twitter (aka X) Tuesday that Bitcoin has “historically performed relatively well following major geopolitical risk events,” adding that “geopolitical news should generally be faded.” Tuesday’s unease was reflected in crude oil prices, as WTI spiked 3.6% past $70 a barrel. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) rose 0.5%, reversing weakness seen in the dollar’s strength since mid-September. Gold jumped 1.3% to $2,670 per ounce. Stocks were down, however, alongside leading cryptocurrencies. If rising oil prices translate into rising consumer prices, Pandl said the Federal Reserve is unlikely to abandon its easing campaign. He contrasted supply shocks with the possibility of persistent demand from China’s oil-hungry economy post-stimulus. “I think it would be likely that the Fed would look through any temporary increase in inflation,” he said. “A more important consideration could be [...] the huge stimulus that we've seen from the Chinese government in the last couple of weeks.” Bitcoin’s price plunged in April alongside geopolitical conflict in the Middle East after Israel struck Iran with a barrage of missiles. The dip to $60,000 was preceded a week earlier by missile and drone strikes in the region that also rattled Bitcoin’s price. In February 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had an instantaneous impact on the crypto market. Bitcoin’s price dropped 9% to around $35,000, as $200 million was swiftly wiped away from the global market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s negative performance following geopolitical risk events is quite common, Bitwise's Dragosch told Decrypt in a statement. At the same time, Bitcoin’s track record suggests they have short-term impact on the asset’s price before exhibiting “significantly positive performance.” Dragosch referenced research he published with ETC Group earlier this year, which found that Bitcoin saw outsized returns following geopolitical risk events in the past, from France launching airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria in 2017 to the aftermath of Osama bin Laden’s death in 2011. The research discussed how Bitcoin’s resistance to censorship and lack of counterparty risk align with the characteristics of safe-haven assets. Additionally, Bitcoin’s newfound scarcity with each so-called halving could bolster its performance relative to gold. “It is still a risky asset but its character will likely continue to change over the long run with every halving and increasing scarcity,” Dragosch said. “Bitcoin has evolved from a very risky asset to a safer asset over the past years.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Editor's note: This story was updated after publications with additional analyst comments and detail.

Crypto long positions endure cascading liquidations for the past 24 hours as Iran launches an air strike against Israel. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin (BTC) crashed in tandem with stock markets on Oct. 1 as tensions continued to escalate in the Middle East after Israel announced ground operations in Lebanon, which has prompted Iran to take action. The official account of Israel Defense Forces on X shared at 4:36 P.M. UTC that Iran was firing rockets at Israeli territory. Additionally, reports claim that Iran is likely to send a second wave of missiles targeting Israel in the ensuing hours. As a result, over $489 million was liquidated over the past 24 hours, with the majority of liquidations — $312 million — occurring within the past four hours, according to Coinglass data. Long liquidations accounted for $416.6 million of the total, while short liquidations amounted to roughly $73 million. According to CryptoSlate data, BTC was trading at $61,598 as of press time, down 3% over the past day. Major altcoins displayed heavier corrections following the news. Ethereum (ETH) was down 4.31% as of press time and trading at $2,490, while Solana (SOL) was down over 5.51% and trading at $146.8. Toncoin (TON) and Dogecoin (DOGE) registered the worst performance, tumbling 6.2% and 7.3%, respectively, to $5.33 and $0.1063. The Fear and Greed Index — which measures crypto investors’ sentiment daily — fell from the greed zone at 61 points to the neutral area at 50 points in 24 hours. The US equities market also registered losses today, with the S&P 500 (SPX) shrinking 1.1% and the Nasdaq Index pulling back 1.85%. Nvidia (NVDA) stocks are down 4%, and Apple (AAPL) shares fell 3.6%. Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index is up 0.6%, followed by a 1.1% leap registered by the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index (XAU). Jeroen Blokland, founder of the Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, stated on X that investors are “literally selling” BTC to buy gold amid the intensification of the conflict. However, he added that Bitcoin’s average return as a hedge against geopolitical events has proven to be a good decision since 2020. Citing a BlackRock report, Blokland highlighted that BTC outpaced the 60-day returns of SPX and gold during the US-Iran conflict and Covid outbreak in 2020, the deflagration of war between Russia and Ukraine in 2022, and the US banking crisis in 2023. At the time of press 6:57 pm UTC on Oct. 1, 2024, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is down 2.44% over the past 24 hours.

Title: Here’s The Actual Reason Why The World’s Second-Largest Asset Manager Vanguard Snubbed Bitcoin ETFs
URL: https://zycrypto.com/heres-the-actual-reason-why-the-worlds-second-largest-asset-manager-vanguard-snubbed-bitcoin-etfs/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T16:02:04Z
Full Content:
Back in 2017, legendary investor Jack Bogle infamously cautioned investors to “avoid Bitcoin like the plague”. Roughly seven years later, Vanguard has still ignited the ire of crypto enthusiasts by sticking to the conservative investment principles of its late founder. Despite the euphoria unleashed by chief rival BlackRock being among the issuers of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on American stock exchanges, Vanguard still won’t touch the new BTC products with a ten-foot pole. Bloomberg’s top ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has revealed why Vanguard, which currently holds approximately $7.2 trillion in assets under management, continues to shun Bitcoin spot investment vehicles, unlike its peers. According to Balchunas, the Pennsylvania-based company has traditionally steered clear of commodities, which Bogle dismissed as “total speculation” since they are “only worth what someone else will pay you.” Bogle favored assets with intrinsic cash flow over mere commodities like Bitcoin. Even as billions flowed into the newly-launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, Vanguard has maintained that it has no plans to offer its clients any crypto-related products. The Bloomberg ETF pundit described Vanguard’s paternalistic decision to block Bitcoin ETFs on its enormous trading platform as “a bit nanny state-ish.” He contends that their “highly intelligent” investors should be able to decide for themselves whether or not they want to gain direct exposure to the burgeoning crypto. Vanguard’s rejection of Bitcoin and crypto in general stands in contrast to its industry peers. BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Invesco have all debuted spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs this year, while major US banks like JPMorgan are serving as authorized participants for the products. Meanwhile, earlier this year, Vanguard named Salim Ramji, a former BlackRock executive who oversaw the company’s launch of its Bitcoin ETF (iShares Bitcoin Trust), as its new CEO. This move triggered chatter on social media that the asset manager might change its stance. However, despite his BTC-friendliness at BlackRock, Ramji quickly poured water on the idea that he has intentions for Vanguard to offer its clientele trading access to any of the multiple spot Bitcoin products on the market. That being said, despite the asset management behemoth eschewing Bitcoin ETFs, it still has indirect exposure in the dominant cryptocurrency by market cap as it is presently the second-biggest institutional holder of MicroStrategy — the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.

The investment firm, known for its role as an active investor in various funds and trusts, increased its holdings by 19,386 shares, bringing its total ownership to a substantial 55,794,604 shares in BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust. This purchase reflects Saba Capital's continued confidence in the trust's performance and potential. BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust, listed under the ticker BIGZ, is part of BlackRock's suite of investment products and focuses on long-term growth and innovation strategies. The trust's shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and this latest acquisition by Saba Capital is likely to be of interest to investors and market watchers alike. The transaction was disclosed in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Saba Capital Management, L.P. and signed off by Zachary Gindes on behalf of the firm, as well as by Boaz Weinstein, indicating the investment firm's continued strategic interest in BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust. Adding to the recent share purchase by Saba Capital Management, L.P., BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ) presents an intriguing profile for investors. According to InvestingPro data, BIGZ boasts a remarkable dividend yield of 13.74%, with the most recent ex-dividend date on September 16, 2024.

Title: Major Bitcoin Miner CEO Reveals Unveils His Plan For AI

MARA CEO Fred Thiel thinks that retail investors are giving small competitors too much credit for artificial intelligence plays that will not pay off for years. He has a vision for his company that plays to its core strengths. Marathon CEO Fred Thiel is making a play for the AI market on his terms Fred Thiel is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of MARA, bringing over 35 years of extensive experience in the technology sector. In this discussion we cover a wide range of issues including how Marathon is adapting to the wave of smaller miners gravitating towards artificial intelligence, what separates his firm from some of the other pure-play miners, and how U.S. politics and the upcoming presidential election will affect the outlook for the mining industry. Forbes: Can you give an overview of how you've tried to position Marathon Digital Holdings within the world of bitcoin mining? Fred Thiel: We look at ourselves as sitting at the point of convergence between energy transformation and digital infrastructure. From a bitcoin mining perspective, we're the largest of the publicly traded miners today, operating 13 sites across four continents. We use a variety of different technologies and we're the only one of the large bitcoin miners that has a fully vertically integrated tech stack. What that means is we operate our own mining pool, which is what orchestrates all our miners around the world and is the interface to the Bitcoin blockchain. All the other miners use third-party pools that are either Foundry, for example, or Chinese pools. We also operate our own firmware, which runs in miners and then we have developed and designed our own cooling infrastructure. We have single-phase and dual-phase liquid cooling, both of which don't use water, so that is totally water-free, and this is a really exciting area as we move into providing digital infrastructure to the AI industry because it's the exact same infrastructure that's used by both industries. The other thing that is unique is we cofounded a company called Auradine, which is the only U.S. bitcoin mining ASIC manufacturer. Their miners can support multiple chip failures and still run so they can operate in wider temperature ranges. So what does that all add up to? To me, it means as a miner we have access to technologies that not necessarily other miners do and we continue to press the envelope on deploying that technology. Our data center in Abu Dhabi, which is all liquid immersion cooling, is a preeminent site. There are two data centers, a total of 250 megawatts, that have 99.8% uptime running in a very harsh environment, which is obviously the Middle East desert next to a body of water. It's very humid so liquid cooling is the only way to go. Our strategy initially was one of being asset light. We focused on just growing rapidly by hosting with third parties. Then earlier this year we shifted to vertically integrating and we acquired 54% of our capacity’s infrastructure, and as we continue to grow in coming years that number will get closer and closer to 100%. We tripled our capacity in 2023, we'll double it again this year and we'll continue to grow at a pretty great rate. Lastly, we're the second largest holder of bitcoin of publicly traded companies in the U.S. and our strategic focus really is to amass as much bitcoin as we can. That's our core treasury asset and we do that through mining and also going into the markets and buying opportunistically when it makes sense. Forbes: What metrics do you pay the most attention to and how does the development and investment you detailed help give you a leg up on the pure bitcoin miners? Thiel: A couple of things. I talked about how we operate 13 sites on four continents. We don't have a concentration in a particular region or state. Riot Platforms is 100% concentrated in Texas today. They're trying to solve that by acquiring Bitfarms and then they've acquired another small site, I think in Kentucky. CleanSpark was heavily focused on Georgia. Now they're focusing on Kentucky as well. The challenge with being focused on just one area is you're very susceptible to your energy utility and energy market pricing in that region. In the case of Riot, they have the double whammy of two big sites in Texas and you have curtailment issues, weather issues and community issues, which in Texas are not small things. In the case of CleanSpark, they operate lots of very small sites. Operationally that is a very different issue because now you have to have people spread all over managing these disparate small sites and it may mean you don't have the opportunity to really aggregate the scale and get the benefits of scale in the same way. But Marathon is operating on different continents, so we also have the ability to avoid the risk of regulatory regime issues in the U.S. For example, in the Biden budget, there were attacks specifically on energy used by bitcoin mining. The Harris administration seems like they are befriending AI, but they are still going to be antagonistic to bitcoin mining. By the way, you can't give AI energy at one price and not give bitcoin mining energy at the same price. Not only would the industry attack that issue, but it's a type of commercial discrimination, which could be viewed as illegal. But more importantly, there is a huge symbiosis between AI and bitcoin mining because AI workloads vary just like demand on the grid varies and bitcoin miners have a unique ability to synchronize their load to AI miners loads such that you don't get this huge variance of demand on the grid. So when you marry bitcoin miners and AI operators together, you get a much better grid profile. You have the ability to stabilize the load, and you have an ability to use more of the intermittent energy—solar, wind—than AI can use. If you look at our technology piece, operating our own pool, it's very transparent to our investors; they can see every block that we win. By operating your own pool, you do a couple of things. One is you pay a pool operator a percentage of your winnings for them to operate the pool. It's 1% or 2% depending on the size of the miner; we don't have to do that. Then we have systems like Slipstream, a non-standard block submittal service that people in the Ordinals world really love. It allows us to get higher fees for submitting blocks to the network than the normal mempool would pay, so that gives us additional revenues on top of the traditional transaction fees that we get. We also have a Layer 2 called Anduro, which people are now starting to develop applications on. Forbes: Can you speak a little more about how Anduro is constructed? Thiel: It's a Bitcoin L2 that is essentially a clone of the Bitcoin network. It can process transactions much faster. It can do things that you can't really do as easily on the L1 of Bitcoin, but it anchors all its security, and it's pegged to the L1. You can, for example, do transactions in a much easier way than you can with lightning. Lightning requires you to open channels and close channels. This is a true sidechain, so you could build a digital identity network on it. You could build a MLS for real estate on it. You could build a transaction processing system for credit card remittances, whatever you may want to have. One of the applications that’s been built on it, which will be released soon, is called Alys, and Alys is a full EMV system from the Ethereum world that lets you take an application built for Ethereum and port it directly to Bitcoin. And then going back to our liquid cooling technology and the ASIC technology, we have technology advantages in that we can build miners specific to the use case. So in Finland for example, we have a small data center that heats 11,000 homes. How are we doing that? We're doing it through district heating by capturing heat from the miners. We have the ability to build custom miners for use cases. We recently made an investment in a company in San Diego, and what they do is they go in and they over-dimension solar systems for homes with solar panels and batteries and they use the excess capacity to mine bitcoin. Realize that solar energy has zero marginal cost, and so if you put 10 kilowatts of panels on a house versus six kilowatts of panels, the only difference in cost is the capital expenditure for the panels. Then all that extra energy can be used for bitcoin mining. More importantly, you can also heat water with the heat from the bitcoin miners. And what they do is they provision this and then they sell electricity to the consumer at 25% below market price. That fits into this model of the long tail of bitcoin mining, which is highly decentralized bitcoin mining, putting it out at the edge and leveraging zero-cost energy. So what you'll see from us over the next couple of years is a move towards the cost to mine being covered by services we're providing to the parties with which we’re partnered. That’s an obtuse way of saying we believe–and we're in the process of signing agreements with large partners–that people will pay us for the benefits of marrying bitcoin mining to different applications. And in doing so, our cost of energy will go towards zero. Forbes: Hash price continues to go down, and your stock price, along with other pure-play miners, has trailed that of Bitcoin and some of the other smaller miners that have made more direct overtures towards AI. What do you think of those things? Thiel: A couple of things. At the beginning of this year you started to see the shift from bitcoin miners to kind of MicroStrategy and the ETFs because of the coming halving. Any miner was suddenly going to produce half as much bitcoin, and so their costs were going to go up. Essentially, they'd be less profitable, so it's only logical to think that their market cap would be impacted. At the same time, MicroStrategy was out there buying $2 billion worth of bitcoin, and that became very attractive for people to do. The investment community–I'll go away from the retail side for a minute–the hedge funds, the volatility investors, love bitcoin mining because you get a lot more alpha than you did just by investing in bitcoin. It's the same reason Warren Buffett invested in gold miners versus gold because he likes the fact that when gold price runs up, gold miners’ cost to extract doesn't necessarily go up. The same generally holds with bitcoin miners. There's a six to nine-month lag as bitcoin price runs up before the cost to mine really starts jumping because the cost of mine is driven by either energy costs or global hash rate and the difficulty rate going up. And so if you have to go buy new capacity, buy new miners and deploy them, there's a six to nine month lag in that process. So you have this period of high profit when bitcoin price moves quickly. When bitcoin price does not move quickly, it moves sideways, buying spot bitcoin is much smarter and that also gives you an insight into our HODL strategy and why we go and buy bitcoin in the market sometimes. But MicroStrategy and Marathon and the other big miners have options that there's an options market. And so the ball players love it. They can do all sorts of very creative stuff and if you look at the stock prices, they tend to move pretty much in a pattern where they move up at the beginning of the week and down at the back half of the week. And that all has to do with selling calls and then buying back the calls after you short the stock. You can see very specific trading patterns for all the companies. The smaller guys were generally ignored previously, and now people have said the big guys are well-valued, and the smaller guys should be valued similarly on a per exhash basis. I think they're giving the small guys too much credit. Look at Cipher, they've signed up 350 megawatts of new stuff, but it's not going to come online for 12 to 18 months, yet the stock price goes up. So that's retail chasing that. Our investor makeup interestingly has changed this year in that in the first quarter we had about 39% institutional and now we're up closer to 60%. The institutional investors are seeing the value in our story because of how we position the transition to AI. I do not think that a miner like TerraWulf or Hut8 can go and build and operate a hosting center for AI very effectively. It is not the same thing as running a bitcoin mining site. Forbes: What is the investor makeup? Are these buy and hold investors? Thiel: Our single biggest shareholder today is BlackRock. They hold 13% to 14% of our shares, in both their managed and unmanaged funds. Same thing with Fidelity. You have basically BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, and then some long list of others after that. But I think what we're certainly seeing when we're out talking to investors is the people who are starting to talk to us with interest are the ones who are looking at what we're doing around AI infrastructure and how that opportunity is very different from traditional bitcoin mining. Traditional bitcoin mining is a zero-sum game, and every four years, you get slapped in the face with a price increase effectively. As you start looking at digital infrastructure in the AI space, you now have the benefit of providing technology or services to these hyperscalers. The area we believe is most interesting is AI at the edge, which is all about inference. The inference marketplace is still two to three years from growing a lot because people are still busy building these LLMs [large language models]. If you read Sam Altman's white paper that he published recently, basically, his argument is you have to invest heavily in LLMs so that you have essentially something for inference to query. The way I put it is LLMs are the brain and inference is how you make money off of AI. Inference is the digital twin that is sitting in a factory, running a factory, and leveraging a model that sits up in the cloud, and the model is updated daily, sent back down to the edge, and it operates at the edge. There will be tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of these modular data centers that do inference at the edges spread all over the place. Forbes: Let’s talk more about the HODL strategy. You've hinted at some very strategic decisions that affect how you leverage your balance sheet when updating equipment and making investments versus procuring bitcoin on the spot market. Can you break that down a little more? Thiel: When you are investing in bitcoin mining, you are betting on the fact that you will be able to produce bitcoin at a lower cost than you could acquire it in the open marketplace. So if I'm going to spend $100 million dollars and buy bitcoin, I get that bitcoin tomorrow, and then I get the benefit of its price appreciation over the hold period, and let's just say I'm going to hold it for 36 months. If you assume it will go up 20%-plus a year, you have that price appreciation in the bitcoin, and your basis is today's price. If you are going to go into the mining business, your bet is I'm going to invest $100 million dollars in infrastructure that will likely go live in about 12 months on average. It could be shorter if you're buying an existing site that's running and you're just going to replace the miners. And so you need to over the following 24 months, mine not just as much bitcoin as you acquired where you bought the bitcoin today, but enough bitcoin so you're also covering your cost of power, etc., such that at the end of the period of time you end up with more dollar value of bitcoin than you did just by buying it today. What that requires is a belief in what the price of bitcoin is going to do in the long term. And so when we have access to capital, there are times when we will choose to go into the market and buy bitcoin versus invest it in adding more mining capacity because sometimes there's a lag in how long it takes for us to deploy the capital when we're adding mining capacity. Forbes: You recently met with Donald Trump. Can you share your experiences or takeaways from that round table? Thiel: Former President Trump has been very well briefed and understands the value proposition that bitcoin provides to the U.S. as a country and the opportunity that bitcoin mining provides for the U.S. to be the dominant player in processing bitcoin transactions and securing the bitcoin blockchain. It's a little bit like the gold reserves the U.S. holds. The U.S. holds 40% of the gold reserves of the world because in the event there was ever an attack on the U.S. dollar, you have the gold reserves that you can use. The U.S. also happens to have custody of the majority of other countries’ gold. As you know, Russia got on the wrong side of that with the sanctions program. Many nations have figured out that with the weaponization of the dollar, they need to be able to hold assets in something other than the dollar. So they're now evaluating holding things in amongst other things, bitcoin as well as gold and other assets. And not that they will hold all their reserves in bitcoin, but they may decide to hold somewhere between 1% to 10%, depending on the country and their risk profile. I don't think the Saudis, if you were to talk to them, would say that they consider the rupee, the ruble or some of these other currencies as good reserve assets, and so they're still going to put their faith in the dollar. But they want to have a hedge, and they want to have something that provides a risk-adjusted return potentially better than just placing their money in dollar assets because a lot of the countries today outside of the U.S. are being very cautious about their buying of Treasury bills, for example. The sixth largest buyer of Treasury bills today is Tether [according to Investopedia]. It's not a country. It's a stablecoin. So what you're starting to see is people who want to have dollar-denominated stablecoins end up being the biggest holders of Treasury bills. Then you have to look at bonds and who wants to hold those? The Chinese certainly aren't buying them anymore nor are a lot of other countries. So if a sovereign is going to hold bitcoin, then the sovereign has to be guaranteed that they can transact it. Because if all bitcoin mining happens in the U.S. or the U.S. has a significant amount of bitcoin mining going on, then the U.S., in theory, could sanction a country by forcing U.S. bitcoin miners through legal regulation to not mine certain transactions because they're on OFAC sanction lists, for example. That could restrict somebody from transacting where, let's just say you had 60% of mining in the U.S., well, six out of 10 blocks, meaning somebody would only be able to transact in four out of any 10 blocks. That happens, and if you've got enough countries in the world to go against one country, you could potentially almost block them out. So sovereigns who are going to hold bitcoin have a need to have mining in their country. Bhutan is a great example. Bhutan holds $1 billion of bitcoin. They also have a lot of mining in their country. El Salvador now has stated that they no longer need third-party debt because they mine and hold bitcoin. So the U.S. should hold bitcoin just like they hold gold, and the U.S. should ensure that a certain percentage of the global hashrate comes from the U.S. so that all the bitcoin held in the U.S. by ETFs and these other funds can be transacted if need be. Forbes: Trump has said that he would like to see all remaining bitcoin mined in the U.S. That might be just politicking more than a serious policy statement, but I'm interested in your thoughts, given what you just mentioned. Thiel: I'm not going to put words in his mouth, but I think he views it as strategic importance for the U.S. to be a dominant player in bitcoin mining. And I think sometimes when he says dominant, he'll say, we have to be the end all. He wants that in the way of bitcoin mining and in the U.S. holding bitcoin reserves just like the gold aspect. You've seen him recently talk about if the U.S. were to hold a lot of bitcoin it could potentially appreciate to a point that it could pay for part of the debt or even all the debt. Representative Paulina Luna, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and others are all believers in these programs. We think it's certainly a very wise choice because there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. So it's just a question of who will own them over what period of time. Being shareholders in and having cofounded the only U.S. ASIC manufacturer for bitcoin mining, we’re certainly big believers in bitcoin miners made in the USA. You could argue that Chinese companies make 75% of the bitcoin miners made in the world today. I'm not saying that they're trying to do anything bad, but it does provide them an ability to essentially somewhat control the supply and the pricing of bitcoin miners. Forbes: That concentration can be dangerous in anything. Thiel: Exactly. So that's why we're big advocates. Regardless of who wins the presidential election, there may be opportunities to do something about that from a tariff perspective. Forbes: Have you had any interactions with the Harris campaign? Thiel: We have talked with the head of the DNC. We have talked with all sorts of senators and the Harris team does not want to engage with us. They have engaged with the AI industry. My belief is that, unfortunately, Senator Warren and her anti-crypto army have a fairly strong lock on some of the policy decisions that the Harris team is evaluating. Certainly, President Biden wanted to apply a tax to bitcoin mining as part of his budget. Part of this is they just don't understand the environmental benefit that bitcoin mining brings and the fact that it does not add additional fossil fuel requirements, it actually helps subsidize the renewable energy side of the world. And if they understood that, I think they would be willing to listen. But there are many forces rallied against us for political reasons on that side of the aisle that I wish didn't exist. Forbes: When did you start imprinting “made in the USA” in the blocks that you mine and why did you do that? Thiel: It was around the 4th of July [actual date was July 31]. It's a way for people to know if that block is mined in the U.S. or if it was mined offshore. Offshore entities control the majority of bitcoin pools. We're one of the few bitcoin pools that is not. We believe some people prefer transacting and putting their transactions into blocks that are mined in the U.S. Forbes: Are you ever worried that there could be a certain premium on bitcoins mined in the U.S. versus those elsewhere? Could that potentially impact the fungibility of any of these assets? Thiel: If you filter on OFAC, that doesn't impact the fungibility because you're not filtering bitcoins; you’re filtering wallets. How to look at it is somebody's bank account is on an OFAC list. The dollars in the bank account are on the list. It's the account, so the account can't transact. It's not that the bitcoin it holds is tainted. You may remember back in 2021, when we launched our pool, it originally had OFAC filtering turned on. Forbes: You’ve mentioned in the past that mining of Kaspa is a way to diversify. How much Kaspa do you have and are you continuing to mine it? Thiel: We continue to mine kaspa. We've grown our capacity a handful of times since we first announced that we were doing it. It's dissimilar from bitcoin in that it's a much smaller market cap and pool of liquidity. And so you can't just add exahashes and grow. You have to be very careful because there isn't a lot of liquidity compared to bitcoin. We mine enough so that we are not an overwhelming amount of the hashrate on the Kaspa network, but it is more profitable to mine than bitcoin on a per kilowatt hour basis. So if I invest a kilowatt of energy towards bitcoin, my profit using S21s could be anywhere from 5 to 8 cents depending on my cost of energy per kilowatt hour. In the case of kaspa, it's anywhere from 35 cents to a dollar. I can take kaspa, I can sell it and I can buy bitcoin or hold it. Kaspa has had some very strong price appreciation lately. So we've had a HODL strategy around some of the kaspa. Forbes: I published a list of what we called crypto billion dollar zombies in the magazine in March. Kaspa was mentioned as one of them. We saw the mining and we know it's similar to bitcoin, but it's hard to ascertain real discernible use for it beyond just people mining it and then sending it back and forth. Any more thoughts about Kaspa you'd like to share? Thiel: Kaspa as a technology is very interesting. It is a webchain versus a blockchain. It's web of blocks versus a linear line of blocks, and Kaspa has a very fast transaction speed. It also has a very high emissions decline. So it goes from emitting a lot of kaspa at the front end and then that subsidy drops very rapidly down. And so kaspa mining will likely not be a long-term business, but as long as we can mine it profitably and there's a good liquid market for it, then we just view it as a great source of revenues. Forbes: Is there anything I didn't ask you that’s at the top of your mind you'd like to share? Thiel: One thing that could be of interest to readers is that one of the primary drivers for the hashrate growth has been the upgrade cycle. If you take 30 watt per terrahash machines and replace them with 15 watt per terrahash machines, you just double your hashrate. Now that the upgrade cycle is finished, we’re entering a phase where people have to add actual capacity. I think you're still going to see global hashrate inching up, but you won't see the step function change that you saw. In 2023 hashrate doubled, then we had a halving in early 2024, and then you had all this hashrate come online [later]. We‘re pushing 700 exahash today. I think if anything, what you're going to see is bitcoin is going to continue to push sideways. We're seeing an institutionalization of bitcoin–ETFs have come on board; you now can do options on ETFs; you now have Morgan Stanley's 15,000 wealth advisors soliciting for bitcoin. We're still in the early days of this and you're now going to have hopefully the repeal or the reversal or the number of exemptions to SAB121, and you're going to see banks being able to custody bitcoin in addition to BNY Mellon, which means you can then start doing leverage, etc. You're going to build a lot of liquidity. With all those, what should be demand drivers? You still see institutional buyers sniping to buy bitcoin. They're sitting on the sidelines. They wait for a dip and they buy a dip. They are not in the market hurrying up, forcing the price up. So until there is a catalyst that drives the price of bitcoin up and maybe the election is the catalyst, I don't think we're going to see bitcoin price move up dramatically. Forbes: Thank you.

India's push into semiconductors comes as more U.S. chipmakers set their sights on India. Nvidia, AMD, Micron are among the U.S. companies that have pledged to expand in the country. "I'm in touch with the Micron CEO regularly, and they are making good progress," Goyal said. Goyal added that Indian behemoth Tata and other domestic companies are working to make India's semiconductor dream a reality. It's unlikely India will manufacture the most cutting-edge chips without the expertise of companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung which build some of the world's most advanced chips. "It is a tough job, but we have the talent, we have the skills," said Goyal. The minister referenced a recent trip to Silicon Valley where he visited several U.S. semiconductor companies and "saw tons of Indians working on the shop floor [and] on management teams," recounts Goyal. The minister, spearheading U.S. corporation expansion efforts under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is confident India will be able to deliver the first chip by 2026-2027. Apple has already found success in India as it has looked to diversify its supply chain away from China. Goyal says 14% of the world's iPhones are manufactured in India, with that number "expected to grow." Apple increased assembly in the country in the last two years while boosting its retail presence to attract new iPhone buyers. And according to Goyal, Indian customers are increasingly opting for the more expensive iPhones. Apple has also begun manufacturing other products, including iPads, AirPods and Apple Watches in the country. "They're increasing production," Goyal added. Apple's expansion efforts in India have brought 150,000 jobs across manufacturing facilities in India, making it the biggest employer in the country's electronics industry, according to India's Commerce department. An Apple spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. Apple's foray into India comes amid ongoing growth challenges in China. On the recent bout of optimism around China's economic story and the latest stimulus measures, Goyal suggested that India's success is not predicated on China's troubles. "India… is not dependent on China. We stand on our own competencies, on our capabilities, and we believe we an offering that is far superior to China," said Goyal. Goyal met with a few Wall Street investors on Monday including executives from BlackRock, Warburg Pincus and KKR. Goyal said almost all the U.S. private equity players are looking to build and develop data centers across the country. Google, Microsoft and Nvidia are among the tech companies that are bringing artificial intelligence expertise to India, which Modi's government has been receptive to. But analysts warn that India must continue tackling larger issues including poor infrastructure, bureaucracy and red tape that have slowed down corporate expansion plans. Got a confidential news tip?

"The amount of easing that’s in the forward curve is crazy," Fink, who's led BlackRock to become the world's largest asset manager looking after $10 trillion on behalf of clients, told Bloomberg on the sidelines of a Berlin conference. "I do believe there’s room for easing more, but not as much as the forward curve would indicate."

Title: Culture Wars And Unconstitutional Laws: The Threat To America's Future

Ill-advised and unconstitutional ideological crusades by conservative state legislators are infringing on the rights of American businesses and endangering America's future. Climate change, conceptual illustration. The Climate Crisis is Here… It's no secret that the accelerating impacts of climate change are being felt worldwide. 2024 is likely to be the warmest year in recorded history, and nine of the hottest years on record have all been in the last decade. To take just one example, residents of Phoenix, Arizona experienced 113 days in a row this summer with over 100-degree temperatures. With hotter days come more extreme weather events. In what was billed as a once-in-a-1000-year event, Sarasota, Florida and its environs experienced as much as ten inches of rain in just 24 hours this past June. (This followed once-in-a-millennium rainstorms in St. Louis, Kentucky, Death Valley in 2022, and Fort Lauderdale in 2023.) July saw Hurricane Beryl become the earliest-ever Category 5 hurricane to develop in the Atlantic. Last week, after another once–in–a–thousand–year rainstorm in Western NC, Hurricane Helene devastated the Southeast, bringing catastrophic flooding to Appalachian cities. As climate impacts become increasingly extreme, we are collectively racing against time to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions before we reach 1.5 degrees of warming. The good news is the global renewable energy boom is here. With costs coming down and technology improving, the world will install an estimated 593 gigawatts of solar capacity this year, nearly 30% more than in 2023 and six times more than in 2019. Here in the U.S., led by California and Texas, we now have eight times more solar power and twice as much wind power as a decade ago. Battery storage capacity is also expected to nearly double this year, meaning more renewable energy can be saved and used whenever needed. …But Texas Legislators Would Halt Our Progress Since its oil boom days, Texas has always been an energy leader, and these days are no exception – Texas now leads the country in wind power and is second only to California in solar. The clean energy transition is crucial for the Lone Star state since Texas is especially threatened by warming temperatures and hurricanes. Its statewide energy grid is also increasingly overwhelmed: Texas suffered 210 power outages between 2020 and 2023, more than any other state. So, given the urgent necessity of decarbonizing our energy grid and Texas's role as a renewable energy leader, why have its lawmakers been trying to sabotage progress against climate change? In 2021, Texas conservatives passed S.B. 13, a misguided and arguably unconstitutional law requiring all state entities, like pension funds and the K-12 education endowment, to divest any business that has moved away from supporting fossil fuels. Meant as an ideological attack against the growing move towards Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, S.B. 13, according to a study by the Texas Association of Business, cost Texas nearly $700 million in lost economic activity, $181 million in annual earnings, more than 3000 full-time jobs, and more than $37 million in tax revenues in F.Y. 2022-2023. S.B. 13's ideological crusade also prompted five of the largest underwriters for municipal bonds in Texas – JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Fidelity – to exit the Texas market, meaning much higher borrowing costs for Texas cities. These five banks "used to underwrite about 35% of the debt in the market," notes Wharton Business professor Daniel Garrett, "so they've left a really big gap." The Texas public school fund also pulled $8.5 billion from Blackrock to comply with the law. Last month, supported by Democracy Forward, the American Sustainable Business Council (ASBC) filed a lawsuit against S.B. 13 and a similar law, S.B. 19, which forces state funds to divest from companies that restrict business with gunmakers. "SB-13 is not just a misguided policy," says David Levine, president and co-founder of ASBC. "It is an unconstitutional attack that stifles free speech and punishes businesses for prioritizing responsible investments." In fact, an Oklahoma District Court Judge has already struck down Oklahoma's anti-ESG law for similar reasons. As Chris Tomlinson wrote in the Houston Chronicle of this "unconstitutional, authoritarian power grab that hurts all Texans," "whether you worry about climate change or not, the real issue is whether the government should dictate any company's investment strategy. True conservatives believe elected officials should stay out of private sector decisions." It's Not Just Texas. Unfortunately, Texas lawmakers are not alone in these attempts to hamstring American businesses. Per Reuters, 2022 saw at least 44 new bills or laws in 17 red states that attempted to penalize companies for investment strategies or behaviors they deemed too progressive, up from a dozen in 2021. Among these was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's infamous "Stop WOKE Act," which attempted to ban workplace trainings on improving race relations and which a federal judge permanently blocked in July. Similarly, the Republican-controlled House in Georgia passed a bill cutting tax breaks for Delta Airlines, the state's largest private employer, after its CEO lambasted new voting restrictions there. (The bill failed to pass the Senate.) Even more frightening, the anti-ESG push has now been taken up by the authors of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation blueprint to supercharge a second Trump presidency. In their report, they call for Trump's Department of Labor to "remove ESG considerations from ERISA," the law setting minimum standards for pension and health plans. After deriding ESG for taking into account woke causes like "reducing greenhouse gas emissions," the Project 2025 report decrees that "DOL should prohibit investing in ERISA plans on the basis of any factors that are unrelated to investor risks and returns." However, considering the impacts of climate change is precisely the type of long-term risk that businesses and investors should be evaluating to protect their returns and financial health. Of course, the government plays an indispensable role in regulating companies, so they follow the law, do right by their workers and communities, and don't conduct business with America's enemies. But trying to force U.S. companies, by law, to uphold far-right conservative ideology is simply a bridge too far. It is, in a word, unconstitutional. And amidst a global climate crisis that threatens all Americans, especially those most vulnerable in our society, these misguided ideological crusades don't just jeopardize our future prosperity and global competitiveness—they endanger our communities, economy, and planet.

Title: Harris’s economic plan helps, but doesn’t get to the root of middle-class discontent

Hans Taparia is a clinical professor at New York University Stern School of Business. Bruce Buchanan is the C.W. Nichols Professor of Business Ethics and professor of marketing at New York University Stern School of Business. Like any candidate seeking reelection, President Joe Biden ran on his economic record: millions of new jobs created, steady GDP growth, inflation tamed, and new legislation allocating trillions of dollars for climate technology, semiconductors, and infrastructure. Kamala Harris aims to build on this record with child tax credits, down payment assistance for first-time home buyers, tax breaks for small businesses, modest tax increases for the wealthy, and a federal ban on price gouging for groceries. Her plan certainly helps—but none of these policy proposals address the root cause of discontent among the middle class: Wealth creation in America today defies gravity and always flows to the top. Despite recent economic indicators, the quality of life for much of America has been diminishing for decades. Since 1970, the share of income held by the middle class has dropped by a third while the share of income held by the wealthy has nearly doubled. Over the same span, the minimum wage, unchanged since 2007, has lost roughly half its purchasing power. Over 39 million workers, or 23% of the working population, make less than $17 per hour. Over 50% of American households earn less than $75,000, which, based on one study, is what the average family of three in the U.S. needs to earn to cover the costs of its basic needs. Simply put, America is hurting. At the core of the problem is that over the past half-century, American society has been reorganized, both legally and culturally, to put the interests of investors above all others—a state of affairs we call “the investor monoculture.” Today, about 80% of public company stock is owned by institutional investors—the likes of Berkshire Hathaway, BlackRock, State Street, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, KKR, and Blackstone. In 1980, this number was just 29%. Such investors tend to operate with one objective: to seek maximum profits, regardless of the harm it may cause society. Such harm usually comes at the expense of workers, customers, and communities—and explains much of the malaise and inchoate rage that plagues America. Today’s extreme profits are being generated in two ways. The first is through cost cutting, which usually means eliminating workers, outsourcing jobs, and lowering wages. Going forward, technological advancement and the artificial intelligence revolution promise to make this worse. The second is a relentless drive for revenue growth, regardless of its effects on society or the planet. For instance, food companies have been supersizing and ultra-processing their products for decades, making a poor diet the leading cause of mortality. Suicide rates for young people are up more than 60% since 2007, but investor pressure pushes technology companies to keep users hooked to their screens for as long as possible. But none of this is the investor’s concern. The investor monoculture serves the richest 10% of households, who hold over 90% of corporate stock, and whose incomes exceed $250,000. It has been the dominant political influence in the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. government since the Reagan administration—lowering taxes on corporations and the wealthy, diminishing the social safety net, frustrating the efforts of organized labor, and pushing back on market regulation. And in recent years, it has put hundreds of pro-investor judges on the federal bench, and a supermajority of six conservative justices on the Supreme Court. The Biden-Harris administration’s attempts to correct this situation have been sincere, but don’t get to the root of the problem. The Biden CHIPS and Science Act provides tens of billions in funding and incentives for American semiconductor manufacturers. But chip manufacturers aren’t large employers, and the biggest beneficiary of these funds will be, yes, the investors in those corporations. Harris just announced a plan for $100 billion in tax credits for companies in strategic industries such as biotechnology, aerospace, blockchain, and artificial intelligence. Once again, it will be the venture capitalists and other large investors in these companies who reap most of the benefits. To materially change our country’s trajectory, a new paradigm is required. Corporations must be redesigned such that everyday people (the bottom 90%) have a more equitable stake and say in corporations. In other words, we need to shift the ownership and governance of corporations away from current investors and toward stakeholders such as employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and the planet. Here’s a set of ideas that can be implemented without any new legislation or funding. This year, the U.S. government will spend $6.5 trillion, or 23% of GDP. Much of this is transfer payments, but trillions of dollars are general expenditures. This represents formidable spending power that can be leveraged to compel corporations to share government-generated wealth more fairly with communities and stakeholders. What if the corporations receiving government funds through the CHIPS and Science Act were required to share ownership rights or profits with the communities in which they build factories? What if the government gave preference to employee-owned businesses, or stipulated profit sharing with stakeholders, for its purchases of goods and services? What if it mandated that, instead of being owned by private equity players looking to return multiples on their investments, all hospice services receiving Medicare funds be substantively owned by nonprofits or the people providing the hospice care? What would that do for the caregivers? What would it do for the care? Or imagine the pride and dedication of construction workers who share in the ownership and profits of firms building government projects. Each year, the U.S. government lends hundreds of billions of dollars to corporations through agencies such as the Small Business Administration, the USDA, and the Department of Energy. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Department of Energy alone will lend over $400 billion to climate technology companies. The biggest gains from these loans will go to just a few investors. The U.S. government should stipulate higher levels of ownership, profit sharing, voting, and board rights for workers, communities, or other stakeholders in companies that participate in these programs. Such requirements would spread the benefits of these loans more broadly and give stakeholders a greater sense of economic agency and civic participation. Similarly, when state-funded universities or the National Institutes of Health license new drug discoveries or technology to corporations, they should require profit distribution that flows not just to investors but also to other stakeholders such as patients and caregivers. Imagine if patients shared in the profits from sky-high drug prices. Redesigning corporations to benefit stakeholders and communities using existing market-based approaches presents endless possibilities. The force of government spending and investment applied in this way would foster hope among the 90% who are marginalized by the investor monoculture and begin a process of political healing. America is hurting. Democrats must acknowledge and address this pain. The investor monoculture is at the root of the problem—and government-encouraged corporate redesign is one viable path to recovery. We already have the tools to do this. The question is whether we have the political will.

Share this article Circle has announced plans to bring its USDC stablecoin to Australia through a partnership with venture capitalist Mark Carnegie’s MHC Digital Group, signaling an expansion into the Asia Pacific region. The collaboration aims to increase USDC distribution and explore institutional use cases in Australia and beyond. MHC Digital Group, with offices in Australia and Singapore, will provide USDC access to wholesale clients across Australia. Circle’s Chief Business Officer Kash Razzaghi highlighted the region’s potential, noting its young, mobile-first population and digital wallet readiness. The partnership could help Australian superannuation funds avoid bank fees and may lead to the creation of an Australian dollar stablecoin in the future. This expansion follows Circle’s recent moves, including relocating its headquarters to New York City’s One World Trade Center ahead of a planned IPO valued at around $5 billion. The company has also made USDC available to investors in Mexico and Brazil through the banking system and became the first global stablecoin issuer licensed to offer dollar- and euro-pegged tokens in the European Union. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin behind Tether’s USDT, currently has a market cap of $35 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $7.87 billion. The partnership with MHC Digital Group represents another step in Circle’s global expansion strategy, potentially bringing stablecoin technology to a broader audience in the Asia Pacific region. In September, Circle partnered with Sony Block Solutions Labs to integrate USDC on Sony’s Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, Soneium, aiming to transform digital finance and entertainment transactions. Earlier this year, Circle implemented smart contract support for BlackRock BUIDL holders, enabling them to transfer shares for USDC, streamlining blockchain transactions and reducing costs. Beyond native L2s, Circle has also expanded its Web3 services to the Solana blockchain, enhancing USDC accessibility for developers and enterprises with improved on-chain transaction management and secure wallet integration.

Title: How To Address The Global Talent Shortage?

75% of employers worldwide are struggling to find the talent they need. In Agreus Group's article 2024 predictions for the family office space, I touched upon a significant ongoing global challenge: a widespread shortage of skilled professionals. The 2023 ManpowerGroup Talent Shortage Study indicates that 75% of employers worldwide are struggling to find the talent they need. This difficulty spans several sectors, with accounting, financial services and investment roles facing some of the most pronounced shortages. Family offices must strategically contend with large corporations for this sought-after talent. Understanding the Global Talent Shortage The global job market today offers skilled professionals a plethora of career choices, presenting a challenge for those seeking to recruit the best. There is a particularly acute shortage of finance and accounting expertise. Avalara’s research reveals that 84% of Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) surveyed in the United States (U.S.) and the United Kingdom (U.K.) face a significant talent shortage within their teams. Family offices often require high-calibre talent in specialised areas such as accounting, financial services and investment, where specific expertise is essential for managing complex portfolios for Ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) families. According to the 2023 BlackRock Global Family Office Survey, 40% of family offices see talent sourcing as a major hurdle in achieving their investment goals. Identifying and retaining top talent has become a major challenge for family offices worldwide. Strategies to Address the Talent Gap With intense competition in attracting top professionals, family offices must differentiate themselves. We recommend a well-rounded strategy to effectively tackle this talent shortage: Competitive Compensation Packages As an expert in the family office recruitment space, we know compensation plays a huge part in attracting and retaining talent. Professionals are often drawn to family offices from sectors where competitive compensation is standard. To engage and keep such talent, it is crucial to offer compensation that is on par with the industry standard, ensuring they match what these individuals may have received from their prior roles. Our 2023 Global Family Office Compensation Benchmark Report is an invaluable resource for benchmarking against other family offices and staying competitive in the market. Explore the Global Talent Pool Expanding your hiring criteria can be an effective strategy to tackle the talent shortage. One way to do this is by leveraging global recruitment and considering job seekers from other countries. With increased global mobility, family offices can have a more varied skill set from an extended talent pool. This will ultimately increase your chances of finding highly qualified candidates and filling vacancies successfully. Flexible Work Arrangements Embracing flexible work arrangements, such as remote work and flexible hours, can broaden the pool of potential candidates and improve employee satisfaction. Remote work also allows you to extend your reach beyond borders, which can help you overcome local skill gaps and save money in the process. Professional Development Opportunities Investing in employee development helps to build a positive work environment, enhances retention, and keeps your family office in the know with the latest developments. It is also a proactive approach to tackling the global talent shortage. The global talent shortage is undoubtedly a critical challenge for family offices worldwide. Family offices must implement a comprehensive strategy to effectively compete for top-tier professionals in the fierce market. By prioritising the strategies discussed above, family offices can attract and retain the skilled talent necessary to achieve their long-term goals.

Title: Open source is not a trust issue, it’s an innovation issue

Dmitry Nikolaev - stock.adobe.co No project is smooth sailing all the way. So perhaps it was appropriate that the Open Source Summit Europe kicked off amid some of the worst storms in memory, before finishing in clear blue skies and warm autumnal sunshine. The Linux Foundation-backed conference saw a raft of product announcements and initiatives, among which was the rolling together of distributed trust projects – including blockchain, ledger, identity and cryptographic efforts – into an LF Foundation Decentralised Trust. The Linux Foundation announced general availability of Valkey 8.0, the open source in-memory database project forked from Redis earlier this year, after the eponymous company behind the in-memory database changed its licence. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) donated the OpenSearch project to the Linux Foundation. The cloud giant launched the OpenSearch project in response to Elastic’s licence switch on ElasticSearch back in 2021. At the same time, the Linux Foundation and its mighty offshoot the Cloud Native Computing Foundation have partnered with Unified Patents to “defend open source software from non-practising entities”, by which they mean patent trolls. But while the “ecosystem” looks in rude health, what is happening in the community? Or more to the point, how are businesses really using and benefiting from open source software? The Linux Foundation’s Open source maturity in Europe report paints a robust picture, stating that between 2022 and 2024, “more than half of the respondents each year reported seeing an increased business value from using OSS compared to the previous year”. For this year, it revealed that just under two-thirds reported a rise in business value from the year before. “This indicates a compounding effect, where the value derived from open source software grows each year. Similarly, the benefits from contributions are also on the rise, with 52% of respondents in recent surveys reporting increased benefits compared to prior years,” said the report. Those benefits include increased productivity, cited by 62%, catalysed innovation (61%) and reduced operating costs (60%). Critically, over three-quarters believed open source software to be more secure than closed source software. But the research also found that resistant organisational cultures were a brake on open source adoption, particularly “in sectors traditionally resistant to openness, such as finance”. It added: “Open source is often mistakenly viewed as merely a technical matter, when in fact, it is a cultural change – it is a change maker and needs to be approached in a multidimensional strategy.” Achieving that cultural change can be critical when it comes to dealing with an increasingly volatile world, where organisations need to constantly innovate just to survive. In a panel on lessons from vertical industries, Mercedes-Benz open source programme lead Wolfgang Gehring said a modern vehicle was a datacentre on wheels, so “innovation and software [mean] open source”, and when it comes to common problems, “you can collaborate with other companies in the industry in open source”. Before open source, he added, “that was much more difficult”. On the same panel, Karel Rietveld, Open Source Program Office lead at the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration, said motivations and inhibitions could be slightly different in the public sector, with different regulations and layers of management and compliance to be aware of. Open source might be more cost effective, a big issue for cash-strapped public entities, he added, but there was also the cost of publicly funded time and people to consider. But, of course, these are the already converted, and it might be argued that many critical sectors will continue to have an instinctive distrust of open source and be extremely unwilling to embed it in their systems. A glib response might be that few companies are not taking advantage of open source in some form anyway. That might be the CEO’s Android phone. Or it could be their use of cloud technologies or services which rely on a cloud native stack predicated on containers and Kubernetes, and open source security tools, and open source-powered developer workflows. For all the talk about community, sometimes it’s more base common interest that will drive a company or a sector to use open source. Finance is generally secretive, but increasingly is adopting open source. That’s not necessarily for any utopian ideals. Rather, banks and other financial institutions will have common problems to code for, in the shape of compliance with regulations for example, so it makes sense from an efficiency point of view to find common answers to these problems. Gabriele Columbro, who heads up both the Linux Foundation Europe and the Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS), said if anything, financial services are ahead of “other traditional industries in their adoption and strategic understanding of open source”. The sector is already highly tech-centric, he said, with banks potentially employing tens of thousands of developers. “And not only the big banks – we have the buy sides, Blackrock, Fidelity, five or six buy side members, and everyone in between. The clearing houses started coming in … so the whole ecosystem is starting to harmonise around open standards and open source.” The power sector is another “conservative” industry that is increasingly relying on open source as it races to rebuild its systems and infrastructure to meet the climate change challenge. This requires new ways of managing and predicting demand, and that means new tools – fast. As with finance, all operators face these problems, making cooperation easier to contemplate. Jonas van den Bogaard, open source lead at Dutch power distribution company Alliander, and a member of the technical advisory council at LF Energy, said the power distribution sector in Holland – likes its counterparts worldwide – is racing to decarbonise the grid and underpin electrification. As well as building out physical capacity, this will require much better tools for management and forecasting. “We are actively searching for collaboration and partnerships with industry players – with vendors, both academia and also cross-sector – to bundle resources, knowledge and expertise to realise these new digital integrations,” he said. “We’ve seen open source more as one of the means to make this possible, and it has been very successful for building up several capabilities.” And power is not the only critical infrastructure that will be relying on open source. Timo Perala heads up Nokia’s open source projects office, having previously worked in standards. Ultimately, he said, its customers want products and services that work – they are not necessarily concerned whether they include open source elements, just as they wouldn’t necessarily care where Nokia sourced components like buts and bolts. Moreover, open source collaboration is a form of shared research and development, where everyone needs to solve a problem without necessarily capitalising on the solution. Perala likened it to how companies agree on a handover on a mobile network. “That is something that you just can’t charge for ... it’s a basic requirement, not a competitive advantage,” he said. It’s hard to think of more conservative industries than power, finance and telecoms. But they are also industries that are facing high levels of disruption and a corresponding need to innovate quickly. If they’re building their businesses on open source, the only reason the rest of the world hasn’t is because they’re not being confronted with the same level of potential disruption. Yet. As Mercedes’ Gehring told his audience: “Innovation nowadays happens in open source. Innovation in software happens in open source. And you’re either there and you participate, or you’re not. That’s basically it.”
