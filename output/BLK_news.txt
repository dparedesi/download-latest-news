Title: Companies say RTO mandates make work more creative — it might take more than that

Companies are betting that asking employees to return to the office will help boost creativity. HR pros say that's only the start. While being physically present may boost collaboration and the flow of ideas, workplace specialists told Business Insider that RTO mandates alone might not be the answer. To get the rest of the way, companies need bosses and a culture that fosters creativity. "You can have a fully in-person organization and still not optimize those things because your culture and your leadership don't bring them out in their people," said Leena Rinne, the vice president of coaching at the corporate training platform Skillsoft. "If you have a really stifling and unsafe culture, but you're trying to get more creativity, bringing people back together is not going to get you there." Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told all corporate employees they had to be in the office five days a week. Goldman Sachs, Salesforce, and JPMorgan have done the same. Bosses want "the water cooler effect" of spontaneous collaboration, said Cary Cooper, a professor of organizational psychology and health at the Manchester Business School. Whether they get it is another question — research on RTO benefits has been inconclusive. Some studies found that returning to the office doesn't really improve employee performance and may drive them to quit. Others suggest it can improve collaboration and strengthen bonds between employees. Alongside any office-return rules, employers should "rethink the role of the manager," Cooper said. He recommended prioritizing soft skills that will help leaders motivate their teams, particularly Gen Zers new to the workplace. "We've been recruiting the wrong kind of manager for this generation," he said. Those staff "want a better work-life balance," Cooper said. "And they want a good quality of working life. That means somebody has to create that, and that somebody has to have good social skills." Workers often don't love being asked to return to the office. At Dell, almost half of US staff rejected the back-to-office call. At Amazon, some employees have joked that they would rather be fired than comply. Jeri Doris, the SVP of people at the HR and payroll platform Justworks, said companies need to justify the working setup they choose, not just mandate it. "We need to treat people like adults," Doris said. The goal should be "creating an environment where people can grow, thrive, and feel seen." Doris recommended tying office attendance to particular tasks, like coming in for particular meetings. Rinne, the workplace-coaching pro, cautioned against an "executive nostalgia" that pushes old-school bosses to want workers where they can see them. "We're not going back to the workplace of yesteryear," she said. "It's different now. We feel different. We have different skills." She said that creativity and personal resilience at work both proliferated with the rise of remote work. Poorly-executed returns can erode them. "If we want more collaboration, what do our people and our leaders need to be doing to accelerate collaboration?" Rinne said. "Because it's not just me and you sitting in the same room that makes us collaborate." Overall, strategy isn't what gets results, Rinne said. "It's your people who get your results," she said. "How I show up to work every day drives what I accomplish and how I contribute to this organization," she added. "If I'm leaning in and excited about it, that's very different from leaning out and doing the bare minimum." Jump to

Title: Judge recuses self from 1MDB’s US$346mil lawsuit against Rosmah
URL: https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/11/19/judge-recuses-self-from-1mdbs-us346mil-lawsuit-against-rosmah
Time Published: 2024-11-19T05:16:00Z
Full Content:
Tuesday, 19 Nov 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: The US$346mil lawsuit filed by 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) against Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor (pic) over the alleged purchase of luxury goods from 1MDB's monies will be heard before a different judge. This is following Judicial Commissioner Leong Wai Hong allowing Rosmah's application to recuse him from presiding over the case. ALSO READ: ‘US$346mil luxury goods linked to 1MDB, SRC scandal’ In his brief decision on Tuesday, JC Leong said he recused himself on the principle of justice. In Rosmah's supporting affidavit, she stated that the JC was a partner and head of litigation and arbitration at law firm Messrs Skrine between 2011 and 2021. Rosmah contended that at the material time at Skrine, which acted for the plaintiff in the present case, the law firm had relations to lawsuits including investigation into 1MDB and her husband, Datuk Seri Najib Razak, who was the prime minister then. "After considering the application, I agree to recuse myself from hearing this suit on the principle that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done. "In the premise, I allow the application. This suit will be heard before another High Court judge," JC Leong said. This is the second time Rosmah has applied for the recusal of the judge in the lawsuit. She, however, failed in her first recusal application. ALSO READ: Rosmah amassed RM1.63bil worth of jewellery, designer goods with 1MDB funds, court told On Sept 9, High Court judge Justice Adlin Abdul Majid dismissed Rosmah's recusal application, stating that Rosmah failed to prove any real danger of bias if she continues to preside over the civil suit. Justice Adlin said she was in charge of the corporate division when she was with the law firm Lee Hishammuddin Allen & Gledhill (LHAG), while all affairs related to 1MDB were handled by the legal division. It is understood that Justice Adlin was transferred to New Commercial Courts (NCC) from the Civil division, resulting in the lawsuit being brought before JC Leong. On May 9, 1MDB, SRC International Sdn Bhd and nine subsidiaries filed the civil lawsuit against Rosmah and another individual seeking US$346mil belonging to the company. The plaintiffs claimed that Rosmah had used the funds from the companies to purchase luxury items such as jewellery, watches and handbags. Apart from 1MDB and SRC, other plaintiffs are 1MDB Energy Holdings Ltd, 1MDB Energy Ltd, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Ltd and Global Diversified Investment Company Ltd (formerly 1MDB Global Investments Ltd). Other plaintiffs are Affinity Equity International Partners Ltd, Alsen Chance Holdings Ltd, Blackrock Commodities (Global) Ltd, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Ltd and Brightstone Jewellery Ltd. They named Rosmah as the first defendant and Shabnam Naraindas Daswani (also known as Natasha Mirpuri) as the second defendant. They claim that Shabnam, who is based in Singapore, had purchased or procured the luxury items on behalf of Rosmah. The plaintiffs claim that funds from 1MDB and its subsidiaries were channelled to various offshore entities - including Affinity Equity, Alsen Chance, Blackrock Commodities, Blackstone Asia and Brightstone Jewellery - before being paid out to 48 different vendors based in 14 jurisdictions for the luxury goods. "A total of 320 such payments totalling US$346,010,489 were made," the plaintiffs stated. They further claim the goods sought were “traceable substitute” of 1MDB and its subsidiaries’ trust property, thus the plaintiffs have an equitable proprietary interest in the luxury goods. They are seeking a court declaration that they have an equitable proprietary interest in the good and traceable proceeds in the hands of Rosmah as well as an order for Rosmah to pay the first until the sixth plaintiffs a sum of US$346mil.

Title: BlackRock Bags Abu Dhabi’s Operational License For AI And Private Markets

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Key takeaways The prominent global investment and asset management company BlackRock has received Abu Dhabi’s operational license. A November 18 Bloomberg report disclosed this newest development regarding BlackRock’s expansion moves. The report noted that the license will enable the asset manager to diversify its AI and private markets in the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). BlackRock also seeks a license to operate in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), an international financial hub in the region. This new office will enable the company to work closely with sovereign wealth funds, wealth managers, and Abu Dhabi-based investment entities. ADGM stands out due to the participation of several crypto-related entities, including M2, Blockdaemon, Laser Digital, and others. In a statement to Bloomberg, Charles Hatami, BlackRock’s Middle East Head, disclosed the company’s scope of activities via its expansion to Abu Dhabi. He pointed out that BlackRock will focus on artificial intelligence infrastructure and private markets in the region. Further, Hatami applauded Abu Dhabi’s proactiveness and commitment to innovation, labeling the region as a “global financial center.” He noted that the region has become an attractive hub with its friendly policies for different companies and businesses. Hatami stated: “Abu Dhabi has rapidly transformed into a global financial center. Its strategic location, proactive government policies, and commitment to sustainable growth make it an ideal location for capital markets.” BlackRock’s latest operational license in Abu Dhabi comes at the heel of another license from Saudi Arabia last month. The asset manager received approval to establish its regional headquarters in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This move aligns with BlackRock’s efforts to expand within the region. Earlier this year, the company disclosed its readiness to allocate $5 billion from its Public Investment Fund to invest in the Middle East and develop a Riyadh-based investment team. BlackRock remains distinctive as the issuer of the largest US-based spot Bitcoin ETF. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, IBIT, boasts net inflows of over $29.28 billion and total assets worth $42.89 billion as of November 15. The UAE has recorded a growing dominance in digital finance. According to an August report from investment migration consultancy company Henley & Partners, UAE ranked third in a crypto adoption index. The nation’s capital, Abu Dhabi, has become one of the regions with a favorable environment for innovative technology and financial growth. This friendly atmosphere has attracted various AI companies and investments. In April, Microsoft revealed its $1.6 billion investment in an Abu Dhabi-based AI tech entity, G42. Also, in September, Microsoft disclosed its plan to develop two AI centers in the region. This move aligns with the tech company’s goal of global AI expansion. Microsoft highlighted that one of the centers will help AI projects that resolve key societal goals. Meanwhile, the other center will concentrate on creating industry standards for the responsible use of AI. Get the latest updates, trends, and insights delivered straight to your fingertips.

Title: BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (MUI) Announces Final Results of Tender Offer
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/press-releases/blackrock-municipal-income-fund-inc-mui-announces-final-results-of-tender-offer-93CH-3729260
Time Published: 2024-11-19T02:36:03Z
Full Content:
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Advisors, LLC (BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)) announced today the final results of BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE: MUI, the Fund) tender offer (a Tender Offer) for up to 50% of its outstanding common shares (the Shares). The Tender Offers, which expired at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on November 15, 2024, was oversubscribed. Therefore, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, the Fund will purchase Shares from all tendering shareholders on a pro rata basis, after disregarding fractions, based on the number of Shares properly tendered (Pro-Ration Factor). The final results of the Tender Offer are provided in the table below. Fund Name Ticker CUSIP Number of Shares Tendered Number of Tendered Shares to be Purchased Pro-Ration Factor Purchase Price BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. MUI 09253X102 44,715,010 35,996,072 0.80505121 12.7890 Equal to 98% of the Fund's net asset value per Share as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on November 18, 2024 (the business day immediately following the expiration date of the Tender Offer). Payments for Shares tendered and accepted are expected to be made within approximately five business days after the expiration date. Questions regarding the Tender Offer may be directed to Georgeson LLC, the Information Agent for the Tender Offer, toll free at the numbers disclosed in the Fund's Offer to Purchase. Conversion to an Unlisted Interval Fund As previously announced, the Fund will be converting from an exchange-listed, closed-end fund to an unlisted, continuously-offered closed-end fund that conducts periodic repurchases of its shares, also known as an interval fund (the Conversion). The Fund's Shares will continue to trade on the NYSE until the effective date of the Fund's delisting from the NYSE, which will be announced at a later date. It is currently expected that the Conversion will occur in the first quarter of 2025, on such date as will be announced by the Fund. Shareholders who continue to hold Shares following the completion of the Tender Offer, but who do not wish to hold Shares of an unlisted interval fund, may sell their Shares in the normal course on the NYSE prior to the effective date of the Fund's delisting from the NYSE. Please note that, following the Conversion, the Fund's Shares will no longer trade on a stock exchange and shareholders will therefore have limited options to sell their shares outside of the Fund's quarterly offers to repurchase between 5% and 25% of the Fund's Shares. Important Notice This press release is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute a recommendation, an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell any common shares of the Fund. The offer to purchase the Fund's common shares was made only pursuant to an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal and other documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as exhibits to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO. Shareholders may obtain a free copy of the offer to purchase and other documents filed with the SEC at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov or by directing such requests to the Fund.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Enhanced Government Fund, Inc. (the Fund) (NYSE: EGF, CUSIP: 09255K108) today announced the completion of its annual offer to repurchase a portion of its outstanding shares of common stock from its stockholders (the Repurchase Offer). Under the terms of the Repurchase Offer, the Fund offered to repurchase up to 5% of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the Shares) for cash at a price equal to the Fund's net asset value per Share calculated as of the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange on November 18, 2024 (subject to the repurchase fee of 2% of the net asset value per Share, which was deducted from the repurchase price (the Repurchase Fee)). As previously announced on November 15, 2024, the expiration date of the Repurchase Offer, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's depositary agent, indicated that 439,157 Shares (approximately 12% of the Fund's Shares outstanding as of November 15, 2024) were validly submitted for tender and not withdrawn. Since more than 5% of the Fund's outstanding Shares were validly submitted for tender, the Fund repurchased validly tendered Shares on a pro rata basis. However, the Fund accepted all Shares validly submitted for tender by stockholders who owned, beneficially or of record, an aggregate of not more than 99 Shares and who validly tendered all of their Shares, before pro rating Shares validly tendered by other stockholders. Consequently, approximately 42% of Shares validly submitted for tender were accepted for repurchase. On November 18, 2024, and subject to pro ration as applicable, validly tendered Shares were repurchased by the Fund at $9.80 per Share, the Fund's net asset value per Share determined as of 4:00 p.m. EST, Monday, November 18, 2024 less the Repurchase Fee. Shares validly tendered and accepted will not be entitled to receive any Fund dividend or distribution with a record date on or after November 22, 2024. The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to provide stockholders with current income and gains. None of the Fund, its investment adviser or its Board of Directors made any recommendation to any stockholder as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering Shares in the Repurchase Offer. For client-specific information regarding the Repurchase Offer, please contact your broker or financial advisor, or in the case of registered stockholders, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., which is acting as the depositary agent in connection with the Repurchase Offer.

Title: ‘He’s been unbelievably helpful’ – Thomas Clarkson thanks Cian Healy for his assistance in ‘surreal’ week

Ireland's Thomas Clarkson during the Autumn Nations Series clash against Argentina at the Aviva Stadium. Photo: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile Thomas Clarkson got to make his debut twice on Friday night, the Wicklow native able to get a feel for things when he came on as a temporary replacement when Finlay Bealham was in the sin-bin during the first half against Argentina before getting 28 minutes after half-time. At the end of this month, he’ll go back to Leinster as a fully-fledged Ireland international and his next task will be to force his way into the match-day squad for the biggest games when he’s competing with Tadhg Furlong and former France international Rabah Slimani. This week, his involvement will be impacted by the health of Furlong and Tom O’Toole and whether Andy Farrell reckons he did enough against Argentina to merit another go. Realistically, he’s fifth in line behind Furlong, Bealham, O’Toole and Oli Jager, but injuries have opened the door and the 24-year-old has shown he can cope at the highest level. Certainly, Farrell has challenged Clarkson and Sam Prendergast to build on their debuts. “It was a big old task for Tom Clarkson coming on, especially when it’s a game of collision-winning and they’re going to test you through the forwards. They’re a good scrummaging pack and I thought he did really well,” he said. “It’s not about one cap, is it? It’s what you do with that one cap and how hungry you are to kick on now to gain on that experience.” Clarkson is still listed as a ‘training panellist’ rather than a full squad member and he was due to leave the set-up once their pre-New Zealand camp in Portugal was complete. Then came a tap on the shoulder. “I wasn’t supposed to be kept on after Portugal so to be kept on and end up playing it was a bit crazy,” he said. “We were gyming on the Monday and the team was announced Tuesday morning, so he [Farrell] kind of gives lads a heads up about what they are doing. “So, he was like, ‘You are going to be involved, 24th man for the New Zealand game’ because obviously Tadhg had been in and out with a few niggles so I was half expecting it. “It was either me or Jack Boyle because they normally take a tighthead so I kind of had a rough idea but he confirmed it there before we left. “I’m delighted and obviously incredibly grateful to the staff that they put a bit of trust in me it was a great day for me and my family and everyone else. “It was a bit surreal, like coming out for the anthem, it hadn’t been that full for the warm-up and then coming out and the fact it was dark as well so that added an extra bit. I had a big family there for the day. I think it was 10 so it was class. “I was still pretty nervous coming on [the second time]. “I wasn’t expecting 30 minutes as well so I was just trying to just make sure I was going at it from the start. Probably blew my load a little at the start, I was running around like a headless chicken there for the first 20 minutes, the last 10 I kind of died a little. “But I suppose that’s what you might expect, first cap.” Clarkson, whose grandfather Tony worked on the Irish Independent Sports desk and remains one of his biggest fans, began playing rugby at Wicklow RFC before attending Blackrock College. A talented swimmer who competed for national titles in the butterfly at U-12s, he is a dual national with an Italian mother and Irish father. He played alongside Ryan Baird, Harry Byrne and Craig Casey on the Grand Slam-winning 2019 U-20s team and was part of the 2022 Emerging Ireland squad, but he’s had to be patient at Leinster where he’s been involved in one Champions Cup game to date. Making the step up to international rugby was big, but Clarkson says Cian Healy was a huge help in settling him down in the build-up as he prepared to make his own milestone appearance. “He has been unbelievably helpful,” he said of the 133-cap veteran prop. “Just, sitting down watching training every day, making sure I understand, because I didn’t really get that many reps during the week because there was only two tightheads training. “He sat down with me and made sure I understood everything he was doing so I could do the same thing.”

The new peak mark comes after investors threw $2.2 billion at such funds last week, the report said. 📈 Digital asset inflows reached US$2.2bn last week, bringing year-to-date inflows to a record US$33.5bn. #Bitcoin and #Ethereum saw inflows of US$1.48bn and US$646m respectively. Short bitcoin investment products saw inflows of US$49m. Full report: https://t.co/W1BDGvhJ3B pic.twitter.com/45YkiVTOyV — CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) November 18, 2024 CoinShares tracks funds around the world that give investors exposure to digital coins and tokens, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Europe and Asia. “This recent surge in [investing] activity appears to be driven by a combination of looser monetary policy and the Republican party’s clean sweep in the recent U.S. elections,” the report said. It added that most of the money was focused on U.S.-listed spot ETFs, giving sophisticated and retail investors exposure to Bitcoin. Wall Street regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), approved 11 new spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. The funds—managed by the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale—give investors from top hedge funds to small-timers using their phones the ability to invest in the cryptocurrency in a streamlined and regulated way. Following Donald Trump’s White House win earlier this month, Bitcoin’s price has surged to new highs above $93,000—partly driven by investors buying into the American ETFs. CoinShares’ report added that enthusiasm around Ethereum, the second-biggest digital asset, also surged: $646 million hit products, giving investors exposure to the coin last week. Since the Republican presidential victory on November 8, money has flowed into the crypto space. The week before, investors put nearly $2 billion into crypto funds. President-elect Trump has promised to help the digital asset industry, making various promises on the campaign trail.

Title: Canadian pension funds exposed as battery maker Northvolt struggles to survive

Time Published: 2024-11-18T23:22:31Z
Full Content:
Workers walk at the site of the Northvolt Ett factory in Skelleftea, north Sweden on Feb. 23, 2022.JONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP/Getty Images Several Canadian pension funds have sizable financial exposure in the event of a bankruptcy filing by Northvolt AB, the Swedish battery maker that is burning through cash as growth in demand for electric vehicles lags expectations. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Investment Management Corp. of Ontario (IMCO), Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec participated in US$2.3-billion in convertible debt financings for Stockholm-based Northvolt, joining major automakers and financial institutions to support the European battery hope as its future looked bright. OMERS also bought an undisclosed number of Northvolt shares in 2021. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Northvolt is considering seeking protection from creditors in the coming days after talks about a rescue package collapsed. The company is still trying to secure short-term financing, but time is getting short, the FT said, quoting unnamed people involved in the negotiations. Northvolt has suffered this year as EV demand growth slowed and a US$2.15-billion battery order was cancelled. In recent months, it has cut a fifth of its staff and shelved many of its expansion plans. Meanwhile, the fate of a $7-billion factory planned for Quebec has yet to be decided. Northvolt said little about its current predicament when contacted by The Globe and Mail on Monday. “Financing negotiations are ongoing,” Northvolt spokesperson Emmanuelle Rouillard-Moreau said in an e-mail. “We are maintaining close communication with our investors and key partners. We will share updates and the outcome of these discussions once decisions have been finalized.” The terms of Northvolt’s convertible debt – including under what circumstances it would be swapped for equity – have not been disclosed, which makes it hard to gauge where the four Canadian pension funds rank in terms of seniority in the event of a bankruptcy, or how much of their initial investments are at risk of being wiped out. Lenders typically rank ahead of equity owners when a company is restructured. Northvolt’s ownership group also includes some of the biggest automotive and financial names, such as Volkswagen AG VWAGY, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Goldman Sachs. The latter was said to be leading ill-fated rescue-package talks that were aimed at securing a reported US$300-million. The total exposure among the Canadian pension funds is murky, making it difficult to glean the precise values of the funds’ investments from public disclosures. The four pension-fund managers participated in a series of debt issues in 2023, including a US$400-million investment from IMCO. CPPIB invested US$55-million, while OMERS and BlackRock Inc., which is the world’s largest asset manager, also participated as Northvolt expanded its existing US$1.1-billion convertible debt program to US$2.3-billion. In November, 2023, the Caisse took on US$150-million in convertible debt. OMERS was an earlier backer of the battery maker and has made three investments, starting with the purchase of an undisclosed stake in a US$2.75-billion private placement of equity alongside a host of other investors, including Swedish pension funds, Goldman Sachs and Volkswagen. OMERS has not disclosed the size of its equity position. Spokespeople for OMERS, CPPIB, IMCO and the Caisse all declined to comment beyond confirming investments that were publicly announced. In September, Northvolt announced it was cutting its Swedish work force by 1,600 and suspending a number of its expansion projects. It retreated from its growth strategy as automakers such as General Motors Co. GM-N, Ford Motor Co. F-N, Volvo Car AB VOLVF and Volkswagen tempered their EV outlooks and spending to deal with high capital costs and some resistance among car buyers, who face sticker shock and still-spotty charging infrastructure. In June, BMW cancelled a US$2.15-billion order for Northvolt battery cells. All of this turmoil has raised questions about the Quebec plant, which has been awarded billions of dollars in loans and production incentives from the federal and Quebec governments. Northvolt has said that it is conducting a strategic review of the facility in Saint-Basile-le-Grand, Que., and results are expected in the coming weeks.

Title: Tokenization’s Tailwinds: Payment Networks and Real-World Assets

No matter the application, the guiding principle behind tokenization remains the same: replacing sensitive data with a digital representation (token) that protects that data. Recent weeks and months have seen the rise of what we might term two “tracks” of tokenization. There’s payment tokenization, and then there’s the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). The former protects card-level details and the cardholder through a digital representation of the 16-digit card details that is without value. The latter streamlines the transfer of assets, such as stocks, bonds and real estate, between parties. Mastercard, for example, plans to phase out the need to enter card numbers, static passwords and one-time codes when making online purchases by the end of the decade through tokenization and biometric authentication. The company’s tokenization technology has reduced cart abandonment and increased transaction approvals by 3 to 6 percentage points, while also minimizing the risk of fraud, as 30% of the payments network’s transactions are tokenized. During Visa’s most recent earnings call Oct. 29, management said more than 30% of the firm’s transactions are tokenized, and Visa has issued more than 11.5 billion tokens. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “The Tokenization Innovation Report: The Future of Security and Personalization” found that 78% of merchants enable network or payment tokens. Larger merchants are more familiar with tokenization. Eighty percent of merchants generating $10 million to $50 million in annual revenue are “very or extremely familiar” with payment data tokenization solutions, more than the corresponding 35% of those generating $1 million to $5 million and 14% of those generating less than $1 million in annual revenue. Another 97% of payment service providers use network tokens to provide digital wallet payments. The growing awareness of tokenization comes as roughly two-thirds of merchants said they had experienced payments fraud; more than three-quarters said they had seen at least some online transactions fail, per the report. Total tokenized market capitalization could reach $2 trillion by 2030, McKinsey estimated. Last month, Visa debuted its Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP), which allows banking partners “to create and experiment with their own fiat-backed tokens in a VTAP sandbox.” In an initial use case, the platform enabled the issuance, transfer and redemption of a bank token on a blockchain, along with interactions of the token with smart contracts. Last week, Tether launched its own RWA tokenization platform, dubbed Hadron, which lets users “tokenize anything, anywhere,” including everything from stocks to loyalty points. In March, BlackRock unveiled its first tokenized fund issued on a public blockchain, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The company said last week that it expanded the offering, “by enabling BUIDL to be used within leading blockchain-based financial products and infrastructure across ecosystems.” In another example, Citigroup partnered with Wellington Management and WisdomTree in February to explore the tokenization of private markets. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Crypto boom 'more than just a fad'

Time Published: 2024-11-18T21:46:00Z

The crypto boom following the US election has pushed the price of Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, to a new all-time high of more than 3 million baht, say industry executives. The surge in crypto prices after the US election is more than just a fad, indicating a major shift in the global financial system amid political and policy changes that are having a wide impact, said Nirun Fuwattananukul, chief executive of Gulf Binance. A combination of favourable policies, institutional acceptance and technological developments are laying the foundation for a new financial system, he said. "We are at a critical turning point. The growth of the crypto market is not just about price, but a fundamental change in the way we manage and access financial services. This change will affect all sectors of the global economy and will determine the future of the financial system for the next decade," Mr Nirun said. Peerapat Hankongkaew, chief investment officer of Cryptomind Advisory, said president-elect Donald Trump has a policy to make Bitcoin the national reserve currency of the US. When that policy takes root, Bitcoin will again set a new record high price, he said. "Investing in Bitcoin now would be worthwhile to capitalise on the long-term trend," said Mr Peerapat. Bitcoin may be an asset to protect itself from inflation. In addition, the increasing demand has caused the price to rise even higher. "If the US can make Bitcoin a reserve currency, other countries will have to follow," he said. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has a gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) that takes about 20 years to reach a value of US$30 billion, but investing in the Bitcoin ETF took only one year to reach a value of $30 billion, said Mr Peerapat. He said over the long term, Bitcoin can maintain its bull run. "The increase is just starting and now is the time to buy," said Mr Peerapat. "Bitcoin is seen as a store of wealth. It is a new asset that can substitute for money. The amount to invest in Bitcoin should match your level of knowledge of the cryptocurrency." Speculation on Bitcoin after the US election drove the price to surpass $91,000 on Nov 14. "This market movement is not just about price, but a structural change in the financial ecosystem that will determine the future of the global financial system," said Mr Nirun. "Financial institutions are making major adjustments to meet growing customer demand and business opportunities. We are seeing a clearer convergence between traditional and digital finance, driven by policy and institutional acceptance," he said. "This reshuffle signals a clear recognition of the role of crypto at the policy level. We expect to see the development of a more pro-innovation legal and regulatory framework, while maintaining a focus on investor protection and system stability." The development of technological infrastructure, the creation of new products and services, and the development of personnel with expertise in digital assets are occurring rapidly in the financial sector. These changes will help increase efficiency and reduce costs in the overall financial system. In terms of investment product development, the industry is starting to see the rise of more sophisticated financial instruments, such as digital asset-based ETFs, derivatives and structured products that combine digital and traditional assets. These financial innovations will increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market. The integration of traditional and digital financial markets is accelerating, especially in terms of infrastructure, payment systems and risk management. Leading financial institutions around the world are investing heavily in blockchain technology and digital systems to support the growth of the digital asset market, he said. "The future of capital markets will be a seamless integration of traditional and digital systems. This shift will affect the allocation of capital worldwide, especially in emerging markets that may benefit from easier access to funds, lower transaction costs and increased fundraising efficiency," said Mr Nirun.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Stocks That Could 10X Over the Next 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) stands against the other stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. The new president of the United States is set to take office in January 2025, and investors are concerned about how the new policies will impact big tech. On November 14, Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO of IBM, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his expectations from big tech as the new presidency takes over the White House. Krishna shares that he expects more innovation and less regulation in the tech sector, with certain "guardrails." He adds that the business community is particularly excited and expects strong tailwinds to the US economy as we enter 2025. In the same interview, William Kerwin, an analyst at Morningstar Technology, appeared to discuss the potential future of big tech under the new presidency and how the new policies could impact companies, particularly those trading in China. Kerwin emphasizes that a lot is yet to unfold but the most crucial element is tariffs. With a proposed 60% tariff on Chinese imports, companies reliant on the region will face severe headwinds and may have to seek trade relationships with other regions like India and Southeast Asia. However, he does add that high exposure to China does not necessarily equate to "high investment risk." READ ALSO 10 Best Predictive Analytics Stocks to Invest in Now and 12 Cheap Chinese Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Speaking of mergers and acquisitions and antitrust regulations, Kerwin is rather optimistic. He expects more merger and acquisition deals to come through over the next four years. In addition to that, he expresses that anti-trust regulations are less likely to be focused on a specific company or a product, and more on the platforms and their respective use cases offered by big tech. Kerwin also adds that he does not expect significant breakups but foresees regulations to be enforced that "erode" the competitive advantages the big tech companies enjoy at the moment. Kerwin believes that companies well exposed to artificial intelligence are currently overvalued. However, he reiterates that this "does not mean" that there are not any opportunities within the sector. He also shares a couple of names in the chip equipment and semiconductor sectors that are well-positioned at the moment. He suggests that while these sectors are pressed over cyclicality worries and the fear of AI reaching maturity, some companies hold promise and are valuable. Since investors are excited to see the business opportunities coming over the next four years, there are certain stocks, especially in the realm of technology, most likely to gain significant momentum. That said, let's take a look at the 8 stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. Our Methodology To come up with the 8 stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks.

Title: Is Rio Tinto Group (RIO) the Best Nickel Stock to Invest in?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Nickel Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) stands against other best nickel stocks to invest in. Investing News Network highlighted that Nickel witnessed strong price momentum in H1 of the year as the prices took support from investor sentiment and speculation throughout commodity markets which saw a surge in prices for precious and base metals. Nickel prices remained volatile during Q3 2024 due to market speculation, Chinese stimulus, and oversupply. Among the contributing factors was the supply of laterite nickel out of Indonesia, which led to mine curtailments in New Caledonia, Australia, and Europe. Furthermore, the increased demand for battery production in China is yet to reach the levels required to make up for the increased supply. Despite the EV sector in China showing a YoY increase of 32% during the first 9 months of 2024, the industry's nickel demand was not able to make up for shortcomings in the broader economy. Nickel remains a critical component in NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) batteries, which are used in EVs. For the last few quarters, the market saw a significant oversupply of nickel from Asian markets, mainly from Indonesia. As per S&P Global, mined nickel production from the country saw an increase of 99,000 metric tons during Q3 2024 and is expected to be in the 2.4 million metric ton range by 2024-end, making up 57% of total global production. Despite growing demand for batteries, the oversupply situation has not been under control. This is mainly because of a weak Chinese economy. China has been tagged as the largest consumer of nickel in the world as a majority of the metal is being used in stainless steel production. However, a difficult real estate sector and broad economic deflation impacted the demand. Investing News Network went on to say that Nickel found pricing support in September, with the Chinese government rolling out stimulus measures focused on fueling economic growth. The measures also included a 0.5% cut to the mortgages and a reduction in the downpayment to buy a home to 15% from 25%. Even though there was an initial surge in nickel prices after the package, the prices retreated once again. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. Despite the challenging market conditions, Nickel’s long-term demand in the EV industry is robust. According to EV Magazine, as automakers prioritize the high-nickel battery chemistries because of range and performance advantages, nickel consumption should be fueled as a result of the global shift toward electrification. As per Benchmark estimates, the battery nickel demand is expected to triple by the year 2030. Mid and high-level performance EVs are expected to fuel the growth of battery nickel demand in the coming years, mainly in Western markets. Benchmark projections demonstrate that nickel-based chemistries will capture 85% of battery cell production capacity outside of China by the year 2030. The batteries should make up for more than 50% of nickel demand growth by 2030, touching 1.5 million tonnes of nickel demand by the decade's end.

In order to compile a list of the 10 best virtual reality stocks to buy now, we utilized stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies with the highest market caps. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best virtual reality stocks to buy now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Average Upside Potential: 29.5% Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) is a multinational mining and metals company, which is engaged in producing nickel and other minerals. Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO)’s definitive agreements with GravitHy in a bid to ramp up the decarbonization of steelmaking in Europe. As a part of this collaboration, Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) will supply high-grade direct reduction iron ore pellets from Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) operations to GravitHy’s planned operation, and manage the sales and marketing of ultra-low carbon Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) GravitHy produces. The steel produced with low-carbon emissions is a critical component of the net-zero energy transition. As per Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), the production of iron and steel contributes ~8% of global carbon emissions and needs new technologies, redesigned processes, and new infrastructure to decarbonize. This collaboration is aligned with Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO)’s steel decarbonization strategy to ramp up the development of low-carbon Electric Arc Furnace steelmaking with high-grade iron as feedstock. This should enable Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) to reduce its Scope 3 emissions and create valuable decarbonized pathways for high-grade iron ore. Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) remains focused on its decarbonization efforts. In this regard, the company signed an MoU with China's Nanjing Iron and Steel Co. on decarbonization technology in ironmaking. Both firms would be exploring pelletizing using extracts from the Rio Tinto site in Pilbara, Western Australia. Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) has moved from strategy to action on decarbonization and continues to make clear progress towards its climate targets: a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050. These alliances point to Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO)’s decarbonization efforts, which should result in a reduction of carbon footprint and reach climate goals. Overall, RIO ranks 3rd on our list of best nickel stocks to invest in according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of RIO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than RIO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Analyst Upside as of November 18, 2024: 29% Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the stocks that could 10x over the next three years. The semiconductor company makes chips for technology giants like NVIDIA and AMD. In the third quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) logged revenue worth $23.7 billion (NT$759.69 billion) and net income worth $10.13 billion (NT$325.26 billion), up by 39% and 54.2% year-over-year, respectively. TSM attributes its revenue growth to the increasing demand for artificial intelligence and expects its four-year revenue to increase by nearly 30%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is expanding its presence across the world. The company recently formed a joint venture with major partners in Germany and expanded its partnership with Amkor to facilitate advanced packaging in Arizona, fueling the semiconductor ecosystem in the region. In addition to that, the company expects to spend $32 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures in 2024, allocated to advanced process technologies, specialty technologies, and advanced packaging and testing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) expects revenue from AI chips to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% by 2027. Baron Global Advantage Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We established a small position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987, as the world’s first dedicated semiconductor foundry. Until then, semiconductor chips were always designed and manufactured by the same company. TSMC introduced a groundbreaking new business model, in which it acted purely as a contract manufacturer, which proved to be highly successful. TSMC maintained a focus on improving its manufacturing process technology and enabled the emergence of innovative fabless design companies, including NVIDIA, Apple, and Qualcomm, who became TSMC’s key customers. Today, TSMC has a more than 60% share of the total semiconductor foundry market and over 90% share in leading-edge manufacturing. TSMC enjoys high barriers to entry given the ever-increasing cost and technological complexity of semiconductor manufacturing while benefiting from economies of scope as once leading-edge manufacturing becomes lagging edge on fully depreciated equipment. TSMC also benefits from scale– higher profits lead to higher R&D and capex investments, allowing for further technological differentiation, resulting in more profits. We believe TSMC will sustain strong double-digit earnings growth for years to come, driven by continued market share gains, strong pricing power, and structural growth in AI demand. According to C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, “almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address the insatiable AI-related demand.”6 Management forecasts that revenue from server AI chips, such as GPUs and other AI accelerators, will grow at a 50% CAGR from 2022 to 2028 and account for more than 20% of TSMC’s revenue by 2028. We except further long-term upside from the eventual proliferation of edge AI devices, including AI smartphones and AI PCs, which will require significantly more computing power and drive even stronger demand for TSMC’s leading-edge technology.” Overall TSM ranks 5th on our list of the stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Energy Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) stands against the other promising energy stocks. In the next decade, global power demand is expected to grow by over 30%, largely fueled by economic growth in emerging markets and the electrification of various sectors. Data centers and artificial intelligence are becoming major energy consumers, increasingly relying on renewable sources like solar and wind power. Although efforts to improve energy efficiency may help mitigate some of this demand, the Asia-Pacific region is projected to account for a significant portion of the increase, capturing 66% of the total growth in electricity demand. In response to the rising demand, there is a strong focus on clean energy sources to meet environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, as well as to qualify for tax incentives, reshaping the entire industry. Renewable energy is projected to increase by more than 740 gigawatts each year from now until 2035. By that year, carbon-free resources, including renewables, hydropower, nuclear energy, and battery storage, are expected to make up 70% of the total installed generation capacity. This shift is also driving significant investments and various initiatives across the industry. This includes renewable energy startups, traditional oil and gas companies, and associated manufacturing and technology firms. Investment in the energy transition is gaining momentum, with the US experiencing a 22% increase in 2023, reaching $303 billion. While this amount is substantial, it remains relatively small compared to the global total of $1.77 trillion.

In the United States, fossil fuels and nuclear power together account for 75% of energy production, while renewables contribute just under 25%. On a global scale, renewable sources now represent 30% of electricity generation. Another emerging trend in the energy sector is the rise of mergers and acquisitions. According to Bloomberg, over $155 billion in deals were finalized in the fourth quarter of 2023 alone, exceeding the total from the previous five quarters combined. As companies face challenging market and economic conditions, consolidation within the oil and gas industry, particularly among upstream, midstream, and oil field services companies, is expected to continue. Oil prices significantly influence the performance of energy stocks, leading to a volatile year for the sector. Stock prices have fluctuated in response to changing oil prices. Despite this volatility, there are still investment opportunities within the energy sector, including traditional oil and gas companies, midstream businesses, and firms focused on renewable energy. With this context in mind, let's take a look at the 10 most promising energy stocks according to hedge funds. To shortlist the 10 most promising energy stocks, we used stock screeners like Yahoo Finance and Finviz to identify the largest energy companies. From there, we refined our selections to 10 stocks based on hedge fund sentiment using our database of 912 top hedge funds as of Q2 2024. The most promising energy stocks have been ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding a stake in them. Note: Although the theme of the article is Oil and Gas stocks, we've also added renewable energy stocks since many oil and gas companies are also diversifying in renewable energy. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) has kept a steady dividend payment record since 1987. Recently, the company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend to 50 cents per share, marking a 14.3% increase from the previous dividend. The company is set to be acquired by Chevron (NYSE:CVX) for $53 billion. This acquisition aligns with the broader trend of major energy companies expanding their shale oil production footprint in the United States. Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) shareholders will receive 1.025 Chevron (NYSE:CVX) shares for each of their Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) shares, making the deal attractive for investors. The company’s stock has been rated a “Moderate Buy.” Bailard Inc. was the leading hedge fund investor in the company as of Q2 2024, with a stake worth over $2.5 million. Overall HES ranks 5th among the most promising energy stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of HES as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HES but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently published a list of 15 AI News and Ratings You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news and ratings you should not miss. AI technology has forced businesses worldwide to reconsider their money making models. This revolutionary change is now making its way into the government sector as well. According to a report from news agency Reuters, Mothibi Ramusi, the chief of the communications regulator in South Africa, recently said that the information and communications technology sector needs policy and regulatory changes to keep up with emerging technologies. The country is also debating new regulations for mobile virtual networks and spectrum sharing. The regulator has initiated an inquiry into the licensing framework for satellite-internet providers to provide clear rules for potential operators in the country. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. In Japan, multinational conglomerate Softbank has partnered with chipmaker NVIDIA in a partnership that aims to turn communication base stations from cost centers into AI revenue-producing assets. The latter claims that traditional telco networks are built to handle peak loads and usually use only about one-third of their capacity. With AI-RAN, a new communications tech, they can expect to monetize the remaining two-thirds of the capacity for AI inference services. Softbank estimates a return of up to 219% for every AI-RAN server it adds to its infrastructure.

Title: D&D: ‘Monster Manual’ Previews Hidden In The Free Adventures
URL: https://www.belloflostsouls.net/2024/11/dd-monster-manual-previews-hidden-in-the-free-adventures.html
Time Published: 2024-11-18T17:52:48Z
Full Content:
Trending Topics Follow BoLS Explore our other sites It won’t be out for a few months yet, but these Monster Manual previews, scattered in some of the new adventures, foretell things to come. The new 5.5E Monster Manual won’t be out for a few months yet. February is, at press time, not yet right around the corner. Which is a relief, because I’m finally getting the hang of September. But though time stands between you and the completion of the 5.5E core rulebook set (first printing), you can still catch a glimpse of what lies in store. Monster Manual previews are scattered throughout the books and adventures released so far. Scions of Elemental Evil, Uni and the Hunt for the Lost Horn, and the adventures included in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, as well as stat blocks in the Player’s Handbook, all point to what the new Monster Manual will be like. Here are a few things we’ve learned. First things first, Monsters in 5.5E look a lot like they did in 5E. The wheel hasn’t been reinvented; it’s just had its numbers crunched a bit more. At least, that’s what they say. I haven’t actually done a number crunch myself. Every time I think of the phrase “number crunch,” my brain just sort of short circuits to WoW Guild Pals For Life’s seminal video about a man who returns from being AFK to grab some chicken, which came out 19 years ago now. But we’re not here to see what happens when Blackrock Whelps overwhelm a party. We’re here to talk about the Monster Manual previews sprinkled throughout the adventures. One of the first lessons we learn is all about mages and other magic-using enemies. And that is the return and evolution of the “magic attack” from Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse. In Hunt for the Lost Horn, we see the Mage, a new CR 6 NPC that could potentially be an enemy or ally NPC spellcaster. It follows a familiar format. A unique “magic attack,” in this case an Arcane Burst, which is a ranged or melee spell attack that does 3d10 damage and can be made three at a time thanks to its multiattack feature. The mage also has a handful of spells, including Fireball and Cone of Cold. Another quick lesson we learn from the same adventure is that some previous things like Pack Tactics seem to have been folded into the attacks themselves. It’s like weapon mastery properties but for monsters. Take the Worg from the same adventure. It has a Bite Attack. But an innate part of the bite attack is that the next attack roll made against a target bitten by a Worg has advantage. It’s no longer a separate trait DMs are likely to forget. It’s a subtle change, but one I think makes Monsters a bit more dynamic and interesting. Another thing we see is a lot more monsters with ranged attacks. The Bugbear Warrior, featured in Scions of Elemental Evil comes with a Light Hammer. Ignore for now that Light Hammer is an awful name for a weapon. Because while it’s a bad name, the hammer can be thrown or used in a grapple. Sometimes, though, your enemies will roll up armed with a brace of pistols. Take the Pirate Captain out of Scions of Elemental Evil. They can just shoot you with a pistol as much as they like (up to three times per round). Each shot does 2d10 + 4 damage on a hit. They get to ignore the Loading property of a pistol. But if that bothers you as a DM, don’t worry. You can just say it’s a brace of pistols and determine when they run out. D&D being the way it is, they’ll be dead before they can make more than a handful of attacks. But this is a trend we see a lot of: monsters with multiple attacks and multiple modes of attack. I think monsters may feel a little more dynamic overall. The DM may have more options for monsters to use to adapt to the unfurling situation of combat. Look for the Monster Manual in February 2025!

That’s what the hedge fund legend said in an interview last month, and it's part of why he's long been an outspoken Bitcoin bull. And Tudor Jones walks the walk, too: His hedge fund has massively upped its exposure to “digital gold” via the largest Bitcoin ETF in the United States. A new 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from last week shows that Tudor Investment Corporation held over 4.4 million shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF), as of September 30. That stash was worth about $160 million at the time, but is now valued at $230 million at the current price. Back in June, the hedge fund held just 869,565 shares of the ETF, which trades under the ticker IBIT. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, now allows more traditional investors to get exposure to Bitcoin via its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. An ETF is a popular investment vehicle allowing people to buy shares that track an underlying asset—which could be anything from foreign currency and gold to U.S. equities or copper. The SEC in January approved Bitcoin ETFs, allowing them to trade on stock exchanges and opening the doors to a new class of crypto investors. BlackRock’s ETF has received the biggest inflows and day-to-day trading action. Jones, who has spoken about Bitcoin for years, earlier this month said that he thought the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency was a good bet because of increasing U.S. federal debt. He added that gold and commodities were also what he’s favored for his portfolio as of late. “I think all roads lead to inflation,” he said in a CNBC interview. “I’m long gold, I’m long Bitcoin. I think commodities are so ridiculously underowned—so I’m long commodities.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Home completions have jumped nearly five-fold in a decade, Glenageary in south Dublin has the highest average monthly rent in the State while the average price paid for a property in Dublin is now over €600,000. These are just of some housing data points contained the Central Statistics Office’s (CSO) new housing hub, described by the agency as a “one-stop shop” for key information about the sector. “The purpose of this new housing hub is to collate statistics on housing in Ireland from the CSO and other public sector organisations in one easy to find location,” the agency said. It comes as housing emerges as the main political issue in the general election campaign with parties presenting different policies for dealing with the crisis. The CSO denied the launch had anything to do with the election though, noting the hub “has been in development for months and has been on our online release calendar since mid-September”. The CSO said its new resource provided a range of information, broken down into four main themes: home building; home prices and rents; cost of building homes; and housing features. It showed the top 10 highest average monthly rents were all located in Dublin, with Glenageary being the highest at €2,808 followed by Sandymount (€2,654), Dalkey (€2,651), Booterstown (€2,549), Ballsbridge (€2,523), Sandycove (€2,506), Clonskeagh (€2,497), Pembroke (€2,482), Blackrock (€2,455) and Killiney (€2,439). The most expensive area outside Dublin was Greystones, Wicklow (€2,155) followed by Bishoptown, Cork (€1,912) and Castletroy, Limerick (€1,849). The hub also indicated that the average or mean price paid for a home nationally in the 12 months to August this year was €419,893 while the average in Dublin was €613,492. The figures also show that in 2022 the population grew by 8 per cent while the State’s housing stock grew by 5 per cent. They also show that new dwelling completions rose from just 6,994 in 2011 to a post-crash high of 32,548 last year.

Title: 'I'm One Of You' – How 'Anti-Woke' Warrior Vivek Ramaswamy Became A Billionaire At Only 38

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Vivek Ramaswamy is a name making waves. Whether it's his stance against corporate "wokeness" or his ambitious political moves, people have started paying attention to him. But behind all the headlines, Ramaswamy has an intriguing story: a child of Indian immigrants who turned his biotech gamble into a billion-dollar fortune – all by age 38. Don't Miss: Warren Buffett Flipped His Neighbor's $67,000 Life Savings Into A $50 Million Fortune — This Would Be Worth Over $500 Million Today Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. Born to Indian immigrant parents, Vivek Ramaswamy grew up with a strong work ethic. Forbes reports his dad worked as an engineer and patent attorney while his mom was a psychiatrist. He didn't coast by in school – Ramaswamy graduated from Harvard with a biology degree and cofounded a startup that helped student founders pitch business ideas to investors. It wasn't a big moneymaker but gave him a taste of entrepreneurship. After Harvard, Ramaswamy worked at QVT, a hedge fund specializing in pharmaceutical investments. By 28, he had become a partner, earning about $7 million. Trending: Studies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do — to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor. At 29, Ramaswamy took a big swing. He left his hedge fund job to found Roivant Sciences (NASDAQ:ROIV), an investment company focused on rescuing abandoned drugs. His bet? That some forgotten treatments could still be worth billions. He was right. Just a year after founding Roivant, one of its subsidiaries, Axovant, went public with a valuation of $2.2 billion. Ramaswamy had bought the Alzheimer's drug that Axovant was based on for only $5 million. While that drug ultimately didn't work out, it didn't stop Ramaswamy from scoring big elsewhere. However, as Forbes writes, in 2020, a Japanese pharmaceutical company bought several of Roivant’s drugs for $3 billion. That sale alone made Ramaswamy an instant multimillionaire. By then, he'd pulled in about $260 million in salary, bonuses and capital gains from Roivant. He invested his gains wisely, mostly in stocks and bonds and riskier bets like Bitcoin, ethereum and Rumble, a YouTube competitor. Trending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share In 2021, Ramaswamy decided to switch gears. He stepped down as CEO of Roivant and focused on politics. He wrote a book called Woke, Inc., where he tore into corporate America’s focus on social justice and the environment. He argued that big companies forgot about making quality products and focused too much on "good PR." The book turned heads and put Ramaswamy on the map as a vocal critic of what he called "woke capitalism." Not long after, he launched Strive Asset Management, an "anti-woke" version of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), one of the largest asset managers in the world. Ramaswamy's firm encouraged businesses to focus on profits, not politics. Investors seemed to like it; Strive was recently valued at about $300 million. Heavy hitters like Peter Thiel, Bill Ackman and Joe Lonsdale even backed it, helping Ramaswamy grow his wealth further. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Ramaswamy has tried to position himself as a regular guy, unlike other wealthy figures. He's got two homes in Ohio worth $2.5 million combined, which may sound like a lot, but it’s far less than many other political figures. He insists that his lifestyle is modest compared to other rich people, though he does admit to owning stakes in three private jets. "If we could buy time, we would buy time. And that's the only thing private aviation buys us. Time with family," he says. See Also: Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? The percentage may shock you. During a campaign stop in New Hampshire, a woman thanked him, a billionaire, for visiting the "cow-town people." Ramaswamy smiled and said, "I'm one of you." He's not, of course – and that might be part of the appeal. People see someone who took big risks, succeeded and isn't apologizing for his wealth. Now, Ramaswamy is stepping even deeper into public life. Recently, President-elect Donald Trump appointed him and Elon Musk as coheads of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new initiative to cut government waste and slash regulations.

Title: Is Illumina, Inc. (ILMN) the Best Immunotherapy Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Immunotherapy Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) stands against the other immunotherapy stocks. The global immunotherapy drugs market is rapidly expanding, with projections to grow from $240 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2033. The growth is driven by the global rise in chronic diseases such as different types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Cancer, particularly is becoming more prevalent among people globally. The American Cancer Society recently released its 2024 Global Cancer Statistics report, which highlights the increasing burden of cancer worldwide. In 2022 alone, approximately 20 million new cancer cases were diagnosed, and 9.7 million people died from the disease. By 2050, annual cancer cases are expected to reach 35 million, driving demand for innovative treatments like immunotherapy. Immunotherapy offers a promising alternative to traditional therapies, and its applications are expanding as research advances. It can be applied to various types of cancer, either alone or alongside treatments like chemotherapy. Immunomodulating agents, a type of non-specific immunotherapy, help improve the body’s immune system's capability of detecting and attacking cancer cells. Read Also: 10 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy Under $20 and 10 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now. Due to the growing demand for treatments, leading pharmaceutical companies are also investing heavily in research and development to expand the range of immunotherapy drugs available. These include immune checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapies, and monoclonal antibodies. Combining different therapies and tailoring treatments to individual patients is helping to unlock new applications for immunotherapy, positioning it to revolutionize cancer care and other areas of medicine. North America led the global immunotherapy drugs industry in 2023, capturing over 48.19% of total revenue, driven by medical advancements and regulatory approvals, particularly in the US. The FDA's approval of immunotherapy for cancers with specific genetic traits, regardless of origin, highlights the region's leadership in innovative treatments like tumor-agnostic therapies. With over 2 million new cancer cases expected in the US in 2024, demand for effective treatments like immunotherapy will continue to grow. Organizations such as Canada’s National Research Council are also developing new immunotherapies, aiming to provide hope for patients with hard-to-treat cancers like B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. We selected stocks from ETFs with immunotherapy exposure and narrowed down the list to the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. The hedge fund sentiment has been sourced from Insider Monkey's database of 912 hedge funds as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A research facility with medical professionals surrounded by diagnostic equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a leading genomics company that provides advanced tools for analyzing DNA and RNA. Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) plays a key role in advancing immunotherapy research, particularly through its next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. These tools help scientists study the mechanisms by which tumors evade the immune system and identify therapeutic targets that could boost immune responses against cancer. Wall Street analysts and investors are optimistic about Illumina, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:ILMN) future, especially after the Grail spin-off in 2024 and the acquisition of Fluent Biosciences to improve its single-cell analysis and multiomics capabilities. In Q2, Illumina exceeded expectations, achieving Core Illumina revenue of $1.1 billion and operating margins of 22.2%, supported by steady progress on its strategic goals. The stock has received a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy.” Here’s what Patient Capital Management said about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a good example. We entered the name late last year as the company began to trade at a 5-yr low. The company is a leader in the genomic sequencing space but made an ill-advised acquisition of Grail, a blood-based multi-cancer early detection product, in 2021 for $8B dollars. Grail was an annual ~$600m drag on profitability hitting the financials at the same time that competition began to pick up and the overall demand environment began to weaken. Despite increased competition in the genome sequencing space, Illumina continues to be a leader with ~80% market share today. With the successful separation of Grail Inc. (GRAL) in June, Illumina has now returned to a pure-play sequencing company. As the company returns to historical profitability post Grail spin-off and as the demand environment normalizes post COVID, we believe you can buy a market leader in a secularly growing industry for less than a market multiple.” Overall ILMN ranks 5th on our list of the best immunotherapy stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of ILMN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ILMN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: There are 'no natural sellers' in stocks: BlackRock's Rick Rieder

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks stalled out last week following their post-election pop, but strategists, including Rick Rieder of BlackRock and John Stoltzfus of Oppenheimer, are still longer-term bulls. “There are no natural sellers,” Rieder said at the recent Yahoo Finance Invest conference. He’s the chief investment officer of fixed income for the asset management giant, and his remit also includes overseeing $150 billion of equities. Rieder said there are two forces supporting equities. First, earnings are growing. “I think the multiples are high. But if you think the E in PE [price-earnings ratio] is going to be significantly higher, you get that multiple to a reasonable level.” Second, “The technicals are crazy for equities,” Rieder said. That’s in part because of the lack of sellers, as the massive amount of dollars in 401(k)s allocated to stocks, plus companies buying back their own shares, provides lots of buyers. As for Stoltzfus, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, he just raised his year-end 2024 target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) for the third time. He was one of the most bullish strategists on the Street coming into the year, and he now sees the index closing out at 6,200. (He has yet to set his forecast for 2025). Stoltzfus told Yahoo Finance in an interview that stocks, the economy, and business growth have continued to defy expectations. "Second and third quarter earnings growth and revenue growth have outperformed consensus expectations," he said. "We were looking for much less growth. And then the Fed has been remarkably successful [at averting a recession]. The consumer and jobs have all proven resilient, even if slowing somewhat is a result of the effects of the Fed going after inflation for over two, two and a half years." Of course, that’s not even factoring in the fiscal policy of the incoming Trump administration, which many strategists expect to help further juice growth. One of them is Ed Yardeni, who recently set a target of 7,000 for the S&P 500 for the end of 2025 and said the election had reignited “animal spirits” in the market. “I think we're just seeing a more pro-business administration coming in that undoubtedly will cut taxes,” Yardeni said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “And not only for corporations but also for individuals. Lots of various kinds of tax cuts have been discussed, and in addition to that, a lot of deregulation. So we're upping our estimates for what profit margins are going to be doing over the next couple of years.” Rieder and Stoltzfus agree that a far-off potential risk for stocks and the economy more broadly could be the ballooning of the US deficit and debt, and a possible resultant buyers' strike in the Treasury market that could send yields higher. However, markets aren’t concerned at the moment. “I think markets tend to react to the shark closest to the boat,” Rieder said. “The shark on the debt dynamic is not going to be next to the boat in January or February, but it is going to get next to the boat sometime. I don't know if it's the latter part of 2025 or the beginning of 2026 unless they address the size of the spending dynamics, the amount of debt we're issuing, and, then obviously, inflation relative to that.” Last week showed euphoria was dampened but perhaps not eliminated. The S&P 500 had its worst week since September, falling 2.1%. That also means it closed 2.1% below its record high of 6,001.35, a level that could be quickly surpassed if the “animal spirits” that Yardeni invoked reassert themselves.

Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have surged to become some of the fastest-growing ETFs of all-time following their January debut and led by BlackRock's $42 billion bitcoin fund, could be about to be approved for options trading after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an advisory notice. "[I]n light of relevant precedents in the courts, it is substantially likely these spot commodity ETF shares would be held to be securities," a CFTC spokesperson wrote. "Therefore, [the Division of Clearing and Risk's] DCR position is the listing of these shares on [Security and Exchange Commission] SEC-registered national securities exchanges does not implicate the CFTC’s jurisdiction, and therefore, the clearing of these options by OCC would be undertaken in its capacity as a registered clearing agency subject to SEC oversight." Bitcoin spot ETF options were given the green light by the U.S. SEC in September when BlackRock's proposal to list and trade options for its IBIT fund was approved, with the CFTC notice the "second hurdle they needed to clear," according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. Options trading for the fleet of a dozen U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs is expected to "attract more liquidity which will in turn attract more big fish" to the market as institutions and market regulators warm up to the technology.

BlackRock’s bitcoin fund has grown by $13 billion since Donald Trump's U.S. election victory with BlackRock winning 85% of the record $1.3 billion of inflows that hit the combined U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs on the Thursday after the election, according to Kaiko Research. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood, a so-called innovation and disruption investor who runs the Ark Invest fund, has reiterated her $1.5 million bitcoin price prediction—which she expects will make bitcoin a $30 trillion asset by 2030. "We have a 2030 target, in our base case it’s around $650,000, in our bull case, it’s between $1 million and $1.5 million," Wood told CNBC, adding "regulatory relief" in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential victory and increased interest from Wall Street will fuel a bitcoin price boom. "It is a new asset class and what that means is institutions, and asset allocators are saying 'this asset is behaving differently from all our other assets and we need to include it,'" Wood said.

November 18, 2024 08:15 ET | Source: Watershed Watershed SAN FRANCISCO, CA & LONDON, UK, Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Watershed, the enterprise sustainability platform, announced today that it has facilitated the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc) on behalf of customers including BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block. The purchases, coordinated with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), will add high-integrity sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) directly to Alaska Airlines passenger flights, and the SAFc will be applied to the companies’ corporate footprints to compensate for business travel emissions. This investment supports the production and use of SAF, an emerging climate technology for air travel. The purchases are part of SABA’s largest-ever collection of deals, announced in April 2024: commitments expected to result in $200M of SAFc worth roughly 50 million gallons of SAF, or 500,000 tonnes of abated CO2e over the next five years. Watershed is an aggregator partner of SABA, which accelerates investment in, and adoption of, sustainable aviation fuel. With this purchase, Watershed customers including BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block are participants in SABA. “We see collective engagement in the SAF market as a compelling demand signal,” said Claire Kiely, Head of Watershed Marketplace Carbon Supply. “Watershed consolidates our customers’ demand for high-impact, low-carbon technology like sustainable aviation fuel, then works with SAF suppliers, airlines, and experts through SABA to meet that demand and grow an essential new sector. By participating in this historic investment, Watershed customers are providing a powerful demand signal for SAF and affirming the role SAFc will play in corporate emissions reduction initiatives.” “Alaska Airlines is all-in on advancing the market for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), a critical element in the path to decarbonize aviation,” said Diana Birkett Rakow, Senior Vice President of Public Affairs and Sustainability, Alaska Airlines. "We are one of the founding members of SABA’s Aviators group because we know that we will only reach our destination if we’re tackling this challenge from all angles–business, policy, financing, and more. Investing in SAF alongside partners like Watershed, BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block helps us scale up use and provides critical demand signals for the market. We’re grateful for their leadership and partnership, and look forward to even more collaboration as they join SABA." “Aggregator partners like Watershed play a pivotal role in helping accelerate the growth of green commodity markets. By consolidating demand among its customers, Watershed is helping SABA send a larger demand signal to the SAF market while enabling us to welcome a new set of leading corporations. SAFc purchases from BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block further our efforts to decarbonize the future of flight,” said Kim Carnahan, Head of SABA’s Secretariat and CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation. "Ripple remains committed to accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy, and joining the push for sustainable aviation fuel is an important step in our journey to net-zero carbon by 2030,” said Ken Weber, VP of Social Impact & Sustainability at Ripple. “We’re thrilled to work with SABA, Watershed, and alongside other leading organizations to help advance the most promising, scalable climate positive energy solutions. We see sustainable aviation fuel as a key pathway toward decarbonizing air travel, a vital global industry, and through collaboration with Watershed and SABA we are not only supporting the growth of SAF, but also empowering other companies to take similar meaningful steps in reducing their emissions footprint.” SAF is made with renewable or waste feedstocks. It can be used in today's aircraft without investments to upgrade existing fleets and infrastructure, and can significantly reduce the carbon emissions from flights. SAF purchased through the SABA transaction will achieve, on average, an 80% reduction in carbon intensity relative to conventional jet fuel. While the industry is growing rapidly, SAF still makes up less than 0.5% of global jet fuel supply and today sells at a premium compared to fossil jet fuel. To scale and meet its full potential, the nascent SAF sector needs both market support—through strong corporate demand and investment—and robust infrastructure. SABA’s book and claim model is designed to set up intentional, high-integrity market infrastructure for the long term. In addition to pooling corporate demand for SAF purchasing, SABA has put in place tracking, registry, and reporting mechanisms that validate SAF as a carbon dioxide reduction commodity. ### ABOUT WATERSHED: Watershed is the enterprise sustainability platform. Companies like Airbnb, Carlyle Group, FedEx, Visa, and Dr. Martens use Watershed to manage climate and ESG data, produce audit-ready metrics for voluntary and regulatory reporting including CSRD, and facilitate real decarbonization. Watershed is the platform of choice for companies seeking to reduce emissions, meet customer, investor and regulatory requirements, and modernize their sustainability programs. Watershed customers also have exclusive access to a marketplace of pre-vetted, high-quality carbon projects and groundbreaking virtual power purchase agreements.

Title: ‘Dying A Slow Death’: Has Ethereum Lost Wall Street’s Favor To Bitcoin?

Full Content:
Blackrock Ethereum has broken an eight-year support trend against Bitcoin, raising questions about the second-largest cryptocurrency’s future. “Dying a slow death”—that’s how Tuur Demeester, founder of Bitcoin hedge fund Adamant Capital, described Ethereum, pointing to the broken trendline to a canary in the coal mine. Crypto analysts blame Ethereum’s setback on slow institutional adoption, where Bitcoin continues to dominate. This could have deeper implications for Ethereum’s positioning as an asset class. Ethereum’s struggles come during a mixed week for the broader crypto market. Bitcoin’s price is flat Monday, hovering around the $90,000 mark, while Ethereum has dropped 0.3% to $3,080. Altcoins are a mixed bag: Solana is up 4.6%, Dogecoin is flat, XRP has gained 7.2%, BNB is down 2.3%, and Cardano is up 2.9%. According to Kaiko, a crypto data firm, Bitcoin’s dominance over Ethereum is due to its superior adoption among institutional investors, particularly through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The disparity became more evident with the launch of crypto ETFs—with Bitcoin ETFs drawing significantly higher trading volumes than Ethereum ETFs. In fact, Bitcoin ETFs garnered more than $47 billion in assets within their first 30 days, while Ethereum ETFs brought in just over $6.7 billion, according to Amberdata, a crypto analytics firm. “The divergence in performance and on-chain activity can also be attributed to the distinct value propositions of Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Amberdata noted in a recent report. “Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ has a simple and well-defined narrative as a store of value and inflation hedge, thanks in part to its fixed supply of 21 million BTC.” Bitcoin benefits from its fixed supply and simpler use case. Ethereum—though more versatile—suffers from scalability challenges and regulatory scrutiny, particularly regarding its transition to a proof-of-stake model. The divide extends to institutional endorsement. Bitcoin ETFs have already earned their name on Wall Street. For example, earlier this year, Fidelity added Bitcoin ETFs to 401(k) plans, while Morgan Stanley allowed its financial advisors to recommend these ETFs to clients. Ethereum, by contrast, has not received as much institutional backing. Even the best-performing Ethereum funds lag behind Bitcoin in terms of adoption and media attention, according to Amberdata. Demeester’s remark may be a bit of a stretch, but it reflects growing concerns about Ethereum’s positioning as an alternative asset class. To regain its edge, experts argue that Ethereum must address scalability issues and redefine its role as a technology-driven asset rather than competing directly with Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. Until then, institutional dollars appear to favor Bitcoin. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

November 18, 2024 07:17 ET | Source: FBS Markets FBS Markets SINGAPORE, Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FBS, a leading global broker, explores the rise of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and their transformative impact on international finance. Representing tangible and intangible assets like real estate and private credit digitally on blockchains, RWAs are redefining asset ownership by enabling fractional ownership and boosting liquidity. This innovation is reshaping global finance, offering retail and institutional investors more accessible and diversified portfolios. FBS analysts emphasize the significant advantages of RWAs, including reduced barriers to entry, streamlined operations, and democratized access to high-value assets. The surge in adoption is evident, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, where institutions like BlackRock and UBS are integrating tokenized assets into their offerings. These advancements highlight the role of RWAs in bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology, addressing inefficiencies and expanding global market participation. However, FBS also notes the challenges that come with this innovation. Scalability, regulation, and the need for robust blockchain infrastructure are key hurdles. FBS analysts suggest that as technology advances, solutions to these challenges will further solidify RWAs as a cornerstone of future financial ecosystems. For traders, understanding the dynamics of this rapidly evolving market is critical, offering new opportunities to align with emerging trends. Tokenization offers the potential to unlock trillions of dollars in otherwise inaccessible assets, broadening their availability to a wider audience. This innovation is reshaping industries like real estate, commodities, fine art, and intellectual property. By integrating RWAs into the global economy, tokenization is driving changes in asset management, trading practices, and portfolio diversification strategies. FBS analysts highlight the importance of keeping a close eye on the tokenized asset space. By staying informed about regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market trends, traders and investors can strategically position themselves to capitalize on this transformative wave. RWAs represent a significant evolution in financial systems, marking a shift toward a more inclusive and efficient global financial ecosystem.

Title: After losing 33% in the past year, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 7 shareholders own 52% of the company Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock Every investor in Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 6.5% increase in the share price after a year of 33% losses as a sign that returns may to begin trending higher. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cracker Barrel Old Country Store. Check out our latest analysis for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Cracker Barrel Old Country Store does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. It would appear that 9.3% of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store shares are controlled by hedge funds. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 16% of shares outstanding. With 12% and 9.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Biglari Capital LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. We did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. We can see that insiders own shares in Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$15m. Most would see this as a real positive. Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Cracker Barrel Old Country Store . But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Title: I earn $200,000 at Google after starting my career earning under $40,000. The reality is that money does buy happiness.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Khayla McCoy, a 33-year-old business analyst who more than quadrupled her income over 10 years. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I grew up in Madisonville, Tennessee, where many people live below the poverty line. The only conversations we had were about lacking things — having enough money for basic needs felt far-fetched. I always knew I wanted to achieve financial freedom. I graduated in 2013 with a degree in biology and landed my first job in New York City as a sessions assistant, making $39,000 a year. I was the first person in my family to make that much money. By 2019, I was making $90,000. Now I make over $200,000 annually in total compensation. Having more money has truly made me happier. When I moved to New York, I had two roommates and had to stick to a strict budget to afford my expenses, from rent, about $1,250, to student loans and everyday costs. My salary barely covered my bills, but I was committed to finding ways to afford living there. I knew my first job would be a stepping stone to bigger roles and higher-paying salaries. I enrolled in a personal-finance course from Ellevest and attended events I found on Meetup. I learned financial discipline and started planning ahead for unforeseen expenses and developing a method for organizing my money. I set up different cash accounts for recurring bills, emergency savings, and everyday spending needs. I hesitated to take risks with my money. At first, I deferred investing in stocks and a 401(k). Shortly after I turned 24, I finally felt like I was finding my financial footing and began investing about 5% of my salary in my 401(k). I started to understand the benefits of investing in the market. As my salary increased, I invested more in my 401(k) and other investment accounts. My family was proud of me, and I achieved many people's dreams of living and working in New York City, but I had a paralyzing fear I'd mess up my career and end up with no money. I stayed at my sessions-assistant job for two years, and my salary grew to $42,000. In 2015, I had a family emergency and left the workforce for two years. When I could work again, I moved back to New York, decided to pause my career in healthcare, and pivoted. I enrolled in an associate degree program from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in beauty-industry merchandising and marketing, which cost $30,000. I took out more student loans for this degree. In 2017, I landed a job in consumer packaged goods, making $50,700. After two years at that company, I decided I needed a better-paying job. I took a data-science course at General Assembly to learn how to use, analyze, and drive insights from data. The course cost $4,000, which was covered by a tuition-reimbursement program at my former company. In 2019, I got a job at BlackRock as a data analyst, which doubled my former salary. I was proud of myself, but I still had recurring anxiety about losing the job and the money. In 2021, I landed a job at Google, bumping up my salary again. That's when my finances seriously changed — and so did my level of happiness. When I started at Google, my base salary was $132,000. I felt financially stable for the first time. I knew I had the money to pay for whatever was thrown my way. When I faced a health scare this year, I had health insurance and a savings account to help me pay for those expenses without taking on medical debt. My total medical expenses were over $60,000 — I never could've covered them without my current salary and benefits. When you come from a lower socioeconomic background, you become accustomed to believing many things you need are actually wants, such as going to the dentist for an annual exam and cleaning. I'd convince myself to skip it because I thought I needed to stretch my cash to see how far it could go. It took a while to redefine my budget. When I was 30, I felt like I finally figured it out because I'd seen myself change my circumstances and create a much different life than the one I grew up in. When I was making less money, I felt like I had to be perfect at that job because I wanted to be considered indispensable to the company. Now I don't want to lose my job, but I would have a cushion if that happened. The other reason work feels less stressful is that my mindset has become more peaceful now that I'm not always thinking about money. I became the person in my friend group everyone came to for financial advice, so I started an online community that helps women define their relationship with money. I hope to use my money lessons to help others make better financial decisions. When people say money doesn't buy happiness, I tell them I disagree and give examples of how healthcare, safe shelter, and the ability to engage in hobbies and take healthy risks all support health and happiness. If I can't afford to make doctor's appointments or get my car fixed, those things directly impact my ability to show up in the world how I want. I always had a voice in my head that said if you want to have a chance to live a comfortable and productive life, you'll need to make a lot of money. That's the reality of it for me. Jump to

Title: Is Ericsson (ERIC) A Cheap NASDAQ Stock To Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ) (NASDAQ:ERIC) stands against other cheap NASDAQ stocks to invest in now. The stock market has been following an uptrend since it rebounded from the bear market in Q4 2022. The bear market that ended in Q2 2022 was regarded to be a fed-induced low as the interest rates were high during that time. However, since then the S&P 500 has finished higher in seven out of the eight quarters, including four consecutive quarters of growth. Over the last four quarters, the index has returned 36.3%. This figure is significant because such high return rates were last seen when the market was recovering from 2020 COVID-19 lows. READ MORE: 8 Best Video Conferencing Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and 10 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy Now. There has been significant stimulus for the bull market to continue ranging from the Fed cutting rates to the China stimulus, and an easing economy with strong data points. Jeremy Siegel, professor emeritus of finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business and WisdomTree chief economist shared his note on November 11 talking about the economic landscape and his perception of the election results. He describes last week as one of the most pivotal in recent memory, starting with the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points during its November meeting. This decision reflects a cautious approach, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s omission of phrases like “further progress” about inflation suggests a recognition that inflationary progress has plateaued. Siegel aligned with Powell’s assessment of rental inflation, indicating that the Fed is now fully aware of disinflationary trends within the housing sector. Siegel anticipates another rate cut at the December meeting, contingent on upcoming economic data, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), retail sales figures, and the November jobs report. He notes that if these indicators show weaker-than-expected results, it could increase pressure on the Fed to implement further cuts. Over the past 2 years starting from November 16, 2022, the NASDAQ composite has seen a 73% rise during this bull market. Analysts are now debating whether we can have a third year of this bull market or not. To discuss this, Nick Colas, DataTrek Research co-founder, joined CNBC on October 26. Colas thinks that this is a positive sign for the index and that there is still room for the NASDAQ to run higher. He pointed out that if we look back at 1971 when the index started, since then we have had 10 instances where the index rallied for two straight years. Historic data shows that in six of these 10 times, the NASDAQ index continued to rally for the third year as well and in four instances it didn’t. Colas mentioned that the overall average return of these 10 years was 4.4%, which was not very impressive, however, the lower return rate was due to the 4 losing years when the index failed to rally. The four losing years as pointed out by Colas were 1984, 1987, 1990, and 2011. Three of these 4 years were characterized by crises including the 1987 market crash, the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and the European debt crisis in 2011. If we take these 4 years out of the equation, the overall return for the NASDAQ in year three is 13.3%. Therefore, Colas believes that as long as we don’t have any crisis events, the momentum is historically said to continue in year three. Colas thinks the index should have at least a 10% return during the third year as historically speaking the index has delivered as much as 20% return rates during the third year. He acknowledges that many analysts think that since we have had two very strong years of growth the third might be a disappointment. However, Colas believes that today’s market environment is much healthier than the one we have had in history, and, based on that, the NASDAQ still has room to run. To curate the list of 10 cheap NASDAQ stocks to invest in now, we used the Finviz stock screener, Yahoo Finance, and Seeking Alpha. We used the screener to get an aggregated list of NASDAQ stocks that are trading below the average Forward P/E of 25.37 (as per Wall Street Journal). Next, we checked the Forward P/E of each stock from Seeking Alpha and earnings growth from Yahoo Finance. Lastly, we ranked the stocks in ascending order, based on the number of hedge funds holding each stock in Q2 2024, as per Insider Monkey’s database. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stocks Forward Price to Earnings Ratio: 18.15 Earnings Growth: 9.30% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 8 Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), commonly known as Ericsson, is a Swedish multinational company specializing in telecommunications and networking technology. Founded in 1876, Ericsson provides essential infrastructure, services, and software to the telecommunications industry and other sectors. The company operates through three main business segments including Networks, IT & Cloud, and Media. It generates revenue by selling hardware for mobile networks including the emerging 5G technologies. Moreover, the company also generates substantial revenue from its managed services and consulting related to cloud infrastructure. In its recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 report, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) emphasized its strategic focus on developing programmable networks that enhance performance and enable new revenue-generating applications. This approach is designed to go beyond traditional consumer mobile broadband by creating new use cases for enterprises and mission-critical operations, which are currently underutilized in revenue generation. Although the organic sales of the company declined during the third quarter by 1% year-over-year, it was still an improvement subsequently. North America became one of the strongest contenders with a strong 55% growth, driven by significant contract wins. As a result, the gross margins of the company improved from 39.2% during the previous year to 46.3% in Q3 2024. Moreover, EBITDA also improved to $728.66 million from $438 million in the comparable quarter last year. Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) also demonstrated strong free cash flow generation capability during the quarter which came at $1.20 billion for the quarter, up from negative $46.71 million during last year. It is one of the cheapest NASDAQ stocks to invest in now. Overall, ERIC ranks 10th on our list of cheap NASDAQ stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of ERIC to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Markets ended week in the red U.S. markets slumped on Friday and ended the week lower. The S&P 500 fell 1.32%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.24%. Asia-Pacific stocks mostly rose on Monday. South Korea's Kospi was up around 1.7% after shares of Samsung Electronics jumped. Japan's Nikkei 225 was the outlier, falling 1%. Surprise share buyback from SamsungKorea-listed Samsung Electronics shares rose as much as 7% on Monday after the company announced a surprise stock buyback plan amounting to roughly 10 trillion South Korean won ($7.19 billion) over the next 12 months. Monday's rise is a cherry on top of Samsung's shares, which surged 7.2% on Friday. WeChat clout for cloud customersTencent is courting cloud customers with its WeChat super app. A "super app" is an application platform, often developed using cloud infrastructure, that consolidates different functions. Clients can build their own apps on the WeChat ecosystem, said Tencent Cloud CEO Dowson Tong, setting the company apart from other cloud players. Last official Biden-Xi meeting U.S. President Joe Biden met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday at the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Biden reflected on his relationship with Xi across decades, while Xi seemed more focused on Trump's presidency, cautioning the U.S. to "make the wise choice" for the sake of bilateral relations. [PRO] Nvidia sets the tone this week Markets had a wild few weeks, during which investors digested the U.S. presidential election results, the Federal Reserve cutting rates, inflation readings and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments. This week, all eyes will be trained on one key event: Nvidia's earnings, coming out Wednesday. Trump's decisive victory in the presidential elections, as well as his purportedly market-friendly policies, drove markets to new highs. Last Monday, the S&P closed above 6,000 and the Dow finished the day above 44,000 for the first time. The so-called "Trump trade" — shares of banks, small-cap companies and energy, for example — were behind much of the indexes' gains. As anyone who has overeaten at a feast knows, however, there's a point when satisfaction passes into satiation into surfeit. It was only the start of the week, but little did we know we were beginning at the peak. When markets closed on Friday, the S&P lost 2.1% and the Dow had fallen 1.2% for the week — both ending the week below their milestones. The Nasdaq slid 3.2% on a weekly basis. A slump in pharmaceutical stocks dragged down the S&P and Dow. It was triggered by Trump announcing he was planning to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed unorthodox beliefs on health, to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This illustrates how investors must delicately navigate Trump's policies, which often present themselves as double-edged swords. For instance, Trump's proposed tariff and tax cuts will buoy up small caps and expand corporate profits but might also keep inflation hot and interest rates high. Those were the worries weighing on markets last week, which brought the S&P back to its level in mid-October, noted CNBC's Michael Santoli. "In the near term we should expect some micro volatility, particularly around potential policy shifts under a new administration," said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy, Americas, at BlackRock. That said, Akullian added that BlackRock does "expect the U.S. equity market to continue to move higher, but don't expect that rise to happen in a straight line." After surfeit comes digestion and then hunger. And the process starts again. — CNBC's Michael Santoli, Brian Evans and Alex Harring contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Ten restaurants around Ireland worth travelling to for an unique experience

Aniar is so much more than a Michelin-starred restaurant. After all, owner JP McMahon is truly dedicated to Irish food. Following 13 years in business, Aniar recently underwent a refit in conjunction with Marmar Architects, and the result is an interior that guides the diner through the 24-course tasting menu experience, all the time subtly mirroring the landscape of the west of Ireland. Joanne Cronin Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix focuses on local, seasonal ingredients and precise cooking, drawing on Sam’s pedigree (Ballyfin, Bath Priory). The lunch menu and midweek “Supper at Six” offer great value but dinner is where the kitchen shines, with a la carte and tasting menus (€75) using vegetables from their walled garden. Highlights include honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion and organic slow roast duck. CH Change is in the air at Ashford Castle. The stately, dark wood panelling of the George V diningroom is now home to executive head chef Liam Finnegan, who works closely with the estate’s newly planted kitchen garden and local suppliers to bring a modern touch to the classics-inspired menu. The wine cellar is famously richly stocked, and has an extensive list of wines by the glass. JC In a restored 200-year-old cottage, Michelin-starred chef Robbie McCauley crafts precise, seasonal dishes, using produce from his own organic garden and ducks he raises himself. With his wife Sophie running the front of house, the experience is both personal and polished. Dishes such as fallow deer with fermented red cabbage or Liscannor Bay crab with garden kohlrabi show the kitchen’s sensitivity to seasonality on the eight-course tasting menu (€109). From November a seven-course afternoon menu (€70), running from 2pm-6pm, adds another option. CH Owner Damien Grey recently announced on Instagram that Liath is looking for a new home. But fear not – for the time being the Blackrock Market continues to host this tiny fine-dining powerhouse. Liath has a philosophy that espouses exploration of the senses, so the diner is drawn inward over the course of the meal into the imagination of Grey and head chef, Jozef Radacovsky. JC Despite being possibly the busiest man in Irish cooking, with television shows, demonstrations and cookware ranges, Neven Maguire’s MacNean House and Restaurant remains one of the most popular destinations in Ireland for a special meal. Often booked out months in advance, the generous hospitality and even more generous cooking from head chef Carmel McGirr feels very special indeed. JC Rob Krawczyk’s Michelin-starred tasting menu is all about restraint, showcasing local ingredients with skill. His home-made charcuterie and organic produce from Lisheen Greens flow through the courses. The four-course menu (€70) offers a taste of his craft, while the Signature Tasting (€149) includes wild halibut with Roaring Water Bay mussels. Upstairs, it’s more laid-back with “Small Plates, Nibbles & Snacks.” Closes through January. CH Dining at Terre is a spectacle from the moment you set foot inside, and it’s not just the open kitchen where French chef Vincent Crepel overseas the dramatically lit pass. It’s the quality of produce and the precision of cooking that makes this two-Michelin-starred restaurant so special. Age-old French cooking methods are coupled with a strong Asian influence on the €250, 11-course tasting menu, with dishes such as hamachi with home-made kosho and Ballycotton lobster with whey sauce. CH The lavish Oak Room delivers all the grandeur that one would expect at one of Ireland’s finest hotels. Service is impeccable, allowing the spotlight to shine on chef Mike Tweedie’s elegant and polished cooking. Since taking over in 2017, Tweedie has truly settled in, finding his way unerringly to the best Irish produce including Doonbeg lobster, Dooncastle oysters and meat from Higgin’s butchers. JC Chef Danni Barry works magic with the freshest seasonal ingredients, crafting visually stunning plates with a light, refined touch. The four-course table d’hote menu (€90) highlights this simplicity: cured scallops with cucumber and nasturtiums, perfectly cooked halibut with morels, and wild venison with garden beets. The Library, which was recently redecorated, now has a conservatory and terrace, and is perfect for a pre-dinner cocktail.

Markets ended week in the red U.S. markets slumped on Friday and ended the week lower. The S&P 500 fell 1.32%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.24%. Europe's Stoxx 600 lost 0.77%, its fourth straight losing week. Separately, the U.K. economy grew 0.1% in the third quarter, missing the 0.2% mark expected by economists. Caught in the crossfire China may be the target of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's hawkish trade policies, but U.S. companies could suffer in the crossfire. If Trump does implement his tariffs on China, the Chinese government could retaliate by introducing its own tariffs, diversifying its imports away from the U.S and increasing scrutiny of U.S. firms operating in China. Last official Biden-Xi meeting U.S. President Joe Biden met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday at the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Biden reflected on his relationship with Xi across decades, while Xi seemed more focused on Trump's presidency, saying: "China is ready to work with a new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences." To infinity Pure-play space companies have seen their shares soar over the past week. For example, shares of Rocket Lab, an aerospace manufacturer, popped 41% on a weekly basis. While that was ignited by positive news from the company's earnings report, analysts say the "Trump-Elon" trade is also behind the gravity-defying moves of space stocks.
