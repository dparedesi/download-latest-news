We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Technology Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CommScope Holding Company Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) stands against the other low-priced technology stocks. The technology sector plays a crucial role in the modern economy, encompassing a wide range of industries. This sector can include businesses involved in electronics, software, artificial intelligence (AI), and information technology, among others. As companies increasingly rely on technological innovations to enhance productivity and efficiency, the technology sector is poised for growth as it becomes essential for both consumers and businesses. Recent trends indicate a significant shift towards AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity as key drivers of growth. Enterprise spending in these areas is expected to increase, driving growth in the global tech market. Generative AI is becoming more important than ever as a vital tool for many organizations, marking a significant shift from experimentation to practical application. According to the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, conducted in the first half of 2024, 65% of respondents indicated that their companies are now regularly utilizing generative AI, nearly double the figure from just ten months prior. This surge in adoption reflects a growing belief in the technology’s potential, with 75% of respondents anticipating that generative AI will bring about substantial changes in their industries in the coming years. The overall adoption of AI has also seen a notable increase, rising from around 50% to 72% over the past year. Technology-oriented stocks are set to achieve another impressive year by the end of 2024, according to U.S. Bank Asset Management. As of mid-December, the S&P 500 Communication Services and Information Technology index has risen over 40% year-to-date, following a remarkable 57% increase in 2023. Although technology stock performance slowed down in the third quarter of 2024, it regained momentum in the fourth quarter. According to Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management, corporate investments in artificial intelligence (AI) applications continue to drive this growth, even though the pace of AI spending eased slightly in the third quarter. Investors are attracted to the tech sector because of its innovative nature. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist with U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasizes that technology is crucial for improving speed and efficiency across various industries. While the sector can experience short-term fluctuations, Sandven remains confident about its long-term prospects, as companies seek growth through technology rather than simply hiring more staff. Haworth shares this optimism, noting that technology stocks are central to current economic expansion and benefit significantly from business capital investments. However, he notes that investors still need to be careful in their approach to this sector. While some tech startups achieve great success, others may fail to get off the ground. To compile our list of the 10 best low-priced technology stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz stock screener. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 25 technology companies with a share price of under $10 as of December 24, 2024. Next, we focused on the top 10 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 10 best low-priced technology stocks to buy now were then ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Title: Why Is EPR Properties (EPR) Among the Best Stocks That Pay Monthly Dividends in 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Stocks That Pay Monthly Dividends in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) stands against the other stocks that pay monthly dividends. Dividend stocks have long been a favorite among investors, regardless of the payout frequency. Companies, however, are deliberate in determining how often to reward their shareholders. Annual and semi-annual dividends might provide larger payouts, but their unpredictability can be challenging for investors. While major firms opt for quarterly payouts due to practicality, some choose monthly distributions, which many investors find attractive for the steady stream of passive income. In addition, a reduction in monthly payouts would have a smaller immediate impact, and receiving dividends monthly is one of the closest alternatives to a regular paycheck, simplifying the management of day-to-day finances. That said, history suggests that companies offering monthly dividends often boast higher yields but may lack consistent dividend policies. Regardless of market conditions, dividend stocks can be a useful tool for enhancing income and boosting portfolio growth potential. For instance, investors who are years away from retirement often reinvest their dividends to increase returns. According to an estimate by Charles Schwab, a hypothetical $10,000 investment in a broader market at the end of 1993 would have grown to over $182,000 by the end of 2023 if dividends were reinvested, compared to only $102,000 if they had not been reinvested. Also read: 10 Biggest Dividend Cuts and Suspensions of 2024 This means that investors looking to reduce their risk while still maintaining growth potential may want to consider high-quality dividend-paying companies. This approach is favored by Ramona Persaud, manager of Fidelity Equity-Income Fund and Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund. She tends to focus on shares of high-quality firms that offer attractive valuations and strong dividends. Persaud pointed out that falling interest rates can create a favorable environment for dividend stocks, as their yields become more appealing compared to declining bond yields. She also mentioned that lower interest rates may lead to gains across a wider range of stocks, a shift from the past two years when market gains were largely driven by a few large-cap growth stocks. Here are some other comments from the analyst: "I'm excited that really good companies may get more credit from investors than they have during the wave of glamour stocks. And investors stand to gain from the stocks' dividend payments." Persaud prioritizes stocks with strong balance sheets, high potential returns on investment, and predictable cash flows. Additionally, she seeks out stocks with attractive dividend yields relative to similar companies and the broader market. Monthly dividend stocks also focus on high dividend yields, which can be a key draw. While high yields may sometimes indicate the possibility of dividend cuts or weaker balance sheets, many monthly dividend companies have been increasing their payouts for years and also maintain solid financial health. However, investors should exercise caution when investing in these stocks. High dividend yields are not inherently negative. Stocks with high yields can still uphold strong dividend policies if their business fundamentals are solid. Many companies with above-average yields have consistently paid and even increased their dividends over time. Research indicated that, in the long run, these stocks often provide superior returns. For instance, a University of Nevada study found that portfolios consisting of the top 10 highest dividend yield stocks from the Dow 30 index outperformed those with medium and low dividend yields between 1987 and 2012. The study also highlighted that investing in high dividend yield stocks can be profitable over the long term, despite potential short-term fluctuations in returns. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks that pay monthly dividends. Our Methodology: For this list, we reviewed a list of companies providing monthly dividends to their shareholders. Among these, we specifically chose businesses with robust dividend practices, consistently maintaining their payouts across multiple years. The majority of these selected companies operate within the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sector, as they are required to allocate 90% of their income towards dividends. From that list, we picked 11 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 hedge funds and their holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A modern REIT building with a bright and inviting entrance. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23 EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) leases its properties to various entertainment and educational businesses, including amusement parks, movie theaters, and ski resorts, across the US and Canada. As a triple net lease REIT, the company requires its tenants to cover all real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. It owns 352 properties and leases to over 200 tenants in 44 US states and Canada. In the past 12 months, EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) has declined by over 10.4%. The company's reliance on the shrinking movie theater market is a significant concern. In 2023, only 852 million movie tickets were sold in the US, a sharp decline from 1.85 billion tickets in 2002, and this downward trend may persist. The rise of streaming platforms, affordable large-screen TVs, and increasing ticket prices have led more people to watch movies at home. Despite these challenges, the company achieved a 99% occupancy rate by the end of Q3 2024. It managed this by selling off vacant theaters, attracting more non-theater tenants for experiential businesses, and expanding its education-related property portfolio. During the quarter, EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) finalized the sale of two theater properties and one early childhood education center, generating net proceeds of $8.7 million. The company's cash position remained strong. It ended the quarter with over $35.3 million of cash on hand with total assets amounting to nearly $5.7 billion. EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR), one of the best dividend stocks, started paying quarterly dividends to shareholders since its IPO in 1997. The company shifted to monthly payments in 2013 and has paid regular dividends to shareholders since then. Its monthly dividend comes in at $0.285 per share for a dividend yield of 7.79%, as of December 28. As of the close of Q3 2023, 23 hedge funds held stakes in EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR), according to Insider Monkey's database. These stakes are worth $247.4 million in total. Overall EPR ranks 5th on our list of the best stocks that pay monthly dividends in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of EPR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EPR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Pearson plc (PSO) Among the U.K. Dividend Aristocrats for 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the U.K. Dividend Aristocrats List: 2024 Rankings by Yield. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO) stands against the other U.K. dividend aristocrats. In recent years, investors have turned away from UK equities, opting instead for global stocks, particularly high-growth options like US technology companies. The UK stock market is contracting at its fastest rate in over a decade, driven by takeovers of London-listed companies. According to Bloomberg data, approximately 45 companies have been delisted from the London market this year due to mergers and acquisitions, representing a 10% increase compared to the total for last year. This marks the highest number of delistings since 2010. Meanwhile, the value of deals targeting UK companies has surged by 81% this year, exceeding $160 billion. Earlier this year, UK equities seemed to be experiencing a shift in sentiment among both large institutions and smaller investors. The British stock market continues to attract bargain hunters, as UK equities are now trading at a record discount of over 40% compared to global counterparts, based on Bloomberg data. Many of the takeover targets have been mid-cap companies listed on London’s AIM market, which typically feature low trading volumes and limited analyst attention. That said, in November, investors returned to UK equity funds after three and a half years of consistent monthly withdrawals and a significant sell-off ahead of the Budget. Data from Calastone shows that retail investors directed a net £317 million into funds focused on UK stocks during the month. This inflow marks a notable shift, ending 41 consecutive months of net outflows, during which over £25 billion was withdrawn since May 2021. Also read: 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Hedge Funds The change in investor sentiment follows a challenging October for equity funds, which experienced record outflows as UK investors withdrew their money due to fears that the chancellor would raise capital gains tax (CGT). At the end of October, during the Budget announcement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed an immediate CGT increase. The lower rate rose from 10% to 18%, while the higher rate climbed from 20% to 24%. Analysts suggest the UK stock market could be nearing a recovery, but the timing and pace of this turnaround remain uncertain. This is where dividend stocks play a key role. Prioritizing stocks with rising dividends can offer stability and consistency through different market cycles. In addition, they provide an opportunity for long-term growth, compounding returns over time until share prices rebound. The UK market offers one of the highest dividend yields among major markets. The FTSE 100 boasts a yield of 3.68%, while the FTSE 250, representing medium-sized UK companies, offers slightly lower yields but still provides attractive income opportunities. This allows investors to focus on higher-growth areas, such as smaller companies, while benefiting from increasing dividends. According to a report by BlackRock, currently, UK market dividends are growing at a rate of 2-3%, roughly in line with long-term inflation. Stocks with growing dividends typically have reliable cash flows, enabling them to increase payouts over time. Janus Henderson's 2023 annual dividend report confirmed the rise in dividend growth, noting that the UK distributed approximately $86 billion in dividends in 2023, a notable increase from the $63.1 billion paid out in 2020. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks according to yield. Our Methodology: For this list, we scanned over 40 holdings of the UK Dividend Aristocrats ETF, which tracks the performance of the highest-yielding UK companies with at least 7 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 28 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best New Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO) stands against the other new stocks. US public markets continue to brace themselves for a 2025 resurgence, which should be led by interest rate cuts, pent-up investor demand, and a growing backlog of IPO expectations. As per PwC, there are over 700 unicorns in the private market as a result of the subdued IPO activity over the previous 3 years. Many IPO candidates, which also include some unicorns, have utilized this time to improve and strengthen their finances and transition to sustainable growth models. Apart from this, pressure continues to mount on private equity fund managers to return capital after an elongated exit dry spell, reported PwC. As per PwC, the traditional IPO market saw its gradual comeback in 2024, with proceeds garnered ~50% higher than in 2023 and ~4x the amount raised in 2022. The IPO activity was broad-based, with strong participation from sectors such as technology, life sciences, consumer markets, and financial services. Stock prices of this year’s traditional IPOs appreciated ~29%, surpassing the S&P 500 index’s return of ~27% on a YTD basis (ended 26th December 2024). This highlights the strength, investor interest, and traction in new offerings. PwC went on to add that IPO activity saw a strong increase in 2024, with 61 traditional IPOs garnering more than $26.4 billion YTD, which was in line with the combined total number of IPOs in 2022 and 2023, which witnessed 28 and 35 IPOs, respectively. Despite this improvement, IPO activity remained short of early anticipations and historical levels of activity. This is because several IPO candidates decided to stay on the sidelines as they waited for a clearer economic picture after the U.S. presidential elections.

The continued rate cuts and a stable policy environment should boost investor confidence, which can help create more favorable market conditions. PwC gave a 60% probability of a “soft landing” scenario and a 20% probability of an optimistic “no landing.” Notably, both of these scenarios offer a supportive environment for IPOs. As per Lynn Martin, president of the NYSE, 2025 year will be an active one for the IPOs. Also, Reuters highlighted that reduced interest rates and inflation slowdown should act as catalysts for new listings. Furthermore, the expected easing of regulations under the new Administration paints a positive picture of the deal activity in capital markets. Bloomberg reported that, as per Goldman Sachs, the number of IPOs in the tech sector is expected to more than double next year. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best New Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we used a screener to shortlist the companies that went public in the past 2 years. Next, we narrowed the list to the ones having high hedge fund positioning. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO) provides water analytics, water treatment, marking and coding, and packaging and color services. The company began trading as a publicly traded company on 2nd October 2023. Jefferies believes in Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO)’s long-term growth potential, which should stem from its focus on mission-critical applications, consistent pricing power, and a strong direct-to-customer distribution channel. With the company’s recurring sales accounting for ~61% of total sales during the nine-month period that ended September 27, 2024, Wall Street believes that this provides some sort of stability of revenues. As per Jefferies, an acceleration in growth is expected in 2025, fueled by a recovery in consumer-packaged goods (CPG) and industrial markets. With industries seeking to reduce their water footprint and operating costs, there seems to be growing interest in closed-loop water systems and process water recycling. Therefore, Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO)’s capabilities in these areas should drive significant growth. As consumer demand stabilizes and increases, Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO) will witness improved volumes in its Materials & Chemicals (M&C) and Products & Consumables (P&C) subsegments. Jefferies believes that Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO)’s combination of mid-single-digit (MSD) organic growth and healthy potential for strategic capital deployment places it well to compound its earnings at a double-digit rate. While Jefferies is bullish on Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO), Aristotle Capital Management, LLC recently sold its position because the firm believes that its other holdings within the water value chain are more optimal investments. Here is what the fund said: “In the fourth quarter of 2023, we received shares of the water and product quality company Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO) when Danaher, a current Value Equity holding, spun off the business. After further assessing the now independently operated Veralto, we decided to exit our position. We believe our other holdings within the water value chain, including Xylem, American Water Works (our most recent purchase) and to some extent Ecolab, are more optimal investments.” Overall VLTO ranks 5th on our list of the best new stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of VLTO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than VLTO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A robotic arm holding a semiconductor chip, emphasizing the precision and quality of the company's production equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) is a British semiconductor and software design company. It was listed on NASDAQ on 14th September 2023. Wall Street believes that Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)’s latest v9 chip architecture continues to gain traction. This transition is significant because v9-based chips command increased royalty rates, potentially doubling or even quadrupling the fees the company receives per chip. The transition should act as a revenue driver as it affects Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)’s core mobile market, where it has a strong market position. As and when smartphone manufacturers upgrade their devices to incorporate v9-based processors, Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) will benefit from increased royalty rates on a massive installed base. Furthermore, the enhanced capabilities of v9 architecture, which includes improved AI performance and security features, can ramp up adoption in other markets like automotive and IoT, further driving royalty growth. The compounding effect of increased royalty rates and expanding market applications should support topline and bottom-line growth. Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)’s energy-efficient chip designs are well-suited for an increased demand for on-device AI processing in smartphones, PCs, and other edge devices. The on-device AI market size was valued at US$17 billion in 2023 and should reach US$114.36 billion by 2031, as per Verified Market Research. Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) is well-positioned to capture a substantial portion of this expanding market. Overall ARM ranks 7th on our list of the best new stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Title: This year in crypto – Spot Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF approvals, ‘Trump pump,’ etc.

Time Published: 2024-12-29T00:00:07Z

The year’s biggest development by far was the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The past year has been highly eventful. From Bitcoin’s [BTC] halving to the Ethereum [ETH] Spot ETF approval, from the quantum computing threat to Bitcoin briefly seizing headlines, here are some of the year’s big highlights. The biggest development by far was the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval. This came after some false alarms caused massive BTC price volatility, such as the one from Cointelegraph in October 2023. On 10 January 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the approval of Spot Bitcoin exchange traded products, or ETFs. Crypto Twitter went haywire, and investors were delirious at the idea of BTC being open to millions of mainstream investors. The emergence of BlackRock and Fidelity as two of the largest ETF funds was also a major boost to sentiment. They currently hold 550k and 200k BTC, respectively. From being a niche asset class, BTC is now open to the public. The funds are regulated and managed by some of the largest entities in the financial world. Michael Saylor, Co-founder and former CEO of MicroStrategy, has also been relentlessly buying Bitcoin. Other companies are beginning to stack BTC too. Source: Michael Saylor on X The Ethereum Spot ETF approval was also a boost to the industry. The 2024 presidential campaign spurred many debates about either candidate and the kind of administration they would bring. Trump’s embrace of crypto, his appearances at industry events, and his campaign promises made his administration’s pro-crypto position clear. This boosted crypto sentiment massively. In fact, the President-elect even made promises to make the USA the crypto-capital of the world. Policy reformations would probably be introduced to bring regulatory clarity. Trump also made public the intention to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a known crypto critic with a tendency to be aggressive in his oversight of crypto. Gensler would be stepping down on 20 January, Trump’s inauguration date. Whether he follows through on those promises remains to be seen. Election time saw the cryptocurrency-based prediction market Polymarket gain popularity. It allows users to gain or lose from the outcome of world events. During these elections, it massively favored Trump to be the victor, which turned out to be accurate. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025-26 In late September, Trump and his three sons announced World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) money market platform. Enthusiasts see this as a positive development, while critics brought the obvious conflict of interest to attention. WLF’s purchase of crypto tokens such as Chainlink [LINK] and Aave [AAVE] were transparent due to the nature of the blockchain, boosting these tokens’ prices. Source: DeFiLlama The DeFi ecosystem in general has also been thriving. The DeFi revival is apparent from the rising total value locked (TVL) across different chains. It was at $120 billion, at press time, closing in on the $170 billion high it made in late 2021 during the last cycle. Finally, Uniswap [UNI], the world’s largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, set records in November. Its monthly trading volume for a Layer-2 solution hit $38 billion, surpassing the $34 billion high it set in March 2024.

Title: Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW): Among the Cheap Healthcare Stocks to Buy Heading Into 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Cheap Healthcare Stocks to Buy Heading into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) stands against the other cheap healthcare stocks. Investing in healthcare equities is typically seen as protective during recessionary times. This is because, even in hard financial times, consumers usually do not reduce their usage of prescription drugs or other necessary healthcare services. National healthcare spending is expected to reach an estimated $4.8 trillion in 2023 and increase at a 5.6% annual pace between 2027 and 2032, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). According to a World Health Organization report published in December 2023, worldwide healthcare spending reached a record high in 2021 at $9.8 trillion, or 10.3% of global GDP. Except in low-income countries, where government health spending declined as a result of their significant reliance on foreign aid, public health spending increased globally. While 11% of the world's population lived in countries where yearly healthcare spending was less than $50 per person, high-income countries paid about $4,000 per capita in 2021. Additionally, low-income countries accounted for just 0.24% of global health spending, despite having 8% of the world's population. The study claims that although public health spending rose dramatically during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic, this increase is unlikely to last in the long term as countries now place a higher priority on economic problems such as high inflation, decreasing GDP, and mounting debt servicing. According to Dr. Bruce Aylward, WHO Assistant Director-General for Universal Health Coverage, Life Course: “Sustained public financing on health is urgently needed to progress towards universal health coverage. It is especially critical at this time when the world is confronted by the climate crisis, conflicts, and other complex emergencies. People’s health and well-being need to be protected by resilient health systems that can also withstand these shocks.” The impending collapse of the U.S. healthcare system, especially in terms of staff shortages and financial instability, is the most worrisome aspect of the healthcare sector. There is a serious manpower shortage in the healthcare sector. An additional 124,000 doctors are expected to be required by 2030, and by 2027, 800,000 registered nurses (RNs) are expected to retire. A startling 24% of staff registered nurses are currently leaving their jobs. In certain healthcare systems, this deficit has resulted in the shutdown of critical patient services like obstetrics, pediatrics, psychiatry, and intensive care units. Nevertheless, the U.S. spends over twice as much on healthcare as the OECD average, despite these difficulties, and the average results are poorer. This discrepancy emphasizes how ineffective and unsustainable the current system is. Further taxing the revenue cycle and reducing the amount of money available for therapeutic treatments is the fact that 58% of hospital bad debt originates from insured patients. The future of the American healthcare system appears bleak when these elements are taken together. The industry faces a systemic collapse that could have serious repercussions for the economy and public health if substantial intervention and reform are not implemented. Our methodology involved selecting stocks with a market capitalization exceeding $10 billion and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio below 17. We then ranked these stocks based on their P/E ratios, as of December 22. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A skilled surgeon surrounded by a team of medical professionals performing a Transcatheter Heart Valve Replacement. P/E Ratio: 10.73 Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) is a medical technology company specializing in devices for cardiovascular diseases, including structural heart disease and critical care. Its products include surgical and transcatheter heart valves (e.g., SAPIEN valves), hemodynamic and pressure monitoring devices, and vascular solutions like Fogarty catheters and carotid shunts. In Q3 2024, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) delivered strong financial performance, surpassing earnings expectations. Their revenue grew 9.6% on a constant currency basis to $1.35 billion which was driven by robust results in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) and Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (TMTT). The company reported an adjusted EPS of $0.67, slightly exceeding the projected $0.665, reflecting its ability to sustain profitability while investing in growth. The corporation's TAVR segment saw a 6% increase in global sales, reaching $1 billion, with the U.S. market performing consistently and Europe benefiting from the launch of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve. Meanwhile, TMTT sales surged 74% year-over-year to $91 million which was driven by strong adoption of the PASCAL repair system and the EVOQUE tricuspid replacement system. Full-year guidance for TMTT remains at the higher end of $320 million to $340 million. In the surgical segment, revenue rose 5% to $240 million which was supported by innovative technologies such as INSPIRIS, MITRIS, and KONECT. The company's strategic acquisitions, including JC Medical, JenaValve, and Endotronix, have expanded its presence in new therapeutic areas and bolstered its leadership in structural heart disease.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Cheap Healthcare Stocks to Buy Heading into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stands against the other cheap healthcare stocks. Investing in healthcare equities is typically seen as protective during recessionary times. This is because, even in hard financial times, consumers usually do not reduce their usage of prescription drugs or other necessary healthcare services. National healthcare spending is expected to reach an estimated $4.8 trillion in 2023 and increase at a 5.6% annual pace between 2027 and 2032, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). According to a World Health Organization report published in December 2023, worldwide healthcare spending reached a record high in 2021 at $9.8 trillion, or 10.3% of global GDP. Except in low-income countries, where government health spending declined as a result of their significant reliance on foreign aid, public health spending increased globally. While 11% of the world's population lived in countries where yearly healthcare spending was less than $50 per person, high-income countries paid about $4,000 per capita in 2021. Additionally, low-income countries accounted for just 0.24% of global health spending, despite having 8% of the world's population. The study claims that although public health spending rose dramatically during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic, this increase is unlikely to last in the long term as countries now place a higher priority on economic problems such as high inflation, decreasing GDP, and mounting debt servicing. According to Dr. Bruce Aylward, WHO Assistant Director-General for Universal Health Coverage, Life Course: “Sustained public financing on health is urgently needed to progress towards universal health coverage. It is especially critical at this time when the world is confronted by the climate crisis, conflicts, and other complex emergencies. People’s health and well-being need to be protected by resilient health systems that can also withstand these shocks.” The impending collapse of the U.S. healthcare system, especially in terms of staff shortages and financial instability, is the most worrisome aspect of the healthcare sector. There is a serious manpower shortage in the healthcare sector. An additional 124,000 doctors are expected to be required by 2030, and by 2027, 800,000 registered nurses (RNs) are expected to retire. A startling 24% of staff registered nurses are currently leaving their jobs. In certain healthcare systems, this deficit has resulted in the shutdown of critical patient services like obstetrics, pediatrics, psychiatry, and intensive care units. Nevertheless, the U.S. spends over twice as much on healthcare as the OECD average, despite these difficulties, and the average results are poorer. This discrepancy emphasizes how ineffective and unsustainable the current system is. Further taxing the revenue cycle and reducing the amount of money available for therapeutic treatments is the fact that 58% of hospital bad debt originates from insured patients. The future of the American healthcare system appears bleak when these elements are taken together. The industry faces a systemic collapse that could have serious repercussions for the economy and public health if substantial intervention and reform are not implemented. Our methodology involved selecting stocks with a market capitalization exceeding $10 billion and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio below 17. We then ranked these stocks based on their P/E ratios, as of December 22. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A row of shelves in a retail pharmacy, demonstrating the variety of drugs and over-the-counter products. P/E Ratio: 11.78 CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), standing fourth among the cheap healthcare stocks to buy heading into 2025, is a leading U.S. healthcare company with a multifaceted business model. It operates over 9,900 retail pharmacies offering medications, health products, and household items. The company provides pharmacy services, including prescription filling, specialty and mail-order services, and Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) through Caremark. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) also offers health services via MinuteClinic for walk-in care and HealthHUB locations for chronic disease management and telehealth. Additionally, through its acquisition of Aetna, the corporation provides medical, dental, and vision insurance, enabling comprehensive healthcare solutions. Customers' access to services has been improved by CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) by utilizing its knowledge of health. Aetna, the company's insurance division, unveiled SimplePay Health on October 16. The new service is an alternate health plan designed to accommodate self-insured consumers' various needs. The strategy improves health outcomes while saving customers money. On October 1, Aetna revealed its 2025 Medicare plans to meet its objectives. By guaranteeing that people have access to dependable and reasonably priced healthcare when needed, the plan aims to address the members' most pressing health requirements. 59 million Medicare-eligible beneficiaries will have access to Aetna's Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) plans when they extend to 44 states and Washington, DC, in 2025, for a total of 2,259 counties. In addition, Medicare Advantage (MA) by Aetna will offer a $0 monthly fee to 83% of Medicare-eligible enrollees in the United States. In its Q2 2024 investor letter, Ariel Investments' Ariel Global Fund made the following statement about CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS): “American healthcare company, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), also declined following disappointing earnings results and a subsequent reduction in full-year guidance. The miss was primarily due to increased utilization of Medicare Advantage plans and weakness in the health services segment driven by the loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. In response, management reiterated its focus on improving margins and enhancing its positioning in Medicare Advantage. CVS believes the program can remain an attractive business for Aetna and CVS Health over time and will construct its bid for 2025 as a multi-year repricing opportunity across plan-level benefits. Meanwhile, CVS continues to return capital to shareholders through dividends and a recent accelerated share repurchase transaction.” Overall CVS ranks 4th on our list of the cheap healthcare stocks to buy heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of CVS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Jim Cramer on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO): ‘I Think Things Will Gradually Improve For Thermo Fisher With Business Picking Up In 2025 and 2026’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) stands against the other stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared some investment guidelines based on his 40 years of experience. As we previously discussed in our article, Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks, Cramer emphasized that both bulls and bears can profit, but greed leads to losses, advising investors to take profits and avoid being overly greedy. His second rule is that paying taxes is acceptable. Finally, Cramer stressed the importance of not making large, all-at-once buys or sales, recommending gradual adjustments to positions instead. In addition to these guidelines, Cramer’s next rule was to recognize the importance of distinguishing between damaged stocks and damaged companies. He explained that buying stocks from companies that are fundamentally flawed is a mistake with no chance of recovery, but stocks of companies that are simply experiencing temporary issues may present a buying opportunity. This distinction is critical because, as Cramer pointed out, there’s no “money-back guarantee” when buying into a company with long-term problems. Investors should focus on finding stocks that are down for reasons that aren’t related to poor company fundamentals. Cramer then moved on to his next rule, which is to always do the relevant homework. “If you want to build a portfolio of individual stocks, that's a big if since there's nothing wrong with getting all of your equity exposure from a cheap index fund that mirrors the S&P 500, well, you gotta be rigorous about it. Which brings me to my next rule: Do the homework.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 8 Stocks in Focus and Jim Cramer Discussed These 11 Restaurants and Retail Stocks Cramer said that doing the homework means more than just picking stocks based on a gut feeling; it involves actively researching companies by listening to earnings calls, reading research reports, and staying on top of the news. Cramer noted that some investors dismiss this kind of work, seeing it as unnecessary or outdated in today’s fast-paced world. However, he was clear in his belief that failing to do proper research before buying stocks is foolish and can lead to poor investment choices. Cramer further emphasized that doing homework today is easier than ever. With so much information available on the internet, there's no excuse for not gathering as much data as possible. For those who don’t have the time or inclination to dive deep into individual stocks, Cramer suggested that index funds are a great alternative. Another crucial rule that Cramer continually stresses is the importance of diversification. “The next rule is another essential that I harp on constantly: Diversify, diversify, and diversify. Always be diversified, that controls risk, and managing risk is really the holy grail of this business. What's the biggest risk out there? It's called sector risk.” Sector risk refers to the potential for a specific sector of the economy to lag, which can result in negative impacts on investments within that sector. Cramer explained that sector risk is one of the most significant dangers to an investment portfolio, and diversification is the only way to protect against it. He frequently says that "diversification is the only free lunch in this business" because it’s the one investment principle that benefits everyone. As per Cramer, by mixing different sectors in a portfolio, at least five according to him, investors can prevent themselves from suffering catastrophic losses if one particular sector takes a hit. “Here's the bottom line: Whether you're an amateur or professional, you always need to do your homework and keep your portfolio diversified. This is the kind of routine maintenance that protects you from monster losses down the line. Remember, if you can keep your losses to a minimum and let your gains run, you almost always come out ahead. But don't try to rationalize those losses because stocks don't always come back to even or anywhere near that.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episodes of Mad Money. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A workstation in a research lab stocked with laboratory products and services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98 Talking about life sciences equipment and solutions provider, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Cramer said: "They make big ticket equipment that these companies need to conduct research, but most of the revenues come from consumables and services for these customers. Regular viewers know that I liked Thermo Fisher for a very long time. It's been a fabulous performer over the last decade, but it’s struggled ever since the stock peaked at the end of 2021, pulled back hard in 2022... Cramer noted that while the stock showed improvement in 2023, it fell sharply after a mixed earnings report in October, which included weaker-than-expected revenue and soft guidance for the fourth quarter. He said that the selling continued, exacerbated by a broader healthcare sector decline. However, the one thing that halted the decline was when the company announced a $4 billion buyback program in mid-November, and in early December, revealed that it had already bought back $1 billion of stock. “I think things will gradually improve for Thermo Fisher with business picking up in 2025 and 2026 and hey, if the IPO market ever comes back to life, there'll be a new wave of biotech companies coming public and spending their money on life science equipment. Doesn't hurt that Thermo Fisher now only trades at 22 times next year's estimate. That's very low because this is a 30 multiple stock over many years.” For the third quarter, Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) reported adjusted EPS of $5.28, a decrease from $5.69 in the same period last year, though slightly exceeding expectations. Revenue increased marginally to $10.60 billion, falling short of consensus estimates. The company raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $21.35 to $22.07, up from its previous forecast of $21.29 to $22.07. It also confirmed its revenue guidance of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion. Overall TMO ranks 1st on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of TMO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TMO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A factory worker monitoring a conveyor belt of specialty chemicals being produced. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Cramer expressed hesitation about chemical companies like LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) having ‘similarly high yields” and remarked: “Okay, I can't say it's necessarily safe that all the chemical companies have similarly high yields. A lot of them are related to China and China weakness. And I think each one has to be explored on its own and that… if this cycle stays bad and the Fed doesn't cut rates quickly enough, a lot of these companies may end up to be, let's say dicier than you'd like to be. How about that? I wanna be polite about it.” LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) is a prominent global player in the production of petrochemicals, polymers, and fuels, serving a broad range of industries. The stock has a yield of 7.18% at the time of writing on December 27, which is up from the 5.62% yield it had when Cramer last talked about it in October. As discussed in our article, Jim Cramer’s Exclusive List of 9 YEV Stocks, at the time, Cramer noted that the stock, like others in its industry, follows a cyclical pattern, performing well during strong economic periods but struggling during downturns. This cyclical nature explains why the stock has lagged this year due to broader economic challenges. He commented: “Until very recently, the two largest economies of the world, the United States and China were both deteriorating. But think about what’s happened just in the past few weeks. First, the Fed officially kicked off a new easing cycle, starting with that double rate cut I just mentioned. And then there’s a clear consensus that we are going to get several more rate cuts done before the Fed is finished… LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) generated $3.4 billion in cash from operations over the past year, with a 77% conversion rate of EBITDA into cash, close to its 80% target. Despite facing challenging market conditions that impacted its third-quarter cash generation, the company expects an improvement in the fourth quarter due to lower global interest rates and economic stimulus measures in China. Additionally, the company is focusing on profitability through its value enhancement program, expecting to unlock $600 million in recurring annual EBITDA by the end of this year and $400 million in 2024. Overall LYB ranks 4th on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of LYB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Elon Musk’s xAI has raised $6 billion in funding, the next step for the tech executive’s disruptive AI startup. Musk has long been a proponent of safe AI research, leading him to co-found OpenAI. Since cutting ties with OpenAI, Musk founded xAI. The company has been growing rapidly, including plans to grow its Memphis supercomputer to 1 million GPUs. In its latest round of funding, the startup has raised $6 billion from a host of investment companies. xAI’s progress is accelerating rapidly. We have closed our Series C funding round of $6 billion with participation from key investors including A16Z, Blackrock, Fidelity Management & Research Company, Kingdom Holdings, Lightspeed, MGX, Morgan Stanley, OIA, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Valor Equity Partners and Vy Capital, amongst others. Strategic investors NVIDIA and AMD also participated and continue to support xAI in rapidly scaling our infrastructure. The company took the opportunity to tout the progress it has been making on its AI models. xAI’s most powerful model yet, Grok 3, is currently training and we are now focused on launching innovative new consumer and enterprise products that will leverage the power of Grok, Colossus, and X to transform the way we live, work, and play. The funds from this financing round will be used to further accelerate our advanced infrastructure, ship groundbreaking products that will be used by billions of people, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies enabling the company’s mission to understand the true nature of the universe. xAI is primarily focused on the development of advanced AI systems that are truthful, competent, and maximally beneficial for all of humanity. Musk has positioned Grok as a less politically correct AI model, one willing to tackle topics ChatGPT, Gemini, and others won’t touch. The round of investment is a significant vote of confidence in xAI, and should go a long way toward helping further xAI’s ability to challenge the industry leaders.

We recently published a list of Warren Buffett’s 10 New Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) stands against other Warren Buffett’s new stock picks. Warren Buffett is one of the few investors that do not require an introduction as his success, wealth and philanthropy are widely known and admired. Earlier this year, Buffett made it clear that his fortune, estimated at around $140 billion will go into a charitable trust that will be administered by his three children. Moreover, the trust will only be able to disburse funds upon unanimous agreement from all three children. In a recently-released letter to shareholders, Buffett explained: “That restriction enables an immediate and final reply to grant-seekers: “It’s not something that would ever receive my brother’s consent.” And that answer will improve the lives of my children.” However, in the meantime, Buffett still appears to be at the helm and running the operations at Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A), even though he has handed over most of the day-to-day managing duties to his lieutenants. In the latest financial report, it was revealed that Berkshire has amassed a huge position in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in US Treasuries. The cash pile, which stands at $277 billion, is the largest that the holding company has ever had. Moreover, Berkshire has slowed down its stock buybacks and hasn’t bought any of its own shares in the third quarter. READ ALSO: 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire David Einhorn and Tiger Global’s 15 Long-Term Stock Picks This has prompted many to speculate that Buffett sees the market as over-valued and is likely anticipating a downturn. In this way, gathering cash will allow Berkshire to purchase shares at cheaper prices. Another explanation might come from Buffett’s comments made at the annual meeting of Berkshire shareholders, where he said that he expected that capital gain taxes to go up, so realizing profits now might be way to save money later. Nevertheless, Berkshire still maintains a portfolio of 40 stocks. Many of the companies that the fund owns are long-term holdings and you can take a look at some of them in our analysis of Warren Buffett’s 10 longest-held stocks. In-line with Buffett’s legacy, Berkshire holds a diversified portfolio and does not make a lot of changes during a quarter. Nevertheless, every quarterly 13F filing reveals two or three new positions acquired during the reporting period. To compile the list of Warren Buffett’s new stock picks, we have scanned through Berkshire’s filings for the last couple of years and have identified 10 stocks that Berkshire has acquired and still holds according to the latest filing. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of bottles of whisky and other alcoholic beverages from a winery. Shares held by Berkshire Hathaway: 227,750 Stake Acquired: Q1 2023 It’s no secret that Warren Buffett likes consumer staples, his longest-term holdings including The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) and Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC). In 2023, Buffett also added global alcoholic beverages manufacturer Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO). Berkshire acquired the shares as Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) stock was below the $200+ highs reached in 2022 and so far the investment most likely has lost money as the stock has been trending down for quite some time as the company has been facing lower volumes due to high inflation and weaker consumer spending and the leadership expects tough times to continue in the near future. Nevertheless, Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is one of the leading alcoholic beverages companies in the world with a solid portfolio of brands that includes well-known names such as Johnnie Walker and Guinness. The company enjoys a robust financial position with more than $20 billion in revenues for the past couple of years. Diageo also has $2.60 billion in free cash flow as of the end of 2024 and has been consistently growing its dividend for more than three decades. It does have quite a lot of debt at $22.11 billion, but for cash cow companies such as Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) this is rarely an issue. Overall, DEO ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett’s new stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of DEO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DEO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A smiling face of a customer as they make a deposit at this company's branch. Shares held by Berkshire Hathaway: 9.10 million Stake Acquired: Q1 2023 Many of us remember the first quarter of 2023 as a rather tumultuous period for the US banking sector, as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed, which sent shockwaves through the entire sector. However, Buffett likely saw this an opportunity to get a solid bank stock at a discount and acquired a stake in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF). Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF)’s shares appreciated by more than 42% in the past year as the company has delivered solid results. One big catalyst for this growth has been the pending acquisition of Discover Financial Services. The $35 billion all-stock deal is expected to close in 2025 and is expected to substantially expand Capital One’s customer base with the addition of several dozen million new customers. Moreover, having access to Discover’s payment network will allow Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF) to potentially compete with the likes of Visa Inc (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). Nevertheless, the completion is still subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. Overall, COF ranks 8th on our list of Warren Buffett’s new stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of COF as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NYSE:NVR), in which the Oracle of Omaha acquired a position in the second quarter of last year. NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR) operates in two segments: homebuilding and mortgage services. NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR) is already benefiting from the housing shortage as it saw a 13% growth in new orders and a 12% increase in backlog (houses sold but not yet settled with customers) last year. For the latest quarter, NVR reported a 19% increase in new orders and a 9% increase in backlog. Nevertheless, NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR) missed analysts’ expectations with both EPS of $130.50 and revenue of $2.68 billion coming in slightly lower than projected. Going forward, if mortgage rates continue to decline, NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR) stands to benefit from more sales, while its mortgage business can see a higher volume of loans. On the other hand, analysts are currently cautious about the stock’s short-term performance, with most maintaining a Hold or Neutral rating on the stock.

Title: Bitcoin To $350K? Kiyosaki Stands Firm Amid BlackRock ETF Drama
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-350k-kiyosaki-stands-firm-amid-blackrock-etf-drama/
Time Published: 2024-12-28T20:00:17Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin fans have been abuzz after a bold prediction emerged: Robert Kiyosaki, the author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad”, believes that Bitcoin can reach $350,000 by 2025. His prediction isn’t just based on a guess. Kiyosaki points out the digital asset’s impressive 130% growth this year as a sign of what is to come. Can Bitcoin really go that high? Institutional players like BlackRock are entering the crypto space in big ways. Their involvement legitimized Bitcoin. But things are not all rosy either. Recently, BlackRock reported $188 million in outflows for its Bitcoin ETF. For some people, that was a red flag. The critics worry that such giants will manipulate the market. Kiyosaki, an adamant proponent of financial freedom, encourages investors to keep their Bitcoin private wallets and not let institutions handle it. Larry Fink dumping Bitcoin. VIVEK warned Larry Fink of BLACK ROCK is a Marxist. Vivek warned Fink & Black Rock are Share Holder Capitalist not Stake Holder Caplitist. Share Holder Capitalists are Marxist….like Klaus Schwab who state: “Someday you’ll own nothing and you’ll be… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 27, 2024 One of the best things about Bitcoin is its decentralized nature. As Wall Street behemoths such as BlackRock begin to dip their toes in, fears of centralization start to fill the air. Kiyosaki does not trust these institutions. He believes they may end up gaining too much influence over the crypto market. This would shift Bitcoin from its original appeal as “people’s money.” With such concerns, institutional interest still may drive up demand. If the market perceives Bitcoin as a “safe bet” due to BlackRock and others, its price may skyrocket. However, the potential downside—the loss of the power of decentralization—cannot be disregarded. Will Bitcoin hit $350,000 by 2025? Opinions remain divided. The crypto market is famously unpredictable, driven by factors like investor sentiment, regulation, and global economic conditions. Kiyosaki’s bullish stance appeals to those who see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. But others argue that market manipulation and regulatory scrutiny could keep prices in check. For now, one thing is quite obvious: Bitcoin is sure to be a hot and highly debated topic. Investor caution is the watchword of the day. While the thought of $350,000 is very tempting, a consideration of risks and reward must be undertaken. Crypto markets are still in an evolving stage. Predictions such as those by Kiyosaki are intriguing, but only time will tell whether or not Bitcoin will see those dizzying heights. For now, stay educated and cautious. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $94,448, down 2.4% and 4.3% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Shares held by Berkshire Hathaway: 24,203 Stake Acquired: Q2 2024 Also in the second quarter of this year, Berkshire Hathaway added beauty retailer Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) to its portfolio. However, in the following three months, the fund disposed of almost the entire position by selling 665,903 shares. Berkshire initiated a stake after the stock dipped after the company provided lower than expected guidance for the current year in March and later in April at an investor conference, the company’s management projected that the first quarter results would be at the lower end of the guidance due to slower sales. For the latest quarter, ended November 2, Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) reported EPS of $5.14 and revenue of $2.53 billion, both topping the expectations by $90.61 and $32.51 million, respectively. Moreover, the retailer inched higher its full-year guidance and now expects between $11.1 billion and $11.2 billion in sales and EPS between $23.20 and $23.75. The company saw a comparable sales growth of 0.6% on the year, which was substantially lower from 4.5% growth seen in the same period of last year. The company has also been investing in expanding its business with 57 new stores opened in the first nine months of its fiscal 2024. Trading at almost 19 times its forward earnings, Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) is no longer trading at the discount seen earlier this year. Analysts are split between Hold and Buy ratings. For example, following the earnings release, UBS maintained a Buy rating and hiked the price target to $490, while Citigroup raised the price target to $450 and maintained a Neutral rating. Overall, ULTA ranks 3rd on our list of Warren Buffett’s new stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of ULTA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ULTA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) stands against the other kid-friendly stocks. Investors and analysts alike are concerned about where equities are headed in 2025. On December 23, Eric Beyrich, Sound Income Strategies co-chief investment officer appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his market thesis for equities in 2025. Beyrich shared his perspective on the market, emphasizing a possible rotation in 2025. He added that drug and mega-cap tech stocks have previously led the market, but as their growth rates continue to decline, a rotation is probable. He also emphasized that value names, especially those that have underperformed over the past two years, are expected to make a comeback. Adding to this, Beyrich suggested that these value names have comparable relative growth rates and their valuation multiples, more often than not, are a third of that of the market.

Speaking of the S&P 500, excluding Big Tech, the market has underperformed, and with the growth rate for the big seven declining, the market emphasis will more likely gear towards value names. Beyrich also added that as rates come down, housing inflation is also expected to decline. He suggested that "abject extremes" are going to help value stocks, especially because the S&P 500 has been trading at 25 times its forward earnings. He emphasized that people have been investing in these stocks because they are scarce, and with growth rates declining, the market will shift away from more expensive names. On the flip side, Beyrich acknowledged that some of the names are great companies with huge cash flows, but they do have a pricing issue. Beyrich also shed light on the nature of valuations, suggesting that they behave like pendulums, going extremes in both directions. Overall, he remains extremely bullish on cheap companies, especially those with solid catalysts for improvement. Stocks with a sustainable and long-standing business model are often deemed safer and have been a household name for adults as well as kids. Our Methodology To come up with the 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy right now, we went over multiple similar rankings on the internet. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024.

Artisan Partners' Artisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Spotify Technology S.A.

Spotify is a leading global audio streaming franchise with over 600 million monthly active users. We believe its position in the supply chain is solid given a secular trend of fragmentation in the music industry as well as internal product and pricing initiatives. Shares rallied after the company reported strong earnings results, including 20% revenue growth. Importantly, the company’s profit margin is expanding nicely, and we believe it can rise further due to likely price increases, potentially better terms with labels and further cost discipline.” Overall SPOT ranks 3rd on our list of the best kid-friendly stocks to buy now.

Title: Real-World Asset Tokenization: Promise, Challenges, and the Path Forward
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/12/real-world-asset-tokenization-promise-challenges-and-the-path-forward/
Time Published: 2024-12-28T16:20:59Z
Full Content:
As Bitcoin reaches record highs, the concept of tokenization—creating digital representations of real-world assets on blockchains—is once again capturing attention in financial and cryptocurrency circles. Long touted as a transformative technology, tokenization has seen both promises of revolutionizing traditional asset markets and periods of slow progress. However, recent developments indicate a resurgence of interest, particularly among major financial players. According to a report by by Olga Kharif and Yizhu Wang for Bloomberg, despite years of growing discussion, tokenization’s adoption has been limited. According to data tracker rwa.xyz, only 0.003% of global assets are tokenized. Most participants in this space—about 67,530 entities—are institutions. Asset categories beyond stablecoins, such as tokenized securities, have struggled to gain traction, and many companies involved in these projects face financial difficulties. Regulatory hurdles in the U.S. have been a significant barrier. Historically, regulators have treated tokenized assets with the same caution as cryptocurrencies, leading many financial institutions to focus on other technologies, such as artificial intelligence. However, as reported by Bloomberg, the anticipated regulatory shift under President-elect Donald Trump’s administration—expected to take a more crypto-friendly approach—is providing new momentum. The involvement of major players like BlackRock, Visa, and Mastercard is also encouraging broader adoption. This year has seen notable advancements in tokenization. BlackRock launched a tokenized money-market fund, a milestone mentioned in Bloomberg’s report that has encouraged other institutions to accelerate their tokenization efforts. Visa introduced a platform allowing banks to issue fiat-based tokens, and Mastercard integrated its token network with JPMorgan’s Kinexys blockchain platform, facilitating cross-border transactions for businesses. Tether also debuted a tokenization platform, expanding its footprint beyond stablecoins. These developments indicate that tokenization is moving beyond experimentation toward practical implementation. For example, JPMorgan’s Kinexys already processes about $2 billion in daily transactions, showcasing the scalability of blockchain-based financial solutions, per Bloomberg’s report. Boston Consulting Group estimates that tokenized fund assets under management could grow from $2 billion today to over $600 billion by 2030. Bloomberg’s coverage also emphasizes the benefits of tokenization, including enhanced liquidity by enabling fractional ownership, making assets accessible to a broader range of investors. By leveraging blockchain, tokenized assets can reduce transaction costs and settlement times. Furthermore, the programmability of blockchain tokens allows for automated processes, such as escrow arrangements, that mitigate counterparty risk. Despite its potential, tokenization faces criticism. Industry experts warn against over-tokenizing assets that may not benefit from digitization. Poorly priced or illiquid tokenized assets could expose unsophisticated investors to significant losses. While the regulatory landscape is improving, unclear rules continue to pose challenges. Bloomberg highlights concerns that some asset classes, such as real estate or public securities, may not derive meaningful advantages from tokenization. For instance, owning a tokenized fraction of a Picasso painting lacks the tangible benefits of enjoying the artwork.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Marine Shipping Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE:ASC) stands against the other best marine shipping stocks to buy according to analysts. Marine shipping is a critical component of the global economy, responsible for transporting approximately 80% of the world’s trade by volume. This industry serves as the backbone of international commerce by facilitating the movement of raw materials, manufactured goods, and energy resources across continents. The maritime shipping industry continues to face significant challenges as geopolitical tensions and security threats escalate in key shipping routes. Shipping companies have been forced to reconsider their routes, with many opting to divert vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, significantly increasing fuel costs and delivery times. These disruptions have far-reaching economic consequences, affecting supply chains and global trade. In an interview with CNBC on November 27, Adrian Beciri, CEO of Ducat Maritime said that marine shipping has faced a series of setbacks over the years, including the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, hyperinflation, manpower shortages, and the aftermath of conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East, including the blockage of the Suez Canal. These events have compounded the issues within the marine shipping sector and continue to affect the industry. Beciri highlighted the intrinsic difficulties of the shipping sector, particularly the demanding nature of the work, coupled with economic challenges that have contributed to a labor shortage in the shipping industry, a problem that is often overlooked by the broader market. The CEO also expressed concerns about the potential impact of the president-elect’s announcement of new tariffs on several countries, which could further complicate supply chains and necessitate a shift towards regional or zonal trading blocks. Such a shift could disrupt the historical patterns of international trade, which are based on the comparative advantages of large nations and the principles of free trade. Looking ahead, Beciri emphasized the importance of stable and consistent markets and policies to foster long-term investments and adjustments within the industry. He called for a conducive environment that would allow firms to make significant investments. Despite the mounting challenges faced by the maritime shipping industry, it remains an indispensable pillar of global trade. A tanker filled with petroleum products, sailing through a calm sea. To compile our list of the 10 best marine shipping stocks to buy according to analysts, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find marine shipping companies with a market cap of over $500 million as of December 24. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 10 stocks that analysts see the most upside to. We also included the number of hedge fund holders for these companies, which was sourced from Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential, as of December 24. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Upside Potential: 56.57% Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22 Stock Price as of December 24: $11.88 Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE:ASC) specializes in the transportation of petroleum products and chemicals. The company operates a modern and efficient fleet of MR (Medium Range) and chemical tankers, which serves major oil companies and global trading houses. Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE:ASC) has made significant investments in efficiency-enhancing technologies and scrubber installations, which have boosted chartering performance and reduced emissions. Looking forward, Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE:ASC) plans to invest approximately $30 million to $35 million in 2025, covering routine dry dockings and additional high-return performance upgrades, including specialized tank coatings. These investments align with upcoming regulations such as the EU Maritime Fuel Regulation. Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE:ASC) is focusing on a disciplined approach to cost management and deleveraging. The company has successfully reduced its cash breakeven level to the lowest in its history from $16,500 per day to $11,500 per day in Q3, which helped that company to achieve annualized savings of about $50 million. The company remains committed to reinvesting in its fleet while ensuring sustainable value creation. This includes evaluating potential avenues for reinvestment in the existing fleet and the broader market. Ardmore Shipping Corporation’s (NYSE:ASC) MR and chemical tanker fleets are well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for long-haul ton-miles and allow the company to maximize TCE (Time Charter Equivalent) rates, due to ongoing geopolitical disruptions, particularly as refineries and petrochemical production capacity expand in the East, while closures in the West drive higher ton-miles. Overall, ASC ranks 7th on our list of best marine shipping stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of ASC to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) stands against the other undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy according to hedge funds. A dividend aristocrat is an S&P 500 company that not only maintains regular dividend payments to shareholders but also increases its payouts annually. To qualify as a dividend aristocrat, a company must raise its dividends consistently for at least 25 consecutive years. Michael Clarfeld, Portfolio Manager at ClearBridge, recently talked about why companies that consistently grow their dividends are well-positioned to handle the challenges of 2025. With rising costs, tighter margins, higher interest rates, and inflation on the horizon, Clarfeld is still optimistic about the economy. He pointed to strong employment numbers, upbeat consumer sentiment, and confident businesses, especially after the election. Pro-business policies under the Trump administration could drive investments and growth, which sounds great, but there’s a catch. For instance, bringing manufacturing back to the US would create jobs and boost wages, but it could also increase business costs. After two strong years, Clarfeld doesn’t see much room for big capital gains in 2025. Plus, with inflation sticking around, the Federal Reserve is likely to take a more cautious approach. That said, he sees opportunities in sectors like European and global consumer staples and US energy infrastructure. Clarfeld is a big fan of dividend growth stocks, calling them a timeless investment. They can act as a safety net during volatile markets and provide steady income, which is especially useful when capital appreciation feels out of reach. He also highlighted how dividends help protect your purchasing power by keeping up with inflation. In his view, dividend growth is a smart and reliable strategy for navigating a potentially bumpy 2025. Paul Baiocchi of SS&C ALPS Advisors sees dividend investing as a smart move, expecting the Fed to ease rates. According to Baiocchi, investors are shifting from money markets and fixed income to dividend-paying stocks, especially companies with leverage that could benefit from lower interest rates. Similarly, Mike Akins of ETF Action also sees dividend ETFs as a defensive play, highlighting that the companies included typically have strong balance sheets. He notes the growing popularity of dividend-focused ETFs, suggesting that consistent dividends give investors confidence in a company’s stability and financial health. Both experts agree that dividends offer a sense of durability and drawdown protection in uncertain markets.

In this article, we selected stocks from the Dividend Aristocrats List that had a P/E ratio below 20 as of December 23. Our focus was on identifying stocks with the strongest hedge fund sentiment in Q3 2024 among the 66 Dividend Aristocrats that also met our P/E criteria. The stocks are ranked below in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders for each company. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Dividend Yield as of December 23: ​​3.72% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45 P/E Ratio: 17.01 Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB), founded in 1872 and headquartered in Dallas, Texas, manufactures and markets personal care and consumer tissue products. The company operates through three segments – Personal Care, Consumer Tissue, and K-C Professional. Consumer demand for premium products continues to grow across developed and emerging markets, supported by trends like aging populations driving adult care. This positions KMB as one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks to buy. Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)’s gross margins have consistently improved over the past eight quarters, averaging 37% for the year. The company remains confident in achieving its long-term goal of at least 40% gross margin and operating margins between 18-20% by the end of the decade. Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) reported third-quarter sales of $5.0 billion, which was 4% lower than the same period last year. This drop was mainly due to a 3% hit from unfavorable currency exchange rates and a 1% impact from selling off their PPE business in July. Looking ahead, Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) anticipates stronger Q4 performance, with stepped-up investments in advertising and brand support. The company expects top-line growth to improve, driven by a volume mix-led strategy while navigating one-time and external factors. Despite these challenges, Kimberly-Clark is making steady progress on margins and remains committed to long-term growth. So far this year, Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) generated $2.4 billion in cash from operations, up from $2.3 billion last year, mainly due to improved operating performance. The company returned $2.0 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. Total debt was reduced to $7.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, from $8.0 billion at the end of 2023. Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)’s board of directors announced a quarterly dividend of $1.22 per share, payable on January 3, 2025, to shareholders on record as of December 6, 2024. This marks the company's 90th consecutive year of paying dividends and the 52nd straight year of increasing them. Insider Monkey’s Q3 data shows that 45 hedge funds were bullish on Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB), compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 1.28 million shares worth $182.35 million. Overall, KMB ranks 4th on our list of the undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of KMB to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Bitcoin Set To Hit $350,000 Despite BlackRock Sell-Off Fears, Robert Kiyosaki Says
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-to-hit-350000-despite-blackrock-fears/
Time Published: 2024-12-28T15:00:42Z
Full Content:
Author of “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” and Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast Robert Kiyosaki has backed the premier cryptocurrency to attain a $350,000 price mark in 2025. This daring prediction comes alongside slamming comments against asset manager BlackRock whom Kiyosaki accuses of trying to manipulate BTC’s price. In an X post on December 27, Kiyosaki claimed that BlackRock under the leadership of Larry Fink, is currently offloading large amounts of Bitcoin as he voiced his distrust over the asset manager’s involvement in the BTC market. The American author reiterated the views of republican Vivek Ramaswamy, who described Larry Fink as a shareholder capitalist i.e. people who are focused on maximizing returns for shareholders rather than stakeholder capitalists who consider the interest of employees and communities. In this regard, Kiyosaki further alleges that BlackRock is deliberately suppressing Bitcoin’s price below $100,000 via sell-off to allow market whales to purchase at lower prices. Truly, data from Arkham Intelligence shows that BlackRock has recently moved +$203 million BTC to Coinbase Prime over the past two days. However, it remains to be seen if BlackRock intends to sell these assets or just maintain ownership on a custodial wallet. Furthermore, Robert Kiyosaki advises against investing in BTC via BlackRock’s ETF, preaching a mode of direct investment in place. Ironically, BlackRock boasts of the largest Bitcoin Spot ETF i.e. IBIT with $52.71 billion in net assets. Amidst rumors of a planned BlackRock market offload and BTC’s ongoing price decline, IBIT recorded its largest market outflow ever of $188 million on December 26 according to data from SoSoValue. Nevertheless, Robert Kiyosaki backs Bitcoin’s robust bullish structure despite BlackRock’s alleged price manipulation antics. The author affirms his conviction to purchase more BTC which he predicts will reach $350,000 per unit in 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $94,405 reflecting a loss of 1.88% in the past day. However, its daily trading volume is up by 12.95% and is valued at $51.35 billion. According to its daily chart, Bitcoin’s immediate resistance lies at $100,000, overcoming which can propel a return to the $108,000 price region marking a total price recovery for the premier cryptocurrency. Albeit, another rejection at $100,000 will force BTC to retain its current consolidation pattern. Regardless, Bitcoin continues to rank as the largest digital asset by market cap with total market shares of $1.86 trillion, translating into a crypto market dominance of 56.8%.

Title: Is Alight, Inc. (ALIT) Among the Best Low Priced Stocks to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alight, Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) stands against the other best low priced stocks to invest in now. According to a report by Charles Schwab published on December 9, the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 from a position of relative strength, but the risks of volatility, particularly those related to policy, are significantly higher compared to the previous year. This uncertainty is largely driven by the policy proposals of President-elect Donald Trump, whose unconventional governing style and fluid policy positions have made forecasting their impact on domestic and global conditions extremely challenging. The report highlights that Trump's policy proposals, which include lower taxes and reduced regulations, are generally seen as growth-positive. However, these are offset by proposals for higher tariffs on imported goods and mass deportations of illegal immigrants, which are generally considered stagflationary, at least in the short term. In terms of the stock market, the report suggests that while equities can perform well from the beginning to the end of the year, the volatility is likely to be higher in 2025 compared to 2024. The S&P 500 is currently above its 50 and 200-day moving averages, which historically has been a positive indicator for future performance. However, the report cautions that after a year with 57 record highs, the median gain in the following year has historically been around 5.8%, suggesting a potential for a step back in performance. The report also notes that the S&P 500's 5-year normalized P/E ratio is quite stretched, indicating a product of market enthusiasm but not necessarily a near-term risk. For small caps, the report notes that the Russell 2000 has struggled in the current bull market due to higher interest rates and weaker profit profiles. The report suggests that profitable small caps could perform well if economic growth holds and the Fed takes a gradual approach to rate cuts, but the index as a whole might continue to face challenges if earnings growth does not improve.

Corpina, Senior Managing Partner at Meridian Equity Partners, discussed his outlook for U.S. stocks in 2025. Corpina noted that the market is finishing the year strong, supported by a resilient economy and key events such as the election and rate cuts being out of the way. He believes that the market will continue to move higher in 2025, though it will take a few quarters for the new administration to implement new policies and procedures. Corpina also addressed investor expectations for strong double-digit earnings growth for S&P 500 companies, suggesting that while the bar is set high, it's important to manage expectations. He emphasized that the economy remains fragile, and companies are still adjusting to the new environment and administration. He advised a cautious approach, noting that there are many uncertainties that could impact the market in the coming year. On the U.S. financial sector, Corpina is optimistic. He anticipates a lot of M&A activity and IPOs in 2025, driven by a pro-business administration. While the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 with a foundation of relative strength, the landscape remains fraught with uncertainty.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms End Trading Week Defying Market Bloodbath. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) stands against the other stocks. A wave of selling gripped Wall Street this Friday, pushing major indices lower as investors shifted capital towards more attractive investment opportunities. Ten companies bucked an overall bearish market sentiment, booking significant gains during the last trading day of the week. Let's explore how they managed to buck the trend and what factors contributed to their remarkable performance amidst widespread market uncertainty. Oil derricks in the background with a few workers in the foreground, emphasizing the company’s oil and gas production activities. Shares in Occidental Petroleum (OXY) rallied by 0.75 percent on Friday to close at $48.56 apiece as investor confidence was boosted by billionaire Warren Buffett’s recent hoard of the company’s stocks. Earlier this month, Buffett through his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, gobbled up nearly 9 million shares for more than $400 million to push Berkshire's stake to 28.2 percent in Occidental Petroleum. At present, Occidental is one of Berkshire’s largest holdings, having owned another $8.3 billion in preferred shares, earning an 8-percent dividend rate. In a recent letter to his shareholders, Buffett said: “Under Vicki Hollub’s leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both the country and its shareholders… Vicki truly knows how to separate oil from rock (fracking), which is a unique ability that is valuable to her shareholders and to her country.” Hollub is the company’s president and chief executive officer (CEO). Overall OXY ranks 7th on our list of the firms that ended the trading week defying market bloodbath. While we acknowledge the potential of OXY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Here’s a look back at the year that was for the world’s largest crypto. The Securities and Exchange Commission had spent a decade saying "no" to top asset managers who wished to offer a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund—the once elusive Bitcoin ETF—to their clients in the United States. But the mood shifted when the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, applied to the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF of its own in June 2023. An ETF is an investment vehicle that allows its buyers to gain exposure to an asset without buying and storing the asset directly. Gold ETFs, for instance, have long been a thing, and provide investors the convenience of investing in gold without fussing about finding a place to safely keep physical bars or coins. But the SEC had been wary of allowing such a thing for Bitcoin, denying applications over and over again on the grounds that the crypto market could be easily manipulated. Industry analysts thought BlackRock jumping in and lending its weight would finally be the thing that pushed the regulator to give the green light. And it turns out it was. On January 10, the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs, with 10 trading the following day. The U.S. market at last had a way for mom and pop retail investors to put a little money into Bitcoin without bothering with cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and seed phrases. It was huge—and it had a bigger impact than even the most optimistic Bitcoin proponents imagined. Nobody—not even those whose job it is to analyze the niche market of ETFs—expected such a roaring start once the trading began. Money hit the funds fast. Investors previously locked out of the world of crypto investing could suddenly buy shares on stock exchanges that tracked the price of Bitcoin. The asset hit an all-time high just above $73,000 in March, CoinGecko data shows. But it wasn’t an easy ride. Many macroeconomic factors—not to mention government confiscations and large crypto movements—weighed on Bitcoin throughout the year. Despite hitting a new all-time high in March, the next few months were rocky for Bitcoin as geopolitical risks—particularly in the Middle East—led investors to shift away from risk assets. At one point, Bitcoin struggled to break higher than $60,000 due to increased tensions between Iran and Israel and missile strikes. The German government caused further selling pressure when it sold off hundreds of millions of dollars of confiscated Bitcoin in June. Then, in September, it finally happened: The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by 50 basis points, the central bank's first such reduction since aggressively raising rates in 2022. The central bank had hiked interest rates in a bid to tame post-pandemic inflation. Higher interest rates generally lead investors to take a "risk off" approach, retreat from stocks and other even riskier assets like crypto, and flee to the relative safety of the U.S. dollar. The September cut and a subsequent chop in November made the asset more appealing to investors again, leading to a price surge. The "risk on" trade was back, and it helped push crypto assets beyond just Bitcoin to all-highs. The following month, Bitcoin did what crypto hopefuls had been prophesying for years: the asset crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time in its 15-year history in early December following the reelection of Donald Trump as U.S. president, with investors expecting a more relaxed regulatory environment for digital assets to come. A big reason for the surge in the price of Bitcoin was down to two things: institutions and politics. On November 5, Trump stunned onlookers by snapping up the Electoral College and the popular vote. The Republican candidate campaigned as a Bitcoin-friendly potential leader of America. “I’m laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet,” Trump said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville back in July, promising to make the country a “Bitcoin superpower” if elected. Analysts and industry watchers anticipated that a Trump victory would enhance the leading digital asset. Their predictions proved accurate; shortly after being announced as the U.S.’s next president, Bitcoin’s price soared. Less than one month after his victory, Bitcoin hit $103,679. Conditions, at least in theory, are favorable for the asset to continue rising as America now has the most pro-congress crypto in its history, including Vice President-elect J.D. Vance, who is pro-digital assets and holds significant amounts of Bitcoin. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who will be the next U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, has spoken about how Bitcoin should back the dollar, and National Security Adviser Michael Waltz has voted for pro-crypto bills. A number of other Republicans and Trump-backers are also in favor of pro-crypto policy. All eyes are now on whether a strategic Bitcoin reserve, a plan for the U.S. government to hold billions worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet for years to come, will be approved when Trump takes the reins in January. The approval of the spot ETFs opened the doors to traditional finance bigwigs like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley investing in cryptocurrency via the vehicles. In the words of MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, 2024 was “year zero of institutional adoption.” Speaking of Saylor, the Bitcoin preacher’s company aggressively snapped up Bitcoin in 2024—accelerating its buys towards the end of the year. The software firm’s stock soared to all-time highs, and its co-founder continued to beat the Bitcoin drum, speaking far and wide about how the cryptocurrency could save a company. The billionaire—whose company held 444,462 Bitcoins, valued at around $42 billion at the time of writing—even shared a Bitcoin adoption strategy with the Microsoft board of directors. The company decided not to buy Bitcoin—despite admitting it had mulled over the matter. However, other small companies like Japan’s MetaPlanet and U.S. public companies such as Semler Scientific and Cosmos Health bought the asset as an inflation hedge. But it was more than just ETFs and institutional adoption that helped put the spotlight on Bitcoin in 2024. The timing was such that one of the most anticipated events for Bitcoiners happened this year as well: the Bitcoin halving. The event, baked into Bitcoin’s code, happens every four years and is meant to keep Bitcoin's inflation rate in check. After every halving, the reward for successfully mining a Bitcoin block is cut in half, meaning less Bitcoin now enters the system. This will keep happening until the mining reward is phased out completely, and Bitcoin reaches its fixed supply of 21 million coins. But this halving was different than the ones before, as investors focused on it more than ever. Why? Again, timing. Increased adoption and the success of Bitcoin ETFs led more people to anticipate that the event would raise the asset’s value. After all, less supply and more demand should lead to higher prices. And despite the event being somewhat underwhelming, the coin, for the first time, did hit a new all-time high even before its halving in April. This halving also brought with it something else: a short-lived craze for a new technical advancement on the Bitcoin network: Runes. Casey Rodarmor, the man behind Ordinals inscriptions—launched last year—created a new standard for creating tokens on the blockchain called Runes. The Runes protocol launched on the same day as the Bitcoin halving and proved popular—for a while—with dog-themed meme coins gaining traction on the network and surging in value. However, some in the community were unhappy about what the Runes mania did to the biggest and oldest crypto network: transaction fees soared whenever there was a flurry of activity on the blockchain to mint the new tokens. Still, even if it was just an annoying craze in the eyes of some, the launch proved that Bitcoin had more use cases to offer than just hold and hope "number goes up."

We recently published an article titled Market Slump Drags Down Share Prices of These 15 Companies. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON) stands against the other stocks. Wall Street’s main indices ended this week’s trading on a bloodbath following an overall market selloff as investors shifted their capital into assets offering higher returns. This article will delve into the factors behind the downturn and explore why each company was particularly affected. To come up with Friday’s top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A group of people in a fitness class with connected fitness products in a studio or gym. Fitness technology company Peloton Interactive saw an 8.57-percent decline in its share price on Friday to finish at $9.39 apiece as investors resorted to profit-taking following Thursday’s gains. In addition, analysts blamed the overall market downturn as having weighed down on its shares, while investors remained in a wait-and-see mode after the company nearly swung to profitability in its recent earnings report, having narrowed its net loss by 99.44 percent. Earlier this year, Peloton earned an Altman Z-Score of -1.56, indicating that it is in Distress Zones and could face the probability of bankruptcy over the next two years. A score of 3 or more shows that the company is performing fairly well. Overall PTON ranks 5th on our list of the stocks that were recently dragged down by market slump. While we acknowledge the potential of PTON as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PTON but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Kinross Gold (KGC) the Best Low Priced Stock to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) stands against the other best low priced stocks to invest in now. According to a report by Charles Schwab published on December 9, the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 from a position of relative strength, but the risks of volatility, particularly those related to policy, are significantly higher compared to the previous year. This uncertainty is largely driven by the policy proposals of President-elect Donald Trump, whose unconventional governing style and fluid policy positions have made forecasting their impact on domestic and global conditions extremely challenging. The report highlights that Trump's policy proposals, which include lower taxes and reduced regulations, are generally seen as growth-positive. However, these are offset by proposals for higher tariffs on imported goods and mass deportations of illegal immigrants, which are generally considered stagflationary, at least in the short term. In terms of the stock market, the report suggests that while equities can perform well from the beginning to the end of the year, the volatility is likely to be higher in 2025 compared to 2024. The S&P 500 is currently above its 50 and 200-day moving averages, which historically has been a positive indicator for future performance. However, the report cautions that after a year with 57 record highs, the median gain in the following year has historically been around 5.8%, suggesting a potential for a step back in performance. The report also notes that the S&P 500's 5-year normalized P/E ratio is quite stretched, indicating a product of market enthusiasm but not necessarily a near-term risk. For small caps, the report notes that the Russell 2000 has struggled in the current bull market due to higher interest rates and weaker profit profiles. The report suggests that profitable small caps could perform well if economic growth holds and the Fed takes a gradual approach to rate cuts, but the index as a whole might continue to face challenges if earnings growth does not improve.

Corpina, Senior Managing Partner at Meridian Equity Partners, discussed his outlook for U.S. stocks in 2025. Corpina noted that the market is finishing the year strong, supported by a resilient economy and key events such as the election and rate cuts being out of the way. He believes that the market will continue to move higher in 2025, though it will take a few quarters for the new administration to implement new policies and procedures. Corpina also addressed investor expectations for strong double-digit earnings growth for S&P 500 companies, suggesting that while the bar is set high, it's important to manage expectations. He emphasized that the economy remains fragile, and companies are still adjusting to the new environment and administration. He advised a cautious approach, noting that there are many uncertainties that could impact the market in the coming year. On the U.S. financial sector, Corpina is optimistic. He anticipates a lot of M&A activity and IPOs in 2025, driven by a pro-business administration. While the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 with a foundation of relative strength, the landscape remains fraught with uncertainty.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) stands against the other best low priced stocks to invest in now. According to a report by Charles Schwab published on December 9, the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 from a position of relative strength, but the risks of volatility, particularly those related to policy, are significantly higher compared to the previous year. This uncertainty is largely driven by the policy proposals of President-elect Donald Trump, whose unconventional governing style and fluid policy positions have made forecasting their impact on domestic and global conditions extremely challenging. The report highlights that Trump's policy proposals, which include lower taxes and reduced regulations, are generally seen as growth-positive. However, these are offset by proposals for higher tariffs on imported goods and mass deportations of illegal immigrants, which are generally considered stagflationary, at least in the short term. In terms of the stock market, the report suggests that while equities can perform well from the beginning to the end of the year, the volatility is likely to be higher in 2025 compared to 2024. The S&P 500 is currently above its 50 and 200-day moving averages, which historically has been a positive indicator for future performance. However, the report cautions that after a year with 57 record highs, the median gain in the following year has historically been around 5.8%, suggesting a potential for a step back in performance. The report also notes that the S&P 500's 5-year normalized P/E ratio is quite stretched, indicating a product of market enthusiasm but not necessarily a near-term risk. For small caps, the report notes that the Russell 2000 has struggled in the current bull market due to higher interest rates and weaker profit profiles. The report suggests that profitable small caps could perform well if economic growth holds and the Fed takes a gradual approach to rate cuts, but the index as a whole might continue to face challenges if earnings growth does not improve.

Corpina, Senior Managing Partner at Meridian Equity Partners, discussed his outlook for U.S. stocks in 2025. Corpina noted that the market is finishing the year strong, supported by a resilient economy and key events such as the election and rate cuts being out of the way. He believes that the market will continue to move higher in 2025, though it will take a few quarters for the new administration to implement new policies and procedures. Corpina also addressed investor expectations for strong double-digit earnings growth for S&P 500 companies, suggesting that while the bar is set high, it's important to manage expectations. He emphasized that the economy remains fragile, and companies are still adjusting to the new environment and administration. He advised a cautious approach, noting that there are many uncertainties that could impact the market in the coming year. On the U.S. financial sector, Corpina is optimistic. He anticipates a lot of M&A activity and IPOs in 2025, driven by a pro-business administration.

Title: Forecast 2025 — Taking Out the Trash

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/28/2024 4:53:32 AM PST by MtnClimber "A core reflex in these decades of postmodern insanity was constant rejection of things we thought we knew in favor of New, Improved Beliefs packaged from above.” — Matt Taibbi, Racket News. I would guess that you’re feeling as if anything might happen now. It’s hard to rule out even the possibility that we could all be vaporized before moving onto the next mundane chore of the day. The world order is dangerously in flux. America’s Woke-Jacobin “Joe Biden” regime was defeated in the 2024 election, but they were apparently just a front for the sinister entity we call the “blob” or the Deep State, which in recent years has consistently and garishly acted against our country’s interests. So, the blob abides, and it probably weaves schemes in the deep background of daily life even as a new government awaits. But if the Woke-Jacobin Biden-istas were tied-in with the so-called “globalist” enterprise centered around the EU bureaucracy, with assistance from the World Economic Forum’s network of zillionaires and bankers. . . well, that coalition looks rather broken now. It’s doing a hurt-dance. It’s on the run, a little bit. What is not broken for the moment — a tenuous moment — is the new Trump regime’s determination to correct the disorders of Western Civ, starting with the affairs of the USA, according to age-old reality-based norms of behavior and good-faith relations between the people and their government. Trust was broken and must be restored. The President-elect has assembled an extraordinary team of reformers, if they can get to their posts without subversion. And, of course, Mr. Trump himself has to evade further attempts to rub him out, to knock him off the game-board before he can take office, and then he must survive the months beyond his inauguration. So, you are correct to be nervous. Paradoxically, Mr. Trump has to initially manage the US government as if it deserves a sense of reassuring continuity, which, in many respects it does not deserve. So many institutions and relationships between them have been perverted and damaged. How do we pretend that the upper layers of management in any federal agency — the strata who really run things below the top “political” appointees — can continue in-place as if all that perversion never happened? The Department of Justice and the FBI are filled with lawyers and agents who abused their power egregiously and went to war against the American people. The agency’s work will just have to stop for a while. The nation can probably endure if investigations and prosecutions are suspended for sixty days while the personnel issues get sorted out — who goes and who stays. But what about the Defense Department and the CIA? The country must be able to defend itself. These departments are the lairs of the more dangerously entrenched blob actors. Both DOD and the CIA have come to be organized as racketeering operations. Both are involved in domestic money-laundering activities at the giant scale, and in rackets abroad — such as the many grifts around Ukraine, in which giant financial entities like BlackRock are partnered-in. (You know, for instance, don’t you, that BlackRock was poised to acquire control of Ukraine’s natural resource base, until Mr. Putin’s resolve ended that fantasy.) And the CIA is suspected of being deeply involved in the Mexican crime cartel operations, both around drugs and human trafficking. The imputations are sickening. The DOD and the CIA will fight desperately to preserve their perqs and projects, and to stay out of jail. But until now they have not really been challenged. The public health agencies, FDA, NIAID, CDC, NIH, and so on have become outright mafias, with labyrinths of money-laundering channels, government grant-grifting, and pharma ph**kery, not least around the still-mysterious, homicidal Covid-19 prank, with the deadly mRNA vaccine program piggybacked onto it. Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

It’s hard to rule out even the possibility that we could all be vaporized before moving onto the next mundane chore of the day. The world order is dangerously in flux. America’s Woke-Jacobin “Joe Biden” regime was defeated in the 2024 election, but they were apparently just a front for the sinister entity we call the “blob” or the Deep State, which in recent years has consistently and garishly acted against our country’s interests. So, the blob abides, and it probably weaves schemes in the deep background of daily life even as a new government awaits. But if the Woke-Jacobin Biden-istas were tied-in with the so-called “globalist” enterprise centered around the EU bureaucracy, with assistance from the World Economic Forum’s network of zillionaires and bankers. . . well, that coalition looks rather broken now. It’s doing a hurt-dance. It’s on the run, a little bit. What is not broken for the moment — a tenuous moment — is the new Trump regime’s determination to correct the disorders of Western Civ, starting with the affairs of the USA, according to age-old reality-based norms of behavior and good-faith relations between the people and their government. Trust was broken and must be restored. The President-elect has assembled an extraordinary team of reformers, if they can get to their posts without subversion. And, of course, Mr. Trump himself has to evade further attempts to rub him out, to knock him off the game-board before he can take office, and then he must survive the months beyond his inauguration. So, you are correct to be nervous. Paradoxically, Mr. Trump has to initially manage the US government as if it deserves a sense of reassuring continuity, which, in many respects it does not deserve. So many institutions and relationships between them have been perverted and damaged. How do we pretend that the upper layers of management in any federal agency — the strata who really run things below the top “political” appointees — can continue in-place as if all that perversion never happened? The Department of Justice and the FBI are filled with lawyers and agents who abused their power egregiously and went to war against the American people. The agency’s work will just have to stop for a while. The nation can probably endure if investigations and prosecutions are suspended for sixty days while the personnel issues get sorted out — who goes and who stays. But what about the Defense Department and the CIA? The country must be able to defend itself. These departments are the lairs of the more dangerously entrenched blob actors. Both DOD and the CIA have come to be organized as racketeering operations. Both are involved in domestic money-laundering activities at the giant scale, and in rackets abroad — such as the many grifts around Ukraine, in which giant financial entities like BlackRock are partnered-in. (You know, for instance, don’t you, that BlackRock was poised to acquire control of Ukraine’s natural resource base, until Mr. Putin’s resolve ended that fantasy.) And the CIA is suspected of being deeply involved in the Mexican crime cartel operations, both around drugs and human trafficking. The imputations are sickening. The DOD and the CIA will fight desperately to preserve their perqs and projects, and to stay out of jail. But until now they have not really been challenged. The public health agencies, FDA, NIAID, CDC, NIH, and so on have become outright mafias, with labyrinths of money-laundering channels, government grant-grifting, and pharma ph**kery, not least around the still-mysterious, homicidal Covid-19 prank, with the deadly mRNA vaccine program piggybacked onto it. Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

Trust was broken and must be restored. The President-elect has assembled an extraordinary team of reformers, if they can get to their posts without subversion. And, of course, Mr. Trump himself has to evade further attempts to rub him out, to knock him off the game-board before he can take office, and then he must survive the months beyond his inauguration. So, you are correct to be nervous. Paradoxically, Mr. Trump has to initially manage the US government as if it deserves a sense of reassuring continuity, which, in many respects it does not deserve. So many institutions and relationships between them have been perverted and damaged. How do we pretend that the upper layers of management in any federal agency — the strata who really run things below the top “political” appointees — can continue in-place as if all that perversion never happened? The Department of Justice and the FBI are filled with lawyers and agents who abused their power egregiously and went to war against the American people. The agency’s work will just have to stop for a while. The nation can probably endure if investigations and prosecutions are suspended for sixty days while the personnel issues get sorted out — who goes and who stays. But what about the Defense Department and the CIA? The country must be able to defend itself. These departments are the lairs of the more dangerously entrenched blob actors. Both DOD and the CIA have come to be organized as racketeering operations. Both are involved in domestic money-laundering activities at the giant scale, and in rackets abroad — such as the many grifts around Ukraine, in which giant financial entities like BlackRock are partnered-in. (You know, for instance, don’t you, that BlackRock was poised to acquire control of Ukraine’s natural resource base, until Mr. Putin’s resolve ended that fantasy.) And the CIA is suspected of being deeply involved in the Mexican crime cartel operations, both around drugs and human trafficking. The imputations are sickening. The DOD and the CIA will fight desperately to preserve their perqs and projects, and to stay out of jail. But until now they have not really been challenged. The public health agencies, FDA, NIAID, CDC, NIH, and so on have become outright mafias, with labyrinths of money-laundering channels, government grant-grifting, and pharma ph**kery, not least around the still-mysterious, homicidal Covid-19 prank, with the deadly mRNA vaccine program piggybacked onto it. Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

So many institutions and relationships between them have been perverted and damaged. How do we pretend that the upper layers of management in any federal agency — the strata who really run things below the top “political” appointees — can continue in-place as if all that perversion never happened? The Department of Justice and the FBI are filled with lawyers and agents who abused their power egregiously and went to war against the American people. The agency’s work will just have to stop for a while. The nation can probably endure if investigations and prosecutions are suspended for sixty days while the personnel issues get sorted out — who goes and who stays. But what about the Defense Department and the CIA? The country must be able to defend itself. These departments are the lairs of the more dangerously entrenched blob actors. Both DOD and the CIA have come to be organized as racketeering operations. Both are involved in domestic money-laundering activities at the giant scale, and in rackets abroad — such as the many grifts around Ukraine, in which giant financial entities like BlackRock are partnered-in. (You know, for instance, don’t you, that BlackRock was poised to acquire control of Ukraine’s natural resource base, until Mr. Putin’s resolve ended that fantasy.) And the CIA is suspected of being deeply involved in the Mexican crime cartel operations, both around drugs and human trafficking. The imputations are sickening. The DOD and the CIA will fight desperately to preserve their perqs and projects, and to stay out of jail. But until now they have not really been challenged. The public health agencies, FDA, NIAID, CDC, NIH, and so on have become outright mafias, with labyrinths of money-laundering channels, government grant-grifting, and pharma ph**kery, not least around the still-mysterious, homicidal Covid-19 prank, with the deadly mRNA vaccine program piggybacked onto it. Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

The country must be able to defend itself. These departments are the lairs of the more dangerously entrenched blob actors. Both DOD and the CIA have come to be organized as racketeering operations. Both are involved in domestic money-laundering activities at the giant scale, and in rackets abroad — such as the many grifts around Ukraine, in which giant financial entities like BlackRock are partnered-in. (You know, for instance, don’t you, that BlackRock was poised to acquire control of Ukraine’s natural resource base, until Mr. Putin’s resolve ended that fantasy.) And the CIA is suspected of being deeply involved in the Mexican crime cartel operations, both around drugs and human trafficking. The imputations are sickening. The DOD and the CIA will fight desperately to preserve their perqs and projects, and to stay out of jail. But until now they have not really been challenged. The public health agencies, FDA, NIAID, CDC, NIH, and so on have become outright mafias, with labyrinths of money-laundering channels, government grant-grifting, and pharma ph**kery, not least around the still-mysterious, homicidal Covid-19 prank, with the deadly mRNA vaccine program piggybacked onto it. Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless.

Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored.

Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that.

Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference?

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges).

Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve.

It takes decades to create a new generation of workers, and we are going to be playing catch up for awhile. 17 posted on 12/28/2024 5:58:50 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: AndyJackson “It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war…” _______ Of course. 18 posted on 12/28/2024 6:04:50 AM PST by jacknhoo (Luke 12:51; Think ye, that I am come to give peace on earth?

It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Does the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency.

These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

(Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached.

These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson For now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so.

Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so.

Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung. Mr. Webb’s concise 99-page book is available free as a pdf HERE.......SNIP......[This is about one half of the article. Please visit the source site, Kunstler.com, if you wish to read the rest. Biden is trying to spend all of the money he can on his way out. I would not be surprised to find out that they are engineering a financial emergency to happen early in President Trump’s second term. For each of you personally: do your best to lead purposeful, ethical lives in 2025. Refrain from trying to push other people around. Take care of your own bidness. . . and keep abreast of the goings-on in the year ahead at good old [kunstler.com]! And, above all, stay calm and cheerful! Inside Job (Don Henley) I think we need to keep our eyes on demographics also. World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. It's a system problem, not just a fix this and all will be well problem. You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News That You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where iLearningEngines, Inc. (NASDAQ:AILE) stands against the other AI stocks. Bloomberg Intelligence projects that the generative AI market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42%, reaching $1.3 trillion by 2032, up from $40 billion in 2022. This growth is driven by demand for generative AI products, especially infrastructure for training large language models, digital ads, and specialized software. The market could generate an additional $280 billion in software revenue, with major companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia expected to benefit as enterprises increasingly move workloads to the cloud. By 2032, generative AI is predicted to account for 10% of total IT spending, with significant revenue coming from infrastructure services, AI servers, and software. The technology is also expected to have a transformative impact on life sciences and education. However, the rapid growth of generative AI could disrupt several industries, including semiconductors, hardware, IT services, and advertising. READ ALSO: 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks. In a blog post, Carrie Tharp, Vice President, of Strategic Industries, wrote that Generative AI has evolved from a futuristic concept into a vital business strategy, transforming industries by enhancing efficiency and customer engagement. Despite its growth, many organizations are still testing its applications, with a study revealing that a third of businesses are evaluating its use. Key trends include the rise of multimodal AI, AI agents, AI-powered search, customer experiences, and deepfake defense. In retail, AI is being used for customer service, marketing, and digital commerce, with long-term goals of creating personalized experiences and AI-powered assistants. The financial services industry is leveraging AI for fraud detection, risk management, and efficiency, while healthcare uses AI to reduce administrative burdens and improve patient care. The media and entertainment industry is increasingly adopting AI to improve productivity, content personalization, and operational efficiency. As AI becomes more sophisticated, businesses need to address challenges like deepfake defense while focusing on high-value use cases. Generative AI is no longer a novelty but a transformative tool, with businesses needing to prioritize AI strategies that align with their specific industry needs and long-term goals. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Interim CEO Tom Olivier expressed confidence that this process will position the company for a stronger future, focusing on long-term growth. As part of the bankruptcy process, iLearningEngines will seek Court approval to maintain normal operations, including employee compensation and vendor payments. Overall AILE ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AILE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

U.Today - Robert Kiyosaki, investor and financial expert, also known for authoring a best-selling book on finances “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” has published a tweet about Bitcoin and the BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) chief executive. He criticized the latter and said that he intends to keep buying Bitcoin, once again voicing his ultra-bullish price prediction of $350,000 for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Kiyosaki believes that “Black Rock suppressing Bitcoin price so the whales can buy Bitcoin at under $100k.” The “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author said that he loves Bitcoin in his wallet and would never entrust the BlackRock ETF with his BTC holdings. Still, Kiyosaki tweeted that he intends to continue stocking up on Bitcoin for one simple reason — it continues to rise in the current highly unstable economic environment: “I will keep buying more Bitcoin because Bitcoin going higher.” Back then, Kiyosaki wrote that the main reason for his prediction is the fact that the U.S. now has a pro-Bitcoin president who takes office in January. Trump accepted crypto donations during his election campaign and made several promises to the crypto community, which include the creation of the strategic Bitcoin reserve and the pardoning of the Silk Road founder Ulbricht Ross from his double life-sentence he has been serving in prison since 2013. A curious thing — before Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time this December, Kiyosaki tweeted that he would stop buying BTC once $100,000 was left behind since it is not the time “to get greedy” now. However, in today’s tweet, he said he would continue accumulating Bitcoin. Earlier this year, Kiyosaki predicted BTC to hit $500,000 in 2025 and then $1 million by 2030 based on AI data. He provided no details about that, though. This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: House prices prompt growing number of young professionals to live in Newry while commuting to Dublin

Six Christmas trees are dotted around a magnificent Co Down house where a book club made up of mainly Dubliners has just met. Camembert Santas were served on charcuterie boards by Co Tipperary-born Pádraig Mullally and his husband Ruairí, who hosted the monthly event in their cinnamon-scented livingroom. The couple live in a detached new-build in the sprawling Hillcrest village development in Bessbrook, a former Quaker village on the outskirts of Newry. “It may as well be a suburb of Dublin,” laughs Ruairí. “There’s 24 of us in the club and only two are from Newry; I’m one of them. The majority are from the South. There’s a lot of Dubs and there’s a guy from Limerick and another one from Wexford. There’s even a woman from Donegal.” During the day, the estate is like “a ghost town” as so many residents are working in Dublin, he adds. Mullally (33) grew up on a farm in Drangan and studied science in Cork; he drives to Blanchardstown in Dublin three days a week where he works for a pharmaceutical company. While a future move back to Tipperary hasn’t been ruled out, he “wouldn’t even consider” relocating to Dublin to be closer to work. “Our quality of life would be massively changed. We were only down in Dublin at the weekend and it was so much more expensive. And then if you think of the house prices,” Mullally says. [ A personal housing plan: Move to Newry, buy for €150,000 less, commute to DublinOpens in new window ] “Take for example our house – a four-bedroom detached with super handy proximity to Belfast and Dublin. You wouldn’t get anything in Dublin for £265,000 (what they paid). It would be unheard of.” Mullally is among the growing number of young professionals living in the border city while continuing to commute to Dublin. Post-pandemic remote working, cheaper rents and a lower cost of living are among the reasons for the increasing number of Southern-based workers renting or buying in Newry, according to local estate agent Ian Hall. “Some of them might have a connection or are moving back here,” he adds. “They’re younger, educated, probably travelled more and their jobs offer more flexibility in terms of where they can live. A lot of them work in professional services or IT.” Hall’s firm, Hanna Hillen, handled many of the sales in the nearby Gantry Lane development, which began four years ago and is almost complete. Diggers are on site where, according to one builder, the remaining houses will “go like hot cakes” as it is so close to Newry train station. A new hourly Belfast to Dublin train service was introduced at the end of October. Estate agent Micheál Hastewell recently sold a three-bedroom semi in Gantry to a couple from the South. “The young couple told me that they were sick of being slaves to Dublin. They were happy to buy something at probably half the price of what they can afford in Dublin,” he says. “But there is now huge demand for Newry – and the supply just isn’t here. “Even more recently, we rented a property down the old Warrenpoint Road. Again, it was a couple renting a shoebox of an apartment in Dublin. They saw a three-bedroom house online for £950 per month. “They’re saying Southern prices are out of control.” Hillcrest resident – and book club member – Emma Morgan (35) is a Dublin-based accountant from Skerries who has been living in the North since 2019. “My husband is from Newry. I always joke that I moved up for love and cheaper housing,” she says. Morgan’s plan was to stay temporarily and save up to buy a house in Skerries – where the average price for a three-bed semi is in excess of €500,000. That has now changed. “We bought our home in Newry at the same time my brother bought a two-bedroom apartment in Skerries. With the exchange rate, it was roughly the same price. We got ours for £212,000 and then paid an extra £15,000 for the sunroom. Already, the value of property in this estate has increased significantly. I redid our mortgage in April and they valued it at £280,000.” But it is more than the cost of property that is keeping her in the North: “If we moved back, there would be a significant impact on our quality of life purely because our money is not going to go as far down South. [ Northern Ireland house sales reach highest point in two yearsOpens in new window ] “Also, from the day I moved up here, I had friends. We’re all pretty much blow-ins – and from all about the place as well. It’s not just Dublin. I think the fact we are blow-ins, we’re looking for that bit of community, so the likes of the book club is great for that. “Joe, my husband, says that I now know more people than he does. I’ve made such an effort over the last five to six years. I joined every baby group going when I had my son.” Before going on maternity leave – she is returning to work next month – Morgan commuted to the office by train two to three times a week. The station is a short drive away. “I would get the 7.40am and be in at ten past nine. I’d get the 4.50pm home and get in at just after six o’clock. Those were roughly the hours I would be in and out of the house when I lived in Skerries. “The internet on the train is generally good and I logged the extra hours when I was working on the train. My boss was completely happy with that because the work got done. “Pre-Covid we were based in Thomas Street, but we’re now out in Blackrock. I used to get the train to Connolly and walk; now I get the Dart and it’s much of a muchness.” A town before it was granted city status in 2002, Newry was an economic black spot during the 1980s with rocketing unemployment rates and a depressed property market. Today, housing demand is outstripping supply. The peace process had a transformative effect, but Southerners would “never have contemplated” buying houses in Newry during the Troubles, says Ian Hill, who has been an estate agent for more than 20 years. “My dad bought a petrol station in Newry in 1983 and had it until 1996. That was a time whenever petrol was cheaper in the North and people would have been coming from the South. They would have been coming down just for a day, and that was a big thing,” he recalls. “Peacetime brought stability, and then you see some things shared – like the health service, for example. All those things break down barriers and maybe make it more comfortable for people from the South to live here.” In early 2025, work will begin on a further housing development close to the main A1 motorway. Paddy Gray, emeritus professor of housing at Ulster University, is aware of the emerging trend: “I think Newry’s an attractive place to live and people regularly travel over the Border. The salaries are much higher in Dublin and it’s not a long commute. When you think of people going to their jobs in London and spending an hour-and-a-half on the Tube, and all the stress of that.” Gray sits on the Residential Tenancies Board, an independent body that regulates the private rental sector in Ireland. Earlier this month, the board released data showing rental costs increased by 4.7 per cent in the Republic in the three months to June compared with the same quarter last year. The average cost of a new tenancy in the South now stands at €1,644 a month. Dublin rentals are highest, costing an average of €2,147. “Remember, these are only averages and figures can be skewed and are much higher in some cases,” adds Gray. In the North, prices are also rising. Government figures show the average price for a house in Northern Ireland was £190,553 between July and September, a rise of 6.2 per cent on the same period last year. In the Newry, Mourne and Down area, it was £201,305 (the fourth highest of the North’s 11 local government district areas), representing a 4.2 per cent increase on the previous year. Back at the Mullallys’ home in Hillcrest, they were preparing to spend Christmas in Tipperary. “I think we could live there one day. We’re farmers in rural Tipp, there’s a bit of frontage there – that’s why Ruairí married me,” jokes Pádraig. “We see the likes of my brother building a fabulous house in the country and that has sparked something. “But we have a life in Newry and Ruairí obviously has his family here as well. I feel like I have the best of both worlds here.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC
