ByHank Tucker ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. In 2001, Michael Dorrell volunteered to move from the Sydney headquarters of Australian investment bank Macquarie to a backwater in its infrastructure investing specialty: the United States of America. “For many years, Macquarie didn’t take the U.S. all that seriously. That’s why a 25-year-old kid could be sent over here and be one of six people looking at this whole market,” explains Dorrell, now 51. “We had the market to ourselves.” The U.S., with its now $4 trillion tax exempt municipal bond market, is still a comparative laggard when it comes to private financing of infrastructure. But between a growing list of profitable niches (think private plane airports and data centers serving the artificial intelligence boom) and growing demand for low-risk alternative investments, it has turned into a bonanza for Dorrell. In 2011, he cofounded New York City-based infrastructure investment firm Stonepeak, and still runs it as CEO. Today, it manages $72 billion in an infrastructure portfolio including wind farms, broadband service and fiber providers, marine shipping equipment, and builders of data centers–with around 55% of those assets in the U.S. Aleksandr Karnyukhin for Forbes Forbes estimates Dorrell is now worth $8.5 billion, with most of that his controlling stake in Stonepeak. In 2023, private capital heavyweight Blue Owl Capital spent $2 billion for a minority stake in Stonepeak in a deal that valued the firm at $15 billion, according to a source. It was the largest investment Blue Owl has made for a stake among the dozens of private investment firms it has partnered with. “There are a million mid-market buyout firms and around 200 large-cap buyout firms. In infrastructure, there are six to 10 major players, so it's a much smaller pool,” says Blue Owl co-president Michael Rees. “Infrastructure is an area where there's a benefit to scale, and returns are actually more attractive at the larger end of the market. You can solve more problems, and the deals tend to be bigger.” Now Stonepeak is raising another infrastructure fund, aiming for a $15 billion fund size and a 12% net annual internal rate of return over the fund’s 12-year life, according to a presentation released by Rhode Island’s state worker pension fund last year. That’s not unrealistic–the presentation showed that Stonepeak’s average net IRR across its four flagship funds is 12.4%. Even more impressive: It hasn’t realized a single loss on 46 investments to date. That downside protection is crucial to the pension funds and insurance companies among its limited partners. Dorrell portrays infrastructure as a blend of private credit and equity, with some assets behaving like long-term bonds, while others have more variable cash flows. While U.S. public markets sink into correction territory and typical buyout funds slump, institutional investors are seeking more stability in private credit and infrastructure. “If you're doing a private equity deal, your base case might be a 25% return, but your downside case may be you only get 30 cents on the dollar back,” says Dorrell. “For us in the downside cases, we get 100 cents on the dollar back, maybe even more than 100 cents on the dollar, but our base case might be a 15 (% return), not a 25.” Goldman Sachs projects private infrastructure assets under management worldwide will triple to $3 trillion by 2035, and the Trump Administration's move to cut back on government infrastructure funding could boost interest in privatization in the U.S. There’s even a chance that a Congress looking for revenue sources to offset the cost of Trump’s tax cuts could limit the tax exempt benefits of bonds. That municipal bond market is crucial. In Australia, a severe recession in the early 1990s prompted states to start selling off assets like toll roads and airports. But in the U.S., governmental authorities, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, are able to sell tax-exempt bonds secured by future revenues—so even when New York City teetered on the edge of bankruptcy in the 1970s, LaGuardia and JFK Airport weren’t sold off. That’s why when Dorrell arrived in the U.S., the area was mostly ignored by Wall Street. Still, Dorrell’s team did identify some attractive U.S. assets, buying up private airport terminals, energy suppliers and electric grids not owned by municipalities. Later, in the mid-2000s, major U.S. investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley launched similar divisions. Dorrell joined Macquarie’s mergers and acquisitions group in 1998 straight out of the University of New South Wales, but noticed much of his desk’s transaction flow came from advising Macquarie’s own funds buying infrastructure assets. After three years of that, with an itch to go abroad, he raised his hand to move to New York. One of Macquarie’s early U.S. deals was its $238 million acquisition in 2004 of Atlantic Aviation, which owns fixed-based operator (FBO) terminals, or airport terminals for private jets. If big, international airports weren’t for sale, this was the next-best thing, and it was underappreciated—Dorrell says they bought it for six times cash flow, while today similar assets would go for 15 to 20 times cash flow. He was instrumental in rolling up a slew of FBOs and adding runways and upgrading the terminals. Today, Atlantic Aviation operates more than 100 such terminals. “You charge landing fees and service fees, and if demand keeps rising, your business is going to get better,” says Murray Bleach, the former CEO of Macquarie North America and Dorrell’s boss at the time. “That’s a traditional infrastructure business—you can predict the income flows for a long time.” Macquarie sold Atlantic Aviation to KKR in 2021 for $4.5 billion, nearly 20 times its purchase price. By then, Dorrell had long since moved on. After a decade at Macquarie, he and colleague Trent Vichie wanted to start their own fund, and after a lunch with Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman decided to partner with the private equity giant. That was in October 2008. Rotten timing. Blackstone’s stock fell by more than 50% before the end of that year—bad news for Dorrell, who received $3 million in stock on his start date to cover the portion of his Macquarie bonus he had to return. His two and a half years at Blackstone were an unsuccessful slog through the crisis, and in 2011, Blackstone let him and Vichie spin out the business and start over. About that time, Dorrell was biking up Mont Ventoux in the French Alps, where the top of the mountain has been deforested and looks like a moonscape. He hit on Stonepeak as a fitting name. One of its first deals was a $175 million equity investment to support the construction of San Diego’s Carlsbad Desalination Plant, sourced through Dorrell’s longtime relationship with Poseidon Resources, the project’s developer. A 30-year water purchase agreement with the San Diego County Water Authority to provide around 10% of the county’s drinking water ensured a baseline of attractive returns. The plant was up and running in 2015. “They bought their water from the Metropolitan Water Association in the north and also the Colorado River, which often ran dry… it’s a win-win, because they’ve solved their challenge,” says Luke Taylor, who was promoted to co-president of Stonepeak along with Jack Howell last year. (Vichie left Stonepeak in 2020 and founded EverWind, a green energy development business in Canada.) In 2019, Stonepeak sold its interest in the Carlsbad project to Aberdeen Standard Investments, generating an annualized return more than double its target 12% return. Stonepeak was also early into “digital infrastructure,” buying a majority stake in Cologix in 2017 with co-investors for $1.2 billion. In 2022, it raised another $3 billion from both new and existing investors to recapitalize the business and buy out some earlier investors. Based in Denver, Cologix is the largest private carrier “hotel” business in the U.S.—carrier hotels serve as hubs for interconnection, for example connecting your home broadband provider to a data center owned by Amazon. Now, artificial intelligence firms are hungry for hyperscale data centers, which have the ability to scale up as demand increases. It’s a field Stonepeak is entering selectively, and only when it has long-term contracts in hand to ensure a return on investment, Howell explains. Cologix has formed a hyperscale division called Scalelogix which has seven current or planned data centers in locations like Ashburn, Virginia, and Columbus, Ohio. “There are two ways to get into hyperscales if you're not already in that game. One way is you go and buy a big existing hyperscale platform… The negative of doing it that way is that you're paying a very big premium,” says Dorrell. “The other way to do it, which we prefer, is to build your own data centers from scratch. It’s probably going to take you five years to get that flywheel going, but the benefit of that is you got into it so much more cheaply.” The U.S. market looks a lot different than when Dorrell got here more than two decades ago. American investors, who once dismissed infrastructure as government work, now can’t get enough of it. Private equity giants KKR, Brookfield and EQT have all raised infrastructure funds, while Blackrock bought Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion last year. “There’s no shortage of opportunity. There’s also no shortage of capital chasing those opportunities,” says Dorrell.

Title: TikTok deal derailed as China pushes back on Trump tariffs
URL: http://technode.com/2025/04/08/tiktok-deal-derailed-as-china-pushes-back-on-trump-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-04-08T10:11:11Z

Every Wednesday and Friday, TechNode’s Briefing newsletter delivers a roundup of the most important news in China tech, straight to your inbox. US President Donald Trump delayed enforcement of the TikTok sale-or-ban order for 75 additional days last Friday, one day before it was set to take effect. The extension follows Trump’s earlier tariff announcement that reportedly disrupted a pending deal to transfer the app’s US operations to American owners. ByteDance later claimed on Weibo that the company is still in talks with the US government and has not yet reached any agreement. Why it matters: The delay highlights the ongoing uncertainty surrounding TikTok’s future in the US and the broader geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump has linked the deal with tariff negotiations, adding a new layer of complexity and making clear this is not a simple tech transaction but a bargaining chip in US-China trade relations. Details: Trump announced the delay on his social platform, Truth Social, stating that his administration has been working hard to secure an agreement to “save TikTok” and has “made significant progress,” but the TikTok deal “requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed.” The delay will allow TikTok to operate for another 75 days, pushing its deadline for a sale or closure in the US to mid-June. Context: Last year, former US President Joe Biden enacted a law that forced ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company based in China, to sell its stake in the app or face a ban in the US over national security concerns. The law was scheduled to take effect in January, but Trump announced a delay in its enforcement, hoping to negotiate a deal to keep the app operational. Since then, Trump has stated that numerous buyers have shown “great interest” in acquiring TikTok. TikTok has tried several approaches to resolve the stand-off over US national security concerns, including establishing a Transparency Center, creating a dedicated US data security company, USDS, to manage American user data, and implementing two projects – “Clover” for data segregation and “Texas” for data security – each costing about $1 billion annually. The company has also hired executives with American backgrounds and reached an agreement with Oracle, which will serve as TikTok’s “trusted technology provider” in the US, according to the agreement, and whereby Oracle is authorized to conduct security reviews of TikTok’s US source code. ByteDance has repeatedly stressed that its data storage is localized, with US user data managed by Oracle, and that there is no evidence of security risks, though this defense has gained little traction among US politicians.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs see sharp $103 million outflow as market reacts to US-China war

Unwavering risk-off sentiment sent Bitcoin ETFs spiralling with no inflows in sight. On April 7, total spot Bitcoin ETF outflows reached $103.9 million, with no funds reporting inflows. Ark (ARKB) saw a $4.7 million outflow, Invesco (BTCO) shed $12.9 million, Valkyrie (HODL) and WTree (BTCW) each lost around $6 million, and Grayscale’s GBTC led with a $74 million outflow. Meanwhile, BlackRock (IBIT), Fidelity (FBTC), Bitwise (BITB), Franklin (EZBC), and Grayscale’s other Bitcoin ETFs showed no changes. By comparison, April 4 recorded $64.9 million in ETF outflows, primarily from Bitwise, Ark, and WisdomTree. Over the past week, only April 2 saw positive inflows at $218.7 million, driven by Fidelity, Bitwise, and Ark, indicating periods of stronger buying interest amid otherwise frequent net outflows. These Bitcoin ETF flows come as the crypto market contends with ongoing trade tensions. Bitcoin experienced significant volatility on Monday, triggering $1 billion in liquidations. The entire crypto market went red after concerns about US trade relations with China. A false report on CNBC based on unconfirmed data from X that the Trump administration was planning a 90-day tariff pause caused a brief rally, pushing Bitcoin past $80,000. However, BTC quickly corrected to $77,000. The broader market saw even higher losses. Within minutes, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) shed nearly $10 and wiped out approximately $2 trillion in value from the broader index. Spot Bitcoin ETFs weren’t immune to this volatility, and the overwhelming risk-off sentiment led to $103.9 million in outflows. If volatility continues into the week, we can expect to see even higher outflows as institutions and professional investors adjust their positions.

Title: Banks and FinTechs Navigate Market Mayhem Amid Escalating Tariff Fears
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/economy/2025/banks-and-fintechs-navigate-market-mayhem-amid-escalating-tariff-fears/
Time Published: 2025-04-08T08:00:21Z

Highlights Trump's recent tariff announcements have intensified recession fears, shaking investor confidence in banking and FinTech sectors. Despite steep year-to-date declines, fintechs like Affirm, PayPal, and Block staged notable rebounds, hinting at investor optimism amid uncertainty. Volatile markets and economic anxieties have stalled FinTech IPOs, with high-profile companies Klarna and Chime postponing their public listings. As the economy continues to reel from President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements, speculation about their impact on the banking and FinTech sectors has reached a fever pitch. The once-promising but cautious outlook for the U.S. economy is now being derailed by growing recession fears, casting a shadow over the entire financial services industry, including the FinTech sector. The stock market has been a clear indicator of the turmoil. FinTech stocks, particularly those in the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) space, have faced significant challenges since the tariffs were announced but staged a rally late Monday (April 7). Affirm’s stock has dropped by 44% year-to-date, although its $32 close on Friday rebounded to $38 by the time the market closed Monday. Other FinTechs showed a similar pattern of rebounding on Monday, indicating that investors saw utility in their business models during what many economists are calling a recession waiting to happen, if it hasn’t happened already. Still other major FinTech stocks defied the market’s 300-point drop, with PayPal rising from $56 to $58.37 and Block opening at $46 and rising to $50.47. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Monday that many business leaders believe the U.S. economy is already in a significant downturn. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” Fink said at an event for the Economic Club of New York, according to CNBC. “One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine — canary in the coal mine — and I was told that the canary is sick already.” Where do FinTechs fit in the larger picture? Analysts remain cautious about FinTech growth prospects, citing economic uncertainty and regulatory pressures. Despite this, there is optimism about the sector’s long-term potential, driven by innovations in artificial intelligence and blockchain, as well as a robust employment market and receding inflation. However, that outlook is clouded by the current economic turmoil. The FinTech IPO market has also been affected, with Klarna recently putting its public listing on ice, signaling a chill in FinTech IPOs. Chime also postponed its IPO. Analysts suggest that the volatile market conditions and fears of a global recession are deterring companies from going public, as investors become more risk-averse. As IPOX CEO Josef Schuster noted: “Even with the improved market sentiment we’ve seen, investors are going to continue scrutinizing deals carefully.” Banking stocks were also hit hard as the sector grappled with the broader market downturn. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index experienced significant volatility, reflecting concerns about the economic impact of tariffs and potential recession risks. Major banks like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have seen their shares decline substantially, with Bank of America’s stock dropping 21.8% year-to-date. Regional banks, in particular, are feeling the pain. As Bloomberg reported on Monday, the KBW Regional Banking Index slumped 13% following the tariff announcements, with banks like Western Alliance Bancorp and East West Bancorp experiencing double-digit losses. These institutions are not directly impacted by tariffs but are vulnerable to economic slowdowns, which can reduce loan growth, lower fee income and increase credit costs. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, highlighted the challenges facing the banking sector in his annual shareholder letter. “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better, because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,” Dimon wrote. He noted that the economy was already weakening before the recent tariff announcement, adding that these policies are “one large additional straw on the camel’s back.” The impact of tariffs extends beyond the financial sector, affecting consumers and businesses alike. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence reveals that Americans’ financial confidence had already been shaken even before the latest tariff announcement. Most consumers are reducing spending, either by buying fewer things or opting for cheaper products. This pullback is linked to concerns about persistent inflation and a possible recession, even before the full impact of these policies has been felt. In the business world, uncertainty is also prevalent. PYMNTS Intelligence found that 32% of middle-market companies say uncertainty will lead them to miss business opportunities, while 33% face delays in getting products to market, and 31% experience client turnover due to their uncertain business outlooks. This uncertainty affects a significant portion of U.S. businesses, acting as a bridge between enterprise and smaller business supply chains.

Making Money host Charles Payne discusses Wall Streets interpretation of President Donald Trumps tariffs. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that the stock market could see declines deepen by another 20% amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariffs and that CEOs are telling him they think the U.S. economy is likely already in a recession. "Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now," Fink told the Economic Club of New York on Monday. Tariffs are expected to make a wide variety of products more expensive, exacerbating inflationary pressures that have been persistent in recent months. Despite turmoil in the market, Fink said that weakness does create a buying opportunity over the long run despite the potential for further declines. "I would say in the long run, this is more of a buying opportunity than it is a selling opportunity. That doesn't mean we can't fall another 20% from here, too," Fink said. BLACKROCK CEO FINK'S LETTER TO INVESTORS DUMPS DEI, TOUTS EXPANSION OF MARKET ACCESS BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said CEOs he talks to think the U.S. has already entered a recession. (Hollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) "The economy is weakening as we speak," Fink said, adding that he sees the economy slowing further in the coming months with inflation likely to be elevated. Given his concerns about inflation, Fink said he sees no chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates four or five times this year due to the outlook for inflation, which could be made more challenging as tariffs take effect and foreign governments retaliate. Trump's tariff announcement on April 2 caused markets to plunge in the ensuing days, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all down more than 9% in the past five trading days and more than 10% over the last month.

Title: Hydrocarbons: Signals of further investment interest in the Greek market

Time Published: 2025-04-08T06:32:14Z

The planet will need investments in natural gas and oil in the coming period to fill the large gaps left behind by the commitment to green development, which led to disinvestment in fossil fuels and a contraction in production. This message was conveyed by Fatih Birol, Director-General of the International Energy Agency, at the CERA Week global exhibition a few weeks ago in Houston, saying that these investments are necessary to address the major shortages observed in the market, which may even cause supply problems. In this international environment of a return to fossil fuel investments, Greece is also seeking to utilize its national energy resources and claim its energy autonomy. The interest of two international giants has already been registered, which aims to proceed with increased pace in the next phase of planning for the extractions, with EDEYEP‘s estimates indicating that the country may attract interest from other investors as well. The state-owned hydrocarbon and energy resources research company recently granted Exxon Mobil a new one-year extension for exploration west of Crete, while yesterday the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources signed the ministerial decision accepting Chevron‘s interest submitted for the South of Crete 1 and South of Crete 2 offshore blocks. It should be noted that Chevron has invested over 5 million euros to purchase all the data (geological and geophysical data) that are in areas that have not been licensed and do not have commercial restrictions. This data becomes accessible to anyone who wants to buy and study it, which is what the American company did to make the decision to invest in our country. In fact, Greece is taking advantage of the international trend brought by Trump‘s re-election to the White House, which wants the revival of investment interest in hydrocarbons. Greece has made it clear that its interest is focused on natural gas, but it could not turn a blind eye to oil either if interesting deposits emerge during the research, according to competent sources who are in a position to know the priorities and the next steps. “It is difficult to say that we have forgotten about oil. What we can say is that we are focusing on natural gas because these investments have a long-term perspective,” say competent sources. And they add that this is also related to quantities. “It would be difficult to tell investors who have spent huge sums on exploration that they cannot get their investments back. It is something we do not consider very likely without closing the door,” the same sources report, estimating that there could be further investment interest in the Greek market. It is worth noting, however, that another large multinational oil and gas company, the Asian Petronas from Malaysia, had been interested in Greece in the past, which had even passed all the technical checks in the country to proceed, something that was ultimately overturned by the change in its strategy. Today, market executives confirm the international investment interest in fossil fuels and cite Blackrock as an example, which recently declared that it is determined to invest in the sector. With the acceptance of Chevron’s interest, the next step is for Greece to determine the exact coordinates of the area, the type of contract and the announcement of an international tender which, based on what the institutional framework provides, will remain open for 90 days so that it can attract other investment interest, if any.

(f-l-e-x: www.flickr.com) Financial markets are often skittish, swinging between extreme optimism and outright panic — a phenomenon we've witnessed in dramatic fashion in the past few weeks. In fact, there are a couple of old adages that brilliantly describe market behaviour. The first is that stock market gains are built upon a wall of worry. And the other is that stocks go up by the stairs and down by the fireman's pole. That second one explains why you only ever hear of "billions wiped off markets" and not the billions slowly wiped on. So, should we pay any notice at all to the shenanigans that routinely rock and roil our world? The short answer is yes. That's primarily because the arcane world of stocks, bonds, currencies and derivatives trading — while generally unfathomable to most of us — can have profound real-world effects. What's more, those effects now have a much quicker transmission process into our everyday lives than they once did. Donald Trump and key advisers such as Peter Navarro have been trying to draw a distinction between what they call Wall Street and Main Street. The message is that there's no need to worry, everything will work out just fine in the end, and that the current meltdown is just wealthy traders chucking a tantrum. Here's what Ed Yardeni, one of Wall Street's most prominent analysts, had to say about that: "On Saturday morning, I nearly gagged on my bagel listening to a CNN interview with Peter Navarro. "The president's senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing declared that the tariffs are aimed at benefiting Main Street, not Wall Street. "Other senior officials in the Trump administration, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have said the same." He went on. "I have news for them: Wall Street is Main Street. Yardeni's last point is extremely important. Gone are the days when ordinary people simply stashed their cash in a bank account. Back in the 1960s and 70s, you could get decent returns with absolutely no risk. But as interest rates have fallen, more people have taken to the stock market, either buying shares directly in companies through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or through investment vehicles. Around half of Australians' superannuation balances are invested in global and local stocks, meaning the tariff-induced market ructions are hitting super savings. Here's why experts say it's not time to panic. According to the most recent survey by the Australian Securities Exchange, 51 per cent of Australians have direct exposure to the stock market. Given the difficulties many younger Australians have in buying a house, a growing number have opted to put their savings into stocks. And then there's superannuation — our retirement funds overwhelmingly reach into the high-octane world of stocks. Australia's superannuation savings have grown to $4.2 trillion. And between them, our big super funds own about a quarter of everything listed on the ASX. When markets move, we notice. There's a phenomenon economists call the "wealth effect" — when we feel wealthy, we spend. When things turn ugly, we snap the wallets shut. It's a rule that applies even if there is no material change in the amount of cash in our pockets. It's become so entrenched, even the Reserve Bank of Australia factors it into its forecasts and its interest rate decisions. The new US tariffs have wreaked havoc on global markets but there could be a silver lining for Australian homeowners, with the big four banks changing their bets on when the RBA could deliver the next rate cut. What would make you feel wealthy? When you're paying off a house and the value of it suddenly surges — as we've witnessed during the past 30 years — home owners tend to be more relaxed about spending, even if on credit. If things turn sour, and real estate prices drop, a large number of households may become worried that the value of their home is worth only barely more than their mortgage. In those circumstances, they're more likely to pull their heads in when it comes to spending. The same goes for the stock market. If it's booming and you own stocks, you'll feel richer and start to spend, even if you don't sell any shares. Consumer spending is the biggest component of our gross domestic product (GDP). When people spend, companies earn bigger profits and are more likely to hire extra workers. But if markets crash, there's a noticeable drop in spending as investors concentrate more on trying to rebuild their lost wealth. And that's when things can turn ugly. The current market sell-offs similarities to the global financial crisis are uncanny and unnerving. Lower spending, businesses going broke, workers being laid off — if the trend becomes entrenched, we end up in recession. And that's one of the big concerns right now, that the violent market shake-out could shatter consumer confidence and result in less spending. Of course, that's on top of the brutal impact of the tariffs themselves. Tariffs ultimately are paid by the businesses and consumers of the country imposing them, meaning prices rise. Those higher prices ordinarily would mean consumers buy less, which would result in an economic slowdown, possibly even a recession. Larry Fink, the head of BlackRock, one of the world's biggest investment institutions, expressed those fears on Monday. "When you see a 20 per cent market decline in three days, obviously it has significant impacts and the ripple effects of the potential of tariffs is going to be longstanding," he said.

Title: Contract for Hong Kong company to operate Panama Canal ports had irregularities, audit finds

Panama’s comptroller authority says an audit found irregularities in the renewal of a 25-year port concession in the interoceanic canal and it would request an investigation into the authorization of the contract to a Hong Kong company PANAMA CITY -- Panama’s comptroller authority said Monday an audit found irregularities in the renewal of a 25-year port concession in the interoceanic canal and it would request an investigation into the authorization of the contract to a Hong Kong company. Comptroller-General Anel Flores said the audit found some payment defaults, accounting miscalculations and some “shadow” operation of companies that the Hong Kong company originally denied, causing Panama around $300 million in lost revenue. The release of the audit of Panama Ports Company, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate subsidiary that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal, comes as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration alleges Chinese interference in the canal's operations, which Panamanian authorities have denied. It also happens the same day the U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrives to the Central American country to participate in a subregional security conference. “There are many violations that will have to be explained,” the Panamanian comptroller said. He added that the audit’s results will be sent to Panama’s Maritime Authority, which oversees the ports and has the power to terminate a contract. Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings conglomerate did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Panama Ports Company won a concession in 1997 to operate the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, and it was renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. Trump has threatened to retake control of the Panama Canal, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians more than two decades ago. Some days ago, while the audit was underway, CK Hutchison said it has agreed to sell its controlling stake in Panama Ports Company to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control. The Panamanian government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’ operations of the ports did not mean a Chinese control over the canal. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Bitcoin Whipsaws On Fake Tariff Bombshell News

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Speculation over a purported White House plan to pause tariffs for ninety days on all countries except China sent markets into a frenzy earlier today, triggering abrupt price reversals across equities, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. In a quick-fire series of conflicting updates, the rumor initially floated at around 10:10 AM ET, sparked momentum in risk assets, and was eventually deemed “fake news” by the White House. The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) described the chronology on X, noting: “What just happened? At 10:10 AM ET, rumors emerged that the White House was considering a ‘90-day tariff pause.’ At 10:15 AM ET, CNBC reported that Trump is considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for ALL countries except for China. By 10:18 AM ET, the S&P 500 had added over +$3 TRILLION in market cap from its low.” However, only seven minutes later, at 10:25 AM ET, reports emerged that the White House was ‘unaware’ of Trump considering a 90-day pause. “At 10:26 AM ET, CNBC reports that the 90-day tariff pause headlines were incorrect. At 10:34 AM ET, the White House officially called the tariff pause headlines ‘fake news.’ By 10:40 AM ET, the S&P 500 erased -$2.5 TRILLION of market cap from its high, 22 minutes prior. Never in history have we seen something like this,” The Kobeissi Letter writes. The mere suggestion of a temporary reprieve from tariffs managed to shift sentiment rapidly in both equity and crypto markets. BTC, which was trading around $75,805 at the time, soared by roughly 7.2% to surpass $81,200 within half an hour. Once confirmation arrived that no such pause was planned, the gains evaporated almost as fast as they had arrived, pulling Bitcoin back to roughly $77,560. The abrupt turn of events unleashed a wave of commentary among crypto observers. Pentoshi (@Pentosh1) remarked that “The fake news tweet showed there’s a lot of sidelined capital at least for relief rally and the risk is to the upside on any positive news at least temporarily.” Will Clemente III cautioned: “Bear take: Liquidity is bad and this volatility might break something. Bull take: This headline was the cointelegraph intern BTC ETF headline but for equities.” Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, remarked that “Bitcoin’s current price drawdown is about to become the largest of the current cycle,” illustrating his point with a chart that showed BTC’s correction reaching -26.62%, matching the scale of August 2024’s correction. Macro analyst Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) invoked BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s observation that another 20% market drop is not out of the question, saying: “That’s the thing. Under normal circumstances, probability of such scenarios or things such as stagflation are so low you can just brush them off. Trump opened up the left tail => anything is possible. We are one headline away from a 7% candle in either direction.” Podcast host Felix Jauvin (@fejau_inc) agrees: “What’s so crazy about this crash vs other is its entirely self-willed and could be reversed in an instant on one tweet. Has there ever been anything like that?” In the midst of the turmoil, European Union Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed a willingness to seek solutions, stating, “Europe is ready to negotiate with the US,” including the possibility of zero-for-zero tariffs on industrial goods.

Title: Audit finds Hong Kong firm flouted terms of Panama Canal ports contract
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2998279/audit-finds-hong-kong-firm-flouted-terms-of-panama-canal-ports-contract
Time Published: 2025-04-08T04:45:00Z
Full Content:
PANAMA CITY - The Hong Kong firm in charge of two ports at either end of the Panama Canal -- which sparked US President Donald Trump's threats to seize the waterway -- has flouted the terms of its contract, according to Panamanian audit results released Monday. The audit found "many breaches" of the concession awarded to a subsidiary of logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the two ports, and concluded that Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed under the contract. The subsidiary, called Panama Ports, benefited from many tax exemptions and also had irregularities in a previous audit that was used to justify an extension of the concession first awarded in 1997, said state comptroller Anel Flores. "This is a very delicate issue," Flores told reporters, adding that he would file a complaint with prosecutors in the coming days over the unpaid concession fees. The release of the audit results came hours before US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was set to arrive in Panama, which has come under strong pressure from Trump to reduce Chinese influence on the US-built canal. The United States has said it is a threat to its national security -- and the region as a whole -- for a Hong Kong company to operate ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. But Flores denied that the announcement of Panama Ports failing to honor the concession contract had anything to do with the Hegseth visit. "This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration. "It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession," Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations, told AFP. The state comptroller's office is an autonomous body that examines how government money is spent. It began the audit of Panama Ports in late January to determine if it was honoring the concession contract, after Trump threatened to take over the canal, by force if necessary. Faced with Trump's repeated threats, the Central American country in turn has put pressure on CK Hutchison to relinquish its control of the ports. In March, the firm announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the interoceanic Panama Canal -- to a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal, likely preventing the parties from signing an agreement on April 2 as planned. Panama Ports, a subsidiary of CK Hutchison, won the concession to operate Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and Cristobal port on the Atlantic side in 1997. The concession was renewed for another 25 years in 2021.

Title: Government to close under-fire $400m climate fund

Climate Change Minister Simon Watts said the fund would be wound down. Photo / RNZ The Government plans to close a $400 million climate investment fund, begun by former Climate Change Minister James Shaw. The fund had been under fire for backing SolarZero, shortly before the solar energy company was liquidated. Current Climate Change Minister Simon Watts announced today that New Zealand Green Investment Finance (NZGIF) will stop making new investments and will wind down its existing portfolio. The Government is not sure how much money it will recoup from the sell down. Watts’ office said it was “too early to comment on the amount of money the Crown will recoup from NZGIF”. However, the fund’s “new mandate is focused on expediting the repurposing of the portfolio in a timely manner that maximises returns”. Watts said the fund had invested “almost $400 million” with “very limited results”. It is meant to act as a green bank, making targeted investments in firms to help them decarbonise. “[T]here are more than 20 government funds operating with similar objectives,” he said. Watts said NZGIF would develop a plan for ministers outlining how changes will be implemented within 90 says. The move to sell the portfolio comes as global share markets are suffering their biggest sell off since the Covid-19 pandemic, making it a particularly challenging time to sell many assets. The fund had recently made investments in Far North Solar Farms, Ruminant BioTech, and Sundergise. The fund copped criticism last year after it was caught up in the collapse of SolarZero, which was liquidated by its owner, American investment firm BlackRock. Advances of $115m from the fund were made to install solar panels and batteries in households under lease-type arrangements. These were not caught up in the liquidation, as the loans, securities and monthly payments from households are tied to trusts and companies controlled by Public Trust. NZGIF chair Cecilia Tarrant resigned in the wake of the scandal. The fund’s most recent annual report estimated the lifetime emissions reduction its combined investments at June 30, 2024 to be 1.3 million to 1.6 million tonnes of CO2-e. “This is greater than New Zealand’s entire annual domestic airline emissions in 2022 and will continue to grow as we make further investments,” Tarrant said at the time. “This Government is serious about climate change, that’s why we have committed to doubling renewable energy, investing in technology to lower emissions while boosting productivity, and cutting barriers to green investment,” Watts said. “We will prioritise actions that have the greatest impact on emissions and growth and will provide real value for money. “In the current economic environment New Zealanders want assurance that taxpayer money is being well spent and delivering results. We believe NZGIF is no longer aligned to that vision,” he said. Thomas Coughlan is deputy political editor and covers politics from Parliament.

Title: More people own crypto in Singapore, with younger users leading the way: Survey
URL: https://www.straitstimes.com/business/more-people-own-crypto-in-singapore-with-younger-users-leading-the-way-survey
Time Published: 2025-04-08T04:34:46Z
Full Content:
SINGAPORE – More people in Singapore own cryptocurrencies, and younger users are leading the way in using the asset for daily financial needs, such as online shopping and bill payments, a new study shows. The number of Singapore residents who own cryptocurrencies is on the rise, with 26 per cent owning digital assets in 2024, up from 24.4 per cent in 2023. A majority of them, or 52 per cent, have paid for goods and services with it, and 67 per cent plan to increase their usage of crypto for payments in future. Gen Zs and millennials, or those aged between 16 and 44 years old as at 2025, lead in crypto ownership, with about 40 per cent of them holding the asset. Of this group of people, 41.1 per cent use crypto for online shopping, 35.9 per cent for bill payments and 27 per cent for in-store retail goods. While younger people use crypto to pay for retail goods and bills, those older – aged 45 and above in 2025 – use crypto more for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions such as those made between friends and family. Among the older generation, 42.9 per cent use crypto for P2P transactions, with 35.7 per cent using it for online shopping and 17.2 per cent for bill payments. These were some of the findings from the study by Singapore-based crypto payment firm Triple-A, based on a survey of 1,006 residents here. Singapore has seen a notable increase in crypto payments, with merchant services receiving nearly US$1 billion (S$1.3 billion) in crypto in the second quarter of 2024, much higher than any other quarter in the past two years, according to data from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. A separate Chainalysis report in September 2024 noted a growing adoption of crypto as a payment method in Singapore. “The combination of regulatory clarity and merchant adoption suggests that Singapore is positioning itself as a major hub for digital assets, which could eventually attract more global businesses and investors,” Chainalysis said. AXS, in partnership with Triple-A, allows its app users to make top-ups or pay bills in digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD Coin and Tether. Other merchants which have partnered Triple-A to offer the crypto payment option include fashion brand Charles & Keith on its e-commerce platform and Apple products reseller iStudio at its retail stores. The findings from Triple-A noted that 37 per cent of respondents cited global acceptance as a key benefit of crypto payments. Higher transaction speed (29 per cent) and lower fees (20 per cent) were also important factors, particularly for cross-border and time-sensitive transactions. But there were concerns about the crypto ecosystem. The complexity involved in using crypto was the top challenge cited by 63 per cent of respondents. For instance, users need to figure out the use of private keys or passwords, which enable them to access and manage their crypto funds. Security concerns (60 per cent) and lack of merchant acceptance (54 per cent) were also factors of concern. The crypto payment trend comes against a backdrop of a rising number of digital payment token (DPT) firms being licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), fuelling new roles in the growing Web3 industry. Web3 companies are those that use blockchain technology to build products and services. As at end-November, MAS has issued a record 13 new DPT licences in 2024, raising the total number of DPT licensees from 16 to 29, said a report from blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs released in December 2024. Despite a global slowdown in hiring, with mass layoffs in 2024, more than 75 per cent of local Web3 companies want to expand their workforce in 2025 as they continue developing products and services for global and regional markets. This is according to the Singapore: The OnChain State report led by the Singapore FinTech Association (SFA), Web3 business account platform HQ.xyz as well as Web3 builder communities SG Builders and Superteam, which conducted surveys and case studies with 53 Web3 companies. The report said 60 per cent of these companies are looking to expand their current workforce by half or more. SFA, which facilitates collaboration between market participants and stakeholders in the fintech ecosystem, told The Straits Times that the hiring plans are driven by growing institutional adoption, ongoing technology improvements in blockchain and the expansion of applications for Web3 technology. Moves that increased institutional adoption of digital assets include the US Securities and Exchange Commission approving the first US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds launched by BlackRock, Fidelity and others in January 2024. A total of 2,433 people are currently employed in the local Web3 sector, excluding those working in Web3 roles in non-Web3-native companies. These roles include those in partnerships, marketing strategy and sales to help Web3 companies go to market with their solutions, said SFA. Product managers as well as developers and software engineers are also key roles being hired. “We also see jobs being created in the professional services sector that support Web3, which include legal, advisory and consulting roles,” SFA said. Companies outlined what they hope to see improvements on as the acceptance of Web3 grows in Singapore. Limited or complete lack of access to services such as banking, with 59 per cent of Web3 companies indicating so, poses significant barriers for these businesses, particularly those in the early stages of development as they rely on these services to ensure operational stability and regulatory compliance. “The perceived risk associated with crypto and Web3 activities leads many service providers to shy away from engaging with these companies, further exacerbating the problem,” the report said. As a result, there is a growing demand for more streamlined, Web3-specific regulatory frameworks that would enable easier access to both banking and non-banking services critical to business growth, the report said. Web3 companies also wished for a forum where they can directly engage policymakers to foster better understanding and ensure that regulatory frameworks can keep pace with rapid advancements, they said.

Title: Top White House trade advisor ‘guarantees no recession’ under Trump’s tariff plan despite market freefall

Top White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday “guaranteed” that the US will not plunge into a recession under President Trump and claimed there would be no inflation despite ongoing fallout from his “Liberation Day” tariffs. Navarro’s promise comes amid concern from Wall Street that the US economy may already be contracting in the aftermath of Trump’s sweeping announcement of new tariffs last week. “It’s finding a bottom now,” Navarro said of the stock market freefall during an interview with Fox News “Ingraham Angle” host Laura Ingraham Monday night. “But look, here’s the thing, it’s going to shift over, and it’s going to be companies in the S&P 500 who are the first to produce here,” he added. “Those are the ones going to lead to recovery, and it’s going to happen.” Navarro then made a pair of bold economic predictions. “Dow: 50,000, I guarantee that, and I guarantee no recession,” the White House official declared. Navarro’s confidence comes from his belief that Congress will soon enact the president’s economic agenda, including eliminating taxes on tipped wages and overtime pay and extending tax cuts authorized during Trump’s first term. US stocks jump as trading partners rush to negotiate with Trump on tariffs “Why? Because when we pass the biggest, broadest tax cut in history, within a matter of months, that’s going to be a great stimulus,” the Trump adviser said. “There’s not going to be any inflation,” Navarro continued. “We’ve already had a significant drop, a huge drop in oil prices – that’s like a point off the [inflation index]. We’re going to have lower yields and mortgage [rates].” In contrast, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told the Economic Club of New York on Monday that most business leaders already feel the nation is in an economic downturn. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” Fink said. A recession is a period of significant decline in economic activity that lasts for more than a few months. It’s typically recognized by two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Trump’s reciprocal tariff plan has roiled the stock market, but it’s too early to tell what lasting effect it will have on economic growth. In the first two days following Trump’s announcement last week, the S&P 500 index plummeted 10.5% – its biggest two-day loss since March 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 300 points on Monday and is more than 10% below its December record close. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite was up less than a percentage point on Monday but confirmed it was in a bear market, defined as a decline of 20% or more below its record close, according to Reuters. Navarro confirmed that foreign leaders are calling the White House and desperately trying to work out a deal to cut the new tariffs, but he argued they’re focusing on the wrong thing. The leaders are “saying ‘We want to talk. We’ll lower our tariffs to zero if you’ll lower yours’… That’s not the problem,” Navarro said. The trade adviser cited the example of Vietnam, which was hit with a 46% levy, and sells “$15 for every $1 we sell them.” “Zero tariffs would get us no reduction in the $123 billion deficit we have,” Navarro argued, adding that “$5 of that $15 they sell us … It’s China.” “They don’t buy anything ours and they want to go to 0-0.” Advertisement

Title: Hong Kong firm did not uphold Panama Canal ports contract: Panama audit

East Asia View of the Port of Balboa, managed by CK Hutchison Holdings, based in Hong Kong, located at the entrance to the Panama Canal in Panama City, on Mar 12, 2025. (File photo: AFP/Martin Bernetti) PANAM CITY: The Hong Kong firm in charge of two key Panama Canal ports has flouted the terms of its contract, according to a Panamanian audit released on Monday (Apr 7), as US and Chinese firms fight for business on the waterway after President Donald Trump threatened to seize it. The audit found "many breaches" of the concession awarded to a subsidiary of logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the two ports, and concluded that Panama did not receive US$1.2 billion it was owed under the contract. The subsidiary, called Panama Ports, benefited from many tax exemptions and also had irregularities in a previous audit that was used to justify an extension of the concession first awarded in 1997, said state comptroller Anel Flores. "This is a very delicate issue," Flores told reporters, adding that he would file a complaint with prosecutors in the coming days over the unpaid concession fees. The release of the audit results came hours before US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Panama, which has come under strong pressure from Trump to reduce Chinese influence on the US-built canal. The US has said it is a threat to its national security - and the region as a whole - for a Hong Kong company to operate ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which 5 per cent of all global shipping passes. Hegseth will meet Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Tuesday and visit the canal, which opened in 1914. He will also participate in a security conference with Central American officials. Although the waterway has been under Panamanian control since 1999 under international treaties, Trump has threatened to take it back, by force if necessary, arguing that it is effectively controlled by Beijing. Flores on Monday denied that the announcement of Panama Ports failing to honour the concession contract had anything to do with the Hegseth visit. "This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration. "It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession," Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations, told AFP. The state comptroller's office is an autonomous body that examines how government money is spent. It began the audit of Panama Ports in late January to determine if it was honouring the concession contract, after Trump threatened to take over the canal. Faced with the US president's repeated threats, the Central American country in turn has put pressure on CK Hutchison to relinquish its control of the ports. In March, the firm announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries - including its two on the interoceanic Panama Canal - to a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock for US$19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal, which likely prevented the parties from signing an agreement on Apr 2 as planned. The Panama Ports concession to operate Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and Cristobal port on the Atlantic side was renewed for another 25 years in 2021.

REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Elida Moreno PANAMA CITY, April 7 (Reuters) – Panama’s Comptroller General office will file a lawsuit against the officials who authorized the renewal of a 25-year port concession to a company led by CK Hutchison, the comptroller general said on Monday, as a key audit of the contract is expected to be completed soon. The contract to Panama Ports Company for the Balboa and Cristobal ports near the Panama Canal, in which Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison has a 90% stake, was renewed in 2021. The Panamanian government started the audit in January and in March a group led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock announced a $22.8 billion deal to buy most of CK Hutchison’s global ports business including the two ports in Panama. The audit has so far determined that Panama “left $1.3 billion on the table,” Comptroller General Anel Flores told reporters in a press conference, referring to tax incentives and benefits granted by the government in the contract. In February, Panama’s Attorney General released a binding opinion finding that the port contract was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court will have the last word on that. Once finished, the audit results will be submitted to Panama’s Maritime Authority, which oversees the ports, Flores said. The audit is seen as a possible roadblock in BlackRock’s offer for CK Hutchison’s port business, which has been criticized by China. If Panama’s Comptroller General confirms irregularities in the concession renewal or the Supreme Court declares the contract to be unconstitutional, the concession could be revoked, lawyers and experts have said. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to take control of the Panama Canal due to the presence of Chinese and Hong Kong firms in the Central American country’s maritime business, celebrated BlackRock’s announced deal for CK Hutchison’s ports. The transaction has not been completed.

Title: Roundup: U.S. stocks close mixed in choppy trade

Tuesday, 08 Apr 2025 NEW YORK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Monday in the roller-coaster trading session as investors' anxiety over a potential economic slowdown and persistent inflation remained elevated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 349.26 points, or 0.91 percent, to 37,965.6. The S&P 500 sank 11.83 points, or 0.23 percent, to 5,062.25. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 15.48 points, or 0.10 percent, to 15,603.26. Nine of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with real estate and materials leading the laggards by losing 2.40 percent and 1.65 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, communication services and technology went up 1.03 percent and 0.32 percent, respectively. Earlier in the day, all three major U.S. stock indexes hit their lowest levels in more than a year, reflecting deepening concern across Wall Street. The CBOE Volatility Index, commonly known as the VIX and widely regarded as Wall Street's fear gauge, surged past 60 points for the first time since August 2024, before settling back to 46.35 by the afternoon session. Markets briefly rallied mid-morning after a news report suggested that Trump might be considering a 90-day pause on tariff implementations. However, the gains quickly evaporated after White House officials denied the report, pushing equities back into negative territory before a late-session rebound. "Margin calls are going out as we speak," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. "For a third straight day investors in U.S. equity markets have turned (a) huge thumbs down on the White House Liberation Day tariffs which have rocked Wall Street." U.S. President Trump made a new threat to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods as he requested China to withdraw retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Adding to the day's developments, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent posted on social media that Trump had directed him to initiate negotiations with Japan's government following what Bessent described as a "very constructive" phone conversation between the two leaders. Bessent also said: "I look forward to our upcoming productive engagement regarding tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers, currency issues, and government subsidies. I appreciate the Japanese government's outreach and measured approach to this process." "The president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe...this is not what we voted for," wrote Bill Ackman, billionaire head of Pershing Square, on X. "The president has an opportunity on Monday to call a time out and have the time to execute on fixing an unfair tariff system. Alternatively, we are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down." If Trump's tariffs push the U.S. economy into a recession, chip stocks could have at least another 20 percent to fall, according to Citi. "We believe the biggest risk to the semi sector is a recession resulting from tariffs," Chris Danely, a managing director at the bank, wrote to clients in a recent note. If the tariffs continue for another month, it is highly likely the supply chain will "freeze up" given uncertainty, drastically lower order rates/inventory, and result in lower guidance across the board - similar to Covid, said Danely. Notably, CEOs were already growing more pessimistic about the U.S. economy. "Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now," said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Monday. "One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine - canary in the coal mine - and I was told that the canary is sick already," he added. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also warned Monday that Trump's tariffs are likely to push up prices on both domestic and imported goods, placing additional pressure on an already cooling U.S. economy.

Title: Are You Ready To Pay A 104% Tariff On All Products From China?

Time Published: 2025-04-07T22:46:53Z
Full Content:
The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? How many products do you have in your home right now that were made in China? If you are like most Americans, that number is very high. We should have never allowed ourselves to become so dependent on cheap Chinese goods, but we did. Walmart, Target and our dollar stores are absolutely teeming with products that were manufactured in China, and now those products are about to get much more expensive. The 34 percent “retaliatory tariff” that the Trump administration recently imposed on the Chinese was on top of a 20 percent tariff that the Trump administration had already imposed on them. The White House has confirmed this. Unfortunately, the 54 percent tariff that we were potentially facing will now rise to 104 percent thanks to an additional 50 percent tariff that will go into effect on April 9th. Earlier today, President Trump posted the following on his Truth Social account… Yesterday, China issued Retaliatory Tariffs of 34%, on top of their already record setting Tariffs, Non-Monetary Tariffs, Illegal Subsidization of companies, and massive long term Currency Manipulation, despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set. Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th. Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter! The math is very clear: 20 percent plus 34 percent plus 50 percent equals 104 percent. No matter how the pundits try to spin this, the truth is that we will be paying this tariff if we continue to purchase Chinese products. It is easy to say that we should just switch to products made in the U.S., but in thousands of cases there simply are not any similar products manufactured here. And in thousands of other cases, products that are ultimately assembled in the U.S. depend on components that come from China. Once again, we should have never allowed ourselves to get into this situation. Trying to reverse course now is going to be a major league headache. I asked Google AI to tell me some of the products that we get from China, and it produced quite an extensive list… Consumer Electronics: China is a major source for smartphones, computers, video game consoles, and other electronic devices. Toys and Games: A significant portion of the toys, games, and sporting goods imported into the U.S. come from China. Furniture and Bedding: China is a major source for furniture, bedding, and other home goods. Textiles and Clothing: China is a major source for textile products and clothing. Machinery and Electrical Equipment: China is a major source for machinery, nuclear reactors, boilers, and electrical equipment Other Products: China also supplies the U.S. with items like lithium-ion batteries, plastics, and miscellaneous manufactured goods. Food: While a small percentage of the U.S. food supply comes from China, it is a major supplier for specific items like apple juice, garlic, canned mandarin oranges, fish, and shrimp. At this point, a list of things that we don’t get from China might be shorter. I am particularly concerned about what these tariffs will do to the pharmaceutical industry, because Google AI says that the vast majority of the active ingredients in our pharmaceutical drugs are imported from China… While it’s difficult to pinpoint an exact percentage, a significant portion of raw materials for pharmaceutical drugs in the U.S. come from China, with estimates suggesting that around 80% of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are sourced from China and other countries like India. We are in so much trouble. Bill Ackman is warning that unless these tariffs are rolled back we are headed into a “self-induced economic nuclear winter”… Billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman, a staunch President Trump ally, has warned that the world is on the brink of “self-induced economic nuclear winter” as he begged the commander-in-chief to pause his sweeping tariffs. “The President has an opportunity on Monday to call a time out and have the time to execute on fixing an unfair tariff system. Alternatively, we are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down,” Ackman wrote in a lengthy X post Sunday night. “May cooler heads prevail.” Bill Ackman wouldn’t have become a billionaire if he wasn’t extremely sharp, and I agree with his assessment. The outlook for the months ahead is extremely dismal. In fact, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is admitting that most CEOs that he talks to “would say we are probably in a recession right now”… BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that the stock market could see declines deepen by another 20% amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs and that CEOs are telling him they think the U.S. economy is likely already in a recession. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” Fink told the Economic Club of New York on Monday. Tariffs are expected to make a wide variety of products more expensive, exacerbating inflationary pressures that have been persistent in recent months. As I discussed on Friday, our economic momentum has been taking us in the wrong direction for a long time. And now these tariffs are going to introduce a tremendous amount of chaos into the equation. As a result of the tariffs that were just imposed, Volkswagen is actually “holding 37,000 cars at US ports”… Volkswagen is holding 37,000 cars at US ports amid tariff turmoil. Audi, the luxury arm of the world’s second largest global automaker, has confirmed it’s in a high-stakes holding pattern triggered by President Donald Trump’s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles. The affected cars arrived in the U.S. the same day Trump announced the sweeping levies. Now, they sit idle as VW considers its next move. Executives are thought to be hoping for either a presidential U-turn or a chance to negotiate a lower rate. How long can they possibly hold these vehicles at our ports? Of course the U.S. auto industry is going to be hit really hard as well… If President Trump’s trade war has a physical battleground, it is Michigan, where companies and workers are already feeling the beginning of an onslaught that could blow a hole in the state’s economy. Nearly 20% of the economy is tied to the auto industry, which has become increasingly dependent on parts and vehicles from Canada, Mexico and China—imports Trump hit with steep tariffs in recent weeks. This trade has grown so large that Michigan ranks fifth in the nation by the size of its imports and exports, even though its total economy ranks 14th. Even before the tariffs were announced, it was clear that a major slowdown was now upon us. For example, the number of commercial bankruptcies in March 2025 was much higher than the number of commercial bankruptcies in March 2024… More companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March than a year ago, indicating economic stress among U.S. businesses, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute (ABI). “Commercial Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings increased 20 percent in March 2025, with filings climbing to 733 from the 611 filings registered in March 2024,” ABI said in an April 3 statement. And during the first three months of this year, U.S. banks filed to close hundreds of local branches… Banks filed nearly 400 notices for the planned closures of some of their locations across the U.S. in the first three months of the year, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) records. Only some of these branches have already shut their doors. The closure of others has received approval from the OCC but has not yet been carried through by the bank, which may ultimately decide against it. Many are pending approval from the OCC, an independent federal agency which safeguards the U.S. banking system, making sure it remains accessible to underserved consumers and communities. I have been warning that it was not going to take much to push the U.S. economy over the edge. Unfortunately, we just got a really big shove. We have been through so much economic pain over the past four years, and I know that a lot of people out there were quite eager for better times to arrive. Sadly, what we are about to experience is not going to be pleasant at all.

U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 10% tariffs on all U.S. imports on April 5, sparking retaliatory measures from Beijing and the European Union and igniting fears of a global trade war. Speaking at the Economic Club of New York on Monday, Fink shared that many of his fellow executives believe the market meltdown is a sign the U.S. is in the midst of an economic recession, Reuters reported. "Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now," Fink said. The executive’s comments come as investors panic over a market meltdown triggered by President Trump’s economic policy, which relies heavily on tariffs that many analysts believe will trigger a global recession. On Monday, Trump reiterated his commitment to these punitive measures, telling his X followers to be “strong…and patient.” The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite— two widely watched indices that measure the health of the U.S. stock market—have cratered 10% over the past five days. Similarly, the cryptocurrency market, worth $2.59 trillion as of publication time, has lost 7% of its market value in the past week, according to CoinGecko data. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptos by market value, have plunged 4% and 13% over the same period, respectively. Meanwhile, major altcoins such as Solana and XRP are trading down 14% and 7%, respectively, over the past seven days. As stocks have slid, several major financial institutions ratcheted back their economic forecasts. Goldman Sachs upped its recession odds forecast by 10 percentage points to 45%, while JPMorgan put those odds at 60%, according to Reuters. Despite those bearish numbers, Fink told investors the market turbulence presented "more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity,” adding that the carnage did not pose systemic risks. Still, "that doesn't mean we can't fall another 20% from here too," Fink said.

Title: Farewell, Fugazy!
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4309527/posts
Time Published: 2025-04-07T20:55:36Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/07/2025 1:55:36 PM PDT by little jeremiah "Ah, the delicious smell of peak fear on Sunday/Monday...and max NOISE on X." —Raoul Pal That ruckus you hear in the capital markets is the sickening howl of the Fugazy Economy meeting its extinction. Fugazy means fake, unreal, dishonest, misaligned to what societies need to thrive. Fugazy means mis-using the time-value of things that purport to be wealth to multiply fake wealth in the hands of a few at the expense of the many. The pernicious effects of that system are visible all across the ruined landscape of our country, a nation of broken cities, failed towns, and a demoralized populace. Mr. Trump apparently aims to convert the expiring Fugazy economy into a production economy — yikes! — based on making things of value, and perhaps more importantly, of people at all social levels having meaningful roles in the making and moving of things. The Trump tariffs are the first big step in a process that is already generating a whole lot of friction, heat, and ferment. The aim of the tariffs is straightforward: the end of a trade regime that punishes and cripples American production. The response so far is heartening. Many other countries suddenly seek new trade arrangements with the USA, correctly sensing that Mr. Trump means bidness. (This ain’t no Mud Club. . . this ain’t no foolin’ around. . . .) It’s even possible that these readjustments will happen so swiftly that the tariff differentials will be a wash before summer, and everybody will be, at least, on a firm footing, knowing what the clear new rules say. This new disposition of things required forceful incentives to change entrenched, harmful practices. Another angle on this process is the dynamic known as import-replacement. It means exactly what it sounds like: where you used to get stuff from other lands, you now make it here. It should be obvious that this can’t be accomplished overnight. But the question is: okay, when are you going to start? Part of the answer is: we can’t afford to put it off any longer. There’s an awful lot of stuff, from machine tools to pharmaceuticals to military equipment that we had better start making again — or else slide into collapse, perhaps even slavery to other powers. That process starts with deploying real capital — as opposed to Fugazy capital — to re-start businesses and industries. That will take money away from hedge funds and other rackets that exist to play games with evermore abstract layers of things that only pretend to represent money. As that occurs, a lot of pretend money will vanish. Don’t be too shocked by this. That’s what happens when a society bends back toward reality: you start sorting out the real money from the fake money. That’s why the price of gold keeps marching up. I sense that Mr. Trump and his colleagues knew full-well that the tariff play would rattle the markets badly, that these “corrections” are an unavoidable consequence, and are better gotten-over as quickly as possible. What else would you expect in a system that has dedicated itself for decades to mis-pricing the value of just about everything? The snap-back is sure to be harsh. The psychopathocracy that drives the Global Left lost more traction last week in its quest to keep all of its old rackets running. Their foot-soldiers in the USA have been defunded effectively by Mr. Musk’s DOGE, starting with the immense network of rackets that were run around the USAID program. The Woke NGOs are no more and the fat paychecks are no longer going out to the nose-ring-for-lunch-bunch who came to infest the DC Beltway — and their satellite offices in Democratic Party controlled cities.

Here’s your poster-boy for that: the retarded slob rock-and-roller Neil Young, performing in support of the US Intel blob, the Covid-19 vaccine campaign, the degenerate Democratic party, Senator Adam Schiff, and BlackRock. Neil Young’s estimated net worth is about $200-million. He could lose ninety percent of that and still live a life of luxury. In 2022, he inveighed against Covid vaccine “misinformation” and promoted the shots. Guess, what? You were dead wrong about that, Neil, and now a lot of people are dead and dying because of those vaccines. He has many compadres in showbiz who took the same position against reality. The time is not far-off when they will be revealed as disgraceful tools — Public vaxx champions such as Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oprah Winfrey, Howard Stern, Ryan Reynolds, Lady Gaga. . . the list is long and discouraging. Meanwhile, they’re all out there rallying the Woke troops against the Golden Golem of Greatness as the Left’s leaky lifeboat goes down, gurgle, gurgle. In the process, they’ve destroyed Hollywood, rock and roll, and comedy. The country will recover from that, too. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to laugh at them in the years to come as the obituaries roll in. Meanwhile, brace and rejoice! Great changes are set in motion. Roll with the turbulence. You’ll come out the other end, stronger, wiser, steadier, perhaps even happier. And, mark ye, the silence emanating from the DOJ and the FBI these budding spring days.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson That ruckus you hear in the capital markets is the sickening howl of the Fugazy Economy meeting its extinction. Fugazy means fake, unreal, dishonest, misaligned to what societies need to thrive. Fugazy means mis-using the time-value of things that purport to be wealth to multiply fake wealth in the hands of a few at the expense of the many. The pernicious effects of that system are visible all across the ruined landscape of our country, a nation of broken cities, failed towns, and a demoralized populace. Mr. Trump apparently aims to convert the expiring Fugazy economy into a production economy — yikes! — based on making things of value, and perhaps more importantly, of people at all social levels having meaningful roles in the making and moving of things. The Trump tariffs are the first big step in a process that is already generating a whole lot of friction, heat, and ferment. The aim of the tariffs is straightforward: the end of a trade regime that punishes and cripples American production. The response so far is heartening. Many other countries suddenly seek new trade arrangements with the USA, correctly sensing that Mr. Trump means bidness. (This ain’t no Mud Club. . . this ain’t no foolin’ around. . . .) It’s even possible that these readjustments will happen so swiftly that the tariff differentials will be a wash before summer, and everybody will be, at least, on a firm footing, knowing what the clear new rules say. This new disposition of things required forceful incentives to change entrenched, harmful practices. Another angle on this process is the dynamic known as import-replacement. It means exactly what it sounds like: where you used to get stuff from other lands, you now make it here. It should be obvious that this can’t be accomplished overnight. But the question is: okay, when are you going to start? Part of the answer is: we can’t afford to put it off any longer. There’s an awful lot of stuff, from machine tools to pharmaceuticals to military equipment that we had better start making again — or else slide into collapse, perhaps even slavery to other powers. That process starts with deploying real capital — as opposed to Fugazy capital — to re-start businesses and industries. That will take money away from hedge funds and other rackets that exist to play games with evermore abstract layers of things that only pretend to represent money. As that occurs, a lot of pretend money will vanish. Don’t be too shocked by this. That’s what happens when a society bends back toward reality: you start sorting out the real money from the fake money. That’s why the price of gold keeps marching up. I sense that Mr. Trump and his colleagues knew full-well that the tariff play would rattle the markets badly, that these “corrections” are an unavoidable consequence, and are better gotten-over as quickly as possible. What else would you expect in a system that has dedicated itself for decades to mis-pricing the value of just about everything? The snap-back is sure to be harsh. The psychopathocracy that drives the Global Left lost more traction last week in its quest to keep all of its old rackets running. Their foot-soldiers in the USA have been defunded effectively by Mr. Musk’s DOGE, starting with the immense network of rackets that were run around the USAID program. The Woke NGOs are no more and the fat paychecks are no longer going out to the nose-ring-for-lunch-bunch who came to infest the DC Beltway — and their satellite offices in Democratic Party controlled cities. Hence, the feeble turn-outs in last weekend’s street actions. The Baby Boomers have gone especially psychotic. That’s why there are so many old folks waving those Soros-made placards in the astroturfed crowds of the “Hands-off” protests.

Many other countries suddenly seek new trade arrangements with the USA, correctly sensing that Mr. Trump means bidness. (This ain’t no Mud Club. . . this ain’t no foolin’ around. . . .) It’s even possible that these readjustments will happen so swiftly that the tariff differentials will be a wash before summer, and everybody will be, at least, on a firm footing, knowing what the clear new rules say. This new disposition of things required forceful incentives to change entrenched, harmful practices. Another angle on this process is the dynamic known as import-replacement. It means exactly what it sounds like: where you used to get stuff from other lands, you now make it here. It should be obvious that this can’t be accomplished overnight. But the question is: okay, when are you going to start? Part of the answer is: we can’t afford to put it off any longer. There’s an awful lot of stuff, from machine tools to pharmaceuticals to military equipment that we had better start making again — or else slide into collapse, perhaps even slavery to other powers. That process starts with deploying real capital — as opposed to Fugazy capital — to re-start businesses and industries. That will take money away from hedge funds and other rackets that exist to play games with evermore abstract layers of things that only pretend to represent money. As that occurs, a lot of pretend money will vanish. Don’t be too shocked by this. That’s what happens when a society bends back toward reality: you start sorting out the real money from the fake money. That’s why the price of gold keeps marching up. I sense that Mr. Trump and his colleagues knew full-well that the tariff play would rattle the markets badly, that these “corrections” are an unavoidable consequence, and are better gotten-over as quickly as possible. What else would you expect in a system that has dedicated itself for decades to mis-pricing the value of just about everything? The snap-back is sure to be harsh. The psychopathocracy that drives the Global Left lost more traction last week in its quest to keep all of its old rackets running. Their foot-soldiers in the USA have been defunded effectively by Mr. Musk’s DOGE, starting with the immense network of rackets that were run around the USAID program. The Woke NGOs are no more and the fat paychecks are no longer going out to the nose-ring-for-lunch-bunch who came to infest the DC Beltway — and their satellite offices in Democratic Party controlled cities. Hence, the feeble turn-outs in last weekend’s street actions. The Baby Boomers have gone especially psychotic. That’s why there are so many old folks waving those Soros-made placards in the astroturfed crowds of the “Hands-off” protests. After an eighty-year run of the most mind-blowing comfort and convenience enjoyed by any generation in world history, America’s Boomers stare into the abyss of their fading Fugazy fortunes as their stock portfolios tank. Kind of too bad. Maybe you shouldn’t have gone along for the ride. Maybe you should have cared for your country a bit more. Here’s your poster-boy for that: the retarded slob rock-and-roller Neil Young, performing in support of the US Intel blob, the Covid-19 vaccine campaign, the degenerate Democratic party, Senator Adam Schiff, and BlackRock. Neil Young’s estimated net worth is about $200-million. He could lose ninety percent of that and still live a life of luxury. In 2022, he inveighed against Covid vaccine “misinformation” and promoted the shots. Guess, what? You were dead wrong about that, Neil, and now a lot of people are dead and dying because of those vaccines. He has many compadres in showbiz who took the same position against reality. The time is not far-off when they will be revealed as disgraceful tools — Public vaxx champions such as Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oprah Winfrey, Howard Stern, Ryan Reynolds, Lady Gaga. . . the list is long and discouraging. Meanwhile, they’re all out there rallying the Woke troops against the Golden Golem of Greatness as the Left’s leaky lifeboat goes down, gurgle, gurgle. In the process, they’ve destroyed Hollywood, rock and roll, and comedy. The country will recover from that, too. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to laugh at them in the years to come as the obituaries roll in. Meanwhile, brace and rejoice! Great changes are set in motion. Roll with the turbulence. You’ll come out the other end, stronger, wiser, steadier, perhaps even happier. And, mark ye, the silence emanating from the DOJ and the FBI these budding spring days.

You were dead wrong about that, Neil, and now a lot of people are dead and dying because of those vaccines. He has many compadres in showbiz who took the same position against reality. The time is not far-off when they will be revealed as disgraceful tools — Public vaxx champions such as Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oprah Winfrey, Howard Stern, Ryan Reynolds, Lady Gaga. . . the list is long and discouraging. Meanwhile, they’re all out there rallying the Woke troops against the Golden Golem of Greatness as the Left’s leaky lifeboat goes down, gurgle, gurgle. In the process, they’ve destroyed Hollywood, rock and roll, and comedy. The country will recover from that, too. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to laugh at them in the years to come as the obituaries roll in. Meanwhile, brace and rejoice! Great changes are set in motion. Roll with the turbulence. You’ll come out the other end, stronger, wiser, steadier, perhaps even happier. And, mark ye, the silence emanating from the DOJ and the FBI these budding spring days. The New York Times is nervous as all git-out.

What else would you expect in a system that has dedicated itself for decades to mis-pricing the value of just about everything? The snap-back is sure to be harsh. The psychopathocracy that drives the Global Left lost more traction last week in its quest to keep all of its old rackets running. Their foot-soldiers in the USA have been defunded effectively by Mr. Musk’s DOGE, starting with the immense network of rackets that were run around the USAID program. The Woke NGOs are no more and the fat paychecks are no longer going out to the nose-ring-for-lunch-bunch who came to infest the DC Beltway — and their satellite offices in Democratic Party controlled cities. Hence, the feeble turn-outs in last weekend’s street actions. The Baby Boomers have gone especially psychotic. That’s why there are so many old folks waving those Soros-made placards in the astroturfed crowds of the “Hands-off” protests. After an eighty-year run of the most mind-blowing comfort and convenience enjoyed by any generation in world history, America’s Boomers stare into the abyss of their fading Fugazy fortunes as their stock portfolios tank. Kind of too bad. Maybe you shouldn’t have gone along for the ride. Maybe you should have cared for your country a bit more. Here’s your poster-boy for that: the retarded slob rock-and-roller Neil Young, performing in support of the US Intel blob, the Covid-19 vaccine campaign, the degenerate Democratic party, Senator Adam Schiff, and BlackRock.

Despite a relatively calm market and XRP trading within a descending triangle that has persisted for weeks amid bearish pressure, the token may be gearing up for a major breakout, according to popular crypto analyst Egrag Crypto. In a detailed analysis, Egrag predicted that XRP could surge to as high as $27 within the next six months if current technical patterns continue to play out, further suggesting a repeat of its 2017 bull run. “The Kangaroo will jump,” the pundit tweeted Sunday, referencing what he calls the current “Kangaroo Phase” or a period of consolidation before an expected breakout. Notably, the analyst highlighted striking similarities between the March 2025 candle formation and October 2017’s patterns, suggesting history may be preparing to repeat itself. “The monthly candle in November 2017 ranged before the explosive growth in December 2017 and January 2018. If this pattern holds true, and I’m right about the candle formations rhyming, double digits are on the horizon,” Egrag stated. Central to the prediction is XRP maintaining support above the $2 support area, which he described as “the safest foundation” and the trigger for the “FOMO stage and ignition phase.” The analyst further outlined three Fibonacci targets, including $7.50, $13.70, and ultimately $27.30, each aligning with Fibonacci expansion levels. “The next 3-6 months are crucial and decisive for many of us” Egrag concluded, emphasizing the critical timeframe for this potential price movement. This isn’t the first time EGRAG has voiced a bullish outlook on XRP. Last month, he referred to the price range between $2.00 and $3.40 as “noise,” indicating that the current consolidation phase reflects healthy price action rather than weakness. According to the analyst, as long as XRP stays within this range, the conditions remain favorable for a potential breakout, with targets reaching from $27 to as high as $222. However, analysts are facing a bit of uncertainty, as several factors, such as the U.S. announcing crypto holdings, the SEC’s comments on the Ripple case, the growing interest in RLUSD, rumors of a BlackRock ETF, and increasing XRP utility globally, haven’t been enough to sustain XRP’s bullish momentum. As a result, attention has shifted to the $2 support level, which is now being closely monitored. On Saturday,analyst AMcrypto underscored the importance of this level stating, “XRP is holding its $2 support level pretty well. It’s one of the few altcoins that didn’t drop below February’s capitulation price. For upside, it needs to break above the $2.30 level; otherwise, the consolidation will continue.” On-chain data from Santiment further supports the bullish sentiment, showing that over 70% of Binance traders holding open XRP futures positions are betting on a price increase. XRP traded at $2.06 at press time, reflecting a 3.10% drop in the past 24 hours.

Title: Analyst Explains Key Reasons Why Ethereum Could Revisit $1,000 This Cycle

Despite Ethereum (ETH) already suffering from bearish pressure and losing approximately 56% from its December 2024 high, Andrew Kang, partner at Mechanism Capital and former CFO at MicroStrategy, believes the decline may not be over. He predicts ETH could experience further significant losses and potentially revisit the $1,000-$1,500 range within the year. Revealing his sentiment on Sunday, Kang tweeted, “I haven’t paid close attention to crypto last few months but it seems high probability that ETH revisits $1000-1500 this year.” Notably, Kang’s assessment focuses on fundamentals, questioning the sustainability of Ethereum’s valuation given its current economics. “$215B market cap for a negative growth/profitability asset is ridiculous when it’s clear speculative winds have already blown past.” He added. This bearish outlook aligns with his consistent stance from last year when he compared Ethereum to Intel, suggesting the cryptocurrency had potentially already seen its peak. “Tell me how you pitch 200x PS, negative revenue growth, and negative profitability to investors at a $420B price,” he had challenged in a June 2024 post. At the time, he argued that while cryptocurrency enthusiasts might support such valuations, traditional finance institutions would be unlikely to invest heavily without improved economic indicators. The analyst has been notably accurate in previous predictions. When BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin spot ETF application in June 2023, Kang was vocally bullish on Bitcoin at around $25,000, which subsequently returned 2.6x, while Ethereum returned 2.1x during the same period. To date, the pundit remains skeptical about Ethereum ETFs providing a similar upside, stating they would need “a compelling pathway to improve its economics.” Kang’s bearish tone aligns with that of other market observers. On Sunday, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Ethereum has broken out of a multi-year triangle pattern, setting $1,150 as the next major target. Earlier, Martinez also noted a concerning trend: Whale accounts on the Ethereum network have declined by 10% since February, dropping from 999 to 896. Approximately 500,000 ETH were sold by large holders between Wednesday and Thursday, suggesting a continued price drop. That said, not all analysts share this bearish outlook. Crypto Bullet told his 168,000 followers on X that Ethereum recently hit its 300-week Moving Average, a level previously reached only during the June 2022 bear market bottom. He suggested this represents “a very important support level” that could trigger a “good mid-term bounce” with a target of $2,900-$3,200. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital observed that Ethereum’s market dominance has plummeted from 20% to 8% since June 2023 while noting that historically, Ethereum has reversed from similarly low levels to regain market dominance. AT press time, ETH was trading at $1,559, reflecting a 3.81% drop in the past 24 hours.

Title: Larry Fink says we are 'probably' in a recession, but don't sell your stocks just yet

The CEO of the world's largest asset manager was asked whether he thinks a recession is coming. Larry Fink's response: We're in it. Most CEOs the BlackRock chief has been talking to "would say we are probably in a recession right now," he said Monday in an interview at the Economic Club of New York. "One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine — canary in the coal mine — and I was told that the canary is sick already," he said, adding that travel demand had declined. Last week, President Donald Trump made a tariff announcement that prompted trillions of dollars in value to be wiped from the stock market. He has made no indication that he will reverse his plans despite investors' pain. Fink raised concerns about inflation if all the proposed tariffs were put into effect simultaneously. He said this would make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, adding that there was "zero chance" of multiple rate cuts. "I'm much more worried that elevated inflation — that's going to bring rates up," he said. While Fink said he believed the markets could still fall by another 20%, he suggested that the conditions were "more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity" in the long run as there are no systemic risks in the financial system. Longer term, Fink thinks Trump will focus on a growth agenda, like deregulation and tax cuts, he said: "The market is not focusing on these areas." Fink said the need to build up infrastructure in the US, especially for AI, is still a major investment theme that needs to play out. "If you spent time right now with the CEOs of the hyperscalers, Nvidia, and other players, they would say the need is just as great today as it was three months ago, and I believe some of the big macro trends are still in place," he said.

Title: Tariff Uncertainty Hurts Economy, Investors. History May Provide Clues
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2025/04/07/tariff-uncertainty-hurts-economy-investors-history-may-provide-clues/

ByMike Patton ByMike Patton, Senior Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 10: U.S. President Donald Trump takes a question from a reporter after ... More signing a series of executive orders including 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, a pardon for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, an order relating to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and an order for the federal government to stop using paper straws and begin using plastic straws in the Oval Office at the White House on February 10, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump has signed more than 50 executive orders as of Friday, the most in a president's first 100 days in more than 40 years. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Stocks around the world continue to slide on President Donald Trump’s nuclear tariff option. The recent actions from Washington have served to elevate uncertainty, raise global fear, push stock prices down, and increase animosity against America. Does Trump have a master plan? Is there a historical lesson we can use to help understand what may come? Today’s tariffs have caused many to reflect to 1930, when President Herbert Hoover signed into law the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. Although there are some differences between today’s tariff environment and the environment at that time, there are several similarities to consider. Here’s how the tariffs in 1930 unfolded. Senator Reed Smoot (R) and Representative Willis Hawley (R) were the two sponsors of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. The U.S. House passed its version in May 1929 by a vote of 264 to 147, with 244 republicans and 20 democrats voting in favor of the bill. The following March (1930), the Senate passed its own version of the tariff bill by a vote of 44 to 42, with 39 republicans and five democrats. After merging the two bills, it was sent to Hoover’s desk for signature. Interestingly, Hoover was not in favor of the bill having campaigned, in part, on international cooperation. Additionally, over 1,000 economists urged Hoover to veto the bill, along with Henry Ford, Thomas Lamont of JPMorgan, and other business leaders. Despite opposition, congressional Republicans pressured Hoover to sign, and it was reported that Hoovers cabinet threatened to resign if he didn’t. Ultimately, Hoover succumbed to the pressure and signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act on June 17, 1930. After signing, retaliatory tariffs began. These counter measures were imposed on the U.S. by Canada, Cuba, Mexico, France, Italy, Spain, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and Switzerland. Canada also strengthened its trade ties with Great Britain. Actions from our trading partners, coupled with Smoot Hawley, helped create a vicious trade war, which led to a 66% drop in global trade between 1929 and 1934. Most economists and business leaders believe the Smoot-Hawley bill prolonged the Great Depression and made it much worse. The economic fallout from the 1930 tariffs hurt Republicans for decades as Democrats retained complete control of Congress for approximately 52 of the next 64 years. This issue was also a major reason Franklin Delano Roosevelt defeated Hoover in the 1932 presidential election. As mentioned, there are differences today, compared to 1930. Today, our economy is strong. At that time, the Great Depression had been in place for several months, so the economy was weak. Even though our economy is strong, the data indicating this measures the period prior to Trump’s tariff announcement. Currently, most corporate CEOs believe the U.S. economy is weakening and some believe we are already in recession. Trump’s Rose Garden announcement last Wednesday stated that the new tariffs were reciprocal. He showed a chart with figures on what other countries were charging the U.S. and how we were only going to charge them about half of that. Now we learn Trump’s tariffs are not reciprocal at all. According to experts, the formula used to derive the new tariff figures has little to do with reciprocation. It has more to do with the trade deficit with specific nations. But there’s more. Peter Navarro, Trump’s senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, used Vietnam as an example. On CNBC Monday morning, Navarro said that even if Vietnam reduced its tariff on U.S. goods to zero, it would not be enough. He said it’s “non-tariff cheating that matters.” Navarro spoke about non-tariff barriers, including: 1) how much we buy compared to how much we sell to another country; 2) intellectual property theft; 3) the VAT tax; 4) currency manipulation, and a few other issues. Let’s look at some of these. The first item compares how much we buy from another country versus the amount they buy from us. Navarro referenced how for every $15 dollars in goods we buy from Vietnam, Vietnam only buys $1 from us. Trade deficits with other countries are only one of the factors built into the Trump tariff formula. Is this reasonable? The GDP of Vietnam is about $245.2 billion, similar in size to the economy of South Carolina ($246.3 billion). Vietnam is also much less wealthy than America. Should we expect that a small country with much less wealth, will buy the same amount of goods from us that we buy from them? Probably not. Especially since the need in America is far greater than that of Vietnam. Another item incorporated into the Trump tariff calculation involves the value added tax. A VAT tax is a tax imposed on goods and services. Think of it as a national consumption tax. In Europe, the VAT tax ranges from 17% in Luxembourg to 27% in Hungary. Each country sets its own VAT tax rate in accordance with EU regulations. Navarro cited the VAT tax as another non-tariff barrier. The problem is, to expect all of Europe to eliminate the VAT tax is asking the region to radically alter its revenue collection system. This would require a change to EU’s regulations. Since Navarro referenced the VAT tax several times and said non-tariff barriers were the most important issues, don’t look for Europe to cave on this anytime soon. Therefore, if these non-tariff barriers are the most important issue, and Trump will not relent until these issues are resolved, the current trade war could continue for quite some time. And, like republicans in the 1930s, this could come back to bite them if they’re not careful. How do stocks react to tariffs? Let’s go back to the Smoot-Hawley tariffs. When the depression began in 1929, stocks initially fell around 50%, then recovered about half their losses. After the Senate passed its tariff bill in March 1930, it was merged into the House version. Stocks peaked on Apr. 17, 1930, then began to fall to an ultimate bottom which was 89% lower than their peak in 1929. Today, stocks fell over 11.0% in the two days following the April 2 announcement. Despite only falling 11.0%, it could easily get worse if America fails to reach new deals with our trading partners. White House economic advisor Kevin Haslett, in an interview Monday morning, said Trump was considering a 90-day pause. The Dow Jones average rose 1,800 points in the next seven minutes on the news. Then Trump said that was “fake news” and stocks fell again. It’s impossible to know what to expect with such conflicting messages emerging from the White House. The biggest impediment to a thriving stock market is uncertainty. When corporations don’t know the rules, they sit on the sidelines until they do. Several companies are talking about layoffs. Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, believes the U.S. is already in recession. He said this sentiment is held by many CEOs he has spoken to. Are the tariffs a negotiating tactic or a longer term, revenue producer for the federal government? Both have been cited by the administration at various times, and both are at odds with each other. If the tariffs are a negotiating tactic, they will be short lived. In that case, it’s hard to see companies spending the time and money to build new facilities in the U.S. Why? Because it takes between three and five years from start to finish for a new plant to be up and running. If the tariffs remain for that long, the stock market and economy could experience significant pain. If the tariffs are designed to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and raise revenue, then negotiations today would be unnecessary. Trump has said the tariffs are both. Which is true? Perhaps no one knows, not even the president. The rules are changing daily. America has entered a period of great uncertainty with the economy teetering and stocks plummeting. Only time will tell if the outcome will be as the president has stated. In the meantime, all we can do is wait and see since no one really knows what’s going to happen.

It’s not so much smoke and mirrors as a herd mentality. There’s very little diversity in the algorithms, they all make similar buy/sell decisions based on the same inputs, using the same metrics, even a lot of the code is shared. Algorithms are lemmings, which is why there are circuit-breakers in the markets. “Yhe whole thing is smoke and mirrors...” I agree. The problem is, for a small potatoes guy like me, there aren’t a lot of options, (no pun intended). P THIS! You Bet! And BlackRock in in possession of the Keyboard. Buy low, sell high. No smoke. No mirrors. Dividend stocks pay to wait it out It doesn’t help that the market cap of the top 10 companies by market cap constitutes roughly 34% of the total stock market cap. Top 25 companies by market cap are roughly 50%. So there is going to be hard correlation between certain stocks and the overall indices. There are a lot of assumptions in your post ... The DOW, S&P 500, and NASDAQ have all pretty much mirrored each other for a very long time. Because the whole damn thing is FAKE AS HELL..earlier today it was up almost 1,000 points based on some BS rumor about Trump having a 90 day freeze on tariffs except China, then the second the White House said “Yeah thats total baloney” the stock went back down 800 points so what does that show, its all crooked phony nonsense I do not know the truth but it all looks fake to me.

Title: BlackRock’s Larry Fink says most CEOs he talks to think US is in a recession as markets roiled by Trump tariffs
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/04/07/business/larry-fink-says-most-ceos-he-talks-to-think-us-in-recession/

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said stock markets could extend their decline by 20% as the US imposes steep tariffs, citing worries across Wall Street that the economy is probably already in contraction. Fink joined a chorus of prominent voices in the business community raising concerns that the US economy may already be slipping into a recession — a downturn directly linked to President Trump’s controversial trade policies. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” Fink, who heads the world’s largest asset manager, stated bluntly during an event at the Economic Club of New York on Monday. He said recent stock market weakness was “more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity,” in the long run, and did not pose systemic risks. “That doesn’t mean we can’t fall another 20% from here too,” Fink said. Fink’s comments underscore growing alarm among top executives after Trump’s sweeping announcement of new tariffs last week triggered panic across global markets, sending the S&P 500 down 10% in just two trading sessions. The magnitude of the market reaction reflects widespread investor anxiety and confusion over the future direction of US trade policy. A recession is a period of significant decline in economic activity that lasts for more than a few months. It’s typically recognized by a drop in key indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), employment, consumer spending and business investment. While a common rule of thumb is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, economists and organizations like the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) look at a broader set of data to officially declare a recession. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. CNBC’s flash survey of chief executives in its CEO Council revealed the scale of corporate anxiety, with 69% of respondents forecasting an imminent recession and over half predicting the downturn will begin this year. While most anticipate the recession to be moderate or mild, their near-unanimous agreement is telling. One CEO described the downturn as “the Trump recession,” underscoring a sentiment echoed by many executives who blame current economic uncertainty squarely on presidential policy. The sudden escalation in trade tensions has also led JPMorgan Chase to increase its recession probability forecast for this year to 60%. JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, has openly expressed concerns about declining business confidence in the current climate. Billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman, a staunch ally of Trump, warned that the world is on the brink of “self-induced economic nuclear winter” as he begged the commander-in-chief to pause his sweeping tariffs. The uncertainty created by tariffs has placed corporate America in an uncomfortable position, with 46% of CEOs surveyed admitting the tariffs would negatively impact their businesses. Another 36% remain unsure, cautiously “war rooming” potential scenarios. “We imagine that our suppliers will have to swallow part of the tariff, and we will have to pass on part of the tariff to our customers,” explained one CEO. “We are controlling what we can control, pricing and sourcing decisions. We can’t control the impact of tariffs on the consumer mindset, which we imagine could be significant.” Almost all executives from companies selling goods and services expect price increases of between 5% to 20%, with 82% preparing for a resurgence in inflation. CEOs warn these price hikes could dampen consumer spending — particularly among the vital 40-to-60-year-old demographic, whose spending power has been bolstered in recent years by stock market gains. The threat extends globally, as executives fear rising anti-American sentiment. One CEO whose company generates nearly half of its revenue overseas told CNBC: “The biggest issue I worry about is boycotts of American brands and anti-American sentiment. There is real backlash happening.” Another executive cautioned of “real potential for boycott of American goods,” warning it could trigger job cuts and stagflation. Trump and his administration continue to defend their aggressive stance, asserting that reshoring manufacturing to the US will ultimately offset short-term economic pain. But CEOs surveyed largely disagree: 45% believe reshoring will take a minimum of two years, if not longer. The White House remains unmoved, with Trump declaring: “Sometimes you have to take medicine.” The administration has also reiterated its goal of reducing America’s significant trade deficit with China. Despite these assurances, most executives strongly disagree that tariffs will lead to long-term economic gains — only a quarter expressed even mild agreement with Trump’s strategy. Ultimately, as former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard remarked, uncertainty itself may exacerbate economic downturn: “Who wants to invest when you don’t know what the rules are going to be?” One CEO summed up corporate sentiment succinctly: “All of the uncertainty with how it’s being handled will harm our business and limit investment until this is all concluded.” Advertisement

Title: Stagflation is America's most 'optimistic scenario' at this point, former Fed president says

Once painted as a worse-than-recession scenario, stagflation might now be the best that Americans can hope for with the trade war about to be in full swing. Bill Dudley, former president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, says only one question remains: how bad will the damage be? Whereas a "Goldilocks economy" seemed alive and well at the start of this year, tariff policy has flipped the economic outlook in a matter of days. Writing in a Bloomberg opinion piece, Dudley said he expects devastating consequences from the White House's across-the-board tariffs. As dwindling demand derails US growth, 5% inflation is likely in the next six months, he said. Dudley added that a slowdown will occur even if Congress is able to implement tax cuts, "because there will be a considerable lag, and because low-to-moderate-income families, which tend to spend more of their income, will be hurt by tariffs more than helped by tax relief." Rising inflation in a cooling economy is the basis for stagflation. The scenario has no clear solution, making it a paralyzing situation for central banks. If central bankers raise interest rates to clamp down on inflation, they restrict economic growth. Cutting rates, meanwhile, could cause prices to spiral higher again. "All told, stagflation is the optimistic scenario. More likely, the US will end up in a full-blown recession accompanied by higher inflation," Dudley estimates. It's bound to be a no-win situation for stocks, he added. Since President Donald Trump announced the tariffs on Wednesday, indexes have tanked into bear market territory. "If companies pass along the cost of higher imports to consumers, inflation will be more persistent and the Fed less friendly. If they can't, profit margins will shrink and earnings will underwhelm. Not to mention the risk of foreign tariff retaliation." Of course, the Federal Reserve can hope the tariff inflation bump is temporary, an idea investors seem to agree with. Traders see the central cutting interest rates by 100 basis points through December, implying that growth will be the Fed's main concern. Dudley sees it differently. If Fed officials allow US inflation to remain above the 2% target rate — as has been the case for five years — it could amplify inflation expectations. Meanwhile, a tariff-induced productivity shock will historically impact inflation for longer, forcing the Fed to raise rates down the road. Others have taken the same stance. Rockefeller International Chair Ruchir Sharma warned that if the Fed chooses to stimulate growth with rate cuts, it would harm its reputation as a bulwark against inflation. "After missing its target for many years, it would be a mistake for the Fed to dismiss the inflation fallout from tariffs as transitory and revert once again to stimulating the economy," he wrote for the Financial Times. Not only might investors be wrong in expecting large-scale rate cuts this year, but one Wall Street heavy hitter warned that the Fed might tighten policy, instead. "This notion that the Federal Reserve is going to ease four times this year, I see zero chance of that. I'm much more worried that we could have elevated inflation that's going to bring rates up much higher than they are today," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Monday. Jump to

As recession fears grow, the CEO of the world’s largest asset manager thinks one is already here — and he says he’s not alone. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” BlackRock (BLK-1.52%) CEO Larry Fink said at an event for the Economic Club of New York on Monday, in remarks reported by CNBC. Fink referred to the airline industry as a “canary in the coal mine.” “I was told that the canary is sick already,” he said. Fink added that he thinks President Donald Trump’s tariff policies could make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as it usually does during recessions, which could exacerbate inflation. “This notion that the Federal Reserve is going to ease four times this year, I see zero chance of that,” he said, according to CNBC (CMCSA-2.70%). “I’m much more worried that we could have elevated inflation that’s going to bring rates up much higher than they are today.” BlackRock has more than $11 trillion in assets under management across private and public investments. The S&P 500 is down 12.1% since March 7, while the Nasdaq Composite is down 14.1% during that same span. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Further 20% Market Drop Is Possible

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the market could see another 20% drop, but that the current drawdown is a buying opportunity in the long term as the current situation doesn’t pose systematic risk. “I see it more as a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity, but that doesn’t mean we can’t go down further,” Fink said during an appearance at the Economic Club of New York on Monday. He noted that inflationary pressure is higher than market participants expect and that many already believe the U.S. to be in a recession. As a result, he does not anticipate the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. Last month, Fink published a letter to shareholders, warning about Bitcoin’s (BTC) threat to the U.S. dollar, which could weaken if Americans believe the cryptocurrency to be a safer asset than the dollar. Markets, including the crypto market, have been in turmoil since U.S. President Donald Trump announced a host of tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. BTC is currently trading 5% lower over the past five days and 11% lower in the past month. Stocks were hit even worse with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down 13% and 15%, respectively.
