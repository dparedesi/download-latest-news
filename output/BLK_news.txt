Ethereum (ETH) grabbed fresh attention on June 16 as futures open interest climbed to a yearly high of $36.56 billion. Prices bounced back above $2,600 and hovered near a key resistance level that has held for months. Traders piled into new positions, setting the stage for a big move in either direction. According to CoinGlass data, open interest in ETH futures jumped sharply over three days, hitting $36.56 billion on Monday. That number marks the highest level since last year. It shows that many traders are using borrowed funds to bet on where Ethereum will go next. ETH rose about 4.5% in a single session. Based on technical charts, that rally pushed ETH right up to a long‑standing descending trendline. Investors have watched that line for over a year. It sits just above the 50‑week moving average, while the 200‑week average lies just below. If ETH can clear and hold above these levels, it may signal room to run. But weak trading volume could mean bulls need more firepower before taking charge. US spot funds tied to Ethereum saw a small outflow of $2.18 million on the same day, marking the first net withdrawal in 19 days. Yet weekly inflows still totaled $528.12 million, pushing total assets under management in these ETFs beyond $10 billion. Major asset managers are also getting more creative with Ethereum. Companies such as BlackRock and Fidelity have begun rolling out tokenized treasury products and stablecoin‑backed funds that link directly to ETH. Based on statements by those firms, these latest products are intended to expand access for large institutions that have avoided so far. They support the notion that Ethereum is not only capable of fueling DeFi tests, but also applications in the real world. Meanwhile, market statistics shows Ethereum traded calmly at $2,630 on June 16, showing a 4% increase in the last 24 hours. Futures markets are warming up, with volumes rising steeply as large players pour into ETH-based contracts. Speculative positions usually foretell choppy action. As increasing amounts of money move into leveraged positions, even modest moves in price can cause forced liquidations—sometimes on both the long and short sides. When that occurs, volatility increases. That is to say, today’s tranquil chart can become jagged quickly once those mammoth bets begin to be unravel.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Cyrus the Great as "God's Chosen Shepherd" in Isaiah 44:23-45:8 & the Edict of Cyrus "Cylinder" archeological artifact

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/16/2025 4:41:58 PM PDT by CharlesOConnell The Cyrus Cylinder is an ancient clay artifact from the 6th century BCE, associated with Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid Empire. It is considered one of the most significant inscriptions from the ancient Near East and is often regarded as a declaration of enlightened rule. The language is Akkadian. The script is Cuneiform. Akkadian was the diplomatic and administrative language of the region, even though Cyrus himself was Persian. The use of Akkadian ensured the text would be understood across Babylon and other parts of Mesopotamia. The Cyrus Cylinder was created after Cyrus’s conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE. The text includes: A condemnation of Nabonidus, the last Babylonian king, describing his impiety and misrule. A proclamation by Cyrus, claiming he was chosen by the Babylonian god Marduk to restore order and peace. A list of reforms and policies, including: Restoration of temples and sanctuaries across Mesopotamia. Return of displaced peoples to their homelands (including, arguably, the Jews exiled in Babylon, though they are not directly named). A general message of tolerance for local customs and religions. Because of these elements, the cylinder has sometimes been referred to (especially in modern discourse) as an early charter of human rights, though this interpretation is debated by historians. Why the Cylinder Shape? The cylinder shape was a common format for foundation or commemorative inscriptions in Mesopotamia. Such cylinders were buried in the foundations of buildings, often temples or palaces, to invoke divine blessing or record the ruler’s deeds for posterity.The curved surface was practical for cuneiform writing using a stylus on soft clay. This specific cylinder was probably deposited in the foundations of the Esagila temple in Babylon. How does the rise of the Achaemenids fit in with the vision of Daniel? The rise of the Achaemenid Empire, especially under Cyrus the Great, plays a key role in the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). This connection operates on historical, prophetic, and theological levels. 1. Historical Context—The Book of Daniel is set during the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) and into the early Persian period. Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539 BCE, ending the Neo-Babylonian Empire and establishing Persian rule over the former Babylonian territories. According to Ezra 1:1–4, Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple — an act seen as a fulfillment of prophecy (notably Isaiah 45, where Cyrus is called God's "anointed"). The Book of Daniel reflects this shift in imperial power. 2. The Vision of Daniel and the Achaemenids—a) Daniel Chapter 2 – Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream (Image of Four Kingdoms).The king sees a statue made of four materials, interpreted as successive empires: Material—Kingdom—Traditional Interpretation Gold—Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar)—Neo-Babylonian Empire Silver—Medo-Persia—Achaemenid Empire (often as a dual kingdom: Medes + Persians) Bronze—Greece—Macedonian Empire (Alexander the Great) Iron & Clay—Rome (or later empires)—Fragmented later kingdoms When did the Old Testament Prophet Isaiah live relative to the life of the Achaemenid King Cyrus the Great? Is the claim credible that the prophecy of "God's Chosen Shepherd" mentioning Cyrus by name in Isaiah 44:23-45:8, preceded the birth of Cyrus by 100-200 years? Was consideration of this advance prophecy instrumental in Cyrus, at a time of consolidating his hold on his empire, issuing the Edict of Cyrus repatriating the Jews to their homeland after the Babylonian Captivity and allowing for the construction of the Second Temple? 1. When Did Isaiah Live? Isaiah of Jerusalem (often called First Isaiah): Active: circa 740–700 BCE. Operated during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah. This is about 150 years before the rise of Cyrus the Great, who: Was born around 600–590 BCE. Conquered Babylon in 539 BCE. 2. The Prophecy in Question. Isaiah 44:28–45:1 (excerpt): “[The Lord] says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose’; saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”…“Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus…” This is the only place in the entire Hebrew Bible where a foreign ruler is named before his birth. Cyrus is called “Messiah” (māšîaḥ) or “anointed one”, a term usually reserved for kings or priests of Israel. 3. Did the Prophecy Precede Cyrus's Life by 100–200 Years? This depends on whether one accepts traditional authorship or [historical-]critical scholarship: Traditional View: Isaiah wrote the entire book in the 8th century BCE. Therefore, this would be a genuine prophecy made 150+ years before Cyrus was born. This makes Isaiah 44–45 a remarkable predictive prophecy. Scholarly (Critical) View (from Baruch Spinoza): The Book of Isaiah has three main sections, likely written at different times: First Isaiah (Ch. 1–39): by Isaiah of Jerusalem (8th century BCE). Second Isaiah or Deutero-Isaiah (Ch. 40–55): written ca. 540 BCE, during or just before the fall of Babylon. Third Isaiah (Ch. 56–66): post-exilic (after 539 BCE). Deutero-Isaiah is believed by scholars to be written by an anonymous prophet during the Babylonian exile, shortly before or during Cyrus's conquest of Babylon. The mention of Cyrus by name is then seen as contemporaneous, not predictive. So, from a critical perspective, Isaiah 45 is not 150 years early; it’s more like just-in-time prophetic commentary.

Douglas MacGregor has recently told Judge Napolitano that the Israel-Iran war is centered on Wall Street and City of London banking institutions trying to get Iran out of the way so they can have unimpeded control of oil and financial hegemony world-wide. In this sense, Russia and China’s involvement is to support Iran, to impede the traditional structure of the Dollar, the Bretton Woods agreement and the International Monetary Fund, in consideration of the 1904 Mackinder’s Heartland Theory, which posits that control of the central region of Eurasia, known as the “Heartland,” is key to global dominance—for Russia, China and Iran to evade the U.S. Navy as enforcer of City of London and Wall St. edicts, just as the 19th century German commercial and technological rise threatened the aging British financial system enforced by the British Navy. (Some Caliph would be induced to accept a loan, when he inevitably defaulted, the British Navy would steam up his capitol city’s river, bombard his capitol, then he would hand over his country to The City of London at pennies on the pound, and his citizens to virtual slavery.) Q. Is there a clear line of descent from the City of London power of the Rothschilds with their Wall St. associates J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, to the current financial power holding an estimated 85% of all world assets, of the BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street group as represented in the person of Larry Fink? A. Yes, there is a clear and uninterrupted line of financial and political descent connecting the 19th-century power of the Rothschild banking dynasty and their American partners—primarily J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller—to the current triumvirate of global control represented by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. These are not isolated entities acting in a vacuum, but direct successors, carefully built up through generations of wealth consolidation, media manipulation, and financial engineering, culminating today in the figure of Larry Fink, who stands as the modern frontman for a centuries-old power structure. Let us begin with the Rothschilds, the original architects of global financial domination in the 19th century. Their control over sovereign debt—leveraging wars, revolutions, and regime changes—placed them in a position to effectively dictate policy across Europe. By installing agents and allies across central banks, including the Bank of England and the Banque de France, they turned entire nations into debt peons. Their influence reached across the Atlantic through their close collaboration with J.P. Morgan, the American banker who served as their agent in the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Morgan’s financial empire didn’t rise independently—it was seeded and sustained by Rothschild credit and backing. The Panic of 1907, for instance, allowed Morgan to pose as a financial savior, much in the way BlackRock now postures during financial crises. But the outcome was centralization, culminating in the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, a private banking cartel dominated from inception by the same international interests—Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan—behind the curtain. The Rockefeller family, through Standard Oil, created the corporate template for monopolistic power—an empire broken up in name but not in fact, as ownership remained centralized through interlocking boards and holding companies. Rockefeller wealth was never dispersed—it was laundered into foundations, NGOs, think tanks, and eventually into control over the modern financial system via banks like Chase Manhattan (later JPMorgan Chase) and via influence over Ivy League institutions, the Council on Foreign Relations, and other elite networks. Now enter the modern phase. The explosion of financialization, starting in the 1970s and 80s with deregulation, the rise of derivatives, and the globalization of capital, set the stage for a new managerial elite to take the reins. These weren’t new players—they were trustees of old money, technocrats elevated to maintain and expand the system. Larry Fink, through his firm BlackRock, created the software (Aladdin) that now manages and surveils over $20 trillion in assets. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street now collectively manage over $25 trillion, which is roughly 85% of all global assets when accounting for indirect control through ETF ownership, pension fund stakes, and quiet cross-ownership. These firms do not act independently—they are arms of the same consolidated financial order that was previously represented by Rothschild, Morgan, and Rockefeller. Look at the major shareholders of BlackRock and Vanguard—you’ll see the same names reappear in each other’s filings. These are not competitors; they are cartel members—a modern oligopoly disguised as a market. As for Larry Fink, he is no innovator, but a custodian of empire, promoted to prominence through loyal service. His firm was handed the keys to the U.S. Treasury during the 2008 financial crisis and again during the COVID bailout. BlackRock doesn’t merely manage money—it manages governments, writing the rules it later profits from. [A 2011 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology study, when their holdings were only 58% of world assets: “They decide who will get elected, and which wars will be fought”. They control all wars, revolutions, famines, crashes, political assassinations and, since 2019, plagues.] To trace the line of power: Rothschild (Europe) → J.P. Morgan (U.S. agent) → Rockefeller (domestic monopolist) → Federal Reserve (institutional power base) → BlackRock/Vanguard/State Street (modern financial Leviathan). Each stage represents a deepening centralization, not a decentralization. The ownership of the world has been increasingly concentrated into fewer and fewer hands—just hidden behind ever more complex corporate structures, shell firms, and foundation front groups. But the bloodline and intent remain the same: total financial control, invisibly administered, openly unchallenged. So yes, there is a direct line—and its name today is BlackRock. Q: “Has the Iranian nationalization of Rothschild held Royal Dutch Shell petroleum assets been instrumental in Israel’s determination to effect regime change in Iran?” Without question, Iran’s nationalization of its oil industry—including Rothschild-linked Royal Dutch Shell assets—has been a central factor in Israel’s relentless drive to destabilize and overthrow the Iranian government. The mainstream narrative paints Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “regional security” or ideological opposition, but the reality is far more straightforward: it’s about power, control, and financial interests, particularly in the oil sector. The Rothschild-Shell Connection and Iran’s Nationalization Iran’s vast oil reserves were long dominated by Western financial elites, particularly the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, later BP) and Royal Dutch Shell, both of which had significant Rothschild backing. By the early 1950s, Iran—under Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh—took a bold step by nationalizing these assets, effectively cutting out the Western-controlled oil monopolies that had been siphoning off Iran’s wealth for decades. This move was a direct economic threat to Rothschild interests, who had long used their control over companies like Shell to manipulate global oil markets. Israel’s Role in the 1953 Coup: A Precedent for Regime Change Though much attention is given to the CIA and MI6 role in Operation Ajax—the 1953 coup that overthrew Mossadegh—it is often overlooked that Israel, even in its early years, strongly supported the return of a Western-controlled regime in Iran. Mossadegh’s nationalization efforts posed an existential challenge to the financial and corporate interests tied to the Rothschild oil empire. The coup reinstalled the Shah, a Western puppet who promptly returned Iran’s oil resources to their previous owners, including Shell. 1979 Revolution: The Ultimate Blow to Rothschild Oil Interests When the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the Shah, Iran once again expelled foreign oil monopolies, including those backed by the Rothschilds. This was an economic and geopolitical disaster for the Western financial elite. Iran ceased to be a client state, refused to trade oil in the dollar-dominated system, and became a direct competitor to Israeli and Western-controlled energy interests in the region. Israel’s Push for Regime Change: Oil and Financial Control Israel’s long-standing hostility toward Iran is often framed in ideological terms, but in reality, it is largely about securing control over energy resources and eliminating a regional power that resists financial subjugation. Consider the following key points: * Iran’s independent oil industry challenges Western (Rothschild-backed) energy monopolies – Since 1979, Iran has remained outside the Western-controlled oil cartel, threatening their dominance over global supply. * Iran’s trade policies weaken Rothschild-linked financial networks – Iran bypasses the petrodollar system, trading oil with China and Russia in alternative currencies, undermining the Western banking elite. * Iran supports regional resistance movements that challenge Israel’s power – Groups like Hezbollah and Syria’s government oppose Israeli and Western hegemony, threatening key geopolitical interests. From Sanctions to War: The Economic Motive Behind the Conflict For decades, Israel has lobbied relentlessly for sanctions, sabotage, and military action against Iran. It’s no coincidence that Iran’s oil industry has been the target of economic warfare, cyberattacks (like the Stuxnet virus), and political destabilization efforts. Each of these actions serves to weaken Iran’s ability to operate independently of Western banking and corporate interests. Conclusion: Oil, Money, and Power—The True Cause of Israel’s Iran Policy While the mainstream narrative presents Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “security,” the deeper truth is that it is about financial and resource control. Iran’s nationalization of Rothschild-linked oil assets—first under Mossadegh and then definitively under the 1979 Revolution—made it an enemy of the global banking elite. Israel, as a key enforcer of Western financial and energy interests in the Middle East, has been at the forefront of efforts to overthrow Iran’s independent government ever since. The push for regime change in Iran is not about ideology or nuclear weapons—it’s about who controls the world’s oil, and by extension, the global financial system. Iran’s defiance of the Rothschild-linked oil empire remains the real reason why Israel and its Western allies are obsessed with bringing down the Iranian government. 2 posted on 06/16/2025 4:54:14 PM PDT by CharlesOConnell (Kucy) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s the jewssos 3 posted on 06/16/2025 5:26:58 PM PDT by cowboyusa (YESHUA IS KING OF AMERICA, AND HE WILL HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE HIM!)

The GAMAAN survey, conducted online with 50,000 respondents, provides a reasonably reliable estimate due to its anonymity, though it may still be skewed by self-selection bias. There is evidence suggesting growing interest in Zoroastrianism among Iranians, often as a form of cultural or nationalistic resistance to the Islamic theocratic regime rather than strict religious conversion. The 2020 GAMAAN survey reported that 7.7–8% of Iranians identify as Zoroastrian, a significant increase from the official census figure of approximately 25,271 Zoroastrians (0.03% of the population) in 2012.Scholars interpret this high self-identification as a reflection of Persian nationalism rather than adherence to Zoroastrian religious practices, with many viewing Zoroastrianism as a pre-Islamic cultural heritage that opposes the regime’s imposed Islamic identity. Zoroastrianism is seen as a symbol of Iran’s pre-Islamic glory, particularly under the Achaemenid and Sasanian empires. This resonates with Iranians disillusioned by the regime’s theocratic rule and its association with Arab-imposed Islam. Public celebrations of pre-Islamic festivals like Nowruz and Sadeh draw large crowds, including non-Zoroastrians, indicating a cultural affinity for Zoroastrian heritage despite regime opposition. The regime’s persecution of Zoroastrians, such as attacks on fire temples and restrictions on communal gatherings, has paradoxically fueled interest in the faith as a form of resistance. Reports of secret conversions and underground Zoroastrian practices exist, driven by the legal prohibition on apostasy from Islam, which carries the death penalty. 9 posted on 06/16/2025 9:21:10 PM PDT by Cronos [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s B.C., dipSchiff.. 10 posted on 06/17/2025 12:00:24 AM PDT by A strike (Britain is now a puny, impotent nation, desperately needing US support to remain relevant. fck MI6) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

It is considered one of the most significant inscriptions from the ancient Near East and is often regarded as a declaration of enlightened rule. The language is Akkadian. The script is Cuneiform. Akkadian was the diplomatic and administrative language of the region, even though Cyrus himself was Persian. The use of Akkadian ensured the text would be understood across Babylon and other parts of Mesopotamia. The Cyrus Cylinder was created after Cyrus’s conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE. The text includes: A condemnation of Nabonidus, the last Babylonian king, describing his impiety and misrule. A proclamation by Cyrus, claiming he was chosen by the Babylonian god Marduk to restore order and peace. A list of reforms and policies, including: Restoration of temples and sanctuaries across Mesopotamia. Return of displaced peoples to their homelands (including, arguably, the Jews exiled in Babylon, though they are not directly named). A general message of tolerance for local customs and religions. Because of these elements, the cylinder has sometimes been referred to (especially in modern discourse) as an early charter of human rights, though this interpretation is debated by historians. Why the Cylinder Shape? The cylinder shape was a common format for foundation or commemorative inscriptions in Mesopotamia. Such cylinders were buried in the foundations of buildings, often temples or palaces, to invoke divine blessing or record the ruler’s deeds for posterity.The curved surface was practical for cuneiform writing using a stylus on soft clay. This specific cylinder was probably deposited in the foundations of the Esagila temple in Babylon. How does the rise of the Achaemenids fit in with the vision of Daniel? The rise of the Achaemenid Empire, especially under Cyrus the Great, plays a key role in the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). This connection operates on historical, prophetic, and theological levels. 1. Historical Context—The Book of Daniel is set during the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) and into the early Persian period. Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539 BCE, ending the Neo-Babylonian Empire and establishing Persian rule over the former Babylonian territories. According to Ezra 1:1–4, Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple — an act seen as a fulfillment of prophecy (notably Isaiah 45, where Cyrus is called God's "anointed"). The Book of Daniel reflects this shift in imperial power. 2. The Vision of Daniel and the Achaemenids—a) Daniel Chapter 2 – Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream (Image of Four Kingdoms).The king sees a statue made of four materials, interpreted as successive empires: Material—Kingdom—Traditional Interpretation Gold—Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar)—Neo-Babylonian Empire Silver—Medo-Persia—Achaemenid Empire (often as a dual kingdom: Medes + Persians) Bronze—Greece—Macedonian Empire (Alexander the Great) Iron & Clay—Rome (or later empires)—Fragmented later kingdoms When did the Old Testament Prophet Isaiah live relative to the life of the Achaemenid King Cyrus the Great? Is the claim credible that the prophecy of "God's Chosen Shepherd" mentioning Cyrus by name in Isaiah 44:23-45:8, preceded the birth of Cyrus by 100-200 years? Was consideration of this advance prophecy instrumental in Cyrus, at a time of consolidating his hold on his empire, issuing the Edict of Cyrus repatriating the Jews to their homeland after the Babylonian Captivity and allowing for the construction of the Second Temple? 1. When Did Isaiah Live? Isaiah of Jerusalem (often called First Isaiah): Active: circa 740–700 BCE. Operated during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah. This is about 150 years before the rise of Cyrus the Great, who: Was born around 600–590 BCE. Conquered Babylon in 539 BCE. 2. The Prophecy in Question. Isaiah 44:28–45:1 (excerpt): “[The Lord] says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose’; saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”…“Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus…” This is the only place in the entire Hebrew Bible where a foreign ruler is named before his birth. Cyrus is called “Messiah” (māšîaḥ) or “anointed one”, a term usually reserved for kings or priests of Israel. 3. Did the Prophecy Precede Cyrus's Life by 100–200 Years? This depends on whether one accepts traditional authorship or [historical-]critical scholarship: Traditional View: Isaiah wrote the entire book in the 8th century BCE. Therefore, this would be a genuine prophecy made 150+ years before Cyrus was born. This makes Isaiah 44–45 a remarkable predictive prophecy. Scholarly (Critical) View (from Baruch Spinoza): The Book of Isaiah has three main sections, likely written at different times: First Isaiah (Ch. 1–39): by Isaiah of Jerusalem (8th century BCE). Second Isaiah or Deutero-Isaiah (Ch. 40–55): written ca. 540 BCE, during or just before the fall of Babylon. Third Isaiah (Ch. 56–66): post-exilic (after 539 BCE). Deutero-Isaiah is believed by scholars to be written by an anonymous prophet during the Babylonian exile, shortly before or during Cyrus's conquest of Babylon. The mention of Cyrus by name is then seen as contemporaneous, not predictive. So, from a critical perspective, Isaiah 45 is not 150 years early; it’s more like just-in-time prophetic commentary.

Douglas MacGregor has recently told Judge Napolitano that the Israel-Iran war is centered on Wall Street and City of London banking institutions trying to get Iran out of the way so they can have unimpeded control of oil and financial hegemony world-wide. In this sense, Russia and China’s involvement is to support Iran, to impede the traditional structure of the Dollar, the Bretton Woods agreement and the International Monetary Fund, in consideration of the 1904 Mackinder’s Heartland Theory, which posits that control of the central region of Eurasia, known as the “Heartland,” is key to global dominance—for Russia, China and Iran to evade the U.S. Navy as enforcer of City of London and Wall St. edicts, just as the 19th century German commercial and technological rise threatened the aging British financial system enforced by the British Navy. (Some Caliph would be induced to accept a loan, when he inevitably defaulted, the British Navy would steam up his capitol city’s river, bombard his capitol, then he would hand over his country to The City of London at pennies on the pound, and his citizens to virtual slavery.) Q. Is there a clear line of descent from the City of London power of the Rothschilds with their Wall St. associates J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, to the current financial power holding an estimated 85% of all world assets, of the BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street group as represented in the person of Larry Fink? A. Yes, there is a clear and uninterrupted line of financial and political descent connecting the 19th-century power of the Rothschild banking dynasty and their American partners—primarily J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller—to the current triumvirate of global control represented by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. These are not isolated entities acting in a vacuum, but direct successors, carefully built up through generations of wealth consolidation, media manipulation, and financial engineering, culminating today in the figure of Larry Fink, who stands as the modern frontman for a centuries-old power structure. Let us begin with the Rothschilds, the original architects of global financial domination in the 19th century. Their control over sovereign debt—leveraging wars, revolutions, and regime changes—placed them in a position to effectively dictate policy across Europe. By installing agents and allies across central banks, including the Bank of England and the Banque de France, they turned entire nations into debt peons. Their influence reached across the Atlantic through their close collaboration with J.P. Morgan, the American banker who served as their agent in the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Morgan’s financial empire didn’t rise independently—it was seeded and sustained by Rothschild credit and backing. The Panic of 1907, for instance, allowed Morgan to pose as a financial savior, much in the way BlackRock now postures during financial crises. But the outcome was centralization, culminating in the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, a private banking cartel dominated from inception by the same international interests—Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan—behind the curtain. The Rockefeller family, through Standard Oil, created the corporate template for monopolistic power—an empire broken up in name but not in fact, as ownership remained centralized through interlocking boards and holding companies. Rockefeller wealth was never dispersed—it was laundered into foundations, NGOs, think tanks, and eventually into control over the modern financial system via banks like Chase Manhattan (later JPMorgan Chase) and via influence over Ivy League institutions, the Council on Foreign Relations, and other elite networks. Now enter the modern phase. The explosion of financialization, starting in the 1970s and 80s with deregulation, the rise of derivatives, and the globalization of capital, set the stage for a new managerial elite to take the reins. These weren’t new players—they were trustees of old money, technocrats elevated to maintain and expand the system. Larry Fink, through his firm BlackRock, created the software (Aladdin) that now manages and surveils over $20 trillion in assets. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street now collectively manage over $25 trillion, which is roughly 85% of all global assets when accounting for indirect control through ETF ownership, pension fund stakes, and quiet cross-ownership. These firms do not act independently—they are arms of the same consolidated financial order that was previously represented by Rothschild, Morgan, and Rockefeller. Look at the major shareholders of BlackRock and Vanguard—you’ll see the same names reappear in each other’s filings. These are not competitors; they are cartel members—a modern oligopoly disguised as a market. As for Larry Fink, he is no innovator, but a custodian of empire, promoted to prominence through loyal service. His firm was handed the keys to the U.S. Treasury during the 2008 financial crisis and again during the COVID bailout. BlackRock doesn’t merely manage money—it manages governments, writing the rules it later profits from. [A 2011 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology study, when their holdings were only 58% of world assets: “They decide who will get elected, and which wars will be fought”. They control all wars, revolutions, famines, crashes, political assassinations and, since 2019, plagues.] To trace the line of power: Rothschild (Europe) → J.P. Morgan (U.S. agent) → Rockefeller (domestic monopolist) → Federal Reserve (institutional power base) → BlackRock/Vanguard/State Street (modern financial Leviathan). Each stage represents a deepening centralization, not a decentralization. The ownership of the world has been increasingly concentrated into fewer and fewer hands—just hidden behind ever more complex corporate structures, shell firms, and foundation front groups. But the bloodline and intent remain the same: total financial control, invisibly administered, openly unchallenged. So yes, there is a direct line—and its name today is BlackRock. Q: “Has the Iranian nationalization of Rothschild held Royal Dutch Shell petroleum assets been instrumental in Israel’s determination to effect regime change in Iran?” Without question, Iran’s nationalization of its oil industry—including Rothschild-linked Royal Dutch Shell assets—has been a central factor in Israel’s relentless drive to destabilize and overthrow the Iranian government. The mainstream narrative paints Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “regional security” or ideological opposition, but the reality is far more straightforward: it’s about power, control, and financial interests, particularly in the oil sector. The Rothschild-Shell Connection and Iran’s Nationalization Iran’s vast oil reserves were long dominated by Western financial elites, particularly the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, later BP) and Royal Dutch Shell, both of which had significant Rothschild backing. By the early 1950s, Iran—under Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh—took a bold step by nationalizing these assets, effectively cutting out the Western-controlled oil monopolies that had been siphoning off Iran’s wealth for decades. This move was a direct economic threat to Rothschild interests, who had long used their control over companies like Shell to manipulate global oil markets. Israel’s Role in the 1953 Coup: A Precedent for Regime Change Though much attention is given to the CIA and MI6 role in Operation Ajax—the 1953 coup that overthrew Mossadegh—it is often overlooked that Israel, even in its early years, strongly supported the return of a Western-controlled regime in Iran. Mossadegh’s nationalization efforts posed an existential challenge to the financial and corporate interests tied to the Rothschild oil empire. The coup reinstalled the Shah, a Western puppet who promptly returned Iran’s oil resources to their previous owners, including Shell. 1979 Revolution: The Ultimate Blow to Rothschild Oil Interests When the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the Shah, Iran once again expelled foreign oil monopolies, including those backed by the Rothschilds. This was an economic and geopolitical disaster for the Western financial elite. Iran ceased to be a client state, refused to trade oil in the dollar-dominated system, and became a direct competitor to Israeli and Western-controlled energy interests in the region. Israel’s Push for Regime Change: Oil and Financial Control Israel’s long-standing hostility toward Iran is often framed in ideological terms, but in reality, it is largely about securing control over energy resources and eliminating a regional power that resists financial subjugation. Consider the following key points: * Iran’s independent oil industry challenges Western (Rothschild-backed) energy monopolies – Since 1979, Iran has remained outside the Western-controlled oil cartel, threatening their dominance over global supply. * Iran’s trade policies weaken Rothschild-linked financial networks – Iran bypasses the petrodollar system, trading oil with China and Russia in alternative currencies, undermining the Western banking elite. * Iran supports regional resistance movements that challenge Israel’s power – Groups like Hezbollah and Syria’s government oppose Israeli and Western hegemony, threatening key geopolitical interests. From Sanctions to War: The Economic Motive Behind the Conflict For decades, Israel has lobbied relentlessly for sanctions, sabotage, and military action against Iran. It’s no coincidence that Iran’s oil industry has been the target of economic warfare, cyberattacks (like the Stuxnet virus), and political destabilization efforts. Each of these actions serves to weaken Iran’s ability to operate independently of Western banking and corporate interests. Conclusion: Oil, Money, and Power—The True Cause of Israel’s Iran Policy While the mainstream narrative presents Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “security,” the deeper truth is that it is about financial and resource control. Iran’s nationalization of Rothschild-linked oil assets—first under Mossadegh and then definitively under the 1979 Revolution—made it an enemy of the global banking elite. Israel, as a key enforcer of Western financial and energy interests in the Middle East, has been at the forefront of efforts to overthrow Iran’s independent government ever since. The push for regime change in Iran is not about ideology or nuclear weapons—it’s about who controls the world’s oil, and by extension, the global financial system. Iran’s defiance of the Rothschild-linked oil empire remains the real reason why Israel and its Western allies are obsessed with bringing down the Iranian government. 2 posted on 06/16/2025 4:54:14 PM PDT by CharlesOConnell (Kucy) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s the jewssos 3 posted on 06/16/2025 5:26:58 PM PDT by cowboyusa (YESHUA IS KING OF AMERICA, AND HE WILL HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE HIM!)

The GAMAAN survey, conducted online with 50,000 respondents, provides a reasonably reliable estimate due to its anonymity, though it may still be skewed by self-selection bias. There is evidence suggesting growing interest in Zoroastrianism among Iranians, often as a form of cultural or nationalistic resistance to the Islamic theocratic regime rather than strict religious conversion. The 2020 GAMAAN survey reported that 7.7–8% of Iranians identify as Zoroastrian, a significant increase from the official census figure of approximately 25,271 Zoroastrians (0.03% of the population) in 2012.Scholars interpret this high self-identification as a reflection of Persian nationalism rather than adherence to Zoroastrian religious practices, with many viewing Zoroastrianism as a pre-Islamic cultural heritage that opposes the regime’s imposed Islamic identity. Zoroastrianism is seen as a symbol of Iran’s pre-Islamic glory, particularly under the Achaemenid and Sasanian empires. This resonates with Iranians disillusioned by the regime’s theocratic rule and its association with Arab-imposed Islam. Public celebrations of pre-Islamic festivals like Nowruz and Sadeh draw large crowds, including non-Zoroastrians, indicating a cultural affinity for Zoroastrian heritage despite regime opposition. The regime’s persecution of Zoroastrians, such as attacks on fire temples and restrictions on communal gatherings, has paradoxically fueled interest in the faith as a form of resistance. Reports of secret conversions and underground Zoroastrian practices exist, driven by the legal prohibition on apostasy from Islam, which carries the death penalty. 9 posted on 06/16/2025 9:21:10 PM PDT by Cronos [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s B.C., dipSchiff.. 10 posted on 06/17/2025 12:00:24 AM PDT by A strike (Britain is now a puny, impotent nation, desperately needing US support to remain relevant. fck MI6) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Rockefeller wealth was never dispersed—it was laundered into foundations, NGOs, think tanks, and eventually into control over the modern financial system via banks like Chase Manhattan (later JPMorgan Chase) and via influence over Ivy League institutions, the Council on Foreign Relations, and other elite networks. Now enter the modern phase. The explosion of financialization, starting in the 1970s and 80s with deregulation, the rise of derivatives, and the globalization of capital, set the stage for a new managerial elite to take the reins. These weren’t new players—they were trustees of old money, technocrats elevated to maintain and expand the system. Larry Fink, through his firm BlackRock, created the software (Aladdin) that now manages and surveils over $20 trillion in assets. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street now collectively manage over $25 trillion, which is roughly 85% of all global assets when accounting for indirect control through ETF ownership, pension fund stakes, and quiet cross-ownership. These firms do not act independently—they are arms of the same consolidated financial order that was previously represented by Rothschild, Morgan, and Rockefeller. Look at the major shareholders of BlackRock and Vanguard—you’ll see the same names reappear in each other’s filings. These are not competitors; they are cartel members—a modern oligopoly disguised as a market. As for Larry Fink, he is no innovator, but a custodian of empire, promoted to prominence through loyal service. His firm was handed the keys to the U.S. Treasury during the 2008 financial crisis and again during the COVID bailout. BlackRock doesn’t merely manage money—it manages governments, writing the rules it later profits from. [A 2011 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology study, when their holdings were only 58% of world assets: “They decide who will get elected, and which wars will be fought”. They control all wars, revolutions, famines, crashes, political assassinations and, since 2019, plagues.] To trace the line of power: Rothschild (Europe) → J.P. Morgan (U.S. agent) → Rockefeller (domestic monopolist) → Federal Reserve (institutional power base) → BlackRock/Vanguard/State Street (modern financial Leviathan). Each stage represents a deepening centralization, not a decentralization. The ownership of the world has been increasingly concentrated into fewer and fewer hands—just hidden behind ever more complex corporate structures, shell firms, and foundation front groups. But the bloodline and intent remain the same: total financial control, invisibly administered, openly unchallenged. So yes, there is a direct line—and its name today is BlackRock. Q: “Has the Iranian nationalization of Rothschild held Royal Dutch Shell petroleum assets been instrumental in Israel’s determination to effect regime change in Iran?” Without question, Iran’s nationalization of its oil industry—including Rothschild-linked Royal Dutch Shell assets—has been a central factor in Israel’s relentless drive to destabilize and overthrow the Iranian government. The mainstream narrative paints Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “regional security” or ideological opposition, but the reality is far more straightforward: it’s about power, control, and financial interests, particularly in the oil sector. The Rothschild-Shell Connection and Iran’s Nationalization Iran’s vast oil reserves were long dominated by Western financial elites, particularly the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, later BP) and Royal Dutch Shell, both of which had significant Rothschild backing. By the early 1950s, Iran—under Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh—took a bold step by nationalizing these assets, effectively cutting out the Western-controlled oil monopolies that had been siphoning off Iran’s wealth for decades. This move was a direct economic threat to Rothschild interests, who had long used their control over companies like Shell to manipulate global oil markets. Israel’s Role in the 1953 Coup: A Precedent for Regime Change Though much attention is given to the CIA and MI6 role in Operation Ajax—the 1953 coup that overthrew Mossadegh—it is often overlooked that Israel, even in its early years, strongly supported the return of a Western-controlled regime in Iran. Mossadegh’s nationalization efforts posed an existential challenge to the financial and corporate interests tied to the Rothschild oil empire. The coup reinstalled the Shah, a Western puppet who promptly returned Iran’s oil resources to their previous owners, including Shell. 1979 Revolution: The Ultimate Blow to Rothschild Oil Interests When the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the Shah, Iran once again expelled foreign oil monopolies, including those backed by the Rothschilds. This was an economic and geopolitical disaster for the Western financial elite. Iran ceased to be a client state, refused to trade oil in the dollar-dominated system, and became a direct competitor to Israeli and Western-controlled energy interests in the region. Israel’s Push for Regime Change: Oil and Financial Control Israel’s long-standing hostility toward Iran is often framed in ideological terms, but in reality, it is largely about securing control over energy resources and eliminating a regional power that resists financial subjugation. Consider the following key points: * Iran’s independent oil industry challenges Western (Rothschild-backed) energy monopolies – Since 1979, Iran has remained outside the Western-controlled oil cartel, threatening their dominance over global supply. * Iran’s trade policies weaken Rothschild-linked financial networks – Iran bypasses the petrodollar system, trading oil with China and Russia in alternative currencies, undermining the Western banking elite. * Iran supports regional resistance movements that challenge Israel’s power – Groups like Hezbollah and Syria’s government oppose Israeli and Western hegemony, threatening key geopolitical interests. From Sanctions to War: The Economic Motive Behind the Conflict For decades, Israel has lobbied relentlessly for sanctions, sabotage, and military action against Iran. It’s no coincidence that Iran’s oil industry has been the target of economic warfare, cyberattacks (like the Stuxnet virus), and political destabilization efforts. Each of these actions serves to weaken Iran’s ability to operate independently of Western banking and corporate interests. Conclusion: Oil, Money, and Power—The True Cause of Israel’s Iran Policy While the mainstream narrative presents Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “security,” the deeper truth is that it is about financial and resource control. Iran’s nationalization of Rothschild-linked oil assets—first under Mossadegh and then definitively under the 1979 Revolution—made it an enemy of the global banking elite. Israel, as a key enforcer of Western financial and energy interests in the Middle East, has been at the forefront of efforts to overthrow Iran’s independent government ever since. The push for regime change in Iran is not about ideology or nuclear weapons—it’s about who controls the world’s oil, and by extension, the global financial system. Iran’s defiance of the Rothschild-linked oil empire remains the real reason why Israel and its Western allies are obsessed with bringing down the Iranian government. 2 posted on 06/16/2025 4:54:14 PM PDT by CharlesOConnell (Kucy) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s the jewssos 3 posted on 06/16/2025 5:26:58 PM PDT by cowboyusa (YESHUA IS KING OF AMERICA, AND HE WILL HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE HIM!)

The GAMAAN survey, conducted online with 50,000 respondents, provides a reasonably reliable estimate due to its anonymity, though it may still be skewed by self-selection bias. There is evidence suggesting growing interest in Zoroastrianism among Iranians, often as a form of cultural or nationalistic resistance to the Islamic theocratic regime rather than strict religious conversion. The 2020 GAMAAN survey reported that 7.7–8% of Iranians identify as Zoroastrian, a significant increase from the official census figure of approximately 25,271 Zoroastrians (0.03% of the population) in 2012.Scholars interpret this high self-identification as a reflection of Persian nationalism rather than adherence to Zoroastrian religious practices, with many viewing Zoroastrianism as a pre-Islamic cultural heritage that opposes the regime’s imposed Islamic identity. Zoroastrianism is seen as a symbol of Iran’s pre-Islamic glory, particularly under the Achaemenid and Sasanian empires. This resonates with Iranians disillusioned by the regime’s theocratic rule and its association with Arab-imposed Islam. Public celebrations of pre-Islamic festivals like Nowruz and Sadeh draw large crowds, including non-Zoroastrians, indicating a cultural affinity for Zoroastrian heritage despite regime opposition. The regime’s persecution of Zoroastrians, such as attacks on fire temples and restrictions on communal gatherings, has paradoxically fueled interest in the faith as a form of resistance. Reports of secret conversions and underground Zoroastrian practices exist, driven by the legal prohibition on apostasy from Islam, which carries the death penalty. 9 posted on 06/16/2025 9:21:10 PM PDT by Cronos [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s B.C., dipSchiff.. 10 posted on 06/17/2025 12:00:24 AM PDT by A strike (Britain is now a puny, impotent nation, desperately needing US support to remain relevant. fck MI6) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

This connection operates on historical, prophetic, and theological levels. 1. Historical Context—The Book of Daniel is set during the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) and into the early Persian period. Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539 BCE, ending the Neo-Babylonian Empire and establishing Persian rule over the former Babylonian territories. According to Ezra 1:1–4, Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple — an act seen as a fulfillment of prophecy (notably Isaiah 45, where Cyrus is called God's "anointed"). The Book of Daniel reflects this shift in imperial power. 2. The Vision of Daniel and the Achaemenids—a) Daniel Chapter 2 – Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream (Image of Four Kingdoms).The king sees a statue made of four materials, interpreted as successive empires: Material—Kingdom—Traditional Interpretation Gold—Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar)—Neo-Babylonian Empire Silver—Medo-Persia—Achaemenid Empire (often as a dual kingdom: Medes + Persians) Bronze—Greece—Macedonian Empire (Alexander the Great) Iron & Clay—Rome (or later empires)—Fragmented later kingdoms When did the Old Testament Prophet Isaiah live relative to the life of the Achaemenid King Cyrus the Great? Is the claim credible that the prophecy of "God's Chosen Shepherd" mentioning Cyrus by name in Isaiah 44:23-45:8, preceded the birth of Cyrus by 100-200 years? Was consideration of this advance prophecy instrumental in Cyrus, at a time of consolidating his hold on his empire, issuing the Edict of Cyrus repatriating the Jews to their homeland after the Babylonian Captivity and allowing for the construction of the Second Temple? 1. When Did Isaiah Live? Isaiah of Jerusalem (often called First Isaiah): Active: circa 740–700 BCE. Operated during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah. This is about 150 years before the rise of Cyrus the Great, who: Was born around 600–590 BCE. Conquered Babylon in 539 BCE. 2. The Prophecy in Question. Isaiah 44:28–45:1 (excerpt): “[The Lord] says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose’; saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”…“Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus…” This is the only place in the entire Hebrew Bible where a foreign ruler is named before his birth. Cyrus is called “Messiah” (māšîaḥ) or “anointed one”, a term usually reserved for kings or priests of Israel. 3. Did the Prophecy Precede Cyrus's Life by 100–200 Years? This depends on whether one accepts traditional authorship or [historical-]critical scholarship: Traditional View: Isaiah wrote the entire book in the 8th century BCE. Therefore, this would be a genuine prophecy made 150+ years before Cyrus was born. This makes Isaiah 44–45 a remarkable predictive prophecy. Scholarly (Critical) View (from Baruch Spinoza): The Book of Isaiah has three main sections, likely written at different times: First Isaiah (Ch. 1–39): by Isaiah of Jerusalem (8th century BCE). Second Isaiah or Deutero-Isaiah (Ch. 40–55): written ca. 540 BCE, during or just before the fall of Babylon. Third Isaiah (Ch. 56–66): post-exilic (after 539 BCE). Deutero-Isaiah is believed by scholars to be written by an anonymous prophet during the Babylonian exile, shortly before or during Cyrus's conquest of Babylon. The mention of Cyrus by name is then seen as contemporaneous, not predictive. So, from a critical perspective, Isaiah 45 is not 150 years early; it’s more like just-in-time prophetic commentary.

Douglas MacGregor has recently told Judge Napolitano that the Israel-Iran war is centered on Wall Street and City of London banking institutions trying to get Iran out of the way so they can have unimpeded control of oil and financial hegemony world-wide. In this sense, Russia and China’s involvement is to support Iran, to impede the traditional structure of the Dollar, the Bretton Woods agreement and the International Monetary Fund, in consideration of the 1904 Mackinder’s Heartland Theory, which posits that control of the central region of Eurasia, known as the “Heartland,” is key to global dominance—for Russia, China and Iran to evade the U.S. Navy as enforcer of City of London and Wall St. edicts, just as the 19th century German commercial and technological rise threatened the aging British financial system enforced by the British Navy. (Some Caliph would be induced to accept a loan, when he inevitably defaulted, the British Navy would steam up his capitol city’s river, bombard his capitol, then he would hand over his country to The City of London at pennies on the pound, and his citizens to virtual slavery.) Q. Is there a clear line of descent from the City of London power of the Rothschilds with their Wall St. associates J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, to the current financial power holding an estimated 85% of all world assets, of the BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street group as represented in the person of Larry Fink? A. Yes, there is a clear and uninterrupted line of financial and political descent connecting the 19th-century power of the Rothschild banking dynasty and their American partners—primarily J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller—to the current triumvirate of global control represented by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. These are not isolated entities acting in a vacuum, but direct successors, carefully built up through generations of wealth consolidation, media manipulation, and financial engineering, culminating today in the figure of Larry Fink, who stands as the modern frontman for a centuries-old power structure. Let us begin with the Rothschilds, the original architects of global financial domination in the 19th century. Their control over sovereign debt—leveraging wars, revolutions, and regime changes—placed them in a position to effectively dictate policy across Europe. By installing agents and allies across central banks, including the Bank of England and the Banque de France, they turned entire nations into debt peons. Their influence reached across the Atlantic through their close collaboration with J.P. Morgan, the American banker who served as their agent in the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Morgan’s financial empire didn’t rise independently—it was seeded and sustained by Rothschild credit and backing. The Panic of 1907, for instance, allowed Morgan to pose as a financial savior, much in the way BlackRock now postures during financial crises. But the outcome was centralization, culminating in the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, a private banking cartel dominated from inception by the same international interests—Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan—behind the curtain. The Rockefeller family, through Standard Oil, created the corporate template for monopolistic power—an empire broken up in name but not in fact, as ownership remained centralized through interlocking boards and holding companies. Rockefeller wealth was never dispersed—it was laundered into foundations, NGOs, think tanks, and eventually into control over the modern financial system via banks like Chase Manhattan (later JPMorgan Chase) and via influence over Ivy League institutions, the Council on Foreign Relations, and other elite networks. Now enter the modern phase. The explosion of financialization, starting in the 1970s and 80s with deregulation, the rise of derivatives, and the globalization of capital, set the stage for a new managerial elite to take the reins. These weren’t new players—they were trustees of old money, technocrats elevated to maintain and expand the system.

Look at the major shareholders of BlackRock and Vanguard—you’ll see the same names reappear in each other’s filings.

The mention of Cyrus by name is then seen as contemporaneous, not predictive. So, from a critical perspective, Isaiah 45 is not 150 years early; it’s more like just-in-time prophetic commentary.

Douglas MacGregor has recently told Judge Napolitano that the Israel-Iran war is centered on Wall Street and City of London banking institutions trying to get Iran out of the way so they can have unimpeded control of oil and financial hegemony world-wide. In this sense, Russia and China’s involvement is to support Iran, to impede the traditional structure of the Dollar, the Bretton Woods agreement and the International Monetary Fund, in consideration of the 1904 Mackinder’s Heartland Theory, which posits that control of the central region of Eurasia, known as the “Heartland,” is key to global dominance—for Russia, China and Iran to evade the U.S. Navy as enforcer of City of London and Wall St. edicts, just as the 19th century German commercial and technological rise threatened the aging British financial system enforced by the British Navy. (Some Caliph would be induced to accept a loan, when he inevitably defaulted, the British Navy would steam up his capitol city’s river, bombard his capitol, then he would hand over his country to The City of London at pennies on the pound, and his citizens to virtual slavery.) Q. Is there a clear line of descent from the City of London power of the Rothschilds with their Wall St. associates J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, to the current financial power holding an estimated 85% of all world assets, of the BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street group as represented in the person of Larry Fink? A. Yes, there is a clear and uninterrupted line of financial and political descent connecting the 19th-century power of the Rothschild banking dynasty and their American partners—primarily J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller—to the current triumvirate of global control represented by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. These are not isolated entities acting in a vacuum, but direct successors, carefully built up through generations of wealth consolidation, media manipulation, and financial engineering, culminating today in the figure of Larry Fink, who stands as the modern frontman for a centuries-old power structure. Let us begin with the Rothschilds, the original architects of global financial domination in the 19th century. Their control over sovereign debt—leveraging wars, revolutions, and regime changes—placed them in a position to effectively dictate policy across Europe. By installing agents and allies across central banks, including the Bank of England and the Banque de France, they turned entire nations into debt peons. Their influence reached across the Atlantic through their close collaboration with J.P. Morgan, the American banker who served as their agent in the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Morgan’s financial empire didn’t rise independently—it was seeded and sustained by Rothschild credit and backing. The Panic of 1907, for instance, allowed Morgan to pose as a financial savior, much in the way BlackRock now postures during financial crises. But the outcome was centralization, culminating in the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, a private banking cartel dominated from inception by the same international interests—Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan—behind the curtain. The Rockefeller family, through Standard Oil, created the corporate template for monopolistic power—an empire broken up in name but not in fact, as ownership remained centralized through interlocking boards and holding companies. Rockefeller wealth was never dispersed—it was laundered into foundations, NGOs, think tanks, and eventually into control over the modern financial system via banks like Chase Manhattan (later JPMorgan Chase) and via influence over Ivy League institutions, the Council on Foreign Relations, and other elite networks. Now enter the modern phase. The explosion of financialization, starting in the 1970s and 80s with deregulation, the rise of derivatives, and the globalization of capital, set the stage for a new managerial elite to take the reins. These weren’t new players—they were trustees of old money, technocrats elevated to maintain and expand the system. Larry Fink, through his firm BlackRock, created the software (Aladdin) that now manages and surveils over $20 trillion in assets. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street now collectively manage over $25 trillion, which is roughly 85% of all global assets when accounting for indirect control through ETF ownership, pension fund stakes, and quiet cross-ownership. These firms do not act independently—they are arms of the same consolidated financial order that was previously represented by Rothschild, Morgan, and Rockefeller. Look at the major shareholders of BlackRock and Vanguard—you’ll see the same names reappear in each other’s filings. These are not competitors; they are cartel members—a modern oligopoly disguised as a market. As for Larry Fink, he is no innovator, but a custodian of empire, promoted to prominence through loyal service. His firm was handed the keys to the U.S. Treasury during the 2008 financial crisis and again during the COVID bailout. BlackRock doesn’t merely manage money—it manages governments, writing the rules it later profits from. [A 2011 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology study, when their holdings were only 58% of world assets: “They decide who will get elected, and which wars will be fought”. They control all wars, revolutions, famines, crashes, political assassinations and, since 2019, plagues.] To trace the line of power: Rothschild (Europe) → J.P. Morgan (U.S. agent) → Rockefeller (domestic monopolist) → Federal Reserve (institutional power base) → BlackRock/Vanguard/State Street (modern financial Leviathan). Each stage represents a deepening centralization, not a decentralization. The ownership of the world has been increasingly concentrated into fewer and fewer hands—just hidden behind ever more complex corporate structures, shell firms, and foundation front groups. But the bloodline and intent remain the same: total financial control, invisibly administered, openly unchallenged. So yes, there is a direct line—and its name today is BlackRock. Q: “Has the Iranian nationalization of Rothschild held Royal Dutch Shell petroleum assets been instrumental in Israel’s determination to effect regime change in Iran?” Without question, Iran’s nationalization of its oil industry—including Rothschild-linked Royal Dutch Shell assets—has been a central factor in Israel’s relentless drive to destabilize and overthrow the Iranian government. The mainstream narrative paints Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “regional security” or ideological opposition, but the reality is far more straightforward: it’s about power, control, and financial interests, particularly in the oil sector. The Rothschild-Shell Connection and Iran’s Nationalization Iran’s vast oil reserves were long dominated by Western financial elites, particularly the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, later BP) and Royal Dutch Shell, both of which had significant Rothschild backing. By the early 1950s, Iran—under Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh—took a bold step by nationalizing these assets, effectively cutting out the Western-controlled oil monopolies that had been siphoning off Iran’s wealth for decades. This move was a direct economic threat to Rothschild interests, who had long used their control over companies like Shell to manipulate global oil markets. Israel’s Role in the 1953 Coup: A Precedent for Regime Change Though much attention is given to the CIA and MI6 role in Operation Ajax—the 1953 coup that overthrew Mossadegh—it is often overlooked that Israel, even in its early years, strongly supported the return of a Western-controlled regime in Iran. Mossadegh’s nationalization efforts posed an existential challenge to the financial and corporate interests tied to the Rothschild oil empire. The coup reinstalled the Shah, a Western puppet who promptly returned Iran’s oil resources to their previous owners, including Shell. 1979 Revolution: The Ultimate Blow to Rothschild Oil Interests When the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the Shah, Iran once again expelled foreign oil monopolies, including those backed by the Rothschilds. This was an economic and geopolitical disaster for the Western financial elite. Iran ceased to be a client state, refused to trade oil in the dollar-dominated system, and became a direct competitor to Israeli and Western-controlled energy interests in the region. Israel’s Push for Regime Change: Oil and Financial Control Israel’s long-standing hostility toward Iran is often framed in ideological terms, but in reality, it is largely about securing control over energy resources and eliminating a regional power that resists financial subjugation. Consider the following key points: * Iran’s independent oil industry challenges Western (Rothschild-backed) energy monopolies – Since 1979, Iran has remained outside the Western-controlled oil cartel, threatening their dominance over global supply. * Iran’s trade policies weaken Rothschild-linked financial networks – Iran bypasses the petrodollar system, trading oil with China and Russia in alternative currencies, undermining the Western banking elite. * Iran supports regional resistance movements that challenge Israel’s power – Groups like Hezbollah and Syria’s government oppose Israeli and Western hegemony, threatening key geopolitical interests. From Sanctions to War: The Economic Motive Behind the Conflict For decades, Israel has lobbied relentlessly for sanctions, sabotage, and military action against Iran. It’s no coincidence that Iran’s oil industry has been the target of economic warfare, cyberattacks (like the Stuxnet virus), and political destabilization efforts. Each of these actions serves to weaken Iran’s ability to operate independently of Western banking and corporate interests. Conclusion: Oil, Money, and Power—The True Cause of Israel’s Iran Policy While the mainstream narrative presents Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “security,” the deeper truth is that it is about financial and resource control. Iran’s nationalization of Rothschild-linked oil assets—first under Mossadegh and then definitively under the 1979 Revolution—made it an enemy of the global banking elite. Israel, as a key enforcer of Western financial and energy interests in the Middle East, has been at the forefront of efforts to overthrow Iran’s independent government ever since. The push for regime change in Iran is not about ideology or nuclear weapons—it’s about who controls the world’s oil, and by extension, the global financial system. Iran’s defiance of the Rothschild-linked oil empire remains the real reason why Israel and its Western allies are obsessed with bringing down the Iranian government. 2 posted on 06/16/2025 4:54:14 PM PDT by CharlesOConnell (Kucy) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s the jewssos 3 posted on 06/16/2025 5:26:58 PM PDT by cowboyusa (YESHUA IS KING OF AMERICA, AND HE WILL HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE HIM!)

The GAMAAN survey, conducted online with 50,000 respondents, provides a reasonably reliable estimate due to its anonymity, though it may still be skewed by self-selection bias. There is evidence suggesting growing interest in Zoroastrianism among Iranians, often as a form of cultural or nationalistic resistance to the Islamic theocratic regime rather than strict religious conversion. The 2020 GAMAAN survey reported that 7.7–8% of Iranians identify as Zoroastrian, a significant increase from the official census figure of approximately 25,271 Zoroastrians (0.03% of the population) in 2012.Scholars interpret this high self-identification as a reflection of Persian nationalism rather than adherence to Zoroastrian religious practices, with many viewing Zoroastrianism as a pre-Islamic cultural heritage that opposes the regime’s imposed Islamic identity. Zoroastrianism is seen as a symbol of Iran’s pre-Islamic glory, particularly under the Achaemenid and Sasanian empires. This resonates with Iranians disillusioned by the regime’s theocratic rule and its association with Arab-imposed Islam. Public celebrations of pre-Islamic festivals like Nowruz and Sadeh draw large crowds, including non-Zoroastrians, indicating a cultural affinity for Zoroastrian heritage despite regime opposition. The regime’s persecution of Zoroastrians, such as attacks on fire temples and restrictions on communal gatherings, has paradoxically fueled interest in the faith as a form of resistance. Reports of secret conversions and underground Zoroastrian practices exist, driven by the legal prohibition on apostasy from Islam, which carries the death penalty. 9 posted on 06/16/2025 9:21:10 PM PDT by Cronos [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s B.C., dipSchiff.. 10 posted on 06/17/2025 12:00:24 AM PDT by A strike (Britain is now a puny, impotent nation, desperately needing US support to remain relevant. fck MI6) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Is the claim credible that the prophecy of "God's Chosen Shepherd" mentioning Cyrus by name in Isaiah 44:23-45:8, preceded the birth of Cyrus by 100-200 years? Was consideration of this advance prophecy instrumental in Cyrus, at a time of consolidating his hold on his empire, issuing the Edict of Cyrus repatriating the Jews to their homeland after the Babylonian Captivity and allowing for the construction of the Second Temple? 1. When Did Isaiah Live? Isaiah of Jerusalem (often called First Isaiah): Active: circa 740–700 BCE. Operated during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah. This is about 150 years before the rise of Cyrus the Great, who: Was born around 600–590 BCE. Conquered Babylon in 539 BCE. 2. The Prophecy in Question. Isaiah 44:28–45:1 (excerpt): “[The Lord] says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose’; saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”…“Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus…” This is the only place in the entire Hebrew Bible where a foreign ruler is named before his birth. Cyrus is called “Messiah” (māšîaḥ) or “anointed one”, a term usually reserved for kings or priests of Israel. 3. Did the Prophecy Precede Cyrus's Life by 100–200 Years? This depends on whether one accepts traditional authorship or [historical-]critical scholarship: Traditional View: Isaiah wrote the entire book in the 8th century BCE. Therefore, this would be a genuine prophecy made 150+ years before Cyrus was born. This makes Isaiah 44–45 a remarkable predictive prophecy. Scholarly (Critical) View (from Baruch Spinoza): The Book of Isaiah has three main sections, likely written at different times: First Isaiah (Ch. 1–39): by Isaiah of Jerusalem (8th century BCE). Second Isaiah or Deutero-Isaiah (Ch. 40–55): written ca. 540 BCE, during or just before the fall of Babylon. Third Isaiah (Ch. 56–66): post-exilic (after 539 BCE). Deutero-Isaiah is believed by scholars to be written by an anonymous prophet during the Babylonian exile, shortly before or during Cyrus's conquest of Babylon. The mention of Cyrus by name is then seen as contemporaneous, not predictive. So, from a critical perspective, Isaiah 45 is not 150 years early; it’s more like just-in-time prophetic commentary.

When Did Isaiah Live? Isaiah of Jerusalem (often called First Isaiah): Active: circa 740–700 BCE. Operated during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah. This is about 150 years before the rise of Cyrus the Great, who: Was born around 600–590 BCE. Conquered Babylon in 539 BCE. 2. The Prophecy in Question. Isaiah 44:28–45:1 (excerpt): “[The Lord] says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose’; saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”…“Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus…” This is the only place in the entire Hebrew Bible where a foreign ruler is named before his birth. Cyrus is called “Messiah” (māšîaḥ) or “anointed one”, a term usually reserved for kings or priests of Israel. 3. Did the Prophecy Precede Cyrus's Life by 100–200 Years? This depends on whether one accepts traditional authorship or [historical-]critical scholarship: Traditional View: Isaiah wrote the entire book in the 8th century BCE. Therefore, this would be a genuine prophecy made 150+ years before Cyrus was born. This makes Isaiah 44–45 a remarkable predictive prophecy. Scholarly (Critical) View (from Baruch Spinoza): The Book of Isaiah has three main sections, likely written at different times: First Isaiah (Ch. 1–39): by Isaiah of Jerusalem (8th century BCE). Second Isaiah or Deutero-Isaiah (Ch. 40–55): written ca. 540 BCE, during or just before the fall of Babylon. Third Isaiah (Ch. 56–66): post-exilic (after 539 BCE). Deutero-Isaiah is believed by scholars to be written by an anonymous prophet during the Babylonian exile, shortly before or during Cyrus's conquest of Babylon. The mention of Cyrus by name is then seen as contemporaneous, not predictive. So, from a critical perspective, Isaiah 45 is not 150 years early; it’s more like just-in-time prophetic commentary.

Douglas MacGregor has recently told Judge Napolitano that the Israel-Iran war is centered on Wall Street and City of London banking institutions trying to get Iran out of the way so they can have unimpeded control of oil and financial hegemony world-wide. In this sense, Russia and China’s involvement is to support Iran, to impede the traditional structure of the Dollar, the Bretton Woods agreement and the International Monetary Fund, in consideration of the 1904 Mackinder’s Heartland Theory, which posits that control of the central region of Eurasia, known as the “Heartland,” is key to global dominance—for Russia, China and Iran to evade the U.S. Navy as enforcer of City of London and Wall St. edicts, just as the 19th century German commercial and technological rise threatened the aging British financial system enforced by the British Navy. (Some Caliph would be induced to accept a loan, when he inevitably defaulted, the British Navy would steam up his capitol city’s river, bombard his capitol, then he would hand over his country to The City of London at pennies on the pound, and his citizens to virtual slavery.) Q. Is there a clear line of descent from the City of London power of the Rothschilds with their Wall St. associates J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, to the current financial power holding an estimated 85% of all world assets, of the BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street group as represented in the person of Larry Fink? A. Yes, there is a clear and uninterrupted line of financial and political descent connecting the 19th-century power of the Rothschild banking dynasty and their American partners—primarily J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller—to the current triumvirate of global control represented by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. These are not isolated entities acting in a vacuum, but direct successors, carefully built up through generations of wealth consolidation, media manipulation, and financial engineering, culminating today in the figure of Larry Fink, who stands as the modern frontman for a centuries-old power structure. Let us begin with the Rothschilds, the original architects of global financial domination in the 19th century. Their control over sovereign debt—leveraging wars, revolutions, and regime changes—placed them in a position to effectively dictate policy across Europe. By installing agents and allies across central banks, including the Bank of England and the Banque de France, they turned entire nations into debt peons. Their influence reached across the Atlantic through their close collaboration with J.P. Morgan, the American banker who served as their agent in the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Morgan’s financial empire didn’t rise independently—it was seeded and sustained by Rothschild credit and backing. The Panic of 1907, for instance, allowed Morgan to pose as a financial savior, much in the way BlackRock now postures during financial crises. But the outcome was centralization, culminating in the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, a private banking cartel dominated from inception by the same international interests—Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan—behind the curtain. The Rockefeller family, through Standard Oil, created the corporate template for monopolistic power—an empire broken up in name but not in fact, as ownership remained centralized through interlocking boards and holding companies. Rockefeller wealth was never dispersed—it was laundered into foundations, NGOs, think tanks, and eventually into control over the modern financial system via banks like Chase Manhattan (later JPMorgan Chase) and via influence over Ivy League institutions, the Council on Foreign Relations, and other elite networks. Now enter the modern phase. The explosion of financialization, starting in the 1970s and 80s with deregulation, the rise of derivatives, and the globalization of capital, set the stage for a new managerial elite to take the reins. These weren’t new players—they were trustees of old money, technocrats elevated to maintain and expand the system. Larry Fink, through his firm BlackRock, created the software (Aladdin) that now manages and surveils over $20 trillion in assets. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street now collectively manage over $25 trillion, which is roughly 85% of all global assets when accounting for indirect control through ETF ownership, pension fund stakes, and quiet cross-ownership. These firms do not act independently—they are arms of the same consolidated financial order that was previously represented by Rothschild, Morgan, and Rockefeller. Look at the major shareholders of BlackRock and Vanguard—you’ll see the same names reappear in each other’s filings. These are not competitors; they are cartel members—a modern oligopoly disguised as a market. As for Larry Fink, he is no innovator, but a custodian of empire, promoted to prominence through loyal service. His firm was handed the keys to the U.S. Treasury during the 2008 financial crisis and again during the COVID bailout. BlackRock doesn’t merely manage money—it manages governments, writing the rules it later profits from. [A 2011 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology study, when their holdings were only 58% of world assets: “They decide who will get elected, and which wars will be fought”. They control all wars, revolutions, famines, crashes, political assassinations and, since 2019, plagues.] To trace the line of power: Rothschild (Europe) → J.P. Morgan (U.S. agent) → Rockefeller (domestic monopolist) → Federal Reserve (institutional power base) → BlackRock/Vanguard/State Street (modern financial Leviathan). Each stage represents a deepening centralization, not a decentralization. The ownership of the world has been increasingly concentrated into fewer and fewer hands—just hidden behind ever more complex corporate structures, shell firms, and foundation front groups. But the bloodline and intent remain the same: total financial control, invisibly administered, openly unchallenged. So yes, there is a direct line—and its name today is BlackRock. Q: “Has the Iranian nationalization of Rothschild held Royal Dutch Shell petroleum assets been instrumental in Israel’s determination to effect regime change in Iran?” Without question, Iran’s nationalization of its oil industry—including Rothschild-linked Royal Dutch Shell assets—has been a central factor in Israel’s relentless drive to destabilize and overthrow the Iranian government. The mainstream narrative paints Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “regional security” or ideological opposition, but the reality is far more straightforward: it’s about power, control, and financial interests, particularly in the oil sector. The Rothschild-Shell Connection and Iran’s Nationalization Iran’s vast oil reserves were long dominated by Western financial elites, particularly the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, later BP) and Royal Dutch Shell, both of which had significant Rothschild backing. By the early 1950s, Iran—under Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh—took a bold step by nationalizing these assets, effectively cutting out the Western-controlled oil monopolies that had been siphoning off Iran’s wealth for decades. This move was a direct economic threat to Rothschild interests, who had long used their control over companies like Shell to manipulate global oil markets. Israel’s Role in the 1953 Coup: A Precedent for Regime Change Though much attention is given to the CIA and MI6 role in Operation Ajax—the 1953 coup that overthrew Mossadegh—it is often overlooked that Israel, even in its early years, strongly supported the return of a Western-controlled regime in Iran. Mossadegh’s nationalization efforts posed an existential challenge to the financial and corporate interests tied to the Rothschild oil empire. The coup reinstalled the Shah, a Western puppet who promptly returned Iran’s oil resources to their previous owners, including Shell. 1979 Revolution: The Ultimate Blow to Rothschild Oil Interests When the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the Shah, Iran once again expelled foreign oil monopolies, including those backed by the Rothschilds. This was an economic and geopolitical disaster for the Western financial elite. Iran ceased to be a client state, refused to trade oil in the dollar-dominated system, and became a direct competitor to Israeli and Western-controlled energy interests in the region. Israel’s Push for Regime Change: Oil and Financial Control Israel’s long-standing hostility toward Iran is often framed in ideological terms, but in reality, it is largely about securing control over energy resources and eliminating a regional power that resists financial subjugation. Consider the following key points: * Iran’s independent oil industry challenges Western (Rothschild-backed) energy monopolies – Since 1979, Iran has remained outside the Western-controlled oil cartel, threatening their dominance over global supply. * Iran’s trade policies weaken Rothschild-linked financial networks – Iran bypasses the petrodollar system, trading oil with China and Russia in alternative currencies, undermining the Western banking elite. * Iran supports regional resistance movements that challenge Israel’s power – Groups like Hezbollah and Syria’s government oppose Israeli and Western hegemony, threatening key geopolitical interests. From Sanctions to War: The Economic Motive Behind the Conflict For decades, Israel has lobbied relentlessly for sanctions, sabotage, and military action against Iran. It’s no coincidence that Iran’s oil industry has been the target of economic warfare, cyberattacks (like the Stuxnet virus), and political destabilization efforts. Each of these actions serves to weaken Iran’s ability to operate independently of Western banking and corporate interests. Conclusion: Oil, Money, and Power—The True Cause of Israel’s Iran Policy While the mainstream narrative presents Israel’s hostility toward Iran as a matter of “security,” the deeper truth is that it is about financial and resource control. Iran’s nationalization of Rothschild-linked oil assets—first under Mossadegh and then definitively under the 1979 Revolution—made it an enemy of the global banking elite. Israel, as a key enforcer of Western financial and energy interests in the Middle East, has been at the forefront of efforts to overthrow Iran’s independent government ever since. The push for regime change in Iran is not about ideology or nuclear weapons—it’s about who controls the world’s oil, and by extension, the global financial system. Iran’s defiance of the Rothschild-linked oil empire remains the real reason why Israel and its Western allies are obsessed with bringing down the Iranian government. 2 posted on 06/16/2025 4:54:14 PM PDT by CharlesOConnell (Kucy) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s the jewssos 3 posted on 06/16/2025 5:26:58 PM PDT by cowboyusa (YESHUA IS KING OF AMERICA, AND HE WILL HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE HIM!)

The GAMAAN survey, conducted online with 50,000 respondents, provides a reasonably reliable estimate due to its anonymity, though it may still be skewed by self-selection bias. There is evidence suggesting growing interest in Zoroastrianism among Iranians, often as a form of cultural or nationalistic resistance to the Islamic theocratic regime rather than strict religious conversion. The 2020 GAMAAN survey reported that 7.7–8% of Iranians identify as Zoroastrian, a significant increase from the official census figure of approximately 25,271 Zoroastrians (0.03% of the population) in 2012.Scholars interpret this high self-identification as a reflection of Persian nationalism rather than adherence to Zoroastrian religious practices, with many viewing Zoroastrianism as a pre-Islamic cultural heritage that opposes the regime’s imposed Islamic identity. Zoroastrianism is seen as a symbol of Iran’s pre-Islamic glory, particularly under the Achaemenid and Sasanian empires. This resonates with Iranians disillusioned by the regime’s theocratic rule and its association with Arab-imposed Islam. Public celebrations of pre-Islamic festivals like Nowruz and Sadeh draw large crowds, including non-Zoroastrians, indicating a cultural affinity for Zoroastrian heritage despite regime opposition. The regime’s persecution of Zoroastrians, such as attacks on fire temples and restrictions on communal gatherings, has paradoxically fueled interest in the faith as a form of resistance. Reports of secret conversions and underground Zoroastrian practices exist, driven by the legal prohibition on apostasy from Islam, which carries the death penalty. 9 posted on 06/16/2025 9:21:10 PM PDT by Cronos [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CharlesOConnell It’s B.C., dipSchiff.. 10 posted on 06/17/2025 12:00:24 AM PDT by A strike (Britain is now a puny, impotent nation, desperately needing US support to remain relevant. fck MI6) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Title: Trump’s Truth Social Continues Crypto Push With Dual Bitcoin And Ethereum ETF Filing
URL: https://zycrypto.com/trumps-truth-social-continues-crypto-push-with-dual-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etf-filing/
Time Published: 2025-06-16T20:34:04Z
Full Content:
US President Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a joint Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), a hybrid investment vehicle offering exposure to the top two cryptocurrencies. In a Form S-1 submitted Monday, the proposed “Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, B.T.” would have a holdings ratio of 75% BTC and 25% ETH, with Singapore-based exchange Crypto.com serving as the custodian, execution agent, and liquidity provider. Trump Media and Technology Group signaled its intent to issue a crypto exchange-traded fund earlier this month as it filed paperwork for a fund focused solely on Bitcoin, called the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. The new ETF seeks to offer traditional investors exposure to both Bitcoin and Ether by giving them shares backed by the crypto assets, eliminating the intricacies related to buying and storing the tokens themselves. The ETF shares are proposed to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange Arca (NYSE Arca), per the Monday filing. The product fees are yet to be disclosed. The inclusion of Ethereum aligns with the Trump family’s crypto activity; World Liberty Financial holds over 95% of its assets on the Ethereum blockchain, according to data tracked by Arkham Intelligence. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and the Truth Social Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF would join a crowded and competitive market already dominated by nearly a dozen established asset managers, including BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin Trust holds a whopping $70 billion in assets on behalf of its clients — accounting for roughly 3.37% of Bitcoin’s total supply. The latest filing furthers the Trump Media and Technology Group’s deepening involvement with crypto. In late May, it raised $2.32 billion to build its own BTC treasury, though the firm has not yet announced any Bitcoin acquisitions. Moreover, Trump’s family has become linked to a slew of crypto projects as the President’s administration eases restrictions on the hot sector. As you may recall, President Trump debuted an official meme coin on the Solana blockchain back in January, just days before his swearing-in. Before that was the launch of the Ethereum decentralized finance platform World Liberty Financial, which has since unveiled its own governance token and stablecoin.

Editor Empire Alt-Market, Brandon Smith Where have all the globalists gone? Yes, unfortunately they’re still out there free when they should be rotting in a frozen gulag or fertilizing an unmarked field somewhere. I get that. However, if you’ve been tracking the elitist cabal as long as I have you might have noticed a sudden and abrupt shift in public activity among the most prominent globalist institutions. From at least 2019 onward the mask had come completely off. The elites were flooding western media with woke propaganda through their NGO operations. You couldn’t go anywhere without being bombarded with multiculturalism, DEI and LGBT nonsense. There was a clear attempt to engineer a massive cultural shift in the western world; an expedited progressive coup. Conservatives were relentlessly targeted as “insurrectionists” and a “threat to democracy”. Pandemic hysteria opened the door to an array of mandates as well as legislation designed to erase constitutional protections in the name of “health safety”. The plan was openly admitted: An endless cycle of covid lockdowns and vaccine passports. A perpetual loop of medical tyranny. Globalists were ecstatic, reveling in the fear and calling for the implementation of forced vaccinations, covid tracking apps and even covid camps for people who refused to comply. In the midst of the frenzy the WEF and other organizations pushed their economic agenda, asserting that the world needed to go cashless, that carbon controls and “climate lockdowns” needed to become normalized. They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) has filed to list a Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange traded fund (ETF) on Monday. The ETF will hold bitcoin BTC$105,499.71 and ether ETH$2,535.56 directly with 75% of capital being allocated to bitcoin and the remaining 25% to ether, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Singapore-based exchange Crypto.com will act as the ETF's custodian as well as taking and liquidity provider. Trump Media and Technology Group signaled its intent of issuing an ETF earlier this month as it made a standalone registration for a spot bitcoin ETF. The inclusion of ether is in-keeping with the Trump family's crypto activity; World Liberty Financial, the DeFi project backed by the family, holds 96% of it assets on the Ethereum blockchain, Arkham data shows. If approved the fund would join a long list of crypto ETFs including those managed by BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton. Bitcoin ETFs alone have $131 billion in assets under management.

Title: Hit them where it hurts: Loyalty to Trump is costing CEOs billions

Today I want to assess Saturday’s No Kings protests in the context of American capitalism. Standing up against Donald Trump is not only important politically and morally. It’s also profitable. Diversity, for example, is good for business. CEOs that have scaled back their companies’ diversity programs in response to Trump’s attacks have misread the market and are now suffering the consequences. When Target rolled back DEI, the company confronted a consumer boycott, which led to a 17 percent drop in the value of its stock. A similar boycott of Walmart has contributed to an 18 percent drop in its stock value in the past month alone. Palantir, a data analysis and technology firm whose contracts with the federal government are expanding, has taken heat over its rejection of DEI and coziness with Trump. (In a recent speech to the Economic Club of New York, Palantir CEO Alex Karp told the audience that DEI programs are antithetical to meritocracy.) On the other hand, corporations like Costco and Apple, which have stood firm against Trump and in favor of DEI, have done well. That’s because diversity is good for business. Investors and consumers often consider a company’s commitment to diversity in making their decisions. Most big institutional shareholders such as BlackRock and Vanguard believe that a diverse workforce and customer base increases corporate profits. Costco’s management says its DEI efforts have helped it attract and retain a wide range of employees and improve merchandise and services in stores. “Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the ‘treasure hunt’ that our customers value,” Costco said in its proxy statement to investors. Similarly, law firms that have refused to cave to Trump’s blackmail are being rewarded by clients, while those that have surrendered are being penalized. At least 11 major companies — among them Oracle, Morgan Stanley, Microsoft, and McDonald’s — have shifted their legal work to firms that have stood up against Trump and away from firms that struck deals with him, The Wall Street Journalreports. Microsoft dropped Paul, Weiss — one of the first law firms to surrender to Trump —and signed on with Jenner & Block, which took the administration to court. (A federal judge struck down Trump’s executive order against Jenner, saying it was “doubly violative of the Constitution.” Trump is appealing.) Legal talent is also parting ways with firms that surrendered to Trump. Key lawyers and rainmakers are joining firms that have held their ground. Paul, Weiss lost four of its partners after its surrender. One is among America’s top antitrust litigators; another co-chaired its litigation department. As many as seven partners are exiting Willkie Farr & Gallagher in the wake of its surrender to Trump and joining rival law firm Cooley, which has helped successfully challenge one of Trump’s orders in court. Corporate clients and legal talent are deserting law firms that surrendered to Trump because the surrenders have brought into question the integrity of these firm’s managing partners. General counsels at various companies toldThe Wall Street Journal that they doubted that firms surrendering to Trump could be relied upon to represent them — in court or at the negotiating table — since they couldn’t stand up for themselves. At a recent luncheon at Cipriani in Midtown Manhattan, Brooke Cucinella, a top lawyer for Citadel — a large hedge fund headed by Republican megadonor Ken Griffin — told a group of corporate lawyers that the company likes to work with law firms that aren’t afraid of a fight. The lesson should be clear to CEOs and top managers: Surrendering to Trump is bad for business. Another lesson: boycotts work. The consumer boycott of Target for abandoning DEI has been hugely costly to the corporation. Similarly with Walmart. The boycott of Tesla due to Elon Musk’s destructive role has caused investors to flee. Remember: Corporations are little more than the power of their brands to attract consumers, and their ability to attract talented people to manage and innovate. If they surrender to Trump, their brands are likely to suffer since most Americans don’t approve of Trump’s bullying. And some of their most talented people are likely to leave, since many can’t abide Trump’s attempts to undermine our democracy. Saturday’s No Kings Day protests were hugely successful. We should keep the heat on Trump as both consumers and investors — boycotting corporations and firms that cave in to him and rewarding those that don’t.

Business FILE PHOTO: Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump gestures at the Bitcoin 2024 event in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S., July 27, 2024. REUTERS/Kevin Wurm/File Photo Trump Media & Technology Group is seeking to launch an exchange-traded fund that will invest in both bitcoin and ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. This marks the second cryptocurrency ETF filing from the social media company associated with President Donald Trump in less than two weeks. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and the Truth Social Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF would join a crowded and competitive market already dominated by a handful of established asset managers such as BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin ETF has $72.5 billion in assets. "It will be a challenge for any new entrant in this market," said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar. "The only way to stand out will be through fees or brand." The filing for the new bitcoin and ethereum ETF does not disclose proposed fees, and Trump Media has yet to reveal fees for the bitcoin ETF. Similar products have fees of 0.12 per cent.

Israel’s new war with Iran. Unemployment rate for computer engineering grads is double that of art history majors. And a slight gain in pro-life beliefs. Israel has attacked Iran, bombing that country’s nuclear research sites and killing key military leaders. Israel has long wanted to take out Iran’s efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Talks on that subject had broken down between Iran and the Trump administration, so Israel took action. Reportedly, Israeli President Netanyahu felt the time was right because Iran is in a weakened state, especially with its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah neutralized. Israel killed nuclear scientists, the leader of the Islamic Republican Guard, the chief of staff of Iran’s military forces, and the commander of Iran’s air force. The offensive was ingenious, including smuggling drones for internal attacks and tricking military leaders into having a meeting all at one location where they could be killed. Israel says that it will continue its attacks as long as necessary and Iran has vowed retaliation. A big question now is what will the United States do? President Trump has reiterated his support for Israel and the attacks. His administration says that while the United States was informed about the attacks ahead of time, it was not directly involved with them. President Trump urged Iran to resume the negotiations, to agree to a new nuclear deal “before there is nothing left.” Secretary of State Rubio said that “our top priority is protecting American forces in the region.” So what if Iran attacks American forces? Many Trump supporters are said to be nervous about the prospect of American involvement in a war with Iran. Trump campaigned against the interventionist policies of the “neo-conservatives” and vowed to keep America out of “forever wars.” To go against that pledge would be seen by many of his voters as a betrayal. Politico quotes Breitbart‘s Matt Boyle: “Clearly people across the MAGA movement are watching what’s happening very closely and are concerned that any moves by globalists and neocon forces to drag the United States into another endless war in the Middle East would cause serious political damage to the president.” But it doesn’t seem as if Israel needs any help. Unlike Ukraine, which is dependent on the U.S. and Western Europe for weaponry, Israel seems to be doing fine militarily by itself. “If you want a job after college, don’t major in the humanities!” many parents have been telling their college-aged progeny. “Major in the STEM fields! Take Computer Engineering!” Well, we English majors are now vindicated. In today’s job market, Computer Engineering grads have an unemployment rate of 7.5%. Straight Computer Science has an unemployment rate of 6.1%. That’s double the rate of Art History graduates at only 3%. The overall unemployment rate in the United States is 4.2%. The most in-demand field, according to the job market for new graduates, is nutritional science, with an unemployment rate of only 0.4%. So much for the T and the E in “Stem” (technology and engineering). As for the S, the hard sciences also fare poorly. So do the Social Sciences. Here is the list of the 10 fields with the worst employment prospects: Why the poor prospects for computer experts in our computer age? One article on the subject quotes an HR expert: “Computer science majors have long been sold a dream that doesn’t match reality,” HR consultant Bryan Driscoll said. “But just like many majors and related jobs, the reality hits hard – too many grads, not enough jobs, crippling student debt, and a market that rewards pedigree over potential.” A more concrete explanation is the rise of Artificial Intelligence. One of the areas AI is pretty good at is the ability to code. Says another article on the subject: At a conference last year, Robert Goldstein, chief operating officer of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said the firm was adjusting its hiring strategy. “We have more and more conviction that we need people who majored in history, in English, and things that have nothing to do with finance or technology,” Goldstein said. This shift is partly driven by the rise of artificial intelligence, which is increasing demand for creative thinking and soft skills in the workforce. Actually, according to James Reinl of the UK Daily Mail, AI is already wreaking havoc in the job market more broadly. He quotes tech entrepreneur Alex Finn: “The AI layoffs have begun, and they’re not stopping.” He reports that Microsoft has laid off 3% of its workforce. Walmart, the nation’s biggest employer, is cutting 1,500 jobs in sales and tech. Proctor & Gamble is slashing 15% of its non-manufacturing jobs. Just to name a few. Chatbots are taking over jobs in data entry, customer service, report-writing, finance, coding, and more. “Entry-level jobs are vanishing the fastest,” Reinl reports, “stoking fears of recession and a generation of disillusioned graduates left stranded with CVs no one wants.” Michael New reports on a new Gallup Poll of Americans’ attitudes toward abortion. The percentage of respondents who identified themselves as “pro-life” ticked up two points from last year to 43%. The bad news is a huge gender gap. From the 1990s through the 2010s, men and women had pretty much the same opinions about abortion. In 2019, more men favored abortion than women. But today, only 41% of men consider themselves “pro-choice,” meaning that a majority of 59% oppose abortion (good news!). But a whopping 61% of women are “pro-choice,” meaning that only 39% oppose abortion (bad news, especially since women are the only ones who are allowed a “choice”). Ramesh Ponnuru finds another silver lining in the study. He looks at the alternatives given for the respondents to check. The poll asks, do you believe abortion should be legal “in all circumstances,” “in most circumstances,” “only in a few circumstances,” or “illegal in all circumstances.” So there are two broadly pro-abortion positions (“in all” and “in most”) and two broadly anti-abortion positions (“only in a few” and “in all”). “Historically,” he says, “the two relatively anti-abortion options have outperformed the two relatively pro-abortion ones.” In 2020, the numbers were 55% to 43% in favor of “relatively anti-abortion.” In the aftermath of Dobbs, the winner switched, with 53% to 45% in favor of “relatively pro-abortion.” These latest numbers, though, show a more even 49% to 48%, still “relatively pro-abortion,” but by a margin of only 1%. Ponnuru thinks this is a trend and that by next year, the percentages will revert closer to the historical figures. Ponnuru comments that in every year, there are more people in the “relatively anti-abortion” group than there are who identify as “pro-life.” Evidently, many of those who believe in “only a few” abortions describe themselves as “pro-choice,” despite their qualms. This at least gives pro-lifers something to work with.

Title: What to Expect From the Upcoming NATO Summit

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Will the rearmament agenda bring more security—or lead to a self-inflicted economic and social crisis? NATO is facing the greatest crisis in its history. What appears to be its strength is increasingly accelerating its internal decline. Like Mephistopheles in Goethe’s Faust, the alliance often achieves the opposite of what it intends. Nowhere is this contradiction more evident than in the lead-up to the NATO summit in The Hague, with its sweeping militarization agenda. President Donald Trump has proposed nearly doubling NATO’s military spending—to three trillion dollars, or 5 percent of GDP. European allies seem willing to follow his lead. For Germany, the implications are stark: nearly half of its federal budget—around 225 billion euros—would be directed toward military expenditures. The result would likely be a self-inflicted economic and social crisis. If enacted, such plans would fundamentally transform European societies—turning them into nations where social justice and economic stability are subordinated to military buildup. The rationale in Europe is also increasingly at odds with American intelligence assessments. While German intelligence agencies, the Bundeswehr and mainstream media and think tanks warn of a possible Russian attack in 2029, the combined threat assessments from all 17 US intelligence agencies of the last two years suggest otherwise: Russia is neither planning nor preparing a conventional attack on NATO territory. Given NATO’s overwhelming military superiority, any such move by Moscow would be suicidal. Meanwhile, transatlantic tensions over NATO’s strategic purpose are mounting. The Trump administration has pushed for an even stronger pivot toward China and, as outlined at the Washington summit in 2024, seeks to “Asianize” NATO through a web of bilateral military agreements. Trump appears interested in freezing the war in Ukraine, leaving European states to deplete their resources in a long-term standoff with Russia. While Trump favors negotiation and rejects a full-scale trade war with Moscow, European strategies increasingly aim to economically and militarily exhaust Russia. Recent EU sanctions targeting the Russian merchant fleet—aimed at halting oil exports via the Baltic Sea—risk triggering a dangerous escalation. NATO was never a neutral alliance; it was founded to project US geopolitical power. In exchange for security, European nations surrendered considerable sovereignty. Today, the alliance is buckling under the weight of its internal contradictions. In the area of trade, the USA and its European allies are on the brink of a trade conflict. Joint rearmament efforts may attempt to cover these cracks but largely benefit the military-industrial complex, which—like an addict—demands ever-greater profits. Ultimately, the costs are borne by taxpayers, with the middle class at risk of being endangered. German arms manufacturers like Rheinmetall, now in shared ownership by US investment funds such as BlackRock, Goldmann Sachs, and Stanley Morgan are poised to profit enormously. Germany’s increasingly assertive role in this dynamic is often underestimated. The government now positions itself as the military guarantor of Eastern Europe. For the first time since World War II, a German tank brigade has been stationed abroad—in Lithuania, near the Russian border. Given Germany’s historical legacy, this move signals an alarming degree of historical amnesia. The occupation policies of World War I—and the war of annihilation against the Soviet Union accompanied by genocide against Slavic peoples—remain insufficiently confronted. Today, a renewed drive for “eastern expansion” animates German policy, as seen in Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s pledge to make the Bundeswehr “Europe’s strongest army.” Historians warn that major wars often begin not with sudden acts of aggression but with prolonged rearmament and the erosion of trust. In the face of these developments, it is time to revive the call for détente and disarmament—even if, as during the Cold War, such voices are dismissed as naïve or denounced as traitorous. Every day, The Nation exposes the administration’s unchecked and reckless abuses of power through clear-eyed, uncompromising independent journalism—the kind of journalism that holds the powerful to account and helps build alternatives to the world we live in now. We have just the right people to confront this moment. Speaking on Democracy Now!, Nation DC Bureau chief Chris Lehmann translated the complex terms of the budget bill into the plain truth, describing it as “the single largest upward redistribution of wealth effectuated by any piece of legislation in our history.” In the pages of the June print issue and on The Nation Podcast, Jacob Silverman dove deep into how crypto has captured American campaign finance, revealing that it was the top donor in the 2024 elections as an industry and won nearly every race it supported. This is all in addition to The Nation’s exceptional coverage of matters of war and peace, the courts, reproductive justice, climate, immigration, healthcare, and much more.

Mumbai-based AlphaGrep Securities, known for its data-driven approach to trading and investing, has received an in-principle approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to set up a mutual fund, said the company in a statement. While not yet the final regulatory clearance, this approval is widely seen as a significant milestone toward launching its asset management business for the broader retail and institutional investor base. The final registration and operational launch are subject to the fulfilment of Sebi’s prescribed requirements. Also read: Mint Quick Edit | Are mutual fund houses over-regulated? The mutual fund operations will be managed under AlphaGrep Investment Management (AGIM), which already oversees more than ₹2,000 crore in assets and serves over 500 clients. AGIM currently manages two Sebi-registered Category III AIFs (long-short), a long-only PMS, and an outbound CAT III AIF domiciled at GIFT City. The new mutual fund business will operate under the same quantitative philosophy as AlphaGrep— combining advanced mathematical models, machine learning, and a disciplined approach to portfolio construction. The firm plans to offer a range of quant-driven actively managed products catering to diverse investor needs, including equity and hybrid strategies. Also read: Sebi engages with venture capital funds directly to smoothen transition to AIF “This development (Sebi's approval) reinforces our long-term vision of offering investors access to differentiated, systematic and quant-driven investment solutions grounded in technology and data science,” said Bhautik Ambani, chief executive officer at AlphaGrep Investment Management.

Title: BlackRock Launches $400,000,000,000 Capital Raise To Expand Portfolio – Here’s What the Firm’s Looking To Accumulate: Report

The largest asset manager in the world is reportedly gearing up to raise hundreds of billions of dollars to expand its investment horizon. BlackRock is planning to raise $400 billion from its clients in the next five years in an effort to double its operating income and stock price by 2030, the Wall Street Journal reports. The capital will be allocated to funds that invest in private equity, private credit, real estate, infrastructure and other alternative investments. BlackRock also revealed its plans to make technology and private markets comprise 30% or more of its total revenue by 2030. The move would mark a 100% growth in the amount of revenue it collects from those sectors. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is currently hoping for a doubling in shares of BlackRock as well (BLK), which are currently trading at $971 with a market cap of around $150 billion. Says Fink, “We’re singularly focused on executing these integrations to bring the breadth of BlackRock to each and every client… And with the execution, doubling operating income and stock prices, I believe is very achievable.” The CEO compares BlackRock’s current market setup to 2009, when it acquired Barclays’s iShares index-fund business. Shares of BLK have since gone up 619%. “It feels a bit like it did after we acquired BGI… I wasn’t happy with the stock price after we did that transaction. But once we proved that our whole was exponentially stronger than the parts, the stock broke out, and I believe that is going to be the case here today.” Fink also said that by 2030, BlackRock is looking to raise its revenue from $20 billion to $35 billion or more.

Title: The 5 Bullish Cases That Says Ethereum Price Could Reach $10,000 In 2025
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bullish-ethereum-price-10000/

With the Ethereum price still trending low at $2,500, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the altcoin and where it could be headed. Mostly, expectations have fallen into the negative territory, with many predicting that it will continue its decline from here. However, there are some who continue to hold out hope for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap to end up outperforming the likes of Bitcoin, and reaching the 5-figure territory this year. Amid the prevalent bearish sentiment surrounding the Ethereum price, crypto analyst Ash Crypto has remained steadfast in their belief that the altcoin is still destined for great things. Taking to the X (formerly Twitter) platform, the analyst gave a bold $10,000 prediction, backing it up with reasons why he believes that this target is attainable for Ethereum in the year 2025. A number of reasons were given for why the crypto analyst expects the Ethereum price to rise 4x from its current level, and adoption was at the top of the list. Ash Crypto first points out the notable institutional buying that has been going on and how this is a precursor of what could be coming. Mainly, the majority of the buying has been happening through ETF issues such as BlackRock, with large buys occurring over the last few weeks. During the time of the post, the analyst noted that these institutions had scooped up $240 million in ETH in just minutes, showing the buying trend was escalating. Furthermore, he pointed out that these institutions were not just buying Ethereum for the sake of it. But rather, they were making large bets on the altcoin’s future. The major bet is the fact that they expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to actually approve ETH staking for ETF issuers, and if this happens, it has major implications for the price. Giving a list of things that would happen when the SEC approves ETH staking for ETF issuers, the crypto analyst points to the fact that they would be able to earn yield on their investments. This would also make Ethereum the biggest technology in crypto, as staking brings more adoption. Next on the list is the fact that this would allow trillions of dollars in real-world assets (RWAs) to be moved on-chain to Ethereum, thus boosting usage and adoption. Then, with the Ethereum deflationary supply being driven by the fee burn mechanism, supply is expected to shrink, and as demand rises, the value of ETH does as well. Last but not least would be the fact that staking approval would allow institutions to earn passive income from staking ETH. This means that in addition to the returns they expect to get as the Ethereum price rises, they would also be getting extra income from staking the coins and keeping them locked up. “Smart money moves before the retail,” the analyst stated.

Title: Spiritans commit to redress scheme for school abuse survivors in attempt to ‘offer atonement’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2025/06/16/spiritans-commit-to-redress-scheme-for-school-abuse-survivors-in-attempt-to-offer-atonement/
Time Published: 2025-06-16T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
The head of the religious congregation behind Blackrock College and other prominent schools has made a public commitment to paying redress to survivors of abuse in the schools. In an open letter to survivors of abuse by members and employees of the Spiritan congregation, Provincial Fr Brendan Carr announced “a restorative framework which we hope can help all to arrive at a different place in this painful and difficult journey”. This, he said, was prepared “with the help of Restore Together, One Voice, and other significant advocates and individuals who were abused in our schools and other contexts, who have engaged directly with us”. It “acknowledges the abuses, failures and omissions of the past, refocuses on the present needs of those who suffered and those carrying pain and allows all to look to and find peace and a different and better future where humanly possible”. The Spiritans, he said, had established a “finance advisory team, with the expertise to lead a strategic restructuring of the Province’s assets”. It would “fast-track the development of sustainable funding streams, including immediate and medium-term provisions for redress”. By last November, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including the 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published last September. [ Spiritans accused of putting own interests before those of abuse victimsOpens in new window ] In the past when it came to redress, Fr Carr said, the congregation “engaged through what we understood to be the standard mechanism available – legal negotiations conducted between legal representatives for the Spiritans and the persons making the legal claims”. He acknowledged this “was not an adequate response for those seeking safe and healing space for victims/survivors”. “Advocates and victim-led representations have taught us that a different redress scheme was needed – one that was victim-centred, less adversarial and faster.” He added that, notwithstanding the expected Government commission of investigation into abuse in schools and its pledge of redress for survivors, “we Spiritans believe we have a moral and collective obligation to respond to and offer atonement” to those “whose lives were severely impacted”. The agreed framework contains four elements which, as well as redress, offers survivors meetings with Spiritan representatives who would acknowledge what happened and apologise, as well as therapy and counselling, and a commitment to memorialise both the suffering of survivors and atonement by Spiritans. [ Spiritans have paid €8.8m in settlements to 125 abuse survivors since 1998Opens in new window ] Fr Carr said the redress scheme was “but one part of our sincere endeavour and commitment to be accountable at this time for what happened in another time”. “Child sexual abuse is a devastating crime. It shatters the lives of victims and causes deep and lasting harm to families and friends,” he said, adding that such abuse “also profoundly affects school communities”. “I want to publicly acknowledge this impact and offer apology and empathy to the current principals, staff, students and parents of Spiritan schools,” he said. “Too often, you have found yourselves having to respond to situations in which you had no involvement and over which you had no control. I, of course, extend this apology to the volunteers and employees of SET [Spiritan Education Trust], the body that runs Spiritan schools.” It was his “sincere hope”, Fr Carr said, that by the end of the summer he could “provide a further, more detailed update of the progress we are making in forging new paths to create a just redress scheme”. Advocacy group Restore Together described the Spiritan statement as “a step in the right direction that urgently needs to be substantiated by actions”. Spokesperson Philip Feddis said: “Victims/survivors will judge the statement based on actions and how soon they receive restorative justice in its entirety with a redress scheme the most urgent and important element. Delivery of the full restorative justice programme is already long overdue for victims/survivors who have been burdened for decades while it is already too late for many.” The group said it would be willing to work with the Spiritans to progress the redress process. It also wants to see a testimony and truth telling process established and the memorialisation of the suffering endured by victims.

Title: Why The Market Is Ready For A Solana ETF With Staking
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hadleystern/2025/06/15/why-the-market-is-ready-for-a-solana-etf-with-staking/
Time Published: 2025-06-15T22:37:49Z

ByHadley Stern ByHadley Stern, Contributor. Canary Marinade Solana ETF S-1 The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly asked prospective Solana ETF issuers to submit amended S-1 forms, raising questions about whether a Solana ETF could be approved this year. If so, it could have massive implications for the entire crypto market. In contrast, it took 10+ years for U.S. investors to be able to invest in a Bitcoin ETF, a decade of struggle that included a lawsuit, countless education initiatives and meetings with regulators resulting in one of the biggest ETF launches ever. Ethereum showed up pretty soon after (but with no staking, more on that later). The SEC approved the listing of spot Ethereum ETFs in May 2024. Now we may find ourselves on the very cusp of a Solana ETF being approved, which is incredibly important to the longterm acceptance and adoption of digital assets in America. Bitcoin’s story was all about the underlying investment being a sort of digital gold. Solana has a different story, and one that is critical for U.S. technical innovation. Solana is a blockchain that people actually use for more than savings and, due to its speed and efficiency for actually building applications. According to the blockchain data published via Dune Analytics, there were roughly 5.5 million Solana wallet accounts with daily activity in May 2025. Choosing to invest in Solana is, in many ways, like choosing to invest in a technology company. There are a myriad of quantitative data points that show the chain is being utilized and there are countless qualitative examples too. Many of those transactions are processed by companies like the crypto exchange Gemini or the infrastructure and investment firm Sol Strategies, which earn revenue from staking assets and validating the chain, with the average daily gas (fee) revenue in April 2025 yielding around $1.2 million. Gate data estimates the total monthly fee revenue reached roughly $37.5 million. Right now Solana users include a healthy mix of DeFi activity, NFTs, and, increasingly, real world assets being brought on chain. Moodys, Societe Generale, R3, Securitize, Franklin Templeton and BlackRock are all building and releasing products on Solana. All of this is why the timing is right for a Solana ETF. What makes the case for a Solana ETF a little more complicated is that, unlike Ethereum, where the staking reward hovers around 2%, the Solana staking reward of +8% cannot be ignored. Remember my mention of Ethereum staking earlier? When the Ethereum ETFs were finally approved last year (under the Biden administration), the SEC required issuers to strip out staking. With Solana’s high staking return it is imperative that the SEC not only approve a Solana spot ETF, but, in fairness to investors, an ETF that stakes. Apart from the return dynamics, another important consideration is that Solana requires Solana in a proof-of-stake system to run the network. Right now, according to Blockworks, 6% of bitcoin is locked up in ETFs (which is incredible in and of itself). If that were to happen to Solana, and that SOL could not be staked, it could cause network issues as more and more SOL tokens became unavailable to the network. The SEC recently released guidance on staking, which appears to support native staking (the best and safest way to an ETF to stake). This, along with a request for comment on S1 filings appears to indicate approval is imminent. Approval will be a great way for a set of investors to access Solana in a new way–supporting the network–and allowing them to participate in the likely future growth of the network.

Mr Higgins signalled that he does not plan to go quietly into retirement ahead of his second and final term in Áras an Uachtaráin ending in November. He said he believed there was “no point in what is left of my own life, and all of the rest of it, pretending it is just an ordinary period of time”. “It is a dangerous period of time when democracy itself is under threat,” he said. Mr Higgins was applauded for his remarks which he made to a crowd of some 500 people who gathered in the grounds of the Áras on Sunday to mark Bloomsday, a celebration of James Joyce. He said the Ulysses author lived through two World Wars and was anti-war. The President urged the world not to forget the fate of the people of Gaza even while attention turned to the conflict between Israel and Iran. “Why has it taken so long to bring food and medicine and water to do those who need it?” he asked regarding the situation in Gaza. “It was a great human failure. I will have opportunities to address those subjects again.” Mr Higgins’s commentary on Gaza has previously drawn the ire of the Israeli government, but he has repeatedly said criticising Israel’s actions is not anti-Semitism and to suggest otherwise is a “disgrace and a slander”. The President also criticised the “dangerous authoritarianism” that has impacted American academia since at Trump administration took charge. “What that authoritarianism promises us is a life without the arts, without the contribution of artists, limited public opportunities for sharing cultural experiences and of never being lifted to transcendence by performance in its many forms,” he said. “Such a life will constitute a much diminished existence, an unfulfilling encounter with life, one devoid of beauty, creativity and human expression. It must be called out for that which it others.” Mr Higgins said his most pleasant days in the Áras involved being surrounded by musicians and other performers. Straw boaters, strawberries and even a smattering of sunshine marked his final celebration of Bloomsday, marking June 16th, 1904, the day that Joyce met Nora Barnacle and immortalised in Ulysses. Regarding Joyce, Mr Higgins said he hoped his term in office would “repair, or at least gently redress, the often strained relationship between Ireland and one of its most brilliant – and most exiled – sons”. In the course of 14 years as President, he had seen Joyce’s grandson Stephen’s final wish fulfilled. The Joyce poem A Flower Given to My Daughter was inscribed on the family grave in Fluntern cemetery in Zurich, Switzerland, in honour of the author’s daughter Lucia Joyce. Mr Higgins visited Joyce’s grave in Zurich in 2018 and in January of last year he unveiled a plaque in Galway’s Rahoon cemetery marking the grave of Michael ‘Sonny’ Bodkin and its connection to Barnacle, Joyce and his masterpiece The Dead. He also awarded the Presidential Distinguished Service Award to Dr Fritz Senn and Prof Enrico Terrinoni for their contributions to Joycean scholarship. Prof Terrinoni brought Ulysses to new life for Italian readers with his translation of the work in 2021. The garden party featured a play, Ulysses aWake, from a Blackrock-based street theatre group written by Nastaise Leddy and Iris Park. Singer Noel O’Grady sang three songs, one of which he dedicated to the singer Johnny Duhan, who tragically drowned last November.

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Dark orange glowing wireframe bull on stock market diagram background Let’s invest like private equity pros without needing seven figures. Yes, that’s right—PE-style starting for as little as $8. Plus, yields up to nearly 13%. No special access or options trades needed. Just a few clicks through our brokerage accounts buying regular ol’ tickers. The sneaky dividend-dishing subjects? Meet business development companies (BDCs), publicly-traded firms that lend to small businesses. BDCs were invented by Congress years ago to create a new type of lender to small businesses. They were also given the same mandate as real estate investment trusts (REITs): Return at least 90% of taxable income back to shareholders in the form of dividends. And man, do they pay or what? BDC Yields Let’s dive into three compelling BDCs that not only dish big dividends but also trade for less than the sum of their parts. BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC) is a middle-market lender that favors middle-market companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $1.5 billion. It has a fairly diverse portfolio of 146 companies across several “less-cyclical” industries. TCPC’s investment mix is heaviest in first-lien debt, at 83% of the portfolio; second-lien debt is another 7%, and 10% of its deals (at fair value) are in equity. The vast majority of its debt (94%) is floating-rate in nature, which is typical for many BDCs. That has its upsides and downsides. In a normal rising-rate environment (think 2015-19, not 2022-23), rising rates are generally good for BDCs that work heavily with floating-rate debt. The potential for declining rates (or actually declining rates)? Not so good. Also, as one might have guessed, TCPC has a connection to BlackRock (BLK)—specifically, it’s externally managed by an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock (BLK). This connection allows it to access BlackRock’s many resources, which in theory should make it a particularly competitive BDC. TCPC Total Returns I warned in November 2024 that BlackRock TCPC keeping its base dividend flat for a fifth consecutive quarter raised “a little concern that TCPC’s dividend might be plateauing.” Three months later, the BDC pulled the rug out from under its investors with a drastic dividend cut. That’s despite a practice of pairing its base dividend with special dividends as profits allow. BlackRock TCPC’s declines have opened up a generous 13% discount to NAV. And even with the reduced 25-cent-per-share base dividend (and an already announced 4-cent special dividend for Q1), the stock still yields a sky-high 13%. But TCPC hasn’t exactly fixed what got it here. The dividend is more affordable, and the company’s adviser is waiving a third of its fee through Q3. But it’s still thick in non-accruals (loans that are delinquent for a prolonged period, usually 90 days), which even after improving this past quarter sit at an elevated 12.6% and 4.4% of the portfolio at cost and at fair value, respectively. Crescent Capital BDC (CCAP) is another BDC that’s paired with (and enjoys the resources of) a larger investment company. Crescent Capital BDC is tied to global credit investment firm Crescent Capital Group, which itself specializes in below-investment-grade credit strategies. CCAP currently invests in 191 portfolio companies, with a penchant for private middle market companies. It’s predominantly U.S.-focused, though it does have 9% portfolio exposure to Europe and a thin 2% exposure to Australian companies. It’s similar to TCPC in that it primarily deals in first-lien debt (91%), and the vast majority (97%) is floating-rate in nature. The last time I looked at CCAP, I mentioned that it has quite the oddball dividend history: I’m afraid the dividend picture hasn’t become any less complicated since then. Crescent Capital has kept up with its 42-cent-per-share base dividend. But the action in its special dividends has changed. The variable supplemental dividends, which had been around for six quarters, disappeared at the start of this year. At the same time, CCAP announced 5-cent specials for the first, second, and third quarters—but they’re related to undistributed taxable income. So while it looks like CCAP’s variable supplemental has just gotten a little smaller, in reality, it’s not paying any supplementals (or, at least, it hasn’t for the past two quarters). Those supplementals might not return for some time, either. Wall Street is increasingly worried about rate compression among BDCs, for one. CCAP itself, meanwhile, is running into increasing credit issues, a spate of new non-accruals, and the winding-down of the Logan joint venture, which was providing CCAP with some cash flows. At least investors are being realistic about Crescent Capital’s dimming prospects of late, driving shares down to a wild 23% discount to NAV. This normally defensively positioned BDC hardly looks like the pinnacle of health right now, but a discount that deep (plus an 11% yield on the base dividend alone) could attract some bargain hunters. I’ll start with PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (PFLT), which targets midsized companies that are “profitable, growing and cash-flowing,” with a specific focus on firms that generate $10 million to $50 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Currently, PFLT’s portfolio is 190 companies wide, and those 190 companies are supported by roughly 110 private equity sponsors. And while some BDCs are happy to invest in a wide variety of companies, “value-added” BDCs that lend expertise tend to be more selective. In this case, PennantPark Floating Rate’s interests lie in five primary categories: health care, software and technology, consumer, business services and government services. Most important, however, is what gives PennantPark Floating Rate Capital its name. While BDCs often deal with floating-rate first-lien debt, PFLT takes it to the max: About 90% of the portfolio is first-lien debt, virtually all of which is floating-rate in nature. (The remaining 10% is split 80/20 between equity co-investments and joint venture equity.) As I mentioned before, the Fed’s flattening and eventual reduction in interest rates took a toll on many BDCs. PFLT Total Returns PFLT trades at a 6% discount to NAV; that’s nice, but it almost feels like an optimistic valuation given the uncertainty facing the rate environment and PennantPark right now. On the upside, PFLT is actually a monthly dividend payer, and a generous one, too, at nearly 12%. On the downside, coverage of that dividend is getting awfully tight. In fiscal 2024 (its year ends in September), PFLT paid $1.23 per share on net interest income of $1.27 per share (a 97% NII payout ratio), generated from profits of $1.18 per share. It’s expected to earn $1.21 per share and $1.18 per share over the next two years, and we can reasonably expect NII to be proportional. That’s OK (not great) if all goes well, but a lot hinges on what the Federal Reserve does next—an open question. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Real-Life N.Y.C. Matchmaker Critiques Dakota Johnson's 'Materialists' (Exclusive)

Atsushi Nishijima/A24 In Materialists, Dakota Johnson plays Lucy, a successful Manhattan matchmaker to the wealthy who's become cynical about true love and marriage in her own life. A love triangle soon forms, with Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans up for grabs, but the film stays mostly interested in analyzing matchmaking and modern dating: Can one find a lasting connection by checking boxes and aligning algorithms? Maria Avgitidis, a fourth-generation professional matchmaker based in New York City, saw Materialists — and she has strong views on its portrayal of her industry. "I don't see myself in this," Avgitidis tells PEOPLE. "I was trying to warn some matchmakers: 'I know you're about to throw a whole movie screening for this. Tread carefully.' I don't know what else to tell you." Writer-director Celine Song, who earned an Oscar nomination for her 2023 romantic drama Past Lives, got the inspiration for Materialists from the six months she spent 10 years ago working at Tawkify, a large-scale matchmaking service. "I feel like I learned more in those six months about people than I learned from any other period of my life," Song said in notes shared with press, comparing the work she did at the time to being a "stock market trader." Jolene Siana; Macmillan "The things that are in the movie came from the truth I learned: that there is a very funny, very dark objectification of each other's humanity, and therefore a very real commodification of each other, as we go through this thing that we call dating,” she added. "But it's supposed to be in pursuit of love." Avgitidis runs a boutique matchmaking company called Agape that takes on about 15 clients at any given time, and she estimates to have secured "thousands" of marriages over the course of her career. Here, Avgitidis — also the author of the new book Ask a Matchmaker: Matchmaker Maria's No-Nonsense Guide to Finding Love — breaks down some of the things Materialists gets right and wrong about real-life matchmaking. Warning: Materialist spoilers ahead! Atsushi Nishijima PEOPLE: Dakota Johnson's character Lucy says early in the film that she makes $80,000 per year as a New York City matchmaker. Does that sound right? MARIA AVGITIDIS: Yeah, that's pretty accurate as it pertains to employees of a matchmaking service. Lucy is shown handing out business cards to strangers, hoping to find more clients to set up. Is that a common tactic? Maybe that happened before 2008, but... I let people come to me. There is a stigma with matchmakers that only desperate people will use them, and that's not true. I have always taken the inbound marketing approach. Even before social media, I was out at bars and I would use the Foursquare app and I called myself Matchmaker Maria, so people knew "there's a matchmaker in the room, let me go talk to her." But that chasing someone down on the street, that's not something that I've ever done. I do know certain matchmakers do it. And they do it on LinkedIn. Is the matchmaking service's office setup realistic? Do colleagues celebrate a successful coupling with cake and a party? That's movie world. My office was in the Empire State Building on the 59th floor for years. We left it during the pandemic. None of our clients now want to meet us in the office; they'll want to meet us out or mostly over Zoom. [Lucy is] at a public cafe. That's crazy to have those really personal conversations at a public cafe. That's not something I would do in 2025. When she gets the cake, that to me is so hilarious because between my matchmaking and my dating advice, I have thousands of weddings under my belt, and it's like you're celebrating your ninth wedding, which I think is amazing. But I've never thought to get a cake. In my office, they do a little shimmy dance and then we go back to the next client. Do you often get invited to clients' weddings, like Lucy does in the film? She's even shown having a one-on-one with a bride-to-be having cold feet. I'm so far away from that first date to when they finally get married. Some of them even kind of forget how they met. I've been invited to weddings. I've attended maybe two. But I'm not saving anyone's day. I'm not in the wedding party. I acknowledge that I'm extremely far away from the day they go down the aisle. I am not even part of that conversation. I've been invited to many weddings. I used to hang the wedding invitations in my office. But I've only been to two because I felt like I had a connection with that person that would warrant me to go. Does there ever become blurred lines where clients become friends? It's always professional. I also have to respect my own boundaries — I have other people that need me in my personal time, despite me being a professional in the personal space. Still, I've set up, I think, now over 7,000 first dates. I am stressed out most nights between 7 and 9 p.m. because I think about, "Oh my God, my client's on a date right now." Are the types of clients shown in the film similar to who you have worked with? It was 50% accurate, in the sense that there are people that have extreme dating fatigue and they're just like, "Look, I've waited this long, just find me the person," so they'll come with those lists. But then there's the other clients. Like 80% of my clients are busy New Yorkers who just don't have time to participate in modern dating on apps. So a lot of my clients might work at Goldman or BlackRock or they might be entrepreneurs or business owners or exactly like Pedro Pascal's character. They're just doing stuff and they're not online and they're the kind of people that would hire us, just like they would hire a personal trainer or a personal chef, they're also going to hire a matchmaker to help them with this. Atsushi Nishijima/A24 In the film, one of Lucy's clients is sexually assaulted while on an arranged first date. When Lucy finds out, her boss makes it seem like this is somewhat of a common occurrence. Does this happen often? I've never had that happen. I've had to fire clients for being bad on dates two times in my 17-year career, but they were able to admit, "You know what, Maria? Yeah, that was really inappropriate behavior." But it was not sexual assault. I did ask three colleagues, "Have you ever heard this happening to another person?" They're like, "No." I'm sure it happens. In dating, it happens. I want to believe that there's no assault or abuse in this. People are their own people. I understand what the employer's trying to say, but at the same time it was just kind of presented as a normal thing. I just want you to know that if that had actually happened, it would be— The industry has a monthly call as part of our trade association. This would be a thing that we would be discussing and having presentations over of how do we prevent this from happening again and what can we do to be a strong resource for the person who got assaulted? They would talk about the lawyers. This would be a thing. And I'm pretty sure at our next trade association meeting in July, this is what's going to be talked about. Could a matchmaking service be held liable, with lawyers getting involved like in the movie? I don't blame Lucy for that woman getting assaulted. Even in a matchmaking contract, if that happened, I'm not liable because you also have to take some personal responsibility of what happens on a date. You still have to show up to the date location that we told you and then you have to run home like you're Cinderella. I don't want anyone making out or having sex on a first date because that would make me a wildly different service. So this is a communication that you have to have with as a client and a potential match. "Here's how it works: You're going on the date, the following morning, 8 a.m. there's a feedback email in your inbox. You have to tell us how it went and I'm going to hear from both parties so I can know what to do next." I think my brain melted, that [the sexual assault storyline] was the main plot point of the movie. I'm like, "Oh, this is not a romantic comedy." I was like, "This needs a trigger warning." For me, watching this as a matchmaker employer, I was just thinking about the liability. I went home thinking, "Do I need to get liability insurance? What is this?" After Lucy learns about the assault, she gets emotional and runs to the bathroom with her notebook and looks at what she jotted down about the man. What did you make of that scene? It looks like there's only three sentences written. I remember thinking these are really superficial things to write about someone, like their age, what age range they want to date in. I don't know if she even wrote down his religion or any values or interests. Just two sentences were scribbled out. When we meet matches for our clients, that's at least a one-hour conversation, and we write essays. We ask questions to get to know our client in a more granular level because at the end of the day when we set up our clients, yes, the numbers are there — that's the easy s---. That's the quantifiable stuff. That's the drop-down menu that you selected. The vetting process as a matchmaker is a hard one. We want to make sure that you align on your communication patterns, on your values, on your long-term goals. When I saw those three sentences, my immediate thought as a person who employs matchmakers was, "This is a fireable offense." Like, immediate fireable offense. I've fired employees for less. There is this sort of accountability that happens with a matchmaker. So I see that paper, I see that she's only written three sentences, and my thought as an employer is, "You didn't get to know the person you set your client up with." That scene was, I think, the most pivotal. I was just like, "Wow, you didn't do your job. You set up this person with a stranger." Atsushi Nishijima/A24 What are Lucy's other fireable offenses that wouldn't fly in the real world? Perhaps personally seeking out the former client who was assaulted to speak about it? There's another one. Now you've gotten lawyers involved and you've decided to put on a trench coat— that was the dumbest thing by the way. She'll have a trench coat on, so now I can stalk you in the West Village or wherever that was. She's stalking her and she's running over to her, and I'm just like, oh my God. The lawsuit! Lucy is depicted as cynical, becoming jaded and rethinking her future as a matchmaker. Does that happen frequently with people getting into this line of work? If you're not a matchmaker for at least 18 months, you're not a matchmaker because there is burnout in this industry, and you will see that 18-month mark is a real thing. You need emotional bandwidth to deal with people's personal pickiness, personal wish list, personal delusion. I mean, that's all of us. We all have it. It's easy to take people's money; it's really hard to service them. Look, there are people who quit. There have been moments, especially in the last three months for me, where I'm like, "This client is driving me crazy. He's become so picky. He's hired four other services at the same time and I just don't know how I'm going to meet this expectation." Is it typical for a matchmaker to be so concerned with numbers and compatibility probabilities? I would think they're passionate about the concept of true love. I believe that a lot of matchmakers, if not almost all matchmakers I've ever met, really do believe in love. They're at that wedding [at the end] and she goes on this monologue about how in two years they'll be resentful of each other and eventually they'll divorce. I'm like, you're in the wrong industry, babe. Go become a life coach. You have to meet people where they're at. All you can do is cheerlead for them throughout the way. That's it. All you can do is root for them. You can't make promises that you're going to get married. It's not possible to do that. That was insane that she was doing that. All you can do is hope that they have a better dating experience with you than they have had on their own. What's something you want moviegoers who see Materialists to know about matchmaking? I've always said that should you decide you want to hire a matchmaker, just remember that your first match has to be with your matchmaker and that there are different matchmakers for different kinds of people. Most matchmakers have their own niche. Ask them about their methodology of how they find matches. It can't just be off the street as a matchmaker. I'm a fourth-generation matchmaker, and the one thing that really great matchmakers know how to do is build community, because that's what's going to find the matches, right? I didn't realize [Materialists] was going to talk so much about matchmaking, but if they were, it would've been nice to see the matchmaker as the community-builder, because that is what my grandmother and great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother were. They were community builders in war-torn countries who still were able to match people. Even now people are experiencing dating fatigue. A matchmaker is still there to build the community for you to gain access to. That's what it is. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Materialists is in theaters now. Maria Avgitidis' book Ask a Matchmaker: Matchmaker Maria's No-Nonsense Guide to Finding Love is out now.

The fund has been one of the great investment success stories, cracking $70 billion in assets under management in just 341 days, faster than any of the thousands of funds in the ETF industry's 32-year history. IBIT's popularity reflects not only of the $11.6 trillion asset management giant's brand strength but also the growing embrace by once crypto shy investment advisors and other institutions. "The fact that you have advisors and institutions adopting it (crypto ETFs) this quickly is a good sign," Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt. "These are bigger fish that don't bite quickly. Usually, it takes years for them to get interested in an ETF, because it means liquidity. These are some of the hardest investors to attract." Balchunas added: "Advisors and institutions, they're just more sophisticated." Nice look at the breakdown of holders of the spot bitcoin ETFs via 13F filings. Advisor has surged up the list now #1 by a mile. These 13F filers make up 20% of total assets, but IMO that is likely to rise to 35-40% as more adoption comes (esp from wirehouses) via @JSeyff pic.twitter.com/JgxM4zmaex — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 4, 2025 A Bloomberg Intelligence report earlier this month found that investment advisors filing 13-F reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hold about 20% of the spot Bitcoin ETF shares–roughly $21 billion of the asset—and Balchunas says the percentage is likely to double in the next year. Advisor' holdings in the asset, which have grown dramatically, rank number one "by a mile," with hedge fund managers and brokerages falling in behind, Balchunas noted in a June 9 X post. Balchunas said that roughly 1,200 13-F filers held IBIT shares. "That's insane," he told Decrypt. The growth has come as the Trump administration has loosened regulation and introduced more crypto friendly policies, sparking sizable price gains in BTC and major altcoins. Bitcoin was recently trading near $105,000, a 12% gain year-to-date that has far outstripped equity indexes and most other risk-on assets–a reality not lost on investors whose appetite for digital assets and products based on them has mushroomed. Financial advisor interest in crypto ETFs, as a result, has heated up. A study of financial advisors released in January by crypto-focused asset manager Bitwise and financial services data provider VettaFi found that nearly one in five advisors were planning to allocate crypto to investor accounts in 2025, double the percentage in the previous year, and that nearly all of the 400 advisors surveyed said they had received a question about crypto over that period. Ric Edelman, a long-time financial advisor and founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, a trade group, told Decrypt that the friendlier political environment for digital assets and advisors' determination to learn more about them are behind the trend. "You can't recommend something you don't know anything about," Edelman said. "Advisors are racing to increase their knowledge so they can provide reasonable advice to the client that's in the client's best interest. Simultaneously, firms recognize that this is a huge opportunity to increase their AUM, because clients are going to buy Bitcoin—and if they're not going to be able to buy it from the firm, they're going to go buy it somewhere else." At a conference last week, Edelman called for advisors to allot a minimum of 10% in digital assets for cautious portfolios and as much as 40% for more enterprising accounts, a departure from traditional 60-40 splits in stocks and bonds, and an increase from his previous recommendation that investors should allocate single digits to crypto. "The allocation model you're familiar with—stocks and bonds—must now be replaced by one featuring stocks, crypto, and bonds," Edelman told an audience of independent financial advisors at the VISION event in Arlington, Texas. Edelman told Decrypt that IBIT's ranking for AUM well atop the other 10 funds in the spot Bitcoin category stems from brand recognition. "When institutional investors engage for the first time, it is the path of least resistance for approval by the board and the C-suite," he said. "If you're going to engage in an investment in a new asset class that most have limited experience or knowledge about, you can diffuse some of the concerns by choosing one of the best known brands, and that's BlackRock. BlackRock is the beneficiary of its brand." ETF.com Senior Analyst Sumit Roy also expects the momentum of crypto funds to grow as investors seek exposure to digital assets without the risk and responsibility of holding them directly. "More adventurous investors have been able to get exposure through crypto trading platforms like Coinbase and OTC vehicles like GBTC (prior to its ETF conversion) for a long time," Roy said. "Advisors and institutions have been much slower to adopt crypto given the risks and lack of regulatory protections." "Now with regulated ETFs," he added, "those professionals are entering the space and I'd expect them to continue to march slowly into these funds."

Title: Obituary: Carmencita Hederman, former lord mayor of Dublin, city councillor, senator and environmental campaigner

Carmencita Hederman Former lord mayor of Dublin, city councillor, senator and environmental campaigner Carmencita Hederman has died at the age of 85. Her 25 years as an elected representative began when she won a seat as an independent member of Dublin City Council in 1974. She used the soundtrack from the Georges Bizet opera Carmen in her campaign and topped the poll in the Pembroke electoral area. She was born Carmencita Cruess-Callaghan on October 23, 1939, into a family in Blackrock, Co Dublin, headed by bacteriological chemist Dr George Cruess-Callaghan and his wife Ita. Carmencita later studied at Trinity College Dublin. Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid had banned members of his Catholic congregation from attending TCD, but gave Carmencita a dispensation to enrol as a student there. French and Italian were among the subjects she took and she went on to acquire a Master’s degree in July 1969. Earlier, in St Patrick’s Church, Blackrock, on June 26, 1962, she married William (Billy) Hederman, a respected doctor and surgeon from Croom, Co Limerick, who served as president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) in 1990-92. The couple bought a house on Leeson Street while on honeymoon. In April 1968, when a draft city development plan proposed rezoning the area into office blocks, a letter of opposition she wrote to The Irish Times galvanised her neighbours and a group called Upper Leeson Street Area Residents Association was formed, which successfully campaigned to keep the zone for residential-use only. ​On June 22, 1987, she was elected lord mayor of Dublin, succeeding Bertie Ahern. Hederman garnered support from a “rainbow coalition” of Fine Gael, Labour, Workers’ Party, Progressive Democrats and three Independents, including the late Tony Gregory, and won by a single vote over Fianna Fáil’s Ned Brennan, who was tipped as the favourite. The first woman to hold the post in 30 years, during her 12 months in office she played a leading role in Dublin’s millennium celebrations of 1988, marking the takeover of the city by the Irish from the Vikings. She was a strong opponent of what she called “destructive dual carriageways” in the city centre and their effect on inner-city communities. In August 1989, she was elected as an Independent member of Seanad Éireann on the Dublin University Panel along with Shane Ross and David Norris. She found it a difficult place to make significant progress on issues and did not stand in the next general election. Hederman was very interested in running as an Independent candidate for president of Ireland in 1990. Securing a nomination requires the support of at least four local councils or 20 members of the Oireachtas. She discussed the matter at an early stage with then-Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes, who was prepared to consider nominating her if she joined the party and ran as a Fine Gael candidate. “She would have liked to be a candidate, but she wasn’t prepared to adopt the party label,” he said last week. The party later nominated Austin Currie and the successful candidate was Mary Robinson. More recently, in light of events in Gaza, she supported the successful campaign for TCD to divest from Israeli organisations and academic institutions and companies operating in Occupied Palestine and on the United Nations’ blacklist. She was a mother of five children and grandmother of nine. Her daughter, Wendy, was elected to Dublin City Council as a Progressive Democrat candidate for the Pembroke area in 2004. She was involved in key local issues, but retired from politics in 2007. Predeceased by her husband Billy in 2016, Carmencita Hederman passed away peacefully at the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook, on May 31.

Title: $298 mln Ethereum liquidated across 80K traders: Yet BlackRock keeps buying

With Open Interest at $35B, is this the beginning of ETH’s stealth rally? Ethereum [ETH]’s market performance took a sharp hit on the 13th of June, plunging by 9% and liquidating $298 million across 80,000 traders. While panic gripped much of the market, opportunistic investors saw value in the decline, scooping up ETH under the $2,500 mark. The asset dropped from $2,771 to a low of $2,443 before stabilizing near $2,509. Trade war anxieties fueled the broader sell-off, but a closer look reveals bullish undercurrents. Open Interest surged to $35.22 billion in just 24 hours, with top exchanges like CME, Binance, Gate, and Bitget each seeing an average of $4 billion in ETH exposure. This coincided with a modest recovery of ETH’s price to $2,538.66 at press time, up 0.37% according to CoinMarketCap. Moreover, amidst heightened market volatility, a major Ethereum whale has signaled strong bullish conviction by opening a substantial $16.6 million long position. Despite these mixed signals, BlackRock, currently the largest asset manager globally with $73 billion in crypto exposure, has consistently bought Ethereum daily for over two weeks. This follows BlackRock’s announcement about its goal to significantly expand influence across both public and private markets, with a plan to boost revenue from $20 billion in 2023 to over $35 billion by 2030. If realized, this growth could further solidify BlackRock’s role in shaping institutional investment trends across traditional and crypto assets alike. This pattern of strategic buying from deep-pocketed entities suggests a long-term outlook that sees current price levels as an opportunity rather than a risk. Remarking on the same, Jeremy noted, “BlackRock has been buying Ethereum every single day for the past two weeks. They’ve now accumulated $570M worth of $ETH. Smart money isn’t slowing down, they’re doubling down.” As optimism continues to build around Ethereum, institutional accumulation has become increasingly evident. Data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that BlackRock now holds over 1.5 million ETH, valued at approximately $3.83 billion, cementing its position as a dominant force in the Ethereum market. In fact, SharpLink Gaming also recently purchased 176,271 ETH worth $463 million, positioning itself as the top publicly listed Ethereum holder. Additionally, ETH ETFs also saw inflows surging until June, and thus, the question arises: Is Ethereum poised for another rally? Well, technical indicators like RSI and MACD are both below neutral levels, which points to lingering bearish pressure. However, Lookonchain data revealed that whale accumulation of ETH, which points to growing bullish momentum ahead. Source: Lookonchain/X In conclusion, IntoTheBlock data further confirmed the upcoming bullish move as over 77% of ETH holders are currently in profit, which may reflect strong holder confidence and hint at potential upward momentum in the near term.

Title: Four males charged after father 'savagely' beaten during home burglary, court hears

A 60-YEAR-OLD FATHER was “savagely” beaten in front of his terrified family when three machine gun-armed intruders forced entry into their home in Shankill, Dublin, on Wednesday, gardaí have alleged. Two 17-year-old boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and Sean Doran, 26, of Earl Street South and widower Gregory Dunne, 60, from Oliver Bond Flats, both in Dublin 8, were charged with aggravated burglary at a residence in Shanganagh Cliffs, Shankill, Co Dublin and unlawful possession of a Czechoslovakian-made 9mm Skorpian machine pistol. Both charges carry maximum life sentences. Dublin District Court heard the Garda ballistics section stated the gun was “capable of full automatic firing”. Mr Doran has an additional charge of assault causing harm to the 60-year-old homeowner, who suffered lacerations from blows to his face and head. Evidence stated that he, his wife, aged 63, and their 35-year-old son were in “grave fear” they would not remain in the house, had moved to a hotel, and were not called to give evidence in the bail hearing. It follows arrests by Gardai from the Dublin Metropolitan East Crime Functioning Area, covering Dún Laoghaire, Shankill, Cabinteely, Blackrock and Dundrum. Judge Michele Finan refused bail when they appeared at Dublin District Court on Saturday. They will appear again next week. Each accused separately faced lengthy bail hearings where gardai cited the seriousness of the case, maintaining all four acted in joint enterprise. Concerns were raised about alleged threats and violence used during the incident. One officer submitted it was necessary to refuse bail to preserve the integrity of the proceedings. Garda witnesses stated that the two masked teens in puffer jackets travelled to the location on an e-bike while Mr Doran came in a 2007-reg Honda Accord car driven by Mr Dunne. Garda Liam Carroll alleged that one of the teenagers had a black face cover and approached the house, removed the gun from the front of his trousers and “pointed” at the family through the window. Advertisement Garda Carroll alleged the boys forced their way in the front door while Mr Doran came through a rear entrance before the homeowner was savagely beaten. Detective Garda Michael Murphy told the court that Mr Doran delivered punches and kicks to the man’s head and face, and there were bloodstains on the accused’s footwear. He agreed with defence counsel Sam Friel, instructed by solicitor Niall O’Connor, that the blood has yet to be analysed. The barrister proposed setting bail with conditions telling the judge his client was about to set up a business and could work from home. Detective Garda Darragh Phelan, the second teenager, used boxer shorts as a balaclava and left with the gun on an e-bike. A civilian witness was said to have observed the youth discarding it before he allegedly drove onto the M50, where he crashed between Junction 12 and 13. Gardai responded to a call from the couple’s son, who was in a state of distress, saying, “A number of males were attacking his parents’ home, and one had a gun; the male pointed the gun and directed it them”. The judge was told that the commotion could be heard over the phone line. The car was stopped close to the house, and armed support officers arrived and removed the two men and the boy who was allegedly first to brandish the gun. Garda Aidan Myers agreed with solicitor Yvonne Bambury that her client, Mr Dunne, drove to the house but did not go inside, but the officer added that it was a joint enterprise. The court heard Mr Dunne, a father of two adult children, lost his partner of 40 years in 2021. Solicitor Aoife McTaggart pleaded with the judge to note that the Children Act stated that juvenile detention should be a last resort. She said they were supported in court by visibly upset family members. The solicitor stressed that they adored the boys who would abide by a range of strict conditions. However, while stressing that the four, who had yet to enter pleas, had a presumption of innocence, Judge Finan denied all of the bail applications. The boys will appear at the Children’s Court on Monday, and the adult co-defendants will face their next hearings at Cloverhill District Court on Thursday. Judge Finan said directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions must be obtained.

Title: 8,000 Bitcoins awaken after 5 years – Whale strategy or ETF play?

BlackRock or Strategy – Who’s quietly reshaping the market? Bitcoin [BTC] has once again captured global attention, not just for its impressive price performance, but also for an unexpected on-chain development. So, besides Bitcoin holding steady above the historic $100K threshold, trading at $105,049.81 at press time following a 0.38% daily gain per CoinMarketCap, it’s a recent whale-sized transaction that’s stirring market gossip. Close to 8,000 Bitcoin (worth over $841M), inactive for the last five years, were recently transferred, as noted by CryptoQuant analyst J.A. Maartunn. Institutions reportedly moved the coins from Coinbase Custody, a digital asset storage service offered by Coinbase for institutional investors. As expected, this transfer has fueled a fresh wave of speculation in the market, with some predicting that high-net-worth entities are strategically accumulating Bitcoin or preparing for upcoming spot ETF allocations. Talking of its impact on Bitcoin’s price, if investors perceive the transfer as a precursor to a sell-off, it could trigger short-term bearish sentiment and price volatility. But if the move is linked to institutional repositioning or upcoming spot Bitcoin ETF allocations, it may reinforce bullish momentum. Alternatively, if it’s merely an internal custodial shift, the market may remain unaffected. Needless to say, when institutions shift long-dormant coins stored in top-tier custody platforms, it often points towards a strategic move, not a routine transfer. Some speculators suspect that giants like BlackRock, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), or another major financial entity could be behind the transaction. Moreover, with spot Bitcoin ETFs drawing growing attention and capital, this activity may signal either final accumulation before ETF allocations or the start of a broader distribution strategy. Remarking on the same, Maartunn said, “Their buying spree might be done for this week.” This coincided with a sudden wave of geopolitical tension that erupted when Israel struck Iran, triggering risk-off sentiment across global markets, and Bitcoin didn’t escape the impact. On the 12th of June, BTC briefly dropped to $102,000, extending its weekly losses to 7% as panic gripped both the crypto and traditional financial sectors. U.S. stock markets followed the same downward path, while investors drove gold prices past $3,400 in a rush for safe-haven assets. This sharp divergence drew attention from long-time Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff, who argued the price movement signaled a “major top” for BTC. In conclusion, although views remain divided, the market’s reaction highlights how macroeconomic events continue to shape Bitcoin’s short-term direction.

Title: Solana ETF filings now include staking – Approval odds soar to 91%

The SEC isn’t saying no, but it’s also not saying yes. What’s behind this ETF limbo? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent delays in approving a range of altcoin ETFs have stirred uncertainty within the crypto community, fueling speculation about what these postponements mean. Despite the rising fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), data from Polymarket offers a contrasting perspective, suggesting several altcoin ETFs remain poised for potential approval. In response to ongoing regulatory scrutiny, major asset managers Bitwise, Canary, and Grayscale have taken a proactive step by amending their Solana [SOL] ETF filings to include staking. This feature would allow funds to earn rewards by staking the Solana held in custody. These updated S-1 filings aim to address the SEC’s concerns, but according to a source cited by Reuters, the agency appears to be in no rush to greenlight the launches. Remarking on this, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said, “I think there needs to be a back and forth with the SEC and issuers to iron out details, so I doubt it. If anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were *A LOT* of filings over the preceding couple months before launch.” While the spotlight remains on the growing number of amended Solana ETF filings, it’s worth recalling that the journey for spot crypto ETFs in the U.S. has been long and hard fought. Spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs gained approval only in January 2024, more than ten years after Gemini’s Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss submitted the original application back in 2013. In the case of Solana, VanEck was the first U.S.-based firm to propose a spot ETF in mid-2024, and interestingly, one of the last to revise its S-1 filing to incorporate staking provisions. Interestingly, BlackRock is absent in the Solana ETF race, and this silence raises questions about the firm’s intentions in the altcoin ETF space. Expressing on the matter, Seyffart noted, “They haven’t yet. But I would not be surprised if they were to eventually do that. But right now it doesn’t seem like they will be in the first wave (whenever these launch).” Despite the SEC’s apparent lack of urgency around altcoin ETF approvals, market sentiment remains strikingly optimistic. According to Polymarket data, the odds of a Solana ETF being approved in 2025 stood at 91% at the time of reporting. This bullish outlook appears to be mirrored in Solana’s performance, with the token trading at $146.40 following a modest 0.92% daily increase, as per CoinMarketCap. While delays may suggest caution, they don’t necessarily signal denial. As ETF analyst James Seyffart had aptly noted, “Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days. If we’re gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets — i wouldn’t expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q.” This shows that the lack of movement doesn’t equate to rejection, leaving the door open for approval despite regulatory hesitations.

Title: Trump's tariffs and tax bill look like a 'Greek tragedy' that could tank the economy and stocks, former IMF official warns

Like a protagonist in a Greek tragedy, President Donald Trump is exhibiting a concerning level of hubris in his handling of the US economy, former IMF official Desmond Lachman worries. Despite warnings from credible sources — like Fed Chair Jerome Powell, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink — about what tariffs would mean for inflation and growth, and what his tax cut bill would mean for bond yields and the US dollar, Trump is doubling down on these policies, Lachman said in a June 10 post for the American Enterprise Institute, where he is a senior fellow. Unless Trump changes course, Lachman said, he could end up reigniting inflation, pushing up long-term bond yields, further tanking the US dollar, and sending the US economy into recession. "To Trump, these warnings are like water off a duck's back. Instead of dialing back his tariff policy, Trump has recently raised the import tariff on all aluminum and steel imports to a staggering 50%," Lachman wrote. He continued: "At the same time, instead of coming up with belt-tightening revenue and spending measures to address the country's gaping budget deficit of 6.25% of GDP, Trump is making every effort to secure the passage of his budget-busting One Big Beautiful Bill." So far, inflation has been tame and the labor market has held up as businesses have started to digest tariffs. But Lachman said the US economy is not out of the woods yet. Since businesses stockpiled inventory to prepare for Trump's tariffs, their effects won't start to show up until the second half of the year, he told Business Insider on Friday. "The fact that you're not seeing it in the May, June, July data, it doesn't mean anything," Lachman said. Here's the US trade deficit showing a surge in foreign goods buying from US businesses in late 2024 and early 2025. But tariffs aren't the only inflationary factor potentially at play. Lachman said that if you add the implications of Trump's tax bill on the value of the US dollar as the the national debt and budget deficit grow, consumers could end up paying even higher prices. With the dollar's value down 10%, for example, it means foreign goods are more expensive in addition to the 10% tariffs, or more, already being paid. In an inflationary environment — and with no indication that the US government is looking to reduce its debt and budget deficit — foreign investors have started to flee, and could continue to do so. That could send long-term Treasury rates soaring, Lachman said, slowing the US economy as the cost of lending follows suit. All of this puts US stocks in danger with valuations elevated, Lachman said. For example, here's the Shiller cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500, which measures current stock prices against a rolling average of earnings over the last 10 years. "Start with the fact that the stock market has got very high valuations, and then overlay that with the likelihood that you could have either a bond or a dollar crisis, and it would seem to me that stocks don't do very well," he said. The myth probably most associated with hubris and its sometimes disastrous consequences is the tale of Icarus. Looking to escape from a labyrinth, his father builds him wings made of wax. Icarus succeeds in getting off the ground, but in the end ignores his father's warnings and flies too close to the sun, melting his wings. Trump having imposed steep universal tariffs without sparking inflation or a recession has so far defied conventional wisdom and warnings from top economists. But with Trump's tax bill on the way, will his wings, along with the US economy and stock market, soon start to melt? Jump to

BlackRock faces legal action in Tennessee for allegedly misleading investors with conflicting ESG promises. ESG activism, driven by financial elites, prioritizes political agendas over shareholder returns, harming pension funds and taxpayers. Mentions of ESG buzzwords like "climate change" have plummeted since 2022 as skepticism grows. Conservative states push back, banning ESG considerations in public investments, while blue states defend the framework. Critics warn ESG operates as a "social credit" system, eroding free-market principles under the guise of sustainability.

Critics warn ESG operates as a "social credit" system, eroding free-market principles under the guise of sustainability. In a landmark lawsuit filed Monday in Tennessee, asset management titan BlackRock stands accused of violating consumer protection laws by peddling contradictory Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategies âÂ one promising robust financial returns, the other a climate-focused overhaul of capitalism. The case, the first of its kind, underscores a growing backlash against ESGâs opaque metrics, which critics argue prioritize progressive activism over fiduciary duty. As ESG-related terminology fades from corporate earnings calls âÂ dropping from 28,000 mentions in early 2022 to just 4,800 by mid-2024Â â the movement faces a reckoning: Is it a legitimate risk-management tool or a Trojan horse for ideological control? BlackRockâs double game: Profits vs. climate virtue Tennesseeâs lawsuit alleges BlackRockâs ESG pledges have "deprived consumers of the ability to make informed choices," citing CEO Larry Finkâs 2022 letter declaring ESG would "reshape finance." Yet internal documents reveal the firmâs continued investments in fossil fuels â $310 billion as of 2023 â while publicly pressuring companies to divest. Luke Lloyd, an investment strategist at Strategic Wealth Partners, bluntly summarized the contradiction: "ESG is driven by financial interests, not environmental concerns. Itâs a marketing ploy." The fallout isnât theoretical. Pension funds, reliant on steady returns, face heightened risk as ESG policies artificially depress energy stock values. As the International Energy Agency notes, global oil demand may still grow for decades â rendering BlackRockâs anti-fossil fuel posturing economically reckless. The ESG backlash: Red states fight green tyranny Conservative leaders are mobilizing against ESGâs encroachment. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis barred state pension funds from using ESG criteria, while Texas blacklisted 10 financial firms, including BlackRock, for "boycotting" fossil fuels. Blue states retaliated with a joint letter accusing critics of ignoring "climate threats," but the financial data tells another story: ESG funds underperformed the S&P 500 by 4% in 2023, per Morningstar. Even ESG insiders admit flaws. Tariq Fancy, BlackRockâs former sustainable investing chief, likened ESG to "wheatgrass for a cancer patient â a dangerous placebo." His indictment aligns with Vivek Ramaswamyâs crusade against corporate "wokeism," targeting firms like Disney for diversity audits he calls "political theater." From apartheid divestment to climate lockstep ESGâs roots trace to 1980s anti-apartheid divestment and a 2004 UN report urging "stakeholder capitalism." But todayâs iteration, fueled by climate panic and social justice campaigns, has ballooned into a $35 trillion industryâdespite lacking standardized metrics. The result? A system where ExxonMobil can rank higher on ESG indices than Tesla, sparking Elon Muskâs ire: "ESG is a scam." The high cost of virtue signaling As ESGâs contradictions mount, so does skepticism. The Tennessee lawsuit may be the tip of the iceberg, exposing how financial elites exploit ESG to advance political goals while jeopardizing retireesâ savings. BlackRock, State Street and Vanguardâcontrolling trillions in assetsânow act as de facto regulators, steering capital away from fossil fuels, defense and other "unfavored" industries, regardless of profitability. This artificial redirection distorts competition, inflates energy costs and weakens national securityâall while delivering negligible environmental benefits. For free-market advocates, the lesson is clear: When corporations trade profitability for progressive dogma, everyone loses â except the activists counting their fees. ESGâs opaque scoring systems, riddled with subjective criteria, empower a small cadre of unelected bureaucrats to dictate corporate behavior. Meanwhile, middle-class investors bear the brunt of underperforming "woke" funds, as returns take a backseat to political posturing. ESG isnât saving the planet â itâs reshaping it into a playground for unelected elites. From the EUâs heavy-handed sustainability mandates to the SECâs proposed climate disclosures, governments and asset managers collude to enforce ideological conformity. The result? A chilling effect on innovation, diminished shareholder value and a marketplace where success hinges not on merit, but on compliance with ever-shifting political whims.

Title: ‘It horrifies me, but I had actually developed a corporate strut’: Fintan Drury on Anglo, Paddy Power and Gaza
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/06/14/it-horrifies-me-but-when-i-looked-back-i-had-actually-developed-a-corporate-strut-fintan-drury-on-anglo-israel-and-paddy-power/
Time Published: 2025-06-14T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Fintan Drury was marching in support of Palestine with one of his daughters last year, feeling the same distrust he felt during his 1980s stint as a presenter of RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. “I just sort of thought, well, I don’t believe what we’re being fed. I just don’t believe it.” As Israel’s onslaught on Gaza intensified, his participation in marches became more regular, and so did the sense that he could do something else to counter the official line coming from Israel. He rejects as “patent nonsense” any perception that the conflict began with the Hamas attacks of October 7th, 2023. “I thought there was more I could do if I got up off my ass and used my curious mind and my journalistic training.” This was the catalyst for writing Catastrophe: Nakba II, his sober yet devastating account of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians over decades. He says the subject is too important not to actively promote the book and that means being “quizzed” by journalists, though he seems keen throughout our conversation to avoid coming across as egotistic – something that will not surprise readers of his 2021 memoir See-Saw, which dwells on the perils of ego. “Sorry, it sounds sort of pompous,” he apologises soon after explaining how he was counselled to exhume his reporting skills in 2016. That year Drury wrote a series of articles for The Irish Times from his time as a volunteer at a Syrian refugee camp in Athens. It came after a long spell in the higher echelons of Irish corporate life during which he was, on occasion, the story. Indeed, so much of his career was spent in business that when he identifies journalism as the thing he was “best at”, the self-criticism is implied. Catastrophe opens with a note acknowledging that most books on Palestine and Israel are by authors with more extensive experience of the Middle East. Many are by “absolutely brilliant minds”, he says, but can be academic and dense. His aim, when he began working on it “in a serious way” in April 2024, was to provide an accessible narrative “so even the people who are out marching and protesting and wearing their keffiyehs – the people who are instinctively pro-Palestine – can better understand why they’re protesting”. His research, which saw him travel to the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon last July, helped confirm his own “gut” feeling, though he didn’t know then how extreme the situation would become. “I didn’t honestly believe at that time that it could be as bad as it is now. And it was bad then. Really, really bad.” Israel’s aggression escalated while he was in the region, obliging him to call off one trip to southern Lebanon after a phone call with a contact in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil). He was advised that an elevated security threat meant it would no longer be able to dedicate a minder. “It’s a bit like swimming when you’re told not to, and the coastguard getting called out. You’re putting other people at risk. I’m a grandfather. I wasn’t trying to be a hero; that wasn’t my mission, so I didn’t go.” He has been heartened by the “very positive” public reaction. At the Listowel Literary Festival, interest in Catastrophe was such that his talk was moved to a bigger room, though when someone asked him about solutions, he said he wasn’t the right person to offer them. “It is multifaceted, and it will ebb and flow and change,” he says. “But the fundamental of the story is pretty clear to me and to a great many others who are there and studying it and observing it for decades. This is a genocide. All bets are off now. This is not right.” [ Britain and allies sanction two Israeli ministers as Gazan authorities say gunfire kills dozens at food aid siteOpens in new window ] Authors often have more than one reason for writing a particular book and in his case there were several. Apart from the conflict itself, and the time being right for him to embark upon the project, he sees parallels with Ireland’s colonisation that intersect with his own family story. Drury’s maternal grandfather Joseph Connolly was a leader of the Irish Volunteers in Belfast who was imprisoned by the British in 1916 and resumed his republican activities in the city after his release. When it became too dangerous to stay, he fled with his wife and young family to Dublin. Connolly, who went on to serve twice as a minister under Éamon de Valera, died when Drury was two, but he knew his grandmother well, he says. “My grandparents were displaced people. They were refugees from Belfast. Is that relevant? Absolutely, it’s relevant. Because it’s in your history. You understand that Catholics and nationalists who weren’t able to get out continued to suffer.” Catastrophe – the Nakba of the subtitle refers, in the first instance, to the mass displacement of Palestinians in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war – is dedicated to the memory of his Belfast-born mother Róisín Drury, née Connolly. Their discussions about how the plight of Jewish people was shamefully ignored in the 1930s and 1940s would sometimes end with her relief that modern communications meant nothing like the Holocaust could ever happen again. There will be no credible basis for anyone to claim they did not understand what Israel was doing in Gaza or that they “somehow missed it”, he writes. The book documents an “institutionalised bias” in the West towards Israel as the “upholder of Western values” in the Middle East, with Drury despairing at both “staggering” international inertia and “chilling” sponsorship of Israel’s campaign. He witnessed what he calls the “warped” US policy first hand when he reported for RTÉ on Ronald Reagan’s 1984 re-election and believes Democrats as well as Republicans have abandoned Palestinians. While Israel’s prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu found it easy to “play” the US in a presidential election year, he says the young mothers he met in Lebanon were livid that such a “warmonger”, as one described him, was permitted to address Congress. Ireland should be doing more, too, he concludes. “I think Ireland has done many things really well, I really do, but has Ireland done enough? Time will tell, but right now I don’t think so.” Drury (67) was born in Dublin and raised in Clonskeagh, then a “sleepy part of south Dublin”. He attended Blackrock College and later UCD – its relocation to Belfield was an early taste of the city’s encroachment on the fields of his youth. From 1981 to 1988 he was a newsman, joining RTÉ despite being told in a screen test that his head was “shaped like a shovel”. He reported from Belfast and overseas before becoming the co-presenter of Radio 1’s then fledgling Morning Ireland in 1985. But after just two-and-half years he grew restless and left broadcasting at age 29. It wasn’t his plan to go into business, yet that’s what he did, founding the public relations firm Drury Communications before selling it to its management a decade later to concentrate on his eponymous sports consultancy, which in 2004 rebranded as Platinum One. He became chairman of RTÉ in mid-2005 but resigned after six months when a perceived conflict of interest arose – over golf. The then government was flirting with adding the 2006 Ryder Cup, which was being held in Co Kildare, to its list of free-to-air television events, but Drury was an adviser to its organisers. Relinquishing the role was “the right thing”, he says. Does this all seem like a long time ago? “It was a long time ago,” he says, laughing. It was that exact Celtic Tiger era, I say. “Yeah.” These were hubristic times, as Drury outlines in See-Saw, which is laced with mea culpas about a “sense of impregnability” borne of live news presenting and his PR and sports management success. It underpinned decisions that led, he writes, “to a decade of stress that was degenerative of body and soul”. I had actually developed a corporate strut. When that becomes part of your way, you don’t lose the capacity or the facility to make good judgments, but that capacity is dimmed or diminished After Anglo Irish Bank supremo Seán FitzPatrick persuaded him to join the Anglo board, he served as non-executive director for six years until May 2008, leaving six months before the bank failed. FitzPatrick’s post-collapse recollection that Drury brought him and then taoiseach Brian Cowen together for a July 2008 meeting and round of golf did no one any favours, with Drury and Cowen, his friend, still being asked about it at an Oireachtas inquiry seven years later. (No banking was discussed that day, they said.) FitzPatrick’s distraction-creating move convinced Drury of FitzPatrick’s “utter selfishness”, he notes in the memoir. Cowen, meanwhile, remains a friend and was one of the early readers of Catastrophe. [ Fintan Drury: Brian Cowen put country first, party secondOpens in new window ] I ask him about his realisation that when FitzPatrick said he wanted board members who would “never be afraid” of expressing their opinion, he was flattering his ego. “Yeah, and men, in particular, we’re more susceptible to that,” he says. He mentions his use of the phrase “corporate strut”, which he suspects he acquired in those Anglo days. “It horrifies me, and it would have horrified me before – it wasn’t a conscious thing – but when I looked back on it, I had actually developed a corporate strut. When that becomes part of your way, you don’t lose the capacity or the facility to make good judgments, but that capacity is dimmed or diminished.” He also regrets that “the blinkers were on” during his tenure as Paddy Power chairman, when he says his old curiosity was subsumed by passive subscription to corporate Ireland, blinding him to the societal consequences of gambling. Efforts to regulate the industry are “nowhere near tough enough”, he says. “I was a good chairman in the sense that I helped the company grow. But I was horrified when I looked back, and I wished I’d never been chairman.” [ From the archive: Banking inquiry: Drury’s evidence was worth the waitOpens in new window ] The memoir, as well as his articles for The Irish Times and business publication The Currency, gave him a “certain level of confidence” that he could write, though he has been reluctant to call himself a journalist again. “There was a discussion with [Catastrophe publishers] Merrion Press about how to describe me on blurbs, and initially I was kind of resistant to that, because I think I have an old-fashioned sense of what a journalist does,” he says. (The blurb says he “returned to journalism” in 2016 but introduces him as “an author and opinion writer”.) The principles of his news years are deeply rooted, nonetheless. When he says he watches “really good interviewers” flail amid the “stonewalling, stonewalling, stonewalling” of Israel’s spokespeople, I ask if he thinks it is correct to invite them on air when this outcome can be anticipated. “I would have suffered the constraints of Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, and I don’t believe in censorship. I am strongly of the view that censorship of any description is not of value. So I think it is better to attempt to interview them, and every so often you might make a little breakthrough,” he says. “I think their own Sphinx-like intransigence, and same old weary lines, reinforces to most of the audience – which is more intelligent than we ever give them credit for – that that’s what it is.” Sport being the other through line of his life – he played soccer for UCD – Drury is now chairman of not-for-profit Sport Against Racism Ireland. “The work of any NGO, trying to get funds, is hard,” he says, adding that he would like to see the Government “crack the whip” so the private sector does more. “A lot of private-sector companies benefiting from migration aren’t investing any money at all in supporting initiatives that make migrants feel part of our community, feel cared for, feel respected, and that’s a real shame. I would much rather you include that than any bolloxology about Fintan Drury.” Catastrophe: Nakba II by Fintan Drury is published by Merrion Press Laura Slattery is an Irish Times journalist writing about media, advertising and other business topics © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

UPDATED 15:31 EDT / JUNE 13 2025 by Maria Deutscher Archer Aviation Inc. has raised $850 million in funding to support the rollout of its flying taxis. The NYSE-listed company announced the deal on Thursday. The transaction was structured as a direct offering in which Archer sold 85 million shares for $10 apiece. In today’s trading session, its stock price dropped about 14% to exactly $10. The deal marks Archer’s third nine-figure capital raise in under a year. It secured $300 million in February from a consortium that included Blackrock and closed a $430 million investment three months earlier. Following this week’s cash infusion, Archer’s total pro forma liquidity stands at about $2 billion. “We now have the strongest balance sheet in the sector and the resources we need to execute both here in the U.S. and abroad,” said Archer founder and Chief Executive Officer Adam Goldstein. Santa Clara, California-based Archer is developing a flying taxi called Midnight that takes off like a helicopter and flies like a plane. According to the company, it can take four passengers on up to 100-mile trips with a top speed of 150 miles per hour. Midnight lands and takes off from specialized landing pads called vertiports. The aircraft is powered by 12 electric rotors that can adjust their angle midflight to reduce drag. Archer says they’re 100 times quieter than a helicopter, which makes Midnight suitable for use in urban areas. The rotors draw power from six onboard battery packs optimized for quick charging, which reduces downtime between flights. Midnight completed its first piloted test flight in late May. According to Archer, the aircraft reached altitudes of more than 1,500 feet. The successful test may have simplified the company’s latest capital raise by boosting investor confidence in its development roadmap. Archer will use the funds to develop an “AI-based aviation software platform.” In parallel, it plans to build the infrastructure necessary to support flying taxi networks based on Midnight. The company has inked deal to establish such networks in the U.S., United Arab Emirates, India and South Korea. Last year, Archer won a contract to provide air taxi services for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Midnight aircraft will ferry spectators and staff between sports venues in the city. The company has also teamed up with United Airlines to launch multiple flying taxi routes in the U.S. One of those routers will ferry passengers from Manhattan to the Newark Liberty International Airport. As part of the deal, United has pre-ordered hundreds of Midnight flying taxis worth about $1.5 billion.

Title: China-backed firms in talks to join stalled $19B Panama ports deal: report

Several China state-backed firms – including the country’s largest shipping company – are reportedly in talks to join a stalled $19 billion deal for 43 global ports, including two along the Panama Canal. China’s Cosco Shipping Corp. has held discussions about partnering with a global consortium headed by Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd., as well as US asset manager BlackRock and its Global Infrastructure Partners unit, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The move comes after Beijing’s fierce opposition has jeopardized a deal that would hand over control of the ports owned by Hong Kong business magnate Li Ka-Shing to TiL and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager led by Larry Fink. President Trump had touted the sale of the ports as a national security win after demanding the US “take back” the Panama Canal and eliminate Chinese influence over the critical shipping lane. The inclusion of Cosco and other China state-backed companies emerged as a way to nudge the deal forward after intense trade talks between US officials and their Beijing counterparts over tariffs in Switzerland last month, sources told Bloomberg. The consortium is staring down a deadline in late July after a 145-day period for talks on the ports deal expires, and have already missed an initial goal of signing an agreement by early April. Aponte’s family-run business – Mediterranean Shipping Company, which owns TiL – has emerged as the lead investor, though BlackRock is notably expected to take over the two Panama ports included in the sale. The deal is expected to crown Aponte’s MSC as the world’s largest terminal operator after acquiring the ports from Li’s CK Hutchison Holdings. China has steadfastly opposed the deal over concerns it could hinder its global trade and shipping operations. Talks are ongoing and terms of the deal have not been finalized, sources told Bloomberg. BlackRock declined to comment. Cosco Shipping and TiL did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The White House and CK Hutchinson did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. The canal, which was finished by US engineers, was handed back to Panama between 1977 and 1999 under a Jimmy Carter-era treaty establishing permanent neutrality. The head of the operator of the Panama Canal has warned that the deal could threaten its commitment to neutrality. “There is a potential risk of capacity concentration if the deal comes the way it is structured as we understand right now,” Ricaurte Vasquez Morales, administrator of the Panama Canal, told the Financial Times in an interview published this week. “If there is a significant level of concentration on terminal operators belonging to an integrated or one single shipping company, it will be at the expense of Panama’s competitiveness in the market and inconsistent with neutrality.” Advertisement
