Share this article BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund has increased its holdings in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) by 91% to 821,664 shares valued at around $47 million as of January 31, according to a Thursday SEC filing. The globally diversified investment strategy, designed to maximize total return while managing risk, added 390,894 IBIT units to its portfolio between November 2024 and January 2025. The fund has steadily expanded its IBIT holdings from 43,000 shares in April 2024 to 198,874 shares in July 2024. Apart from the Global Allocation Fund, BlackRock previously disclosed holding $78 million in IBIT shares across two investment funds—the Strategic Income Opportunities (BSIIX) and the Strategic Global Bond (MAWIX). According to the firm’s most recent disclosure, the BSIIX fund owned 2,140,095 IBIT shares worth approximately $77 million, while the MAWIX fund maintained 40,682 shares valued at about $1.4 million, as of September 30. BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust has drawn massive investments from hedge funds, pension funds, and institutional investors since its launch. Mubadala Investment, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, reported last month that it had purchased almost $437 million worth of IBIT shares during the first quarter of 2024, representing one of the first significant investments in crypto assets by a major sovereign wealth fund. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) also doubled down on IBIT, revealing a $321 million investment by the end of 2024. As of March 25, BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund had around $49,5 billion in assets under management, according to the fund’s official website.

Title: Has ESG investing lost its shine? Spark finds friends and worries over Synlait’s weak second half – Stock Takes

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. ESG investing has been put on the back foot. Photo / 123rf Environmental, social and governance investing looks to be on the back foot, particularly in the United States after the change of Government. In the US, environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing faces pushback under the presidency of Donald Trump – and there are signs of a change of heart in Europe as well. The term “ESG” has steadily faded from the investor and corporate lexicon over the past year after cultural and political clashes over its meaning and purpose, a report published on the Harvard Law School Forum said. Institutional investors have gone quiet on ESG amid public criticism and congressional subpoenas. Investment giant BlackRock had publicly disavowed the term for having become too politicised and the use of “ESG” in earnings calls had dropped precipitously, the report said. Robbie Urquhart, senior portfolio manager Australian equities at Fisher Funds, said the US and other jurisdictions have seen a shift in their approach to ESG. “In response to that, there are a number of corporates and fund managers globally that have altered their stance on ESG,” Urquhart told Stock Takes. “But from our perspective, we have not changed our approach to ESG investing in response to these changes. “The rationale that underlines that still holds today,” Urquhart says. “When you have fads either by moving the ESG dial more in favour of being stricter or becoming more relaxed, to the extent that you have short-term gyrations in how the pendulum swings, we are unlikely to alter our approach.” From an environmental perspective, changes in attitude towards ESG would not alter the need for the world to decarbonise over time, Urquhart said. “Some of those shifts that we have seen in the US are possibly in response to the parameters being too strict, given the pace of technology changes is taking longer than some would have hoped. “Nevertheless, the world still needs to decarbonise and as a consequence, it is still in investors’ interests to try and help push towards a decarbonised future in a sensible fashion.” Urquhart noted the pushback on ESG, particularly in the US, looked to be strong. Irrespective of how the US may be moving against ESG, Urquhart didn’t think the local “institutional landscape” had altered that much. “I would be surprised to see huge changes in New Zealand investment policy off the back of what we have seen in the US.” But Urquhart said it would be interesting to see how ethical investing evolves in the European market over time, given the likely military build-up there. “Clearly, we have seen a big step up in promises for defence spending in the European countries, and defence generally has not been a great destination for ESG funds.” It’s been a luckless year or two for Spark. A string of earnings downgrades has acted to drive Spark’s share price to 14-year lows, but the telco has found a friend in US investment behemoth BlackRock, which has lifted its stake to 8.07% from 5.9%. And brokers Forsyth Barr have upgraded the stock to “outperform”. “We expect structural, competitive and cyclical headwinds to slowly start to ease through 2025,” Forsyth Barr said in a research note. “While the structural decline in broadband and cloud gross margins is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, pressure on corporate mobile in particular and enterprise IT services should start to abate as [competitor] 2degrees begins to prioritise returns over market share gains, and Spark’s partnership agreements reduce costs and cyclicality in IT services. “Outside of the fundamentals, we believe the dissonance between Spark’s cashflow generation and its ambitions has contributed meaningfully to the 60% drop in the share price over the last year.” The broker said the combination of: (1) maintaining a 25 cents per share (cps) dividend; (2) retaining the A- credit rating; and (3) funding its data centre (DC) ambition was not a feasible proposition. “We struggle to understand why it is taking so long to correct, but expect it to be done within the next 12 months,” Forsyth Barr said. It expected the dividend to be reduced to 18cps. “The uncertainty around funding its DC expansion remains high, but most outcomes should be positive – including abandoning the expansion altogether.” Spark’s shares rebounded off their lows this week. They now trade at around $2.08. Forsyth Barr analysts Paul Koraua and Rohan Koreman-Smit continue to view The Warehouse Group’s performance as unattractive, describing its 2025 first-half result as “less worse than expected”. Of particular concern for Koraua and Koreman-Smit was The Warehouse’s heightened promotional activity and aged inventory, which contributed to a group gross margin contraction of 170 basis points, along with a 7% decline in gross profit versus the prior corresponding period. Koraua and Koreman-Smit did think that costs were well controlled by the group, with personnel and lease expenses broadly flat year on year and IT, SaaS (Software as a Service) and travel expenses down by 7%. The Warehouse has set an internal target to reduce its cost of doing business to below 31% in the near term (it currently sits at 31.3%), but the pair believe this target will be a challenge to meet. This is because sales momentum is likely to remain weak in the near term, there are timing uncertainties around further IT savings due to contractual terms and personnel and lease costs are generally inflationary. The Warehouse has maintained its initial guidance for the second-half result, expecting an operating loss of $14 million, in line with the second-half result in 2024. However, Koraua and Koreman-Smit continue to believe in a downside to the guidance, noting heightened promotional pressure and gross margin exit run-rates in the second quarter of 2025. The pair also expect domestic consumer spending to remain subdued over the next six months. They are forecasting a second-half operating loss of $18m, with no expected dividend until the second half of the next financial year. Shares in The Warehouse now trade at around 90c, having dropped by about 42% over the last 12 months. Synlait Milk’s first-half ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of $63.1m was meaningfully ahead of what Forsyth Barr senior analyst Matt Montgomerie would have forecast six months ago, but he says the outlook for the second half is unclear. The dairy processor is guiding to net debt of $250m–$300m by the end of 2025 (prior guidance was $200m–$250m). This included the Bright Dairy loan of $130m but excludes lease liabilities of $55m. Synlait is targeting senior leverage to ebitda of 2.5 times in full-year 2025 (which includes lease liabilities but excludes the Bright Dairy loan). “The midpoint of Synlait’s debt guidance and 2.25x gearing (target <2.5x) implies ebitda of $90m,” Montgomerie notes. “This in itself was not confusing, but the lack of commentary around why second-half 2025 performance is expected to be so weak versus 1H25 was.” The outlook for a2 Milk – Synlait’s biggest customer – remained robust. “While favourable foreign exchange and stream returns ($12m year-on-year ebitda benefit in 1H25) may abate, it is still difficult to reconcile the weak implied guidance,” Montgomerie said. Synlait’s shares have fallen, post-result, to around 76c, after last month hitting a high for the year of $1.02.

Title: French WealthTech firm RockFi raises €18 million

Time Published: 2025-03-27T14:39:00Z
Full Content:
Less than a year after an initial fundraising round of €3 million, RockFi, the French fintech aiming to revolutionize private wealth management through its combination of seasoned advisors and cutting-edge technology, has announced a Series A funding round of €18 million, led by Partech, with renewed participation from Varsity and several business angels, including Arthur Waller and Félix Blossier, both co-founders of Pennylane. 0 27 March 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. This new capital will allow RockFi to accelerate its growth and achieve its goal of €1 billion in assets under management by the end of 2026.Founded in 2023 by Pierre Marin, Marie Bedu, and Maxime Durand, in association with former private banking directors including Stéphane Carles (ex-director of SG Private Banking) and Vincent Pagny (ex-director of HSBC Gestion Privée), RockFi is a French fintech redefining private wealth management through its network of independent private bankers and its technology platform.The Rockfi Experience: An Exclusive Approach Serving a New Generation of InvestorsRockFi serves a clientele of entrepreneurs, senior executives, top athletes, and artists seeking high-performance, responsive wealth management tailored to modern needs. These investors favor a tailor-made approach where human expertise is combined with a reimagined digital experience for greater simplicity and transparency.RockFi distinguishes itself through its family office approach, providing each client with a dedicated private advisor capable of building a comprehensive investment strategy encompassing financial investments, taxation, and estate planning.Its premium offering includes 3,000 financial instruments across all asset classes, with a strong focus on private equity through 30 established partnerships with prestigious firms such as Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs.Thanks to its proprietary technology platform, RockFi provides clients with a global reporting of their assets, featuring real-time tracking and in-depth analytics.Exceptional Growth and Confirmed TractionLess than a year after launching its commercial offering, RockFi has already attracted 500 clients, driving a monthly business growth of over 25%. At the same time, its workforce has expanded rapidly, reaching 50 employees, including 25 private bankers, distributed across six offices in France (Paris, Lille, Bordeaux, Lyon, Annecy, and Toulon).This remarkable traction illustrates the pertinence of RockFi’s model, which combines top-tier human expertise in wealth management with the power of technology to offer a premium and accessible service.“We want to breathe new life into private wealth management, to the careers of those who shape it and the assets of their clients. This financing will enable us to scale up to serve our customers even better, in France and - eventually - across Europe, with the ambition of rapidly establishing ourselves among the leaders of next-generation wealth management”, says Pierre Marin, co-founder and CEO of RockFi.Over the next 12 months, RockFi plans to recruit 50 additional private bankers and open one new office per month, starting with Nice, Cannes, Toulouse, Rennes, and Strasbourg. This territorial expansion aligns with the company’s commitment to providing closer and more tailored support to regional investors and entrepreneurs.Top-Tier Investors to Support RockFiThis Series A round brings RockFi top-tier financial partners. Partech is joining the capital of the company by leading the round; on this occasion, Philippe Collombel, co-founder and General Partner at Partech, is joining the RockFi board of directors. Varsity, the fund co-founded by Didier Valet (former Deputy CEO of Société Générale) which had already led RockFi’s seed round in 2024, has reinforced its commitment by making a significant reinvestment. RockFi also counted on the support of strategic business angels such as Aurthur Waller and Félix Blosser (co-founders of Pennylane) and Mark Ransford (former Managing Director of Apax UK).“We are delighted to support RockFi in this new phase of its growth. Its model - combining a technological platform with human expertise - addresses a strong demand in the wealth management sector. The traction gained in just a few months shows RockFi’s potential to become a key player in an industry that is about to transform,” said Phillipe Collombel, co-founder and General Partner of Partech.“Since the beginnings of RockFi, we have been convinced by Pierre and his team’s vision to transform private wealth management. In less than a year, they have executed this vision with remarkable efficiency and tangible results. As early investors, it seemed natural to us to strengthen our support in this Series A to support RockFi in its expansion”, added Didier Valet, co-founder of Varsity.An Innovative Technological Wealth Management OfferingThe funds raised will allow RockFi to continue innovating and expanding its service offerings. In March, the fintech launched a dedicated client app, which provides each client with a comprehensive and detailed report of their entire financial portfolio in real time.RockFi relies on a team of 12 engineers, which it plans to double this year, to monitor, report, and identify investment opportunities tailored to each portfolio.In addition, RockFi integrates both French and Luxembourg-based life insurance solutions to optimize the tax and estate planning strategies of its high-net-worth clients. It also offers a wealth engineering service including personalized tax declaration assistance, offering clients a unique and comprehensive approach in the market.

Title: Energia’s US owner presses start button on multibillion euro sale
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/03/27/energias-us-owner-presses-start-button-on-multibillion-euro-sale/
Time Published: 2025-03-27T14:01:46Z
Full Content:
New York-based investment firm I Squared Capital has pressed the start button on the long-awaited multibillion euro sale of its Irish electricity and gas utility Energia, nine years after it bought the business, say sources. Investment bankers from Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Santander, who were hired a year ago to advise on sale strategy, have begun calling potential interested parties, said the sources, who declined to be identified. It is anticipated that an initial round of non-binding bids will be called by early June. An enterprise value of €2.75 billion, including debt, had been put on the business a year ago when it emerged that I Squared was preparing a third attempt to sell it. A spokesman for Energia, which is led by chief executive Ian Thom, declined to comment. [ Planners approve Energia data centreOpens in new window ] The decision to start the process comes within days of An Bord Pleanála giving Energia permission to build a data centre in Huntstown, Co Dublin, in partnership with tech giant Microsoft. It also comes as Energia enters the final days of its financial year to the end of March. I Squared, founded 13 years ago by former executives at Morgan Stanley’s infrastructure arm, acquired Energia – then known as Viridian Group – in 2016 from Bahrain’s Arcapita Bank for €1 billion. Arcapita had owned the company for almost a decade. The US firm subsequently sold a minority stake in Energia to an unknown investor the following year and set up a holding company over the business in the Cayman Islands. I Squared made two unsuccessful efforts to sell the company before now, in 2018 and 2020. UK-based Octopus Energy is teaming up with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to consider a bid for Energia, industry publication PeakLoad reported in recent days. Other potential bidders include investment giants KKR, BlackRock and Brookfield and utility groups Centrica and SSE, say sources. Energia reported earlier this month that its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) dipped to €238.3 million for the nine months to the end of December from €246.7 million for the same period in the previous fiscal year. The three parts of Energia’s business – renewable energy, a flexible electricity generation business, and a unit supplying customers – have proven to be complementary in recent years despite upheaval across energy markets. Ebitda in its renewables business, which owns 358 megawatts (MW) of wind assets and purchases electricity from 1.19 gigawatts (GW) of third-party green energy producers, and customer solutions unit, which supplies 866,700 homes and businesses on the island of Ireland, declined over the nine months amid lower energy prices. However, earnings in its flexible generation unit, mainly made up of two combined cycle gas turbine plants in Huntstown with a total capacity of 747MW, advanced. This was fuelled by greater use of the plants – used to plug gaps in electricity supplies in the Greater Dublin Area – during the period as well as the opening earlier this year of an emergency 50MW gas-fired electricity plant on the Huntstown site. The approval of the data centre will give investment banks marketing Energia a fresh angle to pitch the company’s growth opportunities to potential suitors. Energia also has a solar energy pipeline of more than 1,200MW.

The partnership is also expected to enhance the company’s ability to distribute independent content across global platforms. With this deal, Tether’s growing investment portfolio now spans media, biotech, sports, and video platforms. Previous deals include $775 million in Rumble, a stake in Juventus Football Club, and a $200 million investment in BlackRock Neurotech, a company developing brain-computer interface technology. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino highlighted the importance of preserving editorial independence. He said the investment would help Be Water avoid pressure from commercial narratives and maintain its creative freedom. He stated: “While often Media companies are bullied into kneeling to sponsored narratives simply to survive, Tether’s investment in BeWater ensures that the group will continue to remain solid, visionary and especially independent.” Despite Ardoino’s claim, the investment has shifted Be Water’s ownership structure. The updated shareholder list includes Guido Maria Brera, Giancarlo Devasini, and Paolo Ardoino from Tether, along with a mix of industry professionals such as Mario Calabresi, Roberto Condulmari, Saverio Costanzo, and Barbara Salabè. At the same time, Be Water’s board will also see changes, with Brera named Chairman and Salabè stepping in as CEO. Other board members include Claudia Lagorio, Tether’s COO, and Sabrina Giovannetti, Be Water’s CFO. Meanwhile, the media company is rolling out a major development plan. This includes investing in next-gen digital infrastructure, expanding its investigative journalism arms, Chora and Will, and partnering with international film, TV, and documentary production talent. While Tether continues venturing into new sectors, the firm’s core business remains strong. In a social media post on X, Ardoino pointed out that USDT stablecoin recently crossed 400 million users worldwide and remains the largest in the industry, with a market cap of over $140 billion. He described USDT as a grassroots solution bridging financial gaps where traditional systems fall short. According to him: “We always focused on the adoption from the ground up, working in the streets, among other people, while traditional finance was watching at us from their ivory towers.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Rumble aims to revamp digital asset adoption among global creators with a new wallet, following a $775 million Tether investment. The new stablecoin could be launched within the next five weeks, potentially based on a dynamic incentive system.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough Senior Contributor. Tesla, Elon Musk’s electric car company, has seen its share price fall by almost half since its December highs (as traders eye a Federal Reserve “big catalyst”). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" Tesla, one of the so-called “Magnificent 7” tech stocks that includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia, has ridden a U.S. president Donald Trump stock market “bump" but is struggling amid a sell-off that led Musk to issue a crypto price warning. Now, as fears swirl a new, mystery threat is targeting crypto, Standard Chartered analysis has found replacing Tesla with bitcoin in the Magnificent 7 delivers higher returns and lower volatility—calling the index Mag7B. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has seen the company's share price collapse by almost half since it ... More hit an all-time high in December. "We find that Mag7B has both higher returns and lower volatility than the Magnificent 7," Geoffrey Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. "This suggests that investors can view bitcoin as both a hedge against traditional finance and as part of their tech allocation. Indeed, as bitcoin’s role in global investor portfolios becomes established, we think that having more than one use will bring fresh capital inflows to the asset. This is particularly true as bitcoin investment becomes more institutionalized." Bitcoin has seen huge Wall Street adoption in the last year as a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) become some of the fastest growing funds of all time and companies follow Michael Saylor’s Strategy in buying bitcoin as a corporate reserve asset. “If it were included, the implication would be more institutional buying as bitcoin would serve multiple purposes in investor portfolios,” Kendrick said, adding the Mag7B produced consistently higher risk-adjusted returns than the original group over the past seven years. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year but has fallen sharply along with Tesla and ... More stock markets in recent weeks. The bitcoin price has soared over the last year, boosted first by Wall Street and then by Donald Trump’s embrace of bitcoin and crypto on the campaign trail. The bitcoin price surged to almost $110,000 per bitcoin following Trump’s election victory and has since declined along with Tesla and other sky-high tech stocks as traders de-risk in the face of Trump’s tariff threats. “It’s true that replacing Tesla with bitcoin would improve the historic returns of the Mag 7 group,” John Haar, managing director at bitcoin-buying app Swan Bitcoin, said in emailed comments. “However, the same can be said for including bitcoin in favor of any stock in the group. Over the past 10 years, the best performer of the Mag 7 has been Nvida, which has returned approximately 70% per year. Bitcoin has returned approximately 80% over the past 10 years.”

Title: Why I Believe Opportunities Are Endless Right Now

Through the generosity of the AHLA Foundation, five students and I had the opportunity to attend the Hunter Hotel Investment Conference in Atlanta last week. I love attending conferences because they’re fun, you make friends, and they often get me thinking in a new direction or about something new in general. And that’s just what happened in Atlanta. During the “Wall Street” session segment of the conference, there were some very heavy hitters discussing the relationships between brands and owners. To put the scale of the participants into context, we’re talking about leaders from companies like Hilton Worldwide and BlackRock. They were discussing potential purchases in the billions of dollars. The four participants and the moderator were truly big dogs. One interesting concept that all parties seemed to agree on was the concern about the commoditization of the hotel product. I think this concern is completely warranted, as it increasingly seems to me that hotels of different brands are very similar to one another. One of the ideas suggested (that is leading to the commoditization of hotels and their brands) was the increasing fragmentation occurring in the industry. Obviously, there are exceptions to this fragmentation, but it does seem that many owners do not operate their properties – certainly not on a day-to-day basis; many brands do not own their properties; and even the hotels themselves are viewed more as “revenue-generating assets” rather than “hotels”. This last point was highlighted further as some major owners had focused their capital on investments in different “revenue-generating assets” – things like data centers. In speaking to some smaller owners and brokers, they noticed this shift away from hotels, too. In fact, one of the hottest trends in “revenue-generating assets” right now is daycares. All this got me thinking: With all this fragmentation that is occurring, how will this impact the future? My conclusion is that it will allow for more and more specialization within the hotel industry. As part of our experience at the conference, the AHLA Foundation set up several intimate sessions with industry leaders. These allowed for frank discussions as well as Q&A sessions for the students. Each of these smaller sessions was incredibly inspirational, and all of the leaders were hardworking, charismatic, and very smart. Although I probably could have filled this entire article with quotes from the sessions, there was one that stood out to me: This quote, connected with the increasing fragmentation that has occurred in the industry, really got me thinking about opportunities that will exist in the future, particularly for young professionals and students. In another general session on artificial intelligence, there was an “aha” moment for me that put the opportunity much more in focus. The people on the stage in the AI session (who were experts) only had about two years’ worth of experience working with AI. The newness of AI in general is a huge opportunity for anyone. Even a complete novice can get ramped up quickly on perhaps the biggest technological opportunity of all time. And I’ll give you an example of a quick ramp-up. In that same general session on artificial intelligence, a web development site (Lovable.dev) was mentioned. This site was described as somewhere that anyone could put in an idea and a website or app would be created. It was mentioned by one of the panelists, who said that his elementary-aged son logged on and created a basketball game within minutes. So later that evening, I checked the site out, and it really was incredible. I was able to very quickly create an accounting game: Financial Statement Classifier Game. Check it out – AI really is incredible and powerful. And that brings me back to the point of this article: to genuinely and enthusiastically encourage everyone out there with an entrepreneurial spirit to go for it! Because right now, at the intersection of fragmentation, specialized skills, and AI, it feels like many barriers that may have existed in the past have been broken down. So, ask yourself: If the answer to these questions is yes, then in my estimation, for you, the sky’s the limit. And if it’s not you? I still believe that looking for your specialty, identifying where you can fit in best, and learning about AI will also bring you great opportunities in the future. What a time to be alive! It’s not too late to get in on the AI boom and use all your talents and specialties to give yourself the next big opportunity. So go get it! Tucker JohnsonUniversity of Houston - Conrad N.

Title: Solana Eyes $300 as Bullish Sentiment Reaches Historic Levels

Solana (SOL) is back in the spotlight as bullish momentum reaches unprecedented levels. Notably, despite struggling since its all-time high of $264 in November 2021, battling market-wide downturns and increased token supply, including the recent FTX estate’s $2 billion SOL unlock, optimism is resurging. According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, institutional adoption and strategic integrations are fueling this renewed confidence. GameStop and BlackRock have launched yield-bearing tokenized treasury funds on Solana, driving massive social media engagement. “The combination of technological advantages, institutional interest, community support, and influencer engagement has created an almost unheard-of positive-to-negative sentiment ratio of 18:1,” Santiment noted Thursday, emphasizing the growing confidence among institutional and retail investors. While market analysts remain divided on Solana’s trajectory, some predict an explosive rally. Analysts from Sandman Research pointed out that SOL recently retested a key support level near $100 before rebounding 16% to $146, mirroring a pattern seen in 2021 that preceded a major altcoin surge. “Is Solana history repeating itself? SOL has been consolidating near previous all-time highs for most of the year. A key level retest triggered a bullish reaction, and if history follows its 2021 trajectory, we could be on the verge of another major altseason,” the analysts wrote. According to analysts, Solana could surge to a minimum target of just over $1,750 if it mirrors its 2021 bull run, with the potential for an even greater upside. Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes weighed in, recently suggesting Ethereum will hit $5,000 before Solana reaches $300. Although the pundit did not give timeframes, he has previously projected that Bitcoin could reach a market peak by late March 2025, suggesting that the SOL price could reach his target around that time, should BTC rally. Beyond technical, fundamental drivers are also boosting sentiment. Apart from its inclusion in the U.S. government’s proposed cryptocurrency reserve, institutional interest is surging, with Fidelity joining six other firms seeking SEC approval for a spot Solana ETF. If approved, Solana would be officially classified as a commodity alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, significantly enhancing its regulatory standing. Additionally, Circle issued an additional 250 million USDC earlier this week on the Solana network, potentially increasing liquidity and network activity. Further validation came as Interactive Brokers, one of the largest global brokerage firms, announced expanded support for Solana, Cardano, XRP, and Dogecoin, broadening mainstream exposure. With institutional backing, expanding network adoption, and surging bullish sentiment, Solana’s resurgence is impossible to ignore. At press time, SOL was trading at $138.16, reflecting a 4.43% drop in the past 24 hours.

Title: Ethereum’s [ETH] short-term price targets – Is the $2,300 resistance too strong?

Key barriers stand before ETH’s price action on the charts. Ethereum [ETH] recently reclaimed its realized price at $2,040 on the charts, signaling renewed optimism across the market. This move indicated that Ethereum could be entering a recovery phase after its prolonged bear market. At press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,064.80, following a slight 0.10% decrease over the last 24 hours. Historically, when Ethereum crosses its realized price, it marks the beginning of a bullish trend. Therefore, this could be a crucial turning point for ETH. However, it still faces several hurdles that could slow down its momentum. At the time of writing, Ethereum’s MVRV ratio stood at approximately 1.02. MVRV ratios below 1 historically mean that a market bottom is near, while ratios above 2.4 indicate overvaluation. Ethereum’s press time position, therefore, signaled that while in a recovery phase, the altcoin was not yet overvalued. On the charts, Ethereum faces substantial resistance ahead at the $2,300-level. According to the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, this level marks a critical barrier that ETH must clear for a sustained bullish trend. ETH is also trading within a falling wedge channel near the upper boundary. Therefore, the price action around $2,300 will be pivotal in determining whether Ethereum’s recovery continues or stalls. Source: TradingView Whale activity continues to support the mid-term bullish case for ETH. Notably, BlackRock recently accumulated 1.25 million ETH worth around $2.5 billion – A sign of heightened institutional interest. However, on-chain metrics pointed to some mixed signals. Ethereum’s exchange reserves increased to 18.375 million ETH, up +0.18% in the last 24 hours. Rather than indicating demand, this uptick may suggest growing sell-side pressure as more ETH is being deposited into exchanges – Often a precursor to potential profit-taking. Meanwhile, user activity has remained strong, with 20,913 active addresses recorded – A +0.99% hike over the same period. This uptick in active wallets hinted at sustained network engagement, a positive sign for ETH’s fundamental health. On the contrary, Ethereum’s gas usage dropped sharply to 2.19 billion ETH – A steep decline from recent highs near 22 billion. This could reflect lower transaction volumes or fall in smart contract execution – Potentially signaling a short-term cooldown in network activity. Source: Santiment As predicted previously by AMBCrypto, Ethereum now faces a critical resistance zone between $2,200 and $2,250. Breaking above this zone could pave the way for a retest of the $2,400-level. However, if ETH struggles to maintain its momentum, it could face a pullback to the $2,000-support level. Therefore, market participants will need to watch for signs of either a breakthrough or a potential reversal. Ethereum has seen some strong signs of recovery, with positive MVRV ratios and growing institutional interest. However, the $2,300-resistance remains a significant hurdle. While ETH has the potential to break through this level, overcoming it will require sustained buying momentum and the clearing of key barriers. Given the prevailing market conditions, Ethereum is likely to face challenges in breaking this resistance in the short term.

Title: How the Irish ‘spice bag’ became worthy of inclusion in the Oxford English Dictionary
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/2025/03/27/how-the-irish-spice-bag-became-worthy-of-inclusion-in-the-oxford-english-dictionary/
Time Published: 2025-03-27T08:13:00Z
Full Content:
The addition of the spice bag to the most recent update of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) signals official recognition at last for the fast food staple people in Ireland have been enjoying for nearly 20 years. The OED attributes the invention of the spice bag to a Chinese takeaway in Dublin’s Templeogue called the Sunflower around 2006. By 2010 the spice bag had become the first dish since the chicken fillet roll to grab us by our culinary cojones and inspire a movement that has since gone global. In 2021, Deliveroo took it upon themselves to launch a Change.org appeal to the Irish government to greenlight a national spice bag day. No doubt the request is still under serious consideration. This odd fusion dish, in all its paper wrapping glory, has by now eclipsed its fast-food origins to become a cultural phenomenon. It is unapologetically Irish, with a surprisingly international twist, part comfort food, part hangover cure, and part guilty pleasure. But how did this quirky concoction come to dominate our late-night cravings? For the uninitiated, a spice bag is a glorious mishmash of crispy shredded chicken (or chicken balls), chunky chips, stir-fried vegetables, and a generous shake of hot seasoning. This golden, greasy delight is often topped with red chillies for a fiery kick and usually comes with the obligatory curry sauce. No two spice bags are the same – every takeaway has its secret blend, as fiercely guarded as the recipe for Coca-Cola. While no one can pinpoint the exact date spice bags began to appear on menus, the consensus is that it was sometime between 2006 and 2010. In 2016, RTÉ reporter Liam Geraghty embarked on a quest to discover who invented Ireland’s most-ordered takeaway item, and his journey brought him to the Sunflower Chinese takeaway in Templeogue where it is said the spice bag was born when staff came up with a post-work fusion snack. Others argue that its roots may lie in Galway or Cork, but wherever it began, its spread was rapid. Combining the flavours of Chinese five-spice, chilli powder and paprika with the Irish obsession with fried potatoes was a stroke of genius. It’s a marriage of two culinary traditions in a way that’s both unexpected and utterly addictive. It is salty, spicy, crispy and carb-heavy – hitting almost every comfort food craving. The chicken is typically deep-fried, providing a satisfying crunch, while the chips soak up all the seasoning goodness. The vegetables (usually a mix of onions, peppers and maybe a rogue carrot or two) add sweetness and texture, balancing out the heat from the all-important chillies. And then there’s the seasoning – the spice mix is where the real magic happens. While recipes vary, most blends include a mix of Chinese five-spice (a fragrant combination of star anise, fennel, cloves, cinnamon and Szechuan peppercorns), garlic powder, chilli flakes and a touch of sugar. The result is a flavour bomb that provides excellent soakage and instant gratification. Spice bag expert and all-round takeaway virtuoso Chris Mellon of @DublinSocial says: “I noticed the popularity of the spice bag at the start of 2023 and decided to create a series visiting our top eight recommended takeaways. The eight videos posted to Dublin Social’s Instagram and TikTok channels gained over 22 million views. Mind-boggling for such a simple dish. We had people all over the world messaging us on how to recreate the dish at home and in restaurants. Some of the world’s biggest online chefs have even done their own version. “I cover every type of restaurant but the popularity of these videos had people screaming spice bag recommendations at me in the street. What makes a great spice bag? For me, it’s all about the chilli. This might be controversial but my favourite is actually served in a tray. Red Rice in Kimmage serves theirs with lashings of their chilli mix, and it has a proper kick.” For Dublin-based food and drinks writer Shamim de Brún, it took a little longer to find her way to worship at the altar of the spice bag. “When I came home after college everyone was talking about it like I should just know what it was, so I pretended I did, ‘cos I was insecure and 21. Then I had one for the first time after a night out – it was only a fiver with a drink, and I was like, ‘I get it now.’ I love it when there’s loads of onions and peppers, which I know they’ve been pulling back on. I am forever a dipper not a douser when it comes to sauce. I think an air-fried spice bag is better than the original. And champagne is the best drink to have with it.” San Sab Thai restaurant and takeaway in Drumcondra (with outlets also in Clontarf and Blackrock) is renowned for its award-winning spice bags. Owner Zoë Magliocco has had them on the menu since it opened its doors in 2017, and the Thai-style spice bag is still its biggest seller. But what makes the San Sab spice bag different? According to Magliocco, there are several factors. “We use fresh chicken fillets that are prepped and breaded in-house each day, as is the (plentiful) veg.” Magliocco goes on to explain that San Sab doesn’t use MSG in the spice bags, and the house blend of Thai spice results in a lighter, fresher dish. [ Spice bag with Champagne? The best wines to drink with tonight’s takeawayOpens in new window ] With a kitchen fully staffed by Thai chefs, how did they feel about the addition of spice bags to an authentic Thai menu? “They didn’t want to do it,” says Magliocco, “but, as a business, they understood that it was needed.” With the Drumcondra branch on the doorstep of DCU, the queue for spice bags starts before the doors open, and the demand for the dish shows no sign of waning. The spice bag is so beloved that it has inspired everything from memes to merchandise, a dedicated Facebook appreciation society and a podcast. It has made its way into high-end restaurants and home kitchens, with jars of spice bag seasoning now sitting in kitchen cupboards around the country. Chefs have put their own spin on the dish, serving deconstructed versions, or using premium ingredients such as free-range chicken and hand-cut chips, and there are vegan and vegetarian spice bags, featuring tofu or plant-based chicken substitutes. The adaptability of the spice bag is part of its charm. Feeding both the stomach and the soul, it’s undeniably a suboptimal nutritional choice, but it ticks many, many boxes. A symbol of Ireland’s constantly evolving food culture, it’s a testament to the creativity of takeaway chefs and the changing appetite of Irish people.

Title: XRPL surpasses 2.8 billion flawless transactions – Major institutions are taking notice!

Could XRP Legder be the next game-changer for institutional adoption? Ripple is in the news after it reportedly reached a settlement with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), following the agency’s unconditional withdrawal of its appeal last week. This development adds to the wave of positive momentum around XRP. Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) continues to strengthen blockchain innovation, having processed over 2.8 billion transactions without a single security failure. In fact, recent data from CryptoQuant indicated a resurgence in XRPL activity since 23 March – Reversing a prior decline observed since 19 March. Owing to the same, XRP was trading just below $2.40 on the charts, up by just over 1% in the last 24 hours. Source: CryptoQuant The recent surge in XRP activity came on the back of remarks from Jasmine Cooper, RippleX’s Head of Products. She stressed on XRPL’s efficiency as a key factor attracting institutional investors. With its speed and reliability, XRPL is also becoming a preferred choice for asset issuers and institutional players. OpenEden, for instance, has achieved significant milestones in tokenizing U.S Treasury bills on the platform, offering institutional investors access to on-chain financial instruments. Additionally, BlackRock, a global asset management giant, is actively exploring asset tokenization, further aligning with XRPL’s growing role in the evolving digital finance landscape. Remarking on the success of XRPL, Cooper, in a podcast with Tony Edward, noted, “SockGen, for example, that are interested in issuing stable coins on the XRP ledger to asset managers that are participating with some of the tokenization platforms. There’s been, you know, Aberdeen has issued certain money market funds through Archax, which is a tokenization provider on the XRP ledger. So, I think there’s a wide range from banks to asset managers that are starting to discover the value of tokenization and of XRPL in particular.” The exec went on to say, “So, RLUSD is doing well. Adoption has been rapid. You know, there’s support in a variety of different centralized exchanges. Market cap is rapidly growing. So I think we’re excited about it.” Cooper further shed light on XRPL’s expanding ecosystem. She stated that it is setting the stage for broader adoption, driven by advancements in DeFi and cross-border payments. Finally, she noted how the introduction of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) has enhanced on-chain trading and liquidity, reducing reliance on centralized exchanges. RippleX’s efforts to integrate an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain that aims to attract developers by enabling Ethereum-based smart contracts while leveraging XRPL’s efficiency is also gaining traction. That being said, the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s new USD-backed stablecoin, has further strengthened the network’s utility. Particularly in cross-border transactions. Therefore, if RLUSD secures regulatory approval and gains institutional traction, XRPL’s adoption could accelerate, positioning it as a key player in blockchain finance.

Title: China tells state firms to halt deals with Li Ka-shing and his family: Report

East Asia Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings company, speaks during a press conference to announce the company's annual results in Hong Kong on Mar 16, 2018. (File photo: AP/Kin Cheung) China has instructed state-owned firms to pause new deals with businesses linked to Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and his family after his plan to sell two ports in Panama to a BlackRock-led consortium, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday (Mar 27). CK Hutchison, the telecoms-to-retail conglomerate owned by Li, has been caught in China's crosshairs in the highly politicised deal with the United States firm. The Hong Kong-based company this month agreed to sell most of its global ports business, including assets near the strategically important Panama Canal, in a deal that would garner the firm more than US$19 billion in cash. The directive was issued to state-owned enterprises last week at the behest of senior officials, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Existing tie-ups are not affected. The report added that Chinese regulators are also reviewing what investments the family has in China and abroad in a bid to better understand the breadth of their business dealings. Shares of CK Hutchison Holdings rose 1.2 per cent by noon, down from a gain of as much as 3.6 per cent earlier in the day. Over the past two weeks, pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao has published a series of commentaries criticising the deal for harming China's national interests and depicting it as a betrayal of China. China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted some of the commentaries on its website, which fuelled speculation Beijing could take steps to try to scupper the sale. Chinese regulators, under the instructions of central leadership, have begun looking into the deal, a source has told Reuters, a sign of Beijing's discontent with CK Hutchison's divestment under perceived US pressure. US President Donald Trump has hailed the transaction after previously calling for the Panama Canal to be removed from what he deemed to be Chinese control.

Title: The Racial Content of Advertising

Time Published: 2025-03-27T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
In an advertisement currently running on TV, a young white male kneels on his front lawn, trimming the grass one blade at a time with a nail clipper. Next door, a slightly older black male sits comfortably on his porch, scanning his automated payroll accounts with an air of confidence and superiority as he looks askance at his foolish neighbor. In another ad, a large, middle-aged black woman dances and sings her way through the supermarket aisles, waited upon entirely by whites. At one point, she stands still, looking doubtfully at a middle-aged white male who has taken a break from mopping the floors. In the end, she breezes out of the store, her cart filled by white employees overjoyed to serve her. In yet another ad, two young girls are selling something like Girl Scout cookies — one using a payment app and another relying on cash. The black girl who uses the app has sold her entire wagonload of goods before the other has sold much of anything. At the end, the black girl wheels her wagon off with a baseball glove and ball inside (indicating she is headed out to play), looking back with a knowing smile at her less clued-in white neighbor. These are just a few of the dozens of ads now airing that depict whites in a demeaning manner and blacks as their superiors in intelligence and ability. “Racial superiority” was once regarded as immoral if not criminal, but now it is out in the open, with blacks consistently depicted as more capable than whites. Nearly every medical doctor in the media is depicted as a black male, a throwback to Dr. Huxtable on the Cosby Show. Increasingly, investment advisers and plant managers are depicted as black, despite the fact that in real life, 4.7% of medical doctors are black, while 6.3% of plant managers and 1.9% of investment advisers are black. The advertising world’s depiction of blacks bears no relation to reality; it seems to be driven by sheer ideology. Some will see this discrepancy as excusable and chalk it up to a sort of cultural affirmative action. For decades, whites were depicted in dominant roles. Old movies often portray black women as maids and black men as porters, as in fact many were, but those blacks who were successful in business or the professions, and surely there were many, were rarely shown. So the argument is that now it’s time for whites to be underrepresented. The problem is that when whites were depicted in superior roles, that was a reflection of reality. In 1960, the vast majority of doctors, managers, and other professionals really were white, much more so than today. In 1960, 2.8% of physicians in the U.S. were black. The causes of this low number were complex, more so than pure racial exclusion, but undoubtedly were often the result of unfair practices. Today, the vast majority of professionals are still white, but whites are almost universally depicted as inferior. It is a strange anomaly and not without consequences. No one can object to seeing black actors depicted positively in television ads. But the problem is that today, blacks are almost always depicted as superior to whites, and the percentage of ads that feature blacks in leading roles — the chief of the boardroom, the manager of the office, the factory supervisor, the smart investor, the well-spoken, well-groomed leader paired with a clueless white — is not credible. One consequence is anger on the part of whites. Most reasonable people are willing to judge others of all races on the basis of merit, but the depiction of whites and blacks in today’s advertising does not reflect merit. Whites who have worked hard in school, earned postgraduate degrees, and devoted themselves to their jobs find themselves depicted as innately inferior to blacks. They know that this is not the case, but there is no way to escape the barrage of hateful depictions. This racial inequality must be confusing for blacks as well, for surely they realize how insincere and dishonest the ads are. The ads are a form of racial pandering, and they may represent a desperate effort on the part of corporations to cover their bases: Large investors such as BlackRock and Vanguard control billions of shares of stock, sometimes amounting to 20% or more of a company’s stock. Those investors have reportedly become “woke” to the point of insisting on more positive portrayals of minorities. For those who do not understand the role of index funds in pressuring corporations, the racial content of advertising must be mystifying. But for many, the ads appear as confirmation that blacks have automatically received priority over whites throughout the culture. Non-minority workers who have lived through the years since affirmative action was widely implemented, which is to say, nearly all white and Asian workers, have suffered a lack of opportunity. They have been passed over for promotions, paid less, or outright excluded from employment, while less qualified blacks have been hired and quickly promoted based on their race. Private companies, schools and universities, the media, and the government have played along with this racist program, refusing to acknowledge that it is unfair. Tens of millions of lives have been harmed, but again, few have spoken out because of the fear of being accused of racism. There is racism in our country, but most of it is now directed against whites and Asians. We are expected to sit still and watch what we know to be a lie because radicals in the media and elsewhere believe they are righting the wrongs of the past. One does not right past wrongs by imposing a national program of anti-white and anti-Asian education, employment, and promotion. One does not “change the culture” by airing hundreds of thousands of ads that people know to be false. Blacks on television dressed up in white coats are not really doctors, but neither are blacks who have been passed along through college and medical school based on their race. Now, under President Trump, this form of “shameful discrimination,” as the president has called it, is being eliminated. Federal agencies are closing down DIE programs, and private companies have begun to modify their DIE programs as well to re-introduce “merit.” In the case of J. P. Morgan Chase, DIE has been modified to DOI (diversity, opportunity, inclusion), a step in the right direction. One would hope that individuals of all races will soon experience opportunity based on their performance, not their skin color. As for those annoying ads, I mute the sound or switch to another network so I don’t have to listen to them. Racism, no matter what form it takes or for what purpose, is anathema to the spirit of our country. Only by eliminating racism entirely will we bring about fairness based on merit for all Americans.

BlackRock is looking to add more people to its digital asset team as the industry grows in popularity among Wall Street firms. Since the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, big names in finance have taken several steps to expand their presence in crypto. While BlackRock has long been a pioneer in the space, especially among traditional financial banks, the asset manager seems to have more in store. Four roles on BlackRock’s digital asset team were added to its website on Wednesday, including Director of Digital Assets, Director of Regulatory Affairs, Vice President for Digital Asset and ETF Legal Counsel and Associate for Digital Asset. According to the job description, three of the roles are based in New York and another one in Atlanta. The descriptions have otherwise been kept fairly broad and don’t give away any clues regarding what BlackRock might be looking to work on in the future. For the role of the legal counsel, the company is seeking somebody who can help with future crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches. BlackRock has so far issued two spot ETF products, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Other issuers have applied to launch funds for several other crypto assets, including Solana (SOL), XRP, and Litecoin (LTC). BlackRock has not announced any plans to do the same. The asset manager is also strongly focused on tokenization, a sector in which it has quickly become a leading force. The firm’s tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), has drawn in $1.7 billion since its introduction in 2023, making it by far the largest tokenized fund on the market currently.

Title: Bitcoin: Are BTC miners holding for a bigger price jump?

Time Published: 2025-03-27T03:00:31Z

Bitcoin’s miner reserve stability, coupled with institutional interest, signals potential for price growth. Bitcoin [BTC]’s Miner Reserve has remained stable, with no significant selling activity recorded over the past 24 hours. This indicates that miners are holding onto their Bitcoin, signaling confidence in future price movements. Source: X The stability in miner behavior could suggest that miners are waiting for favorable market conditions to sell at higher prices. As a result, this steady behavior in the miner reserve is a key indicator to watch for potential shifts in market dynamics. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $88,020.88, up 1.53% over the past 24 hours. BTC has recently broken out of a descending trendline and was bouncing off the demand zone. This suggests strong buying interest around these price levels, which could help push Bitcoin higher. The Bollinger Bands indicated that BTC was nearing the lower range of its bands, suggesting that consolidation is in play or a breakout might be imminent. Additionally, the RSI reading of 53.25 showed neutral market sentiment, signaling no overbought or oversold conditions at the moment. Source: TradingView Looking at Bitcoin’s In/Out of the Money chart, the majority of addresses holding BTC are in profit, with 78.28% of addresses “in the money.” This distribution is important because it signals strong support levels beneath the current price. Furthermore, it suggests that the market sentiment is generally bullish, as most holders are in profit. The absence of significant losses in BTC holdings could be a sign that the price has enough upward momentum to avoid a significant pullback. Source: Coinglass At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) stood at 0.501, showing that the market is in a profit zone. A positive NUPL reflects strong market sentiment, with most Bitcoin holders enjoying unrealized gains. Source: CryptoQuant Bitcoin’s whale activity has been noteworthy, highlighted by the recent transfer of 2,760 BTC. Institutional investors, such as BlackRock, are also accumulating substantial amounts of Bitcoin. Earlier this year, BlackRock purchased $42 million worth of BTC, reinforcing the prevailing bullish sentiment. Combined with whale movements, this institutional activity indicates that key players are preparing for potential future price surges. With stable miner reserves, a positive NUPL, and a breakout from a descending trendline, Bitcoin appears positioned for an upward move. Institutional accumulation, including BlackRock’s $42 million Bitcoin purchase, alongside notable whale activity, adds fuel to this potential rally. The coming days will be pivotal in determining whether BTC can sustain its momentum and solidify a stronger bullish trend.

Scheduling Note: There will be no newsletter March 27th. I may be in your inboxes Friday if we get the readout of the March Politburo meeting, and it is interesting. Summary of today’s top items: 1. Reporting Column for Heinous Acts of 'Taiwan Independence' Enforcers and Accomplices Persecuting Taiwan Compatriots - Chen Binhua, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, gave a fiery press conference today. He denounced, as usual, the DPP and Taiwan President Lai, and also announced a new “Reporting Column for Heinous Acts of 'Taiwan Independence' Enforcers and Accomplices Persecuting Taiwan Compatriots 台独’打手、帮凶迫害台湾同胞恶劣行径举报专栏”. You can submit reports to jubao@suremail.cn. 2. Reaction to latest US entity listings - The Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said the “U.S. move is intended to suppress and contain entities from other countries and deprive other countries of their rights to development. It will seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of relevant entities and undermine the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains. This U.S. move is not conducive to creating an atmosphere for both parties to resolve issues through dialogue and cooperation”. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said it is “typical hegemonic behavior, seriously violating international law and norms, damaging corporate rights and undermining global industrial and supply chain security”. 3. He Lifeng and USTR head talk - United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer held an “ introductory” video meeting with Vice Premier He Lifeng. Both readouts make it sound pro-forma, but at least there is a channel for discussion, especially as we are just a week away from Trump’s tariff “liberation day”. 4. Trump dangles Tariff cuts for TikTok deal - In a press conference today he said “TikTok is very popular, very successful, very good. And we're gonna have a form of a deal. But if it's not finished, it's not a big deal; we'll just extend it. I have the right to have the deal and to extend it if I want. We have a lot of interest in TikTok. China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly, in the form of an approval maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done.” 5. CK Hutchinson-BlackRock ports deal - According to Bloomberg the two sides expect to sign an agreement next week, even as Beijing-controlled Ta Kung Pao launched another broadside against the deal, and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, both central government bodies, again reposted it. It is not at all clear what Beijing or Hong Kong can do to block the deal, but there is still time to find a way. 6. IShowSpeed livestreaming from China - IShowSpeed is a livestreamer with 37 million YouTube followers. He is livestreaming from China this week and he is loving it. The Global Times praised his visit, writing “amid recent "China Travel" fever, more foreign internet influencers are visiting China. Among them, American YouTube sensation Darren "IShowSpeed" is under the spotlight with his ongoing China travel. “What are the odds this IShowSpeed PRC tour is organic and not officially supported in some way? Even if it has no official backing, it is a huge soft power win for the PRC. And if the tour does have official support then the cadres involved deserve promotions. The PRC embassy in the US is a fan: Earlier today I published this week’s episode of Sharp China - Welcoming Foreign Enterprises; Ships are the New Chips; He Weidong and More PLA Rumors; Deep-Sea Cable Cutter. From the show notes: On today's show Andrew and Bill begin with the China Development Forum, including China's messaging to foreign investors, revisiting the Mintz raids as five detained employees are finally released, no updates on a Xi-Trump meeting, and news in the EV space. From there: The US plans to revive shipbuilding capacity, the likely disruption if the US adopts the USTR recommendations to counter Chinese dominance, Michael Froman writes that China has remade the international system, and a few more thoughts on the CK Hutchison deal. At the end: Rumors swirl around He Weidong and others in the PLA, what the noise might signal, and news of a deep-sea cable cutter is accompanied by a reminder that China constructs and protects deep sea cable like no other. You can listen to it here.

A dormant Bitcoin whale has resurfaced after eight years, transferring huge assets and leading the community to a frenzy. Over the years, ancient whales mostly become active after a major price uptick to maximize gains. These new fund movements can affect other whales, depending on the dominant market sentiment. Data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence shows the dormant whale transferred 3,000 BTC worth approximately $250 million. The whale’s stash grew from $3M in 2017 to the present levels. This transfer led to heated debates on the asset’s direction in the coming weeks. “$250M BITCOIN WHALE WAKES UP AFTER 8 YEARS. A Bitcoin Whale that has held BTC since late 2016 has just moved over $250M in BTC last night. His Bitcoin stack went from $3M in early 2017 to over $250M today – and he’s held Bitcoin on one address for over 8 years,” Arkham wrote on X. The move coincided with a 4.7% weekly uptick in Bitcoin’s price. For most holders, the whale might seek to sell assets following the recent price recovery. This month, Bitcoin and the wider crypto market have faced significant headwinds, plunging over 20%. This also sparked a similar reaction from other whales looking to secure previous gains. This year, the market has recorded an outflow of large holders, leading to a price drop from its all-time high above $108k to present levels. Traditionally, whale movements swing the market due to the size of their holdings. Present market forces also led to huge sales from Bitcoin miners plunging reserves. On the flipside, previous dormant whales have added to their holdings or repositioned assets. Recent activities around the leading crypto have triggered a 4% jump in the last seven days. After weeks of negative trading, bulls set their sights on a renewed surge past the $90k mark. According to Arkham, BlackRock accumulated over $100 million worth of Bitcoin without making a sale last week. Most institutional investors have also followed this trend. Furthermore, Michael Saylor’s Strategy bought 6,911 coins last week, surpassing 500,000 BTC in holdings. Most traders remain positive on the upward asset trajectory, citing recent developments from whales. The U.S. regulatory space marking a handful of pro-industry wins heightened bullish confidence in the market.

Title: BlackRock Debuts Bitcoin ETF In Europe Following Blockbuster IBIT Success

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has launched a new Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe following the wild success of its US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Since its debut, the iShares Bitcoin Trust has accumulated nearly $51 billion in assets under management. The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IBIT) started trading on March 25 on Xetra, and Euronext Paris under the “IBIT” ticker and on Euronext Amsterdam under “BTCN”. “Each ETP security corresponds to a specific amount of Bitcoin,” a prospectus on the iShares website reads. The new Bitcoin product features a temporary waiver of 10 basis points, reducing its fee to 0.15% until the end of this year. This marks BlackRock’s first major step to expand its crypto ETP product range outside the United States after the success of the spot Bitcoin ETF. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of iShares Product for Europe and the Middle East, told Bloomberg: “[This launch] reflects what really could be seen as a tipping point in the industry — the combination of established demand from retail investors with more professionals now really getting into the fold.” America’s leading exchange, Coinbase, will custody the digital assets for BlackRock’s new product in cold storage. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the fund’s administrator. IBIT is currently the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF, holding roughly $50.7 billion in net assets, accounting for about 2.73% of the top crypto’s total supply. When it was rolled out in January last year, it quickly garnered investor attention and began drawing in billions of dollars in investments. While there have been ETPs linked to cryptocurrencies already trading in Europe for several years, the local market is considerably smaller compared to the U.S. — $13.6 billion versus $105 billion assets under management. The largest crypto ETP in Europe is currently managed by CoinShares International Ltd, with $1.3 billion under management and a 0.25% fee. This makes BlackRock’s Europe ETP much cheaper while the waiver is in place.

Title: New SEC Chair Paul Atkins Holds $6,000,000 in Crypto-Related Investments – Here’s His Portfolio: Report

The new Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly has a crypto portfolio worth millions of dollars. According to a new report from Fortune, an ethics disclosure reveals that Paul Atkins – President Donald Trump’s nominee to be the next SEC Chair – holds about $6 million in crypto-related investments, including $1 million worth of equity in two crypto firms and $5 million in crypto investment funds. Atkins, who previously served as the SEC’s Chair between 2002 and 2008 under then-President George W. Bush, held a board seat on Securitize – a tokenization firm backed by asset management giant BlackRock – and owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of call options in the company, according to the report. He also held between $250,000 and $500,000 in equity in crypto bank Anchorage Digital and between $1 million and $5 million worth of staked crypto on Off the Chain Capital, an investment fund of which he is a limited partner. In the ethics agreement, Atkins agreed to divest his holdings after his confirmation, which is slated for Thursday. According to Bloomberg, Atkins and his spouse have a net worth of at least $327 million. Under the helm of its previous Chair, Gary Gensler, the SEC waged war on the digital assets industry by accusing several high-profile crypto firms, including Ripple Labs, Binance, Coinbase, and Consensys, of violating securities laws. Gensler also deemed many crypto assets, including smart contract platforms Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), as securities that fell under the agency’s regulatory jurisdiction.

Title: Looking for a job in a recession? Here's the advice this career coach gives her clients.

Recession fears, DOGE cuts, broad layoffs — It's a tough time to be looking for a job. But it's definitely not impossible, and there are certain steps you can take to make sure your next job is more resilient to volatile economic conditions, according to career coach Marnie Lemonik. Big companies like Meta and Blackrock have announced plans to cut down their workforce numbers this year. Unemployment has ticked up slightly from 3.9% a year ago to 4.1% now. And while DOGE layoffs didn't lead to a spike in unemployment claims in February, they could start showing up in next month's data, according to Shruti Mishra, an economist at Bank of America. Uncertainty around DOGE and tariffs could also lead some employers to pause hiring, Mishra added. The choppy economic environment doesn't paint a rosy picture for those who are looking for a new job. However, it hasn't deterred some people — namely, Gen Z workers. In fact, the prevalence of layoffs might further incentivize some workers to start recruiting. "The sentiment that I'm hearing from clients is 'I don't really feel a lot of stability,' and so that loyalty to a company for any given amount of time or reason is just less relevant because no one feels like they're getting that loyalty from the employer side," Lemonik said. Here's the advice Lemonik gives her clients who are looking for jobs right now. Lemonik's clients are exercising more caution in today's job market than they did in previous years. Last year, it wasn't uncommon for Lemonik to see burnt-out clients quit their jobs with nothing lined up. "Even a year ago, I felt like I was working with more people that were like, 'I'm really burned out at my job, and if I don't have another job in 3 months, I think I'm still going to take a break,'" Lemonik said. Now, she's seeing more hesitation from her clients. "It's less so that people are gripping to the job that they have, but more so that they're not willing to take that risk of leaving without another job," Lemonik added. One of the most common questions Lemonik's clients ask her when they interview for jobs is how they can determine if the job is safe from layoffs. The biggest takeaway that Lemonik shared? You can't definitively predict if a job is "stable" or "safe." "I think we all have to have some stability within ourselves in the way that we build our own career paths and financial safety nets because you can't put your stability or safety in any employer. This is my honest take that I give people," Lemonik told BI. That's why it can be helpful to build up an emergency fund and evaluate your current budget to see where you can cut back on spending. Upskilling and investing in your career can also be ways to negotiate your salary at your next job and preserve job security in an economic downturn. Lemonik tells her clients to take advantage of the opportunity to do their due diligence on a job when hiring managers ask, "Do you have any questions for me?" "Could this be a department that's cut? Is this a smart type of role to be getting? Are these the first people out when there's no more budget left? These are the things people are trying to figure out," Lemonik said. Asking the interviewer certain questions at the end of the interview can give you insights into how insulated the role is from economic volatility. Lemonik recommends asking about the direction of the company, as well as situational questions about how the company has dealt with challenges in the past. She provided the following examples: These questions allow you to examine if the role you're interviewing for has long-term growth potential. They also highlight what to expect from company leadership. "I think anything you can do to explore how the leaders of the company operate when things are not as certain is a good indicator of how the company is going to react to potentially inevitable changes," Lemonik said.

Title: Fidelity confirms stablecoin testing but no plans to launch yet

The asset manager recently filed for a tokenized fund, following other traditional finance giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Fidelity is reportedly in advanced testing phases of its own stablecoin as part of its digital asset expansion, the Financial Times reported on March 26. However, a company spokesperson told Reuters that the firm does not have plans to launch the stablecoin in the near term. Earlier this month, a Fidelity unit filed to launch a tokenized money market fund. Under the proposal, investor shares would be recorded on the blockchain via conventional electronic recordkeeping systems, signaling the firm’s continued interest in exploring blockchain applications within existing financial products. Fidelity’s potential move comes amid a wave of institutional interest in stablecoins, driven by clearer regulatory signals and growing adoption in the US under President Donald Trump’s administration. The stablecoin sector currently commands a $231 billion market cap and processed $27.6 trillion in transfer volume last year, outpacing both Visa and Mastercard. Interest in stablecoins is rising rapidly since they offer fast, borderless, and cost-efficient settlement that outperforms traditional financial infrastructure. Institutions see stablecoins as a more efficient alternative to legacy systems. The surge in adoption comes as regulatory clarity begins to take shape, with bipartisan legislation in the US paving the way for compliant issuance. At the same time, stablecoins are gaining geopolitical relevance, as dollar-pegged tokens are viewed as a way to reinforce the US dollar’s dominance in a global economy facing competition from CBDCs and rival currencies. Beyond stablecoins, the broader trend of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) continues to gain momentum. On March 25, the market for tokenized U.S. Treasuries surpassed $5 billion, with over half of that value managed by traditional finance heavyweights like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Given Fidelity’s scale — managing $5.9 trillion in assets as the world’s third-largest asset manager — its growing interest in the space reflects a broader institutional shift. The regulatory environment for stablecoins is also rapidly evolving. On March 13, the Senate Banking Committee passed the bipartisan GENIUS Act in an 18-6 vote. Introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty, the legislation seeks to establish clear rules for the issuance and oversight of stablecoins in the US. One key provision would require U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins to maintain full 1:1 reserves in cash, insured bank deposits, or short-term Treasury bills. Bo Hines, Executive Director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets Markets, stated on March 18 that a regulatory framework for stablecoins could be approved by Trump within two months.

Title: XRP ETF Mania: Pundit Predicts BlackRock And Fidelity Will Soon Jump Into The Ring Amid Ripple’s Victory

With the Securities and Exchange Commission finally pulling the plug on a four-year court battle with Ripple, the chances of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) being greenlighted in the U.S. have certainly increased. A top analyst has predicted that Wall Street giants BlackRock and Fidelity will soon enter the XRP ETF race. On Wednesday, Ripple agreed to pay a $50 million fine to end the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s years-long enforcement case concerning the XRP cryptocurrency. The SEC sued Ripple in late 2020, accusing it of raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering of XRP. As ZyCrypto reported, Ripple’s CLO, Stuart Alderoty, said that the company had meanwhile agreed to drop its cross-appeal of U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling, which found that XRP is “not necessarily a security on its face,” especially within the context of programmatic sales to retail customers. Alderoty’s announcement follows Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s declaration that the SEC’s case has ended. He described it as a “long overdue surrender” on the financial regulator’s part last week. The SEC’s about-face was widely anticipated following Trump’s return to the White House. Since Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda took over the commission’s reins, it has retreated from several lawsuits, including those against Robinhood, Coinbase, and OpenSea. The SEC’s retreat opens the door for mainstream institutional access to XRP, potentially transforming a once-embattled crypto into an approved financial product alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, is now convinced that the regulator’s approval of spot XRP ETFs is only “a matter of time.” At least seven major investment firms, including Bitwise, 21Shares, Grayscale, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton, have filed for XRP-focused ETFs in anticipation of regulatory greenlight. But despite the growing XRP ETF filing craze, BlackRock — issuer of the largest spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) — has yet to submit a filing for an XRP-based product. But the top ETF analyst sees this changing soon. “And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc, to all be involved. XRP currently the 3rd largest non-stablecoin crypto asset by market cap. Largest ETF issuers aren’t going to ignore this,” Geraci added. XRP was valued at $2.40 as of press time after shedding 1.6% over the last 24 hours.

Title: Banks' Spot Crypto Holdings Continue to Collapse as Firms Move to ETPs

Banks across the globe held a total of 341.5 billion euros ($368.3 billion) in crypto assets under custody in the second quarter of 2024 but spot crypto assets now make up less than 3% of banks' holdings — down significantly from a few years ago, data by standard setter Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) showed on Wednesday. BCBS, which focuses on setting measures to ensure the stability of banks, gathered voluntary and confidential submissions from 176 banks — of which 115 are internationally active — in June 2024. The data showed that just 29 banks contributed to the 341.5 billion euro figure, and the vast majority hold exchange-traded products tracking crypto over cryptocurrencies. Global watchdogs have been keeping a close eye on how interlinked the financial sector is with crypto following the collapse of crypto-friendly banks like Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Banks in 2023. The BCBS also recommended that banks' spot crypto exposure should not exceed 2% in December 2022. Banks appear to be following through on this; their exposure to spot crypto holdings fell 44% between 2021 to 2022. As of the June 2024 survey, banks held almost no spot crypto, at 2.46%, instead preferring exchange-traded products. About 92.5% of banks' holdings are now in these more regulated products tracking crypto prices, rather than crypto assets themselves, the BCBS survey showed.

Title: Mother Revamps Global Leadership Ahead of 30th Anniversary

We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters. Mother has overhauled its global leadership team ahead of its 30th anniversary. Felix Richter, previously chief creative officer of Mother London, has been named global chief creative officer. Teri Miller takes on the dual roles of U.S. chief executive officer and global chief client officer. Katie Mackay-Sinclair, who was a partner at Mother London, assumes the role of global chief brand officer, and Chris Gallery, also a former partner at Mother London, has been appointed global chief strategy officer. The four will continue their existing responsibilities—Richter leading Mother London’s creative output, Miller overseeing U.S. operations, and Mackay-Sinclair and Gallery shaping strategy and brand vision—while joining global CEO Michael Wall and founder Robert Saville in leading Mother’s creative and strategic direction across offices in London, New York, Los Angeles, Berlin and Shanghai. “This is a world-class team, and they are proven and high-quality practitioners for Mother,” Wall said in a statement. Richter, who joined Mother London in 2022 as CCO and global creative partner after more than a decade at Droga5, has led the agency to major accolades, including ADWEEK’s International Agency of the Year in 2024. Under his leadership, the agency has produced acclaimed work for Uber, KFC, and IKEA. His new post marks the first time in Mother’s history that the agency has had a global creative lead. In the role, he will collaborate with the CCOs across Mother’s offices while continuing to oversee London’s creative output. Richter noted that the creation of a global CCO role formalizes a natural shift toward increased global collaboration across Mother’s offices in London, New York, Los Angeles, Berlin, and Shanghai over the past few years. “We are finding that our most exciting new business wins, and the most exciting work that comes out, are often the results of collaboration between offices of all different shapes and sizes,” Richter told ADWEEK. Miller, meanwhile, will take the helm on leading Mother’s expansion in North America after Mother U.S. CEO Peter Ravailhe announced his departure last week. Since joining in 2022 from 72andSunny, where she served as president, Miller has played a key role in securing major clients for Mother including Electronic Arts, General Motors, BlackRock and General Mills. Mackay-Sinclair and Gallery, both longtime strategists at Mother, will shape the agency’s global brand and strategic vision. Both have been instrumental in Mother London’s success, including leading work that earned a UK Effie Grand Prix for IKEA’s sustained success. The leadership restructuring comes as Mother continues to expand its client portfolio. Recent wins include General Motors adding Mother LA to its roster, Sonic retaining Mother as its lead creative agency, and Seventh Generation naming Mother New York its agency of record. The agency has also picked up assignments for Duolingo and General Mills. Mother US CEO Peter Ravailhe Leaves for Luxury Consultancy As independent agencies gain momentum as an alternative to holding companies, Mother sees an opportunity to double down on its positioning as a global independent. “It feels like the time is ours,” Mackay-Sinclair told ADWEEK. “When we look at the context of our industry, there are mergers, there’s collapsing of big, established creative brands.” In Mackay-Sinclair’s telling, it’s the agency’s longevity that sets it apart: “There might be a lot of indies out there, but you’re not really an indie unless you’ve been doing it for the long haul… We are lucky to be sitting here thinking, ‘What do the next 30 years of Mother look like?’” Audrey Kemp is a staff reporter for Adweek based in New York City.

Title: Solana Gets A $1.7 Billion Boost As BlackRock Expands Tokenized Funds

Financial management behemoth BlackRock has made another move in its approach to blockchain by starting a fund for big clients on the Solana network. Reports from Fortune say that this fund, called the USD Institutional Digital Fund (BUIDL), is now available on seven different blockchain platforms. BlackRock, which manages $11.6 trillion in assets, has been slowly entering the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Since its start in March 2024, BUIDL has already gathered $1.7 billion in assets. Experts believe the fund could reach $2 billion by April. Solana is attractive because it carries out transactions fast and charges low fees. This blockchain gives investors constant access to regular financial tools. Michael Sonnenshein, the COO of Securitize, says this way of doing things makes it easier and more convenient for funds like treasuries. The institutions are here. Today @Securitize launched the largest yield-bearing tokenized treasury fund ($1.7B), BUIDL, on Solana. BUIDL is issued by BlackRock — the world’s largest asset manager. More from Fortune:https://t.co/pFRrr341Kv — Solana (@solana) March 25, 2025 BlackRock brought its Bitcoin ETP to Europe on Tuesday. It announced that it would start on Xetra and in Euronext Paris and Amsterdam. Franklin Templeton also entered the blockchain scene by launching a money fund on Solana in February. This shows that more major financial groups are interested in using blockchain for investment products. In addition to running funds on blockchain, BlackRock has set up Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, Canada, and Europe. CEO Larry Fink believes blockchain will be important in future financial tools. The company appears to have shifted its focus to asset tokenization after the breakthrough. Moving traditional investment vehicles to the blockchain is the next big thing, Fink said. BUIDL is now a part of blockchain networks like Ethereum, Optimism, Aptos, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Polygon. The fund, backed by cash and Treasury bills, offers big investors a new way to invest using regular financial methods. BlackRock’s effort to merge blockchain with everyday financial products is clear with $1.7 billion already invested, showing strong interest from investors in these new financial tools. Choosing Solana shows the growing confidence in this blockchain’s ability to manage many transactions fast and at a low cost. This makes it a suitable option for big financial firms seeking innovative investment methods.

Polymarket predicts high chances of XRP ETF approval amid Ripple's SEC settlement. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Optimism around a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) is rising as Ripple edges closer to the end of its long-standing legal clash with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On March 26, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, sparked fresh discussion around the possibility of an XRP ETF. He suggested that regulatory approval might be closer than expected, especially with Ripple’s courtroom challenges nearing resolution. Geraci expressed confidence that once the path clears, heavyweight asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity could offer XRP-based investment products. BlackRock and Fidelity are the world’s leading asset management firms, managing more than $15 trillion in assets cumulatively. The two firms have significant exposure to the crypto industry, with their Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominating the market. Geraci’s optimism is rooted in XRP’s strong market presence. Currently, it ranks as the third-largest non-stablecoin crypto by market capitalization—a position likely to draw institutional interest. According to him: “XRP currently 3rd largest non-stablecoin crypto asset by market cap. Largest ETF issuers aren’t going to ignore this.” Market sentiment supports this outlook. Crypto bettors on the decentralized betting marketplace Polymarket have placed heavy bets on an XRP ETF approval, assigning it an 86% probability of getting SEC clearance by the end of 2025. The recent rise in confidence follows key developments in Ripple’s legal battle with the financial regulator. Last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the SEC had withdrawn its appeal, marking a turning point in the multi-year legal standoff. On March 25, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty confirmed that the company would pay a $50 million fine and drop its cross-appeal against the regulator. A key component of the proposed resolution includes lifting a court order that previously barred Ripple from selling XRP to institutional investors. However, this action still awaits SEC Commissioner approval and a green light from the court. Despite concerns over tighter regulatory oversight, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz clarified that the settlement does not alter the company’s core legal position. According to him, Ripple will continue operating under its current framework, with the lifting of the injunction being only one of several developments likely to take shape under the SEC’s new leadership.

Title: BlackRock BUIDL expands into Solana – Is this what SOL needs to beat ETH?

Is BlackRock’s move to Solana a signal that Ethereum is losing ground? BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is strengthening its foothold in the crypto sector by expanding its blockchain-based money market fund to Solana [SOL]. In collaboration with its technology partner Securitize, BlackRock has introduced a new share class of the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Fund (BUIDL) on SOL’s network. This move comes a year after the fund’s initial launch and highlights BlackRock’s continued push into tokenized finance. By integrating BUIDL into Solana’s ecosystem, investors can now leverage the network’s low transaction costs and instant settlement capabilities. Remarking on the same, Carlos Domingo, Co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said, “As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step.” Adding to the fray was Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation, who noted, “Solana is uniquely positioned to drive the next wave of adoption for tokenized real-world assets due to the network’s speed, low costs and active developer ecosystem. Blackrock’s expansion of BUIDL on Solana offers users a network that balances innovation with the operational efficiency the industry demands.” BlackRock’s expansion of its BUIDL fund to Solana comes amid a significant increase in its Ethereum [ETH] holdings, which have surged to a record $1.145 billion. In fact, Kyle Samani, co-founder and managing partner of Multicoin Capital, recently reinforced his bullish outlook on SOL in an interview with Frank Chaparro. On the other hand, Samani also raised critical concerns about ETH’s roll-up-centric scaling approach, questioning its long-term viability. His remarks reflect the ongoing debate between Solana and Ethereum among industry leaders and who is going to outpace the other. That being said, Solana’s dominance over Ethereum remains evident across key metrics such as DEX trading volume, user activity, and transaction fees. While its fee advantage briefly narrowed in February, Solana has consistently maintained a multi-million-dollar lead since early January. Seeing this, analysts at Delphi Digital predict that this trend could extend into 2025, positioning SOL as the top Layer 1 blockchain. Additionally, on the price front, SOL continues to outperform, recently rising 3.83% to $144.51, while ETH saw a modest 0.87% increase to $2,069.30. Therefore, with strong momentum and sustained growth, Solana’s competitive edge over Ethereum appears poised to strengthen further.

Title: ‘Critically Important’: Iran Allegedly Used China as Golden Ticket to Quietly Operate in Panama Canal

DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—China’s growing foothold over the Panama Canal isn’t just fueling its own commercial interests, it also appears to be helping America’s adversaries engage side-step sanctions, court documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show. China has expanded its presence considerably in the Panama Canal since former President Jimmy Carter sold the shipping lane to Panama for $1 in 1977, and is funding multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects in the surrounding countryside while buying up ports to solidify its foothold. It’s also been a boon to American adversaries, like Iran. Panamanian court documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show how Iran appeared to have used proxy firms based in Hong Kong to register ships in the Panama Canal and attempted to reap the benefits of chartering its ships. “Given the presence of Chinese companies in port operations and infrastructure near the canal, U.S. officials worry that Beijing may seek commercial or strategic leverage in the region,” Umud Shokri, senior visiting fellow at George Mason University with expertise in foreign policy, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The Trump administration’s efforts to regain influence over the canal reflect Washington’s broader view of the waterway as a critical national security asset.” The documents center on various cases involving three Hong Kong-based shipping companies—Grace Shipping, Expander Shipping, and Grandest Shipping—all of which have been accused of being subsidiaries of the state-owned Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, a Tehran-based company owned by the Iranian government. IRISL was sanctioned under the first Trump administration, with the State Department describing the company as the “preferred shipping line for Iranian proliferators and procurement agents.” The EU went into more detail than did the Panamanian courts. The EU Council, charged with overseeing security, defense and diplomacy said that for years, IRISL has been “involved in shipping military related cargo,” while the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy “converts container ships owned by IRISL into drone carriers.” Iran has clandestinely operated in the Panama Canal for years, as the Latin American country is considered to be the world’s biggest supplier for “flags of convenience,” which allow shippers to register their vessels under Panamanian colors in exchange for a fee to conceal their port of origin, according to Reuters. Panama took away its flag usage privileges from 136 ships alone over their links to Tehran in 2023. In 2018, the Hong Kong-based companies were looking to sell three separate medium-range tanker ships through an agreement known as a bareboat charter to a Greece-based shipping company. But President Donald Trump announced sanctions on Iran that same year, effectively killing the deal and forcing the Iranian-backed companies to sell the ships outright to avoid penalties. The Greek company went on to use the ships unimpeded for two years after the 2018 sale. However, in 2020, the Hong Kong companies filed a lawsuit in Panamanian court to reclaim the ships from firms under the Greek company’s management that bought the vessels, alleging that the initial selloffs were invalid. The Panamanian court ordered the Greek company to return two of the ships to Grandest Shipping and Expander Shipping, respectively, or pay off the multimillion-dollar valuation of the ships to the plaintiffs, according to the legal documents. The case involving Grace Shipping has yet to be resolved. Though the companies now deny their association with IRISL, they have yet to disclose what third parties they were sold to and the nature of the supposed sales. The only people who have appeared as witnesses in the case for the companies are Iranians related to IRISL, according to court documents. The Hong Kong-based firms are represented by Arias B. & Associates in Panama, court documents show. China’s presence in the Panama Canal has allowed Iran to take its business to the Western Hemisphere right under the nose of the U.S. “China has become unabashed in its unwillingness to comply with U.S. efforts to stop Iranian illicit behavior, and has, in fact, enabled it,” Rebeccah L. Heinrichs, senior fellow and director of the Keystone Defense Initiative at the Hudson Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “China is the one of the most effective enablers of Iran’s ability to evade U.S. sanctions.” The U.S.’ ability to curtail China-based front companies is partly a function of America’s willingness to potentially strain the U.S.-China business relationships, Heinrichs told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “So some of this is just implementing the sanctions, finding the front companies that pop up and not giving China any plausible deniability,” Heinrichs told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “All of this is endorsed by and facilitated by the [Chinese Communist Party].” Iran has long made moves to avoid Western sanctions, especially in its oil trade. President Donald Trump sanctioned Iranian minister of petroleum Mohsen Paknejad Thursday for allowing “the export of tens of billions of dollars worth of Iranian oil and has allocated billions of dollars’ worth of oil to Iran’s armed forces for export,” according to the Treasury Department. The Iranian government operates so-called shadow fleets that export primarily to Beijing. An entire shadow market for Iranian oil has emerged with China and Russia’s help. Beijing and Moscow have both taken steps to obfuscate the origins of the oil, according to the Atlantic Council. “I think we need to be very serious about Iran sanctions,” Matthew Levitt, director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “But being serious about Iran sanctions does not mean just listing more entities, listing more boats. I’m a former senior Treasury official. I’m all in favor of doing that. Can you do that without enforcement? It’s meaningless.” Panama has been more than happy to accommodate China in its expansion of maritime power. China’s Landbridge Group acquired Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. The acquisition was in conjunction with Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project that has already made its way into a myriad of developing nations. The Belt and Road Initiative has been criticized for often giving China undue leverage over the target countries with debt, dubbed “debt-trap diplomacy,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Panama formally joined the Belt and Road Initiative in 2017. Moreover, Panama gave a 25-year no-bid renewal to the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports to operate two ports on either end of the canal, covering both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. However, American investment giant BlackRock agreed to purchase the ports from the China-based firm on March 5 for $22.8 billion. U.S. officials and congressmen, such as Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Republican Utah Sen. John Curtis, have levied criticism at the Panama Canal Authority for allegedly not doing enough to enforce sanctions, especially against China. The Panama Canal Authority has vehemently pushed back against the accusations, saying they are “not a haven for sanctions evasion.” “The United States has found that Iranian vessels are sometimes flagged by Panama in order to avoid sanctions so that they could sell the fuel that they have and then they can take that money and then use it as they wish,” Louis Sola, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission, said during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in January. Cruz also echoed the sentiment during the Commerce Committee hearing, saying the U.S. could not be “idle” while China grows its foothold. “China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction by the U.S. The international community, including China, has conducted normal cooperation with Iran within the framework of international law,” a Chinese Embassy spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “This is reasonable and lawful without harm done to any third party, and deserves to be respected and protected.” “All of this is primarily about control of sea lanes,” Heinrichs told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “So, it’s critically important, and I credit the Trump administration for recognizing that and for understanding it, that you cannot let the Chinese take over the Panama Canal.” The Iranian Foreign Ministry and Arias B. & Associates did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Title: Trump Pick for Panama Envoy: Chinese Influence Goes Beyond the Canal
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2025/03/26/trump-pick-for-panama-envoy-chinese-influence-goes-beyond-the-canal/

Kevin Cabrera, President Donald Trump’s nomination as the next U.S. ambassador to Panama, said Tuesday during his confirmation hearing in Congress that China’s influence in Panama extends beyond the canal’s ports. Cabrera explained to Congress that China exerts influence in Panama’s higher education system through Confucius Institute agreements that China signed with all five local universities. Confucius Institutes are academic organizations entirely controlled by the Chinese regime that spread communist ideology and propaganda to teachers and students at international universities. The first such Confucius Institute in Panama was inaugurated in June 2018 during the administration of former Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela — one year after the Central American nation cut ties with Taiwan and simultaneously embraced the Chinese Communist Party’s “One-China Principle,” which states that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a “province” of China. Additionally, Cabrera detailed that China has inked agreements with Panama’s State Radio and Television System (SERTV), pointing out that the state media system “definitely never criticizes China.” “But again, I think that the Chinese influence is not just in the canal. It’s also in other areas. I know that they have memorandums of understanding with all five public universities in Panama for Confucius centers,” Cabrera said. “And they also have a relationship with the local government-owned TV, SERTV, where they provide information, which many times is put in an uncritical, it definitely never criticizes China, what goes on, the information they pass along.” Cabrera told Congress that, if confirmed as ambassador, he will work alongside President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and members of the House Foreign Relations Committee to continue to diminish Chinese influence in Panama while providing opportunities for American investment in the Central American nation. Additionally, Cabrera expressed his concern on the use of Chinese technology used in Panamanian infrastructure and listed the implementation of Chinese-made security cameras in the city of north-central city of Colón — where the Atlantic Ocean entrance to the Panama Canal is located — and the use of Chinese-made cranes in Colón’s port of Manzanillo, operated by a subsidiary of the Washington-based Carrix marine terminal and rail yard operators company. Cabrella stressed that the use of Chinese cameras and equipment could compromise cybersecurity and access to sensitive information. “We have seen how Chinese state-owned companies can bid significantly lower prices in tenders to ensure that governments buy their technology, Cabrera reportedly said. “This raises questions about who controls the information and whether these infrastructures can be manipulated.” President Trump started an ongoing debate over the Panama Canal in December after he expressed that the United States should take back control of the Canal due to the “exorbitant” transit fees imposed on U.S. ships and because of the growing influence of China in the important trade route. Control of the Panama Canal, which the United States built, was handed over to Panama in 1999 as per the terms of an agreement signed by both nations in 1977 during the administration of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Over the past months, President Mulino, officials from the Panama Canal Authority, and other Panamanian government authorities have repeatedly refuted President Trump’s claims and denied any Chinese influence in the Canal. Mulino has also insisted that his administration will not engage in any talks with the United States pertaining to the control of the Panama Canal. Cabrera stressed to Congress that both President Trump and Secretary Rubio have identified possible violations of Article IV of the 1977 Panama Canal Neutrality Treaty signed by former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Omar Torrijos, which states that the U.S. and Panama agree to maintain a regime of neutrality in the Panama Canal so that it remain “permanently neutral.” Cabrera identified the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings Limited’s sale to BlackRock of its subsidiary that currently operates two ports at the Panama Canal as a positive step in reducing Chinese influence in the country. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday morning that despite China’s “anger” over the transaction, CK Hutchison Holdings Limited’s sale of the two Panama Canal ports to BlackRock is “moving ahead as scheduled.” Christian K.
