BlackRock signals $100T advisor interest in Bitcoin market as metrics point to an incoming institutional demand. Bitcoin [BTC] might be preparing for its next big wave of institutional flows. Financial planners with more than $100 trillion in assets under management might get easier access to BTC exposure in the near term, per BlackRock reports. This has infused new bullish sentiment in the market. Institutional demand for Bitcoin is not novel, but they are accelerating rapidly. As regulatory landscapes shift and spot ETFs become more mainstream, advisors now have a more transparent path to including BTC in diversified portfolios. BlackRock’s announcement follows this trend and implies that the next round of demand will come from wealth managers who had been sidelined in the past. The market is responding in real-time. Since big-ticket institutional investment picked pace, Bitcoin Open Interest has recorded a steady and uninterrupted rise. The trend suggests growing confidence among traders that there is a supply-demand gap brewing. Derivative Open Interest is also likely to mirror the volume of money going into options and futures. Its current consistent rise suggests that big institutions are betting on volatility—typically looking forward to a significant price movement. At present, the direction remains bullish. Source: CryptoQuant Alongside the rising Open Interest, Bitcoin’s Funding Rate has also increased. An increasing Funding Rate indicates that more traders are going long—expecting prices to go up. Such a shift usually precedes bullish breakouts, especially if it comes with institutional news. However, increasing Funding Rates can also introduce short-term volatility. Over-enthusiastic longs can lead to steep corrections, but if institutional flows do materialize, dips can be countered by intense buying. Source: CoinGlass Everyone turns to Bitcoin’s supply side these days. With only 21 million coins and dwindling flow from miners following the halving, increased institutional demand may form the foundation of a supply shock. Unlike retail traders, institutions carry long term goals and like to lock up supply. Once advisors who oversee trillions of dollars begin deploying even small percentages of their portfolios into action, supply from exchanges may disappear in a flash, taking BTC further.

American investors exit Bitcoin ETFs while European retail taps into new opportunities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have entered a third consecutive day of outflows, shedding more than $1 billion. This trend reflects a shift in institutional sentiment as Bitcoin’s price continues to hover around the $105,000 mark without a clear breakout. Data from SoSoValue shows that the 12 US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced $268 million in net outflows on June 2 alone. This follows larger exits on May 29 and 30, when the funds collectively lost more than $1 billion. Industry analysts suggest that these outflows are tied to the broader market cooling. Bitcoin’s price has traded in a tight band over the past week, prompting large investors to reduce risk or shift capital to other asset classes. This behavior is common during periods of price consolidation, where expectations of near-term gains are muted. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest Bitcoin ETF in the US, has not been immune to the trend. However, that has not significantly impacted its position among the country’s top 25 largest ETFs. IBIT currently manages over $72 billion in assets. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted IBIT’s rapid rise in a recent analysis. He noted that at just 1.4 years old, IBIT is the youngest ETF in the top 25, which is significantly younger than any of its peers. Despite Bitcoin’s recent price performance, institutional investors in other jurisdictions remain interested in the flagship digital asset. On June 3, Jacobi Asset Management expanded access to its Bitcoin ETF by removing long-standing investment restrictions. The change allows retail investors in Europe to directly invest in the product, following a decision by Guernsey’s regulator to scrap the professional-only classification and minimum capital requirements. Jacobi CEO Peter Lane welcomed the change, saying: “Our fund was designed from day one with a regulated, institutional-grade structure that investors could trust and were familiar with. Now, with greater regulatory alignment and growing public interest, we’re delighted to expand access to all investors across eligible jurisdictions.” He also praised Guernsey’s proactive approach and expressed optimism about the potential to roll out more regulated crypto investment vehicles soon.

Title: Meta Won’t Add Bitcoin To Balance Sheet As Shareholders Strongly Reject Treasury Proposal
URL: https://zycrypto.com/meta-wont-add-bitcoin-to-balance-sheet-as-shareholders-strongly-reject-treasury-proposal/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T13:50:29Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have voted against a proposal to consider adding Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet. According to a May 28 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, an eye-popping 4.9 billion votes were cast in opposition while 3.92 million — a mere 0.08% of the total — supported the proposal. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls 61% of the company’s voting power, an April regulatory statement reveals, which could mean that he voted down the idea. The proposal, submitted in January by Bitcoin champion Ethan Peck, representing the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), asked Meta to convert a portion of its $72 billion in excess cash and cash equivalents into the apex crypto to better preserve shareholder value. The measure touted Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and strong past performance compared to bonds, as a more reliable long-term store of value. Peck claimed that the tech giant should treat the largest crypto as a strategic reserve asset, similar to a corporate war chest designed to endure monetary policy uncertainty. He also pointed out that Meta’s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock, advised that a 2% Bitcoin allocation is reasonable. While Meta doesn’t want to hold crypto on its balance sheet, the firm has previously dipped its toes into blockchain. In June 2019, it unveiled Libra, a global stablecoin project backed by a basket of fiat currencies. That project collapsed in 2022 after unwelcome regulatory scrutiny and internal wrangles, rebranding briefly as Diem before shutting down and selling assets to crypto bank Silvergate. Peck also submitted similar Bitcoin treasury proposals to Microsoft and Amazon on behalf of the conservative think tank NCPPR. Microsoft shareholders voted against the plan in December, while Amazon shareholders are awaiting a vote on whether to put at least 5% of the company’s assets into Bitcoin. Though Bitcoin treasury proposals were rejected by Meta and Microsoft, global publicly listed companies continue accumulating the flagship crypto. Data tracked by Bitcoin Treasuries shows that over 115 public companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, with one of the newest entrants being GameStop. Michael Saylor’s Strategy leads all publicly traded firms with 580,955 BTC, worth over $60 billion, while eight others, including Marathon Digital Holdings and Elon Musk’s Tesla, each hold roughly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin.

Title: Russia’s Banking Behemoth Bets On Bitcoin With New Bond Offering

Time Published: 2025-06-03T13:00:51Z

Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, has started offering a new bond product tied to Bitcoin’s price. Based on reports, only qualified investors can buy these bonds right now, and trading happens over the counter. The bank says it will soon list them on the Moscow Exchange to make them easier to buy and sell. These bonds pay out if Bitcoin rises in value, and they also give investors a bonus if the US dollar strengthens against the ruble. Investors deal in rubles, so there’s no need to own a crypto wallet or use foreign platforms. According to the bank’s press release, the bonds are for a limited group of investors at first. They plan to make them available on the Moscow Exchange soon. This move means more transparency and the chance for more people to get involved. If Bitcoin goes up, bondholders benefit. If the dollar goes up against the ruble, bondholders get a bit more too. It’s a double play on two markets, crypto and currency. Based on reports, Russia still bans cryptocurrencies for everyday payments, but they’re allowed for cross-border deals. In early June, the Central Bank of Russia gave financial firms the green light to sell crypto-related investments to qualified investors. That change paved the way for Sberbank’s new bonds. No one needs to leave Russia’s financial system to invest in Bitcoin this way, keeping it all above board and legal. Sberbank got a digital asset license from the Central Bank in 2022. Since then, they’ve tokenized assets like gold and real estate. They opened their platform to retail investors in 2023 and handled billions of rubles in transactions. The bank even launched a blockchain network that works with Ethereum. That network started limited testing in 2022 and opened to the public in early 2023. Now, they’re adding Bitcoin futures on June 4 through their SberInvestments platform. This comes just as the Moscow Exchange rolls out its own crypto-based trading tools. Around the world, big banks are moving into crypto. In the US, names like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup are working on a stablecoin project to speed up cross-border payments. In Hong Kong, HSBC launched a crypto settlement product. BNY Mellon is putting money into blockchain to hold digital assets. In March, BlackRock created a tokenized fund on Ethereum and then added one on Solana. Sberbank’s bond ties into this trend, showing that major banks still see value in blending traditional finance with crypto tools.

Title: BlackRock Analyst Warns of Overexposure to US Markets, Says One Country On Right Side of Incoming ‘Tectonic Shifts’

The world’s largest asset manager says investors may want to think twice before betting the farm on US markets. In an interview with CNBC TV-18, Ben Powell, chief of Middle East & APAC at BlackRock Investment Institute, says he’s looking at other regions to invest in as uncertainty builds in the US due to a weakening dollar and trade tensions. Says Powell, “Having all your eggs in one basket, even a beautiful basket like the US, feels a bit riskier.” The analyst says BlackRock is looking at emerging markets like India as potential candidates to outperform the US, noting strong labor force growth, technology gains, heightened geopolitical relevance and favorable demographic trends. “We like India, yes. We think India is the right side of a lot of these huge tectonic shifts that we’re seeing. So India, in terms of the geopolitics… Clearly, India is of course a kind of continent-sized country and economy, and everyone wants to be friends with India. It’s neck and neck at the moment but potentially India’s GDP will be overtaking Japan’s relatively soon in the next few quarters… And I still think, if I can say so, what some of the foreigners still fail to understand is the amazing technological productivity advances we’ve seen in India over the last years.” However, Powell also concedes that BlackRock is still overweight US equities and doesn’t discount the possibility that the American stock market can rip higher from here, noting that artificial intelligence (AI) can be the “megaforce” that can act as a tailwind that offsets other concerns in the market.

Title: Elon Musk’s Neuralink Raises $650M in Series E Funding

Our goal is to help families make informed decisions to keep their children safe online. Read more. Key Takeaways Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain-computer interface startup, has successfully closed its Series E funding round, securing an impressive $650 million. The round attracted a powerhouse roster of investors, including ARK Invest, DFJ Growth, Founders Fund, G42, Human Capital, Lightspeed, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Thrive Capital, Valor Equity Partners, and Vy Capital. The figure represents a significant jump from its Series D funding round in August 2023, which raised $280M and an additional $43M coming in November of the same year. In a company blog post, they announced that it has made ‘significant progress’ in building brain interfaces that help restore independence in paralyzed humans. It listed the five individuals now using Neuralink to control devices, the launch of its global clinical trials, the addition of use cases beyond its original intent, and expanding the number of neurons and brain regions its device interacts with among its achievements since 2023. The company has three human patients with ‘Link’, its brain implant. It allows these paralyzed patients to operate phones and computers using their thoughts, which Neuralink calls ‘Telepathy’. The first two patients, Noland Arbaugh and Alex, are paralyzed by spinal cord injuries. But with Neuralink’s help, they have been able to control computers, with Arbaugh using the implant to control the mouse and keyboard, and Alex being able to play Counter-Strike. Another Neuralink patient is Brad Smith, who has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Having the implant allowed him to ‘speak’ by controlling the mouse and keyboard to type on a computer screen or choose a reply. The message is then output as audio of his voice cloned by AI from samples before he lost his ability to speak due to ALS. As volunteers who participated in the company’s PRIME Study, the three have used Link for 670 days and employed Telepathy to communicate for over 4.9K hours. Founded in 2016 by Musk and a team of scientists and engineers, Neuralink went mainstream the following year after a report from The Wall Street Journal. It was still unclear what products the company might create back then, but there had already been speculations about developing brain implants to treat brain disorders. By 2019, the company raised $158M, with $100M coming from Musk. During this time, Neuralink revealed that it was developing a device similar to a sewing machine that could implant thin threads into the brain. Plans to conduct human trials were scheduled in 2020, but they only received FDA approval in 2023. Arbaugh became the first human to receive the Link implant the following year. However, Neuralink hasn’t been without controversy. A 2022 report by Fortune revealed the departure of most of its founding team, citing internal tensions and concerns over erratic leadership. The article also raised red flags about the company potentially overstating its technological capabilities. In addition, the company faced a probe from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022 over the higher-than-normal deaths in its animal tests. While Neuralink is perhaps the most familiar name in the world of brain implants, other companies also share the same goal as Musk’s. For one, there’s Peter Thiel-backed Blackrock Neurotech, which has already conducted trials on over 30 individuals worldwide. Another notable player is Precision Neuroscience, co-founded in 2021 by Benjamin Rappaport, also a Neuralink co-founder. The company recently secured FDA approval to trial its brain-computer interface, allowing temporary implantation in patients for up to 30 days. Overall, this healthy competition among well-funded companies could bode well for paralyzed patients or those suffering from brain disorders. That said, these implants’ viability and widespread use may still be decades away, after which we may have to contend with their potential ethical issues.

Title: Is Altcoin Season Over Or It Never Started? Here’s What Historical Data Says
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/is-altcoin-season-over-data/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T10:00:39Z
Full Content:
Following the explosive 2021 Bitcoin and crypto bull run, the expectations of an “altcoin season” have become even more pronounced. This term refers to a period where the prices of altcoins rise rapidly and outperform the Bitcoin price by a large margin. Usually, this happens after the Bitcoin price has put in a new all-time high, and money is rotated into altcoins. However, this has not been the case this cycle. So what happened to altcoin season? Crypto analyst and expert Michaël van de Poppe took to the X (formerly Twitter) platform to share with his over 790,000 followers that the altcoin season has yet to begin. This goes against the widespread belief that the altcoin season has already come and gone, and is officially over. According to van de Poppe, the altcoin market is actually still in a bear market, but it is about to end. The analyst’s prediction comes as the Bitcoin price remains above six figures, and yet the altcoin market continues to struggle close to its lows. Despite the abysmal market movement and the massive decline in positive sentiment, the crypto analyst still believes that the best is yet to come. He predicts that the crypto bull market is about to begin, and this would be bigger than ever because the bear market has gone on for so long. Furthermore, he points out that this cycle is different than previous cycles and the next 1-3 years will be different as well. Thus, he predicts many investors will miss it for being impatient. Using the chart above, which was created by crypto analyst TechDev, van de Poppe shows that the altcoin market is at a pivotal point. It shows a period where the Bitcoin price is rising and altcoins have remained flat. However, this has usually turned out to be the calm before the storm, and altcoin season tends to follow. If the analyst is right, then the altcoin season never started, and is still in the future. As Michaël van de Poppe mentioned, this cycle has been quite different from the previous one, and there have been a few reasons for this. The first is the advent of large buys from institutions such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy and heavy hitters like BlackRock buying up Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The natural consequence of this is that money is now only staying in Bitcoin rather than rotating out at the top into altcoins like last cycle. Also, a big difference between the current cycle and the 2020-2021 cycle is the availability of free cash. Following the COVID-19 lockdown of 2020, governments around the world disbursed billions of dollars to citizens to help them weather the storm, and this ‘free cash’ had inadvertently found its way into the market, triggering a massive altcoin season. Other factors that have been pointed out to have contributed to this are the extreme P2P that emerged with the advent of instant meme coin creations. Thousands of new coins flood the market daily, and this has left liquidity spread thin. Also, broader macroeconomic factors such as Donald Trump’s tariff wars have contributed greatly to keeping market performance muted, and the weaker altcoins have suffered more for it.

Title: Henry Holterman: The Dutch midas strikes €1 billion gold vein in Greece (pics)

Full Content:
Henry Holterman is a numbers man.In this invisible but foundational realm, there is no room for misinterpretations or emotion. Based purely on numbers, the Dutch investor ranks among the most successful dealmakers in Greece over recent decades. From the recent sale of his 9.75% stake in Alpha Bank to profitable deals in GEK TERNA and Ellaktor, and the capital gains—both visible and hidden—from his investments in Greece, it’s estimated that he has earned close to €1 billion to date. An impressive figure, but fully justified.Those who know him describe a highly disciplined investor with clear targets and a unique ability to spot undervalued assets, investing without loans or leverage. In every investment move he made in Greece, those who engaged with him confirm he is laser-focused on results, unaffected by emotion or ego—even during the toughest business clashes. It’s just business, with the goal of maximizing profit. If others win along the way, great—but that’s not the goal. Obstacles are seen as opportunities to revise strategy and seek alternative paths to a successful exit—no matter how long it takes. Ellaktor and GEK TERNAHis investment principles are reflected in his every move. In early 2018, amid the shareholder civil war in Ellaktor, Holterman flew to Athens in his private jet, invited by the Kallitsantsis brothers seeking backing for their upcoming proxy battle to oust the existing board of the historic construction group. Though the discussions led nowhere—just like the attempt to acquire Forthnet alongside Odyssey-Athena—a new opportunity had already arisen, leading to a 10%, then 30% stake in GEK TERNA. He eventually exited the group of Mr. George Peristeris with an estimated €200 million in returns. Armed with fresh capital, he entered Ellaktor and, after more than two years of fierce rivalry—first with the Kallitsantsis side, then with the Kaymenakis–Bakou–Exarchos trio—he prevailed, having also forged a strong alliance with the Vardinogiannis group. In Alpha BankNext came the divestment of Ellaktor’s assets, executed with mathematical precision. In 2021, while Greece’s investment-grade rating was still a distant dream, he invested in Alpha Bank. While analysts speculated he might become a banker and increase his stake in the bank, he correctly read the signals and chose to sell—earning over €340 million. He still holds a 3.95% stake in Optima Bank, purchased during its public offering for €21 million, now valued at €60 million. A Dutch… DreamHolterman could be seen as the epitome of the “Dutch dream”—a twist on the more familiar “American dream.” Yet, his story is cinematic in nature. Born in 1955, he began as a certified auditor. Legend has it that he was assigned to audit VolkerWessels, one of the Netherlands’ oldest and largest construction groups, whose investment arm is Reggeborgh. During this time, he met and married Herita, one of two daughters of owner Dick Wessels. Wessels himself came from humble beginnings, working in his father Arend’s carpentry business founded in 1933. In 1968, at 22, he took over the company and turned it into one of Europe’s major construction groups. By 2017, when Wessels passed away, he was the third richest Dutchman, with an estimated fortune of €4 billion. Holterman took over the family business empire that year. Reggeborgh’s PowerFounded in 1990 to manage the Wessels family’s investments, Reggeborgh today holds over 20 companies spanning infrastructure, real estate, energy, medical research, and tech across Europe and the U.S. Among its assets: Koninklijke VolkerWessels, DW Property, Prescan, Tesorion, and EVI. The family’s net worth is estimated at €15–20 billion. The Dutch investment fund also has significant equity holdings, most notably a 3.04% stake in ABN Amro, making it the bank’s fifth-largest shareholder behind the Dutch government, MFS Investment Management, Norway’s NBIM, and BlackRock. It previously sold its 17.6% stake in Van Lanschot Kempen to ING. The World Online AffairThose who know Holterman call him a “player”—a label that can mean many things in Greek, but in his case, it’s quite literal: he has a passion for stock market investments. One such investment tested him, but he emerged stronger and richer. Reggeborgh was among the early investors in tech firm World Online, holding a significant stake at its IPO in 2000. But the stock crashed post-IPO, causing massive investor losses. Reggeborgh escaped unharmed, having sold its shares beforehand. The saga had legal implications. The company’s founder, Nina Brink (also known as Nina Storms), claimed €182 million from Reggeborgh, alleging it owed her per a private agreement. The dispute lasted nearly two decades and was settled out of court. Holterman always maintained that no illegal acts occurred and blamed investor over-expectations for the fallout. Under Holterman, the Wessels family office made other lucrative moves—including in fiber-optic firms Reggefiber and Eurofiber, and the investment bank NIBC—despite regulatory scrutiny. It All Began in CorfuAround this time, Greece entered Holterman’s life—more specifically, Corfu. Neither he nor anyone else could have predicted that Greece would yield €1 billion in capital gains. Roughly 25 years ago, he and his wife Herita bought a vacation home in Kassiopi, a stunning part of northern Corfu. The area is home to luxury villas owned by the Rothschilds, Jörg Rockenhäuser (Permira), Rob Lucas (CVC Capital), and other ultra-wealthy investors. It was during this time he met Nikos Dendias, then a well-known lawyer in Corfu—long before entering politics. Dendias’ firm has handled many of Holterman’s affairs in Greece, where he has been remarkably active as an investor. Corfu: His Island LoveHolterman’s bond with Corfu only grew stronger. He bought a dream villa in Kommeno, and nearly every summer enjoys the island’s beauty and refined cuisine. From his villa, he overlooks Gouvia Bay, often crossed by the yacht “Guilty” belonging to the Ioannou family. Holterman himself once owned the 47-meter yacht “Lars”, built by Italy’s Sanlorenzo shipyard. He later put it up for sale for €24 million, eventually selling it for an undisclosed amount. Unlike the sea, it seems land is Holterman’s true love. His properties in Corfu and Athens mirror his investment philosophy: prime real estate with hidden value waiting to be unlocked. A striking example is the historic Corfu Palace Hotel, which he reportedly acquired for €30 million from the Fokas family. Opened in 1962, the hotel had seen both glory and decline, in need of major renovations that were always partial and never complete. Now under Holterman’s ownership, it’s undergoing a full €20 million renovation, aiming to reopen in 2026 as a key player in Corfu’s luxury hospitality scene. More Real Estate MovesTwo years ago, he also bought a neoclassical building two blocks from Corfu Palace with views of Garitsa Bay, 1,000 square meters in total, for over €2 million. Five years ago, he reportedly acquired the famous “Red House” (Antico Rosso) for €8 million. This stunning 17th-century mansion, built on the ruins of a 13th-century monastery, once belonged to the Kourkoumelis-Rodostamos family—one of Corfu’s oldest and linked by marriage to the Kapodistrias lineage. Locals say Holterman has truly fallen for Corfu. He has made donations to the island’s hospital, coast guard, police, supported the “Melissa” disability center, EKAV, and other nonprofits, sports clubs, and federations—often via Ellaktor. In 2022, Holterman, his wife, and son were honorarily granted Greek citizenship. What’s Next?Corfu isn’t his only turf. Holterman has also built a significant real estate portfolio in Athens. Real estate insiders say REDS paid €80 million to acquire Athens Properties from Holding Greece B.V., managed by the Holterman family. The Hestia Luxury Apartments brand, part of Athens Properties B.V., manages 10 fully renovated buildings in prime locations. Other properties across Greece remain under his ownership—though not all are publicly known. Explore related questions

Title: I’m Very Glad That New York Has Ranked-Choice Voting

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access I can vote for two candidates—Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander—who’ve made climate a cornerstone of their campaigns, with real hopes that one or the other will prevail. I was lucky enough as a young reporter to find myself covering elections in the only city in America that chose its leaders via ranked-choice voting (RCV). This was… a long time ago, and so it all happened on paper: Cambridge voters listed city councilor candidates, sometimes twenty or more, in order of preference, and then, over the course of a week, teams of older ladies physically distributed the ballots around an elementary school gymnasium. As candidate X with the lowest number of first place votes was disqualified, they would carry his ballots to the piles of the candidate listed second, and so on until only the winner remained. All of this happens by computer now, in a burp. But it remains a splendid system. Usually people defend it on the correct grounds that you can vote for a third-party candidate without losing your vote—should they be eliminated, your ballot will go to your next-favorite choice. But there’s also the benefit that two good but similar candidates—the Bernie/Warren problem—don’t split the progressive vote. I’ve long ago left New York City for the northern mountains, but I continue to follow its politics, in large part because they’re so important to the world. The city’s vast public pension fund, for instance, has been used in recent years to help advance the fight against climate change, more skillfully than most such instruments, and I’d like to see that continue. And New York’s sheer vastness and dynamism means it’s a great place to help lead the fight for change: the current effort, for instance, to refurbish large buildings to make them more efficient is showing the rest of the country what can be done. So I’m very glad that New York has RCV, which means you can vote for two candidates who’ve made climate a cornerstone of their campaigns, with real hopes that one or the other will prevail. Zohran Mamdani, the young progressive who seems to be consolidating left votes, led the fight against a fracked gas power plant in his home turf of Astoria. He didn’t just say the right words—he mobilized an impressive fight to get it done. Brad Lander, meanwhile, the city’s current comptroller, did something of inordinate value last month, standing up to Blackrock, which is essentially the same thing as standing up to capitalism. The financial giant needed to do some very specific things to start addressing the climate crisis, he said, or they would find themselves without New York’s hundreds of billions of dollars—this is at last the blue state equivalent of what red state treasurers have spent the last few years doing, which is intimidating the world’s financial powers. (Here’s the Financial Times >attesting to the global importance of his courage). What I’m saying is, if your interest is the planet, both candidates have things to recommend them. Probably I’d vote Lander 1 and Mamdani 2, because I like kicking Big Money in the nuts more than anything else; maybe, when I walked into the booth, I’d switch those two on the grounds that younger is better. Maybe I’d argue myself out of that on the (somewhat sentimental) grounds that it’s hard to imagine New York without at least one representative of the liberal Jewish political heritage that’s done so much for us all, or on the slightly solider reasoning that New York’s vast bureaucracy might be less intimidating to someone who’s spent more time in it. The point is, New Yorkers have a less excruciating choice than most of us in these situations. They don’t have to pretend they don’t have two excellent candidates (and actually several others). But remember—you don’t have to rank any more candidates than you want to. You also get the pleasure of leaving Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo off your ballot, a satisfying (and electorally useful) dis that too few American voters are privileged to enjoy. The slow spread of RCV is one of the life rings we can toss to try to rescue our drowning national politics. For now, enjoy it, you lucky New Yorkers!

East Asia Zheng Yanxiong, director of China's Hong Kong Liaison Office, speaks during the National Security Education Day opening ceremony in Hong Kong, China on Apr 15, 2024. (File photo: REUTERS/Lam Yik) HONG KONG: Hong Kong's leader, John Lee, said on Tuesday (Jun 3) that China's recent removal of its top representative in the city, known for his hardline policies on national security, had been a "normal" personnel change. In a surprise development, China announced late on Friday that Zheng Yanxiong, the director of China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong - Beijing's main representative office in the city with powerful oversight over local affairs - had been "removed" from his post. He was replaced by Zhou Ji, a senior official with the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on the State Council. Zheng, who played a key role in the crackdown on Hong Kong's democratic movement in recent years, was also stripped of his role as China's national security adviser on a committee overseeing national security in Hong Kong.

According to a person with knowledge of the matter, Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison's proposed sale of its global port network to a consortium initially led by US firm Blackrock had caught senior Chinese leaders "by surprise" as they had not been informed beforehand and Zheng was partly blamed for that. The person, who has spoken with the liaison office, declined to be identified as the discussions were confidential. The Liaison Office gave no immediate response to faxed questions from Reuters. Zheng had served in the post since January 2023 and while the position has no fixed term, his tenure was shorter than predecessors including Luo Huining and Zhang Xiaoming. "The change of the Liaison office director is I believe, as with all changes of officials, very normal," Lee told reporters during a weekly briefing, without being drawn on reasons for the reshuffle. "Director Zheng has spent around 5 years (in Hong Kong). Hong Kong was going through a transition period of chaos to order," Lee said, referring to the months-long pro-democracy protests that erupted across Hong Kong in 2019 while adding that he looked forward to working with Zhou.

CK Hutchison's ports deal has been criticised in Chinese state media as "betraying" China's interests and bowing to US political pressure. The conglomerate, controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing, agreed in March to sell the majority of its US$22.8 billion global ports business, including assets along the strategically significant Panama Canal, to the consortium. The consortium is now being led by another member – Terminal Investment Limited, which is majority-owned by Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte's family-run MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company. The deal is still being negotiated. Asked whether Zheng's removal reflected a pivot by Beijing towards economic development from national security, Lee said Hong Kong still needed to pursue both. "Hong Kong faces a stage where development and safety must be addressed at the same time because any development must have a safe environment." China promulgated a powerful national security law in 2020, arresting scores of opposition democrats and activists, shuttering liberal media outlets and civil society groups and punishing free speech with sedition – moves that have drawn international criticism.

Title: Executive Incentives Under Common Ownership
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/06/03/executive-incentives-under-common-ownership/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T04:05:52Z
Full Content:
In recent years, legal scholars and economists have debated whether the rise of “common ownership” by large institutional investors dampens competition. The concern is that when asset managers such as the Big Three – BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street – hold stakes in multiple competing companies, they might encourage those firms to compete less aggressively with one another or even collude. One way asset managers might soften competition is through executive compensation: Common owners could restructure executive pay packages at the companies they own to blunt incentives for cut‑throat competition. Common owners might discourage relative performance evaluation (RPE), a popular pay practice that rewards executives for outperforming peers. A typical RPE award pays top managers more, whether in cash or shares, when their firm outperforms rivals on metrics such as return on equity or total shareholder return. RPE therefore aligns pay with competitive success and motivates managers to vie fiercely against competitors. Eliminating or weakening RPE could, in principle, enable tacit collusion and allow commonly owned firms to earn higher profits than they would in a fully competitive market. In a recent paper, I test whether common owners reduce RPE at their portfolio firms and find clear evidence to the contrary. In fact, the Big Three exhibit strong preferences for RPE. I find evidence of this on three levels. First, more common ownership, measured by how many industry peers share institutional owners, does not lead to reduced RPE use. Instead, firms with greater ownership stakes held directly by the Big Three are significantly more likely to adopt RPE. This positive effect persists even when the Big Three own stakes in multiple competing firms, directly contradicting the anti-competitive narrative. Furthermore, the prevalence of RPE increased substantially during my study’s sample period, from under one-third of firms using RPE in 2010 to nearly two-thirds by 2021, precisely as the Big Three’s market influence was growing. Second, I analyze shareholder voting behavior on executive pay (“say-on-pay”) proposals. If common owners sought to reduce competition through executive incentives, they would likely voice support for compensation packages without RPE. Instead, my findings indicate that firms receive greater shareholder support, especially from the Big Three, when their pay packages include explicit RPE measures. Third, I explore whether common ownership affects firms’ choice of performance benchmarks, another subtle avenue to reduce competitive pressures. The results show the opposite: Firms with significant Big Three ownership tend to choose closely competing companies as performance benchmarks, not avoiding but rather enhancing competitive pressure. Combining these findings, the paper’s core message is that common ownership has not led to weaker executive incentives for competition. Across multiple dimensions, including whether a firm adopts RPE, how shareholders vote on pay, and how peer groups are constructed, there is no support for the idea that common owners encourage collusion through CEO pay design. If anything, the influence of the largest common owners (the Big Three) is associated with more performance-based pay and thus potentially more competition among portfolio companies, not less. Why do the Big Three support RPE in executive compensation? One explanation is that, in their stewardship roles, they generally advocate for robust pay-for-performance systems because these incentives align executives’ interests closely with long-term value creation. By linking executive compensation to relative performance, the Big Three can effectively hold executives accountable, ensuring firms strive for superior operational and financial results. Another plausible explanation is reputational: Given heightened regulatory and public scrutiny of their market power and influence, the Big Three may adopt a “blue sky” approach, endorsing transparent, competitive compensation structures like RPE to avoid any perception of collusion or conflicts of interest. By publicly supporting rigorous performance evaluation, these asset managers signal their commitment to fair competition and governance best practices. From a policy perspective, these findings caution against heavy-handed regulatory interventions targeting common ownership, such as mandated divestitures or stringent antitrust constraints. Regulatory actions undertaken without clear evidence of anti-competitive harm could inadvertently disrupt beneficial governance practices, including effective executive incentive structures like RPE. Worse yet, such interventions might ultimately harm the millions of investors who rely on institutional asset managers for financial goals like retirement. Instead, policy should focus on enhancing transparency and accountability among large institutional investors, avoiding blanket restrictions that could unintentionally undermine their positive societal contributions. My paper also makes an important technical contribution: Researchers should not treat institutional investors as a monolith, especially when studying common ownership. Regressing an RPE dummy on aggregate Direct Ownership and aggregate Common Ownership yields positive and statistically significant coefficients on the latter, but this is due to omitted variable bias. Separating these measures into four distinct categories, Big Three Direct Ownership, Big Three Common Ownership, Other Direct Ownership, and Other Common Ownership, reveals the true relationships. Regressing RPE on these four measures produces positive and statistically significant coefficients on Big Three Direct Ownership and small, statistically insignificant coefficients on the remaining three. Thus, researchers must consider the composition of institutional investors to avoid misattributing the effects of large asset managers such as the Big Three to common ownership. My study demonstrates that fears regarding common ownership’s anti-competitive effects are likely overstated. Instead, large institutional investors, particularly the Big Three, play a constructive role in corporate governance by advocating for stronger performance-based executive pay structures that enhance rather than diminish competition. This post comes to us from Professor Thomas Schneider at the University of Oklahoma, Price College of Business. It is based on his recent paper, “Executive Incentives Under Common Ownership,” forthcoming in the Journal of Corporate Finance, special issue on Statistically Non-significant Results in Financial Economics, and available here.

Title: Circle Going Public On June 4: What Future For The CRCL?

ByMarie Poteriaieva ByMarie Poteriaieva, Contributor. Representation of cryptocurrency and Circle logo displayed on a screen in the background are seen in ... More this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on June 10, 2022. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) One of the most anticipated events in crypto business this year is set for Wednesday. Circle, the company behind USDC—the world’s second-largest stablecoin—is going public on the New York Stock Exchange. It will offer 32 million Class A shares at a range of $27-28 under the ticker CRCL, aiming for a $7.2 billion valuation. Circle may seem like an easy bet: issue stablecoins, invest the reserves in Treasuries, and earn risk-free yield while users essentially lend their dollars interest-free. But behind this seemingly simple model lies a more complex and vulnerable business. The future of interest rates remains uncertain, margins are split, and partnerships are costly. In a winner-takes-most market, Circle must outpace the impact of potentially falling rates by capturing a larger share of the stablecoin market—or simply by growing with it. Additionally, the firm’s long-term success may also depend on its ability to diversify and build synergy across its products. Stablecoins have quietly become the backbone of crypto markets—and are increasingly relevant for traditional finance. In 2024, stablecoin transaction volume reached $27.6 trillion, overtaking the combined volume of Visa and Mastercard by almost 8%. The total stablecoin market cap now stands at $248 billion. Circle’s USDC holds a 25% share—second only to Tether’s USDT at 61%—and accounts for $60 billion of the total. Circle’s EURC leads among euro-backed stablecoins with a $224 million market cap. USD-pegged stablecoin supply. Source: DefiLlama Where Circle stands out is in regulatory compliance. In the U.S., USDC has positioned itself as a compliant bridge between the crypto ecosystem and traditional finance. In the EU, the implementation of MiCA—and the resulting delisting of non-compliant stablecoins like USDT from major regulated exchanges—has paved the way for USDC to become the region’s leading stablecoin. Citi’s recent report estimates that the stablecoin market could reach a size of $1.6 trillion by 2030 in its base case. Circle, with its compliance-first approach, is well positioned to benefit. Circle’s main revenue stream — 99% of it — comes from investing stablecoin reserves, primarily in short-term U.S. Treasuries. In 2024, this model proved highly lucrative, generating roughly $1.6 billion in interest income. However, that reliance also exposes a risk of over-dependence on interest rates. As Todd H. Baker, a senior fellow at Columbia University, wrote in the Financial Times, Another concern is distribution cost. Of Circle’s $1.6 billion revenue, over $1 billion went to “distribution, transaction, and other costs,” according to the company’s S-1 filing. The bulk of that went to Coinbase—Circle’s former USDC co-manager and now a key partner. Circle consolidated statements of operations, Circle S-1 filing. Source: SEC After dissolving the Centre Consortium in 2023, Circle took full control of USDC in exchange for a new revenue-sharing agreement. Under this deal, Coinbase receives 50% of the residual yield from USDC reserves and 100% of the interest generated by USDC balances held on its platform. In return, Coinbase pledged to “support USDC” and “help drive long-term success of the stablecoin ecosystem.” As per Coinbase’s 2024 report, the agreement runs for an initial term of three years. After that, Coinbase and Circle will “discuss in good faith whether any modifications to the Circle Agreement are warranted.” If no new terms are agreed upon, the deal automatically renews for another three years—unless either side fails to meet its obligations. With most of its revenue linked to interest rates and a significant share going to Coinbase, Circle’s long-term prospects could increasingly depend on its ability to diversify. And the diversification effort seems to be underway. Beyond USDC and EURC stablecoins, Circle offers: While revenues from CPN and USYC weren’t included in the S-1 (both too recent), they could effectively diversify Circle’s revenue streams. The CPN in particular could evolve into a blockchain-native alternative to SWIFT—one that’s programmable, compliance-aware, and built for 24/7 financial infrastructure. It’s a compelling bet in a payments market estimated at around $2 trillion annually, as per BCG. USYC, meanwhile, enters the booming market of yield-bearing stablecoins and tokenized treasuries. Assets in such products surged 490% in 2024—from $1.4 billion to $8.25 billion—and now approach $10 billion, according to Stablewatch. In the segment led by BlackRock-backed Ethena’s sUSDe and Sky’s (formerly MakerDAO) sUSDS and sDAI, USYC is still a minor player, holding 4% of the market. Yield-bearing stablecoins (market cap over $40M). Source: Stablewatch Investors appear to think so. According to Bloomberg, Circle’s IPO was already significantly oversubscribed by May 28. Today, the company responded by increasing its valuation target from previously announced $5.65 billion to $7.2 billion. The investors might be onto something. Stablecoins are becoming the de facto digital dollars—especially in a U.S. environment increasingly hostile to CBDCs. Their addressable market spans global remittances, institutional payments, and DeFi integrations. The infrastructure and regulatory positioning that Circle has built could give it a head start, even as traditional giants like JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi intend to conceive their own stablecoin. As Benjamin Billarant, founder of Balthazar Capital—an asset management firm with strong exposure to crypto-related equities—commented, Indeed, the bipartisan GENIUS Act—America’s most comprehensive stablecoin bill yet—passed the Senate on May 21 and now heads to the House. Following the vote, President Trump's Crypto Czar David Sacks said that the GENIUS Act will "pass with significant bipartisan support." The timing couldn’t be better for Circle’s IPO indeed. All in all, Circle isn’t just a bet on interest rates—it’s a bet on the future of regulated crypto finance. With stablecoin adoption growing and a compliance-first model, Circle could become a key pillar of tomorrow’s payment system. For $CRCL holders, the challenge will be navigating the gradual shift from "easy" rate-driven gains to a more demanding reliance on product-driven revenue. Whether Circle can evolve in time is the question the IPO asks—and the market will soon answer.

Tuesday, 03 Jun 2025 NEW YORK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Leading U.S. investment company BlackRock Inc. is ramping up plans to offer more of its private-market products to individuals outside the United States as the Wall Street giant increasingly tries to muscle in on one of the hottest areas in global finance, reported Bloomberg News on Monday. "The world's largest asset manager is targeting a hiring drive and tie-ups with digital investment platforms in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region to boost individual investors' access to its private-markets products," BlackRock executive Fabio Osta was quoted as saying. "We'll continue expanding," said Osta, head of BlackRock's alternative-specialists team for its EMEA wealth unit, declining to specify recruiting targets. "We want more people in private markets." "BlackRock, a pioneer in providing low-cost stock and bond funds, is betting it can conquer a more opaque and exclusive part of finance by homing in on private markets, where longtime leveraged-buyout titans such as Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. traditionally dominate," the report noted.

Title: Circle boosts IPO amid strong investor interest, eyes $7.2B valuation

Circle eyes $896 million from updated IPO as institutional giants like BlackRock join the fray. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has revised its IPO filing to reflect stronger-than-expected investor demand, according to a June 2 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The updated filing shows Circle now plans to issue 32 million Class A shares, up from the previously announced 24 million. It also raised its proposed price range to between $27 and $28 per share, compared to the initial $24 to $26 range. If the final pricing lands at the top end, Circle could raise up to $896 million, which is roughly 44% more than the original estimate of $624 million. This adjustment would also push the company’s valuation to approximately $7.2 billion on a fully diluted basis, up from the earlier $6 billion target. The offering marks a key milestone for the company as it looks to strengthen its standing in the digital finance landscape. USDC, Circle’s flagship stablecoin, is the second-largest dollar-pegged token globally, with a market cap exceeding $61 billion. Circle’s decision to expand the IPO comes amid rising institutional interest in stablecoins and growing regulatory clarity. Market analysts say the stablecoin sector, long considered a niche industry, is entering a new phase of mainstream relevance due to its rising adoption and trust beyond the crypto-native crowd. As a result, legacy financial institutions like JPMorgan, Citigroup, and others are warming up to stablecoins by exploring a jointly issued dollar-backed asset. Another substantial evidence of institutional interest in stablecoins is that BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is one of the largest potential buyers of Circle’s stock. Sources familiar with the matter say BlackRock intends to purchase roughly 10% of the IPO shares. If that plan materializes, it would further deepen the relationship between the two firms. BlackRock already plays a key role in managing Circle’s USDC reserves through the Circle Reserve Fund, which holds about 90% of the stablecoin’s backing assets. However, a stake in Circle would expose the asset manager to the broader stablecoin market and expand its interest in the crypto scene beyond ETFs. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Circle Eyes $7.2B Valuation in Upsized U.S. IPO Amid Strong Investor Demand

Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming for a fully diluted valuation of up to $7.2 billion in its upcoming initial public offering, according to a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company now plans to offer up to 32 million shares priced between $27 and $28 each, up from 24 million shares at $24 to $26 when it first filed in May. The move suggests investor interest in Circle’s business is growing, and possibly heating up faster than expected. That interest appears to be coming from some of the world’s most influential investors. In May, it was reported that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is considering purchasing up to 10% of Circle’s IPO shares, according to people familiar with the matter. Ark Invest, the investment firm led by Cathie Wood, has also signaled intent to buy $150 million worth of stock. Circle’s IPO comes as stablecoins are having a moment in the broader crypto market. Once considered niche instruments mostly used for crypto trading, they are now widely integrated into decentralized finance (DeFi), remittances and even traditional finance rails. The total market cap of all stablecoins now stands at $248 billion, with Tether’s USDT making up 62% of the market at $154 billion, followed by Circle’s USDC at $60 billion, according to DeFiLlama.

How companies are responding to US policy changes and what they should do instead How companies are responding to US policy changes and what they should do instead By Amanda Williams, Lucrezia Nava & Gail Whiteman Jun. 2, 2025 In President Trump’s second term, a variety of executive actions have reversed social progress. Withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement presents a significant challenge to bending the global emissions curve since it is one of the world’s largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters, but a variety of other actions will endanger the energy transition. Trump’s newly established National Energy Dominance Council will prioritize domestic oil and gas production, and reversing offshore drilling bans risks ecosystem degradation and increased emissions. Trump revoked Biden’s plan for 50 percent of all new vehicles sold in the United States to be electric by 2030, halting the distribution of funds from a $5 billion program to install vehicle charging stations. The head of the EPA has asked the White House to “repeal the ‘endangerment finding,’ which says that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare,” contradicting climate science. Reversing the federal ban on plastic straws may seem minor, but 400 million tons of plastic waste is produced each year, harming marine ecosystems and human health. Meanwhile, Trump’s executive order dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within the federal government eliminates DEI considerations in federal hiring, promotions, and performance reviews, aiming to prioritize merit-based decisions. According to the latest Sustainable Development Report, only 16 percent of the targets are on track to be met by 2030. For poverty and climate action, none of the targets are on track. How should companies respond this catastrophic backsliding? Management teams have a range of strategic responses available; they can exit or hide, and they can fight or foster. Backsliding is not a new phenomenon that emerged with the second Trump administration. Companies should learn from the past, and think long term: In other periods of backsliding, leaders were separated from greenwashers. The COVID pandemic was also a period of backsliding, during which many SDG indicators were reversed, numerous people were pushed into extreme poverty, and gender inequality was exacerbated. Some CEOs took pay cuts to cover employee salaries while others took hefty bonuses before filing for bankruptcy. Despite the pandemic-driven setbacks, many companies increased their climate ambitions, and the murder of George Floyd raised awareness and commitment to racial injustice. This period of backsliding will demonstrate which funds are really committed to responsible investing, and investments will shift to those funds that remain responsible. In eras of sustainability backsliding, it is quickly becoming evident who the real leaders are—they uphold or even increase their commitments when the going gets tough. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. Exit. Many companies are leaving industry alliances or retiring corporate sustainability goals and programs. Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley have already exited the Net Zero Banking Alliance, citing political pressure and legal concerns; BP and HSBC have scaled back their net-zero targets, reflecting a broader trend of corporations diluting their sustainability goals in response to shifting political and economic landscapes. Walmart, John Deere, and Ford have scaled back or censored formal diversity targets, programs, and initiatives in response to conservative activists. Meta is also retiring some DEI practices and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has argued that Meta, and other corporations, need “more masculine energy.” Asset management giants BlackRock and Vanguard have paused their support for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) proposals. In some cases, this approach may reveal that the earlier strategy of greenwashing no longer needs to be maintained. In other cases, companies are buying time to fully evaluate and assess the changes. But while companies that are abandoning sustainability activities may ward off short-term risks related to the immediate policy sphere, they face reputational and economic risks in the same short term: Consumers and activist groups, for example, held a week-long boycott aimed at Walmart. Hide. Some companies are strategically changing, hiding, or rebranding prior sustainability commitments to reduce risk. Costco, for example, is standing by its DEI practices but has rebranded them as a “People and Communities” program (even while seeing an increase in customers, presumably in appreciation for upholding its commitments). JP Morgan and Citigroup have left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, but have stated that they plan to work independently on the path to net-zero. Opting for a lower-profile approach, scaling back public commitments, or, for example, omitting DEI-related reporting indicates a new strategy for communicating about sustainability: While maintaining internal sustainability efforts remains a priority, external positioning becomes more calculated. Hiding could still put companies at short-term risk. With companies facing lawsuits over DEI practices—as evidenced by Missouri’s case against Starbucks for breaching anti-discrimination laws—businesses that stand by their (hidden) DEI practices increase their vulnerability to changing laws and conservative scrutiny. Fight. Many companies are standing their ground and publicly reaffirming their existing sustainability commitments. For some, maintaining sustainability is a strategic imperative that cannot be quickly abandoned or hidden. For Ikea, whose CEO reaffirmed the company’s commitment to the Paris Agreement, sustainability is fully integrated into Ikea’s business model and core to its brand proposition. Moody’s rating agency and financial services company continues to leverage diverse teams to enhance the accuracy of its evaluations and decision-making. (Research demonstrates that diverse teams drive innovation, improve prediction accuracy, and enhance overall decision quality). Some are emphasizing the long-term nature of sustainability issues, since social and environmental challenges will endure much longer than one president. Archer Daniels Midland (AMD), a United States multinational food and commodities trader, for example, declared it would stick with its climate goals and reaffirmed its commitment to taking the climate crisis seriously. Ismeal Roig, a member of ADM’s executive council, said, “Frankly if I look forward to 10 or 20 years and you look at what’s going on with climate change, I don’t think this is a thing that we can just shrug off and forget about.” The company has reduced its GHG emissions by 25 percent since 2019 and is committed to no deforestation and to implementing regenerative agriculture practices. Andrew Forrest, an Australian mining billionaire, also confirmed a long-term commitment to net zero because it is “completely bankable.” He believes that short-term policy changes that scrap tax incentives for renewable energy will not change the long-term drive toward clean energy. Companies can use arguments about long-term strategic foresight and proactive risk management to ward off the short-term noise created by the changing political situation in the United States. In the short term, sustainability might be more expensive following Trump’s policies, but in the long term, maintaining those commitments makes strategic sense, especially in industries with long-lasting infrastructure lock-ins. Renewables have become increasingly competitive with fossil fuels as the cost of photovoltaic panels has dropped. These figures might change given President Trump’s exhortation to “drill, baby, drill,” but he cannot reverse the technological improvements that have been made in renewable energy or the long-term dynamics toward an increasingly warming planet and the associated consequences. A few corporate leaders have, therefore, openly stated that now is not the time to be absorbed by backsliding driven by the Trump administration, but to lead the sustainability transition more ambitiously than ever. André Hoffmann, Vice Chair of Roche, in the SDG Tent at the World Economic Forum in Davos reminded leaders not to be distracted by the short-term noise but to stick with their long-term sustainability vision: “I am sure that the economy will become more sustainable going forward because it is absolutely needed.” Foster. It remains to be seen if and how companies can turn Trump-driven backsliding into an opportunity to redefine and accelerate sustainability. Some corporate leaders are not just holding their ground but actively doubling down, investing more, innovating, and expanding sustainability efforts beyond their existing efforts. Although fossil fuels are becoming cheaper, companies can make even stronger climate commitments to transition to cleaner energy sources. Companies can invest now in infrastructure and other plans to secure a net-zeroU future. In March, Jesper Brodin posted on LinkedIn, “We’re investing €1.5 billion to accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuels through retrofitting our stores with renewable heating and cooling systems.” Ørsted, one of the world’s largest renewable energy firms, is increasing investments in offshore wind even as the United States shifts policy priorities. Companies are also repositioning their efforts to private-sector agreements. Companies like Verizon are bypassing government policy shifts by securing private-sector power purchase agreements to continue expanding renewable energy adoption. Private-sector coalitions focused on voluntary carbon markets and cross-industry partnerships are gaining traction, proving that sustainability leadership does not require government approval—it requires commitment and strategy. Other companies are focusing their growth on international markets. Tesla, for instance, has signed a lease agreement to open its first showroom in Mumbai, reinforcing its presence in Asia to help sustain the global electric vehicle transition. In the long run, Trump’s policies are unlikely to prevent the electric vehicle transition in the United States (it may just take longer). Companies can use the moment to rethink DEI approaches beyond policies and quotas to embed it in everyday practices. Managers can conduct a detailed review of hiring, evaluation, and promotion processes for unconscious biases and develop new approaches to foster a fairer and more inclusive workplace. Companies that surpass backsliding to foster sustainability innovation, rather than retreating, will emerge as the new industry leaders, shaping the next era of long-term value creation.

Title: Meta Shareholders Reject Bitcoin Treasury Proposal: Details

Photo Credit: Reuters As of September 30, 2024, Meta has $256 billion in total assets Meta recently assessed if a portion of its cash holdings could be invested into Bitcoin — the oldest and most expensive cryptocurrency in the world. Despite US President Donald Trump's pro-cryptocurrency stance, Meta shareholders dismissed the idea at the company's annual shareholders' meeting on May 28. Among a host of proposals and plans, the shareholders voted against a proposal for Bitcoin treasury assessment. In its proxy statement mailed to the shareholders before the meeting, Meta revealed that Bitcoin was not being included in the company's balance sheets. At the meeting, Meta shareholders voted on a total of 14 proposals, including the one for Bitcoin treasury assessment. The shareholders voted through stocks held as of the close of business on April 1, 2025. For the proposal regarding Bitcoin treasury assessment, an overwhelming 4,980,828,562 votes were registered against the plan as opposed to just 3,916,871 votes for it, which means a mere 0.078 percent of votes were registered in favour of the proposal, an SEC filing showed. Over eight million votes were registered as abstained. “The shareholders did not approve the shareholder proposal regarding Bitcoin treasury assessment,” the voting conclusion to the proposal read. In January, a Meta shareholder named Ethan Peck submitted a proposal to the company suggesting the possibility of exploring Bitcoin as part of the company's balance sheets. Titled "Bitcoin Treasury Assessment", Peck's proposal said Meta should consider replacing some percentage of its total assets into those that "appreciate more than bonds". "As of September 30, 2024, Meta has $256 billion (roughly Rs. 21,85,780 crore) in total assets, $72 billion (roughly Rs. 6,14,680 crore) of which is cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true inflation rate, 28 percent of Meta's total assets are consistently diminishing shareholder value simply by sitting on the balance sheet," the proposal said. Peck said Meta should consider replacing some percentage of its assets with assets that “appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term". “Meta's second largest institutional shareholder, BlackRock, advised that a two percent Bitcoin allocation is reasonable,” Peck said in the proposal, adding that corporate and institutional Bitcoin adoption was increasingly becoming “commonplace”. Citing Bitcoin's price appreciation over the years and the trend of BTC investments catching pace in companies like MicroStrategy, Peck suggested that Meta should evaluate the benefits of exchanging some percentage of its cash holdings into BTC. A #Bitcoin Treasury Shareholder Proposal has been submitted to Meta.The shareholder, Ethan Peck, who is an employee at The National Center for Public Policy Research - the organization that submitted to $MSFT & $AMZN - informed me he submitted on behalf of his family's shares. pic.twitter.com/KrAKw7nHwp At the time, Bitcoin was trading at around $108,000 (roughly Rs. 92.2 lakh). Its price on June 2 stands at $104,948 (roughly Rs. 89.6 lakh). The volatility of Bitcoin emerged as a matter of concern for Meta, its proxy statement filed with the SEC revealed. The Meta board said the requested Bitcoin treasury assessment was “unnecessary”. “Meta utilizes a thorough decision-making process that considers many types of investable assets,” the board said in response. “Our audit & risk oversight committee provides oversight over Meta's treasury policies, and our primary goals are to preserve capital and provide liquidity to the company. “To support our ongoing operations, working capital, and capital expenditure needs, management comprehensively reviews a wide and diverse range of investable assets, including those that offer diversification and risk mitigation, on an ongoing basis. “As part of this process, we assess the volatility of potential assets and seek to invest in those which provide a balanced mix of stability and long-term return to support our financial sustainability. “While we are not opining on the merits of cryptocurrency investments compared to other assets, we believe the requested assessment is unnecessary given our existing processes to manage our corporate treasury.” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who holds 61 percent voting power at Meta and is a vocal supporter of Web3 technologies like the metaverse, has not commented on the development yet. In October 2024, Microsoft, too, invited feedback from its shareholders on exploring Bitcoin investments. Later in December, however, shareholders of the software firm voted against the proposal, pointing out the asset's volatility.

Title: Bitcoin hits NYE 2000 on internet adoption timeline, but Snapchat has more users

Crypto ≠ mainstream (Yet): Why the $100K hype masks a massive adoption gap. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. “We’re not early anymore.” That is the mantra echoing across Crypto Twitter today. Last week, 35,000 people attended Bitcoin 2025, including Bitcoin enthusiasts, U.S. senators, White House staff, BlackRock analysts, and even once-imprisoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. The spot price is well above $100,000, and Bitcoiners are celebrating ‘going mainstream.’ But behind the standing ovations and ETF-fueled price charts lies a quieter truth: Bitcoin is still far from mainstream. Despite a record-setting rally and Wall Street’s growing embrace, only 4 percent of the global population holds any Bitcoin at all. In raw numbers, that’s about 337 million people, half as many as Snapchat users. Even if you include altcoins, we’re still a few hundred million short at 659 million. For all its trillion-dollar promise, Bitcoin remains a fringe tool in a still-developing ecosystem. Compare Bitcoin’s adoption curve to that of the early Internet: Bitcoin in 2025 resembles the Internet before email went fully mainstream. It is a place of innovation, but far from ubiquitous. Using your Bitcoin wallet and reading articles like this one is akin to owning an AOL account or installing the latest version of Netscape from a CD attached to a computer magazine. At 4% adoption, we’re aligned with New Year’s Eve 2000. A time when the world was terrified of leaving their PC on as the clocks struck twelve, save the Millennium Bug would destroy humanity. Nokia 3210s filled the streets and classrooms, basic images loaded line by line, downloading an album took all day, and searches were performed by an online butler named Jeeves. A lot has changed with the Internet since then, and a lot still needs to change with Bitcoin integration if we are to continue to chart the same path. Some in the Las Vegas crowd may feel like the latecomers. Statistically, they’re still early adopters. The crypto narrative increasingly hinges on institutional participation. Since the SEC’s ETF approvals in early 2024, over $44 billion has poured into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs. Pension funds, asset managers, and family offices have all allocated bitcoin as a portfolio hedge. Yet Bitcoin’s everyday utility hasn’t budged. Daily active addresses have dropped to near 700,000, after hitting a peak of 1.1 million in 2021. While TradFi money has legitimized BTC as an asset class, it has not translated into broader transactional use. Ross Ulbricht’s presence, celebrated for Bitcoin’s rebel roots, juxtaposed the contrast between Bitcoin as a political tool and as an institutional commodity. Despite its growing visibility, Bitcoin faces major obstacles on the road to mass adoption: Several initiatives are laying the groundwork for broader utility: “Bitcoin is no longer niche,” said WisdomTree analyst Dovile Silenskyte in January. That may be true in capital markets, but it’s not yet reflected in how people use money. At over $100,000 per BTC, the price of one coin now surpasses the average American household’s net worth (excluding home equity). As Bitcoin becomes more collectible, it risks becoming less usable, unless layer-two solutions and broader access reverse that trajectory. To convert hype into actual financial inclusion, Bitcoin advocates should recalibrate around: Bitcoin’s breakout moment may have arrived in headlines and hedge funds, but the true test lies ahead. Just as the Internet’s promise in the 1990s didn’t materialize until the 2000s brought mobile phones, broadband, and user-friendly apps, Bitcoin’s global impact will depend on what comes after the hype. Total wallets continue to rise, but Lightning usage, active wallets, and daily on-chain traders have failed to regain their all-time highs. The price is elevated, but on-chain usage is not. We cannot be complacent and claim victory when the battle is far from won. So, party like it’s 1999 and celebrate $100k Bitcoin. But, it took smartphones, particularly the iPhone, for internet adoption to maintain its momentum. What equivalent innovation is happening in Bitcoin? The Las Vegas summit was a celebration. But the revolution, in payments, savings, remittances, and financial sovereignty, won’t be televised. It’ll be built. Quietly. Brick by brick.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Ripple’s XRP has rocketed over the last year, climbing 300% compared to the 50% bitcoin price rally (which is now braced for a “critical” $7 trillion tipping point). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The XRP price has come within touching distance of its 2018 all-time high, soaring as developer Ripple tries to cozy up to U.S. president Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration—with U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge crypto prediction. Now, as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk primes the crypto market for an imminent game-changer, XRP has been adopted as a treasury reserve asset by the Saudi-backed VivoPower. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run XRP developer Ripple's chief executive Brad Garlinghouse has seen the XRP price soar this year. VivoPower, a sustainable energy Nasdaq-listed company, has said it plans to buy $121 million worth of XRP, raising the funds via a private share placement, and sending its stock sharply higher. The fundraising is being led by Saudi price Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud, investing $100 million, with former SBI Ripple Asia executive Adam Traidman joining VivoPower as chairman of the board. “We have been investors in the digital asset sector for a decade and have been long-term holders of XRP,” prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud, who met with Trump on his Saudi visit last month, said in a press release, adding the VivoPower investment is due to its "strategic focus on XRP and its objective to contribute to building out of the XRPL [XRP Ledger’] ecosystem." VivoPower said it will use the funds to buy XRP and establish its XRP-focused treasury operations, as well as invest in the XRPL decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. “VivoPower’s initiative to become the first publicly listed company with an XRP-centric treasury strategy is a forward-thinking move that reflects growing institutional conviction in real-world blockchain applications,” Traidman, a former Ripple board member, said in the press release. XRP developer Ripple is an enterprise-focused blockchain service company that owns around 80 billion of the total 100 billion XRP and uses it to facilitate cross-border payments.

More cryptocurrencies to corporate treasuries gets underway. The trend for companies to add bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to their corporate treasuries was started by Michael Saylor’s Strategy in 2020, with Strategy’s near-3,000% stock rally inspiring a flood of copy cat trades. Last week, GameStop became the latest company to begin buying bitcoin, while rival cryptocurrencies ethereum and solana have also been adopted by companies as treasury assets. The XRP price rally was boosted earlier this year when U.S. president Trump named XRP as one of a handful of cryptocurrencies that the U.S. would add to its so-called crypto stockpile, giving a level of validation to the cryptocurrency asset class that was almost unimaginable before Trump’s November election victory.

There’s a quote, though the source isn’t exactly known, and it goes like this: “Whenever people need a hero, we shall supply him.” I can’t quite shake the feeling that Donald Trump is that controlled opposition hero, and this story has me all the more unsettled: Trump is reportedly funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to software giant Palantir, building out a massive domestic surveillance and data collection network, which includes American citizens. From a report at Yahoo Finance: Since Trump signed an executive order in March calling for more interagency data sharing, Palantir has quietly become the go-to vendor for building that digital infrastructure. The company has landed more than $113 million in new and extended federal contracts since Trump took office including a blockbuster $795 million deal with the Pentagon last week. Palantir's Foundry platform is already in use at Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, and engineers were recently embedded at the IRS to begin building a unified, searchable database for taxpayer records. Talks are also underway with the Social Security Administration and Department of Education, suggesting more agencies could follow. To make matters worse, a slew of MAGA sycophants are promising critical thinkers that this is a “good thing” for Americans, because it’s how we identify all of the threats that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris imported into the country during their reign of terror—one such example is seen below: If you’re a patriot, you want Trump using every tool to keep you safe. — Pregnant Redhead (@PregnantRedhead) May 30, 2025 Perhaps she never heard the wise remark attributed to Benjamin Franklin: “Those who would trade freedom for safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” To follow Franklin’s observation to its logical conclusion: “Those who would trade freedom for safety will get neither liberty nor safety. The Republican federal government is selling us this massive database by saying it’s how we clean up the illegal invasion mess wrought by the Democrats—but something tells me they were in it together, and this was the plan all along. We’d resist a centralized database under the Democrats, but when Trump does it? “It’s for our safety.” (More dangerous words have never been spoken by politicians.)

Remember, rule #1 is ALWAYS: Never get high on your own supply. pic.twitter.com/kppLyi9wc3 — Jason Bassler (@JasonBassler1) June 1, 2025 Now, Palantir isn’t exactly to be trusted, for a number of reasons. First of all, the company was founded in part by a man named Peter Thiel, with investment firms BlackRock and Vanguard owning a significant share. Thiel is a billionaire member of the World Economic Forum, and in 2023, Thiel’s gay lover was found dead after he reportedly blew the lid on the alleged affair to Thiel’s husband. He doesn’t quite strike me as a “conservative,” or an America-first type of guy. Here’s another disturbing aspect: the name “Palantir” comes from J. R. R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings tale, as it was the name of the indestructible crystal ball that the evil Saruman used to surveil events throughout Middle Earth, even those far into the future. With Palantir’s use of AI to run algorithms and assess future threats, this is looking a little like the plot to Minority Report. UPDATED: I have just come across a relevant video. Below, Alex Karp, another Palantir founder, brags about how his tech “stopped the far-right” movement that was washing across Europe: MUST WATCH: Alex Karp, the co-founder & CEO of Peter Thiel’s company Palantir, says that their product known as Gotham (which he calls PG) “single handedly stopped the rise of the far right in Europe”. Peter Thiel calls himself an ally to the right while he works to destroy us. pic.twitter.com/FVjT8D9qv1 — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) January 18, 2023 Now, Bassler also adds this about the new data centralization plans: No, this Palantir database isn’t like the others. It will combine: -Tax filings -Student debt -Social Security -Bank accounts -Medical claims -Immigration status No previous database system has ever centralized this much personal info across various federal agencies. — Jason Bassler (@JasonBassler1) June 1, 2025 And, where it can lead: -REAL ID enforcement -Surveillance stablecoins -AI Biometric entry/exit systems -Palantir building a master database -FedEx trucks equipped with license plate readers -ICE using facial recognition to monitor online dissent 2025: Directed by Orwell, produced by Palantir. — Jason Bassler (@JasonBassler1) June 2, 2025 Big Brother is officially here.

With Palantir’s use of AI to run algorithms and assess future threats, this is looking a little like the plot to Minority Report. UPDATED: I have just come across a relevant video. Below, Alex Karp, another Palantir founder, brags about how his tech “stopped the far-right” movement that was washing across Europe: MUST WATCH: Alex Karp, the co-founder & CEO of Peter Thiel’s company Palantir, says that their product known as Gotham (which he calls PG) “single handedly stopped the rise of the far right in Europe”. Peter Thiel calls himself an ally to the right while he works to destroy us. pic.twitter.com/FVjT8D9qv1 Now, Bassler also adds this about the new data centralization plans: No, this Palantir database isn’t like the others. It will combine: -Tax filings -Student debt -Social Security -Bank accounts -Medical claims -Immigration status No previous database system has ever centralized this much personal info across various federal agencies. And, where it can lead: -REAL ID enforcement -Surveillance stablecoins -AI Biometric entry/exit systems -Palantir building a master database -FedEx trucks equipped with license plate readers -ICE using facial recognition to monitor online dissent 2025: Directed by Orwell, produced by Palantir.

Title: BlackRock & Ark Invest Mulls Major Stake In Circle’s Proposed IPO

Asset manager BlackRock has shown interest in acquiring a 10% stake in USDC stablecoin issuer Circle. The highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) will attract large crypto and traditional finance firms. This follows a thickening institutional plot in the crypto market, adding an extra layer of legitimacy for the high-flying assets. BlackRock is preparing to acquire part of Circle’s shares in its upcoming IPO, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Per a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Circle’s Chief Executive, Jeremy Allaire, plans to raise about $624 million in the IPO. The deal, which is expected on June 4, has recorded multiple orders for the shares available. The sources said the deal’s details are not finalized, and the $9 trillion asset manager could swoop in for a stake through another vehicle or opt out entirely. BlackRock and Circle are not strangers, as previous deals have already been struck. BlackRock manages a money market fund for Circle that backs the USDC stablecoin. The Fund now holds approximately $53.5 billion. USDC adoption is projected to build on gains in the past three quarters. Recent institutional developments in the United States, with its user base soaring, are tipped to favor the asset. Incoming stablecoin rules will also push its compliance in multiple jurisdictions. Circle initially filed for its IPO on April 1 but delayed due to rising economic concerns amid US tariff wars. The company has attracted big crypto firms like Ripple and Coinbase as users flock to its USDC stablecoin. Fortune reported informal sale talks with Coinbase and Ripple. However, Circle insisted it was not for sale following reports of a $4 billion bid deemed too low. According to the rebuttals, Circle remains committed to its long-term goals. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest is also preparing a $150 million swoop in Circle’s IPO. Digital asset traders remain thrilled as more institutional investors increase their exposure to the crypto market. According to experts, inflows have positioned assets for major upswings in Q2 2025. From investment in Bitcoin mining firms to stablecoin issuers, traditional players have raised the bar. Strategy, H100, and Addentax made recent Bitcoin acquisitions as the price closed at $110k. Meanwhile, GameStop announced a $513 million purchase, picking up 4,710 BTC.

Title: Bitcoin Suddenly Braced For $7 Trillion ‘Critical’ Price Tipping Point After Stark BlackRock Warning

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 06/01 update below. This post was originally published on May 30 Bitcoin has fallen sharply since hitting an all-time high last week, down 6% despite the U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge bitcoin prediction. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last two years, turbo-charged by Wall Street adoption led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and then U.S. president Donald Trump’s embrace of the technology (with Elon Musk quietly plotting what could be a bitcoin price game-changer). Now, as fears swirl the U.S. dollar could be teetering on the verge of collapse, a serious BlackRock warning that quantum computing could pose an existential risk to bitcoin has been escalated by a Google research paper that found encryption-breaking quantum computers could be a lot closer than previously thought. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has emerged as one of the most bullish voices supporting ... More bitcoin on Wall Street, helping the bitcoin price boom. “This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate,” Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney wrote, referring to the number of quantum computer qubits needed to break a public-key encryption algorithm similar to that used by bitcoin. “If this is even remotely true, combined with everything else happening right now, the only safe trade are hard assets and, dare I say, gold,” investor Chamath Palihapitiya, a vocal supporter of bitcoin who claims to have first bought some when the bitcoin price was just $100, posted to X in response to the paper. 06/01 update: The bitcoin price has now plummeted by almost 10% from its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, falling to just over $103,000 and fast approaching the closely-watched $100,000 level. "Next week will be critical for both the crypto market," analysts with 10x Research led by Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note that suggested long-term bitcoin holders are beginning to sell. This coming week will see slew of economic and labor market data—topped by Friday’s monthly U.S. jobs report—as well as U.S. president Donald Trump’s controversial "big, beautiful" tax bill coming to the Senate and legal back-and-forth expected over Trump’s market-crashing barrage of global trade tariffs. Meanwhile, bullish bitcoin price analysts are predicting small changes in “sentiment” could trigger outsized market swings, with huge volumes of cash still sitting on the sidelines. “With roughly $7 trillion still parked in money market funds and another $2 trillion in fixed income ETFs, even a modest shift in risk sentiment could redirect meaningful capital into crypto and other high-beta assets,” Matt Mena, research strategist at crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) company 21Shares, said in emailed comments. “If bitcoin breaks out of the $105,000 to $110,000 range with conviction, we could see a sharp move to $120,000 and, more importantly, reach our previously year-end price target of $138,500 per bitcoin by the end of the summer.” Earlier this month, BlackRock quietly added a serious warning about quantum computing to the list of risks to its huge spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024. The fund now holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $70 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher, hitting an all-time high of around $112,000 per bitcoin last ... More week before dropping back. “If quantum computing technology is able to advance […] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,” BlackRock’s amended regulatory filing for its bitcoin fund read. The quantum computing risk to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has exploded recently, with tech giants including Google making strides in quantum computing research. “At this point, no blockchain is ready to withstand a quantum attack when this becomes possible, which could very well be much earlier than 2030,” David Carvalho, the chief executive of decentralized post-quantum infrastructure blockchain Naoris Protocol, said in earlier emailed comments that warned bitcoin is “sleepwalking into a disaster.”

Bitcoin’s $8B decline signals potential for a rebound, but macro challenges and bears remain in control. Macro headwinds are starting to weigh on the market. FUD is picking up, demand is clearly slowing, and bears are beginning to find their footing. Bitcoin [BTC] hasn’t established a reliable support base yet, and with long positions stacked up, the risk of a liquidation cascade is real. Still, the market feels like it’s on a knife’s edge. One decisive move from the bulls could flip the momentum fast. The next move likely defines the short-term trend. Let’s take a look at Bitcoin’s daily chart. You’ll see five straight red candles lighting up the board. On the 27th of May, BTC briefly touched $110K, then bears crashed the party hard, triggering a swift sell-off that squeezed the bulls tight. But the catch is, this liquidity surge followed Trump Media’s $2.5 billion Bitcoin treasury buy. Normally, that’d fuel a pump, but instead, traders hit the brakes, dialing up the risk-off mood. The culprit? Trade war jitters. As AMBCrypto pointed out, retail cash is fleeing back to safe havens like bonds, draining momentum from crypto. And it’s not just retail. Amid the U.S. equity slowdown, institutional capital is stepping back, too. BlackRock sold 4,100 BTC, snapping its 52-day streak of consecutive inflows. Source: Farside Investors Bears are flexing. In fact, Funding Rates on Bybit turned red for the first time in almost a month, adding to the downside pressure with the macro scene looking shaky. But here’s the thing: Bitcoin’s been dropping in a straight line – no crazy swings, no solid support yet, no bounce back. So what’s brewing? A full-blown distribution dump or just a tight liquidity squeeze ready to snap back? Putting macro noise and futures flows aside, a single sell-off won’t flip the script to distribution just yet. In fact, on the 29th of May, at $105,521, spot wallets saw an outflow of 8,175 BTC – signaling serious accumulation, not panic selling. On the derivatives front, as AMBCrypto flagged, on the 23rd of May, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) hit a record $80 billion, lining up with its all-time price high. What followed? A sharp round of deleveraging. At press time, Bitcoin’s OI slid to $71.86 billion. That’s a staggering $8 billion flush in just seven days. Source: CoinGlass That explains Bitcoin’s controlled, linear bleed. But without signs of capitulation from weak or strong hands, the bulls still have a window to strike back. So far, this looks less like panic and more like the board getting reset, ready for a healthier leg, once the macro clouds clear.

Title: Adani Energy to raise $502 million through stake sale

(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Gautam Adani-controlled Adani Energy Solutions Ltd. approved raising 43 billion rupees ($502 million) via a stake sale. The Adani Group unit’s board approved a proposal to raise the amount via “Qualified Institutional Placement” in one or more tranches, according to an exchange filing Saturday. Adani companies, with interests stretching from ports to green energy, are steadily regaining investor confidence after a US indictment of the founder soured sentiment. The group in April raised about $750 million for an acquisition, with BlackRock Inc. subscribing to about a third of the bond issue. Last week, its ports unit raised $150 million from DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in a bilateral loan. In March, Fitch Ratings removed Adani Energy from a rating watch and assigned it a negative outlook, citing moderating risks associated with the group’s liquidity. “The Adani group has demonstrated adequate funding access” since the US bribery charges, Fitch said in a statement.

Title: Letters: Michael McDowell is wrong about RTÉ being infiltrated by ‘Stalinists’ at the height of the IRA’s war against the Irish people

Time Published: 2025-06-01T01:30:00Z

Senator Michael McDowell. Photo: Gerry Mooney Madam — In last week’s Sunday Independent (May 25) senator Michael McDowell took a sideswipe at those of us who worked in RTÉ current affairs at the height of the Provisional IRA’s war against the Irish people. In doing so he distorted the historical record and recycled the hairy old conspiracy theory that RTÉ had been “infiltrated” by The Workers Party activists who held the station’s current affairs coverage in a “vice-like grip”. I was one of the “Stalinists” senator McDowell was getting at in his interview with Dónal Lynch. For the record, I wasn’t “infiltrated” into RTÉ in 1978 but was offered the post of producer/director after a rigorous open public competition. I joined the current affairs programme Today Tonight in 1980 and was part of a large editorial team who robustly debated how to cover the biggest story of the day: the Provisional republican movement’s attempt to take power in Ireland, North and south, through “the ballot box and the Armalite”. Like the majority of my producer and researcher colleagues in RTÉ at the time I supported the ban on Provo and loyalist frontmen appearing on air to justify their terror campaigns. In backing Section 31, I and others like me in RTÉ, believed we were acting in defence of Irish democracy against an evil sectarian insurgency that sought to plunge the island of Ireland into a full scale ethnic civil war. In Dáil Éireann Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats all embraced this point of view. Workers Party TDs took the opposite view and voted in support of the arguments advanced by purist advocates of free speech and most RTÉ journalists. Their contention was that the apologists for murder would be held to account by tough forensic journalism. That never happened. In 1994 the ban on Sinn Féin appearing on RTÉ was lifted. At that time the Provos had no TDs sitting in Dáil Éireann. Thirty years later, despite being unrepentant about the war crimes of its military wing, Sinn Féin has 39 TDs, one more than Fine Gael. Like senator McDowell I regard the Provisional IRA campaign that Sinn Féin justifies as an “abomination”. That murderous Provisional “abomination” was at its most lethal in the 1970s and 80s. I am proud to state that I was one of many RTÉ programme makers who saw the slaughter perpetrated on behalf of “Irish freedom” by Provo “volunteers” for what it was, and called it out when it was most needed. Gerry Gregg, Blackrock, Co Dublin Madam — In years to come, a global generation of young people will confront their parents with two simple questions. What did you do to oppose the catastrophic genocide of innocent civilians in Gaza and what did you do to resist the deliberately induced famine? The very least we should be able to answer is that we demanded of our TDs an immediate implementation of the Occupied Territories Bill. A piece of legislation which in and of itself is a totally inadequate response to the incremental displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank and yet consecutive Irish governments have found multiple excuses to not apply even this deficient response. If we do not mobilise as a national collective to demand our representatives act on Israeli genocide, we, too, will have to bear the guilt of the morally outraged, yet at the same time otherwise engaged citizen. Kevin McCarthy, Killaloe, Co Clare Madam — I read the article last week, ‘Doctor sees nine of her 10 children killed in new IDF atrocity’, and wondered why it wasn’t on the front page. These awful atrocities by Israel continue and our national news is more interested in what new disrespectful, bully-boy tactics have been dreamed up by Trump, giving him priority. What has happened in the world where poor children can just be killed by a powerful and rich nation, cheered on by the USA (a country I used to respect), while the rest of the world seems afraid to show our total disgust. The bad will continue to wreak havoc uncontested if the good remain silent. I am proud that Ireland is vocal in its condemnation of Israel, but the media needs to give it more priority. Less prominent pages of newspapers can be reserved for Trump news. Siobhán Buckley, Mallow, Co Cork Madam — Letter writers last week wrote about the suffering of children in Gaza and accused Israel of genocide. No mention that the current war began when Hamas perpetrated the highest number of murders of Jews in one day since the Holocaust. If the Israeli military campaign in Gaza was genocide then the Allied campaign against Nazi Germany would have been genocide, too. Ciarán Masterson, Cathedral Road, Cavan Madam — John Boyne writes that he came out as gay to unequivocal family support. Many of us were not so lucky. He also says he was too afraid to attend Pride as a teenager. Many of us attend Pride, and campaign for our community, in spite of or even because of that fear. If all he can do at a time of rising anti-LGBTQ+ hate across the world is sit on the sidelines and throw barbs at a community he has never needed or aided, that might go some way to explain why our community doesn’t need or heed him now. Jess Connor, Glasnevin, Dublin 9 Madam — In his recent article, John Boyne argued for the repeal of the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) 2015, referring to it as “problematic at best, and deeply misogynistic at worst”. Yet he offers no explanation as to what these problems might be. The issue of gender recognition has been thoroughly examined by the Irish courts and the Dáil since Dr Lydia Foy’s case began in 1997. To scrap this legislation would make Irish law incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Mr Boyne mentions “fear of being attacked” as a teenager. Yet repealing the GRA (the mechanism by which trans people can update documents to match their gender, presentation and appearance) would force trans people to out themselves constantly. We face the same hatred, from the same people, but Mr Boyne refuses to empathise with us. He would prefer to split our community based on our differences, rather than unite under our shared struggle. Ciara Witts, Birr, Co Offaly Madam — John Boyne’s column reads like a lengthy exercise in privilege, positioning himself as a spokesperson for a “respectable” gay minority. His account of coming out to unequivocal family support, a string of relationships, and public success is not just his personal experience — it’s a profoundly atypical one. His suggestion that Pride is no longer necessary because his life is comfortable reveals a breathtaking detachment from the daily realities still faced by many LGBTQ+ people. Pride was not built for those who never needed it. Boyne’s attempt to distance himself from LGBTQ+ culture does not make him brave or insightful. It makes him condescending. To imply that queer students are just “ruthlessly straight middle-class” dilettantes, or that trans women pose a threat to women’s rights, is scapegoating — fear dressed as reason. He praises the Cass Review as if it were universally respected, failing to acknowledge the flaws that have prompted criticism from within the medical and academic communities. What Boyne dismisses as hollow allyship — being told he is “loved, seen and heard” — is, in fact, empathy. His rejection of it says more about his own discomfort than the intentions of allies. Empathy, not elitism, is what underpins meaningful progress. Caz Koopman, Cobh, Co Cork Madam — I wish to compliment John Boyne on his brave, balanced, honest and insightful article about being gay. He sums it up very well when he says, “it is just the way I was born”. I agree. Dr Pat Mc Grath, Monkstown, Co Dublin Madam — It is wonderful to read John Boyne’s clear and refreshing refutation of our modern “Pride” celebration and the LGBTQ+ label. At a time when Pride flags are draped year round outside secondary schools and youth centres, we have to wonder what confusing ideology is being promoted to our youth in the guise of compassion and inclusion. The pendulum has swung too far and clear thinking and maturity is needed from the leaders of our community. Boyne is clearly showing leadership here and I hope our educators listen. Alan Coakey, Roscommon town Madam — As someone who has visited the United States many times, it saddens me that I will probably never go there again. Trump’s recent intention to have the social media accounts of visa applicants looked at is not only creepy, but scary. To me it is the last straw. This is going to cause widespread damage to the plans of students in Ireland who go to America every summer to work on a J1 visa. And after he is gone, his legacy will still linger as the much younger and even more right-wing JD Vance, the vice president who has publicly let it be known that he dislikes foreigners immensely, especially Europeans, will carry on Trump’s catastrophic policy of ripping America’s reputation to bits. Mike Burke, Sixmilebridge, Co Clare Madam — I want to congratulate Nikki Hayes for being so candid with Niamh Horan in last week’s Sunday Independent. I was stuck by the veracity of Nikki’s story and I want to take this opportunity to wish this brave woman every good wish for the future. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Madam — As an Irish pro-choice, pro-gay marriage feminist, I was delighted to read in the Sunday Independent that the commencement of the Government’s recently enacted surrogacy legislation has been paused and that a reconsideration is taking place. It is simply not the case that only conservative people oppose this legislation. There are very many liberal feminists in Ireland who oppose surrogacy because they want and work towards the best possible life for women and girls and this does not include having babies for anyone other than themselves. Anne Weadick, Galway city Madam — How timely was Niall MacMonagle’s interview with artist Michael Kane. Niall interviewed the artist before the opening of his exhibition in the Taylor Galleries. Michael died the day after. This particular interview captured the essence of the artist and this particular column is to be treasured because it captures the essence of the man. Niall is a superb interpreter of the art world and we could do with more words and more space from this columnist. Phyl Herbert, Rathmines, Dublin 6 Madam — Your restaurant critic’s review is my “go-to” page in Life magazine. It is always enjoyable. Last week, Lucinda asked: “Could this be the first 3-star?” This being Chapter One restaurant in Dublin and the 3-star being the elusive Michelin award. She supports her suggestion by telling us that, at the recent RAI awards, Chapter One, a Michelin 2-star restaurant, took the gong for the best restaurant in Dublin. I have no doubt that this is truly deserved. However, at the very same awards ceremony, Dede in Baltimore, also a Michelin 2-star restaurant, not only took the gong for the best restaurant in Ireland, but, as it happened, retained the gong won in 2024 for the best restaurant in Ireland. I would respectfully suggest that the Michelin Man should be more inclined, if and when they give the 3 stars, to look at the best in Ireland, rather than the best in Dublin — even if it is in West Cork, rather than in the capital. Michael Kenefick, Whitegate, Co Cork Madam — Gabija Gataveckaite and Mary Regan’s timely piece recently highlighted growing coalition unease over James Browne’s performance as Housing Minister. It’s hard not to ask: why didn’t Simon Harris, as FG leader, take the role himself? With housing in crisis, it would have been a clear signal of leadership. Instead, he chose Foreign Affairs and Defence. As Shane Ross noted recently, Ireland is acting like “a small country with a swollen head”. With record homelessness and housing starts at a four-year low, Harris’s decision speaks volumes. When the house is on fire, he is out installing satellite dishes. A housing tsar might yet be appointed, but we needed a political heavyweight months ago. Dylan Redmond, Leixlip, Co Kildare Madam — In response to a letter writer who pined for a more charismatic and youthful president of the United States, I wrote a letter to your newspaper with “Boring Joe Biden is doing just fine. He doesn’t have to leave his basement to get votes and instead concentrates on policy and enacting legislation”. Your predecessor edited those words to “Boring old Joe Biden” and gave me €50. Reading Shane Ross’s article last week, ‘Politics is a vocation where vanity captures its victims — I should know’, I’m reminded of that ageist sentence. Joe Biden was boring but by any standard he was one of the most successful bipartisan legislators of the past 50 years in US politics. What he was not good for though was selling newspapers or advertisements on cable TV. And therein lies the problem in the English-speaking western media. The 46th US president may still have lost to Donald Trump had he resisted the pile-on from the media and others to step down, but his record in government will stand the test of time. Tom McElligott, Listowel, Co Kerry Madam — If mass is the scientific term for the quantity of matter in a given object, and Mass is the ceremony that celebrates the sacrament of the eucharist, might it be a good idea to differentiate the two by using lowercase and uppercase? Mary Lally, Clontarf, Dublin 3 Madam — Having watched Uncharted on RTÉ, may I compliment the real heroes, the camera crew and the back-up team who took serious risks to get the daring footage. Well done also to Ray Goggins and the other amazing participants on their bravery.

Buckle up, folks. You’ll have a lot of words coming your way, but they’re the good kind of words. The ones with nothing but earnest intentions, that want to help people, not hurt them. While Refused are more know for their overbearing aural sounds, they’re aiming to contribute a bit more to society. A global society that needs it for sure. Now that the band is approaching the upcoming start of the European leg of their farewell tour, they’ve got a plan that involves them raising hella money to donate to pro-Palestinian causes across the land. Besides it being the right thing to do, their decision came after finding out information about some of the festivals they’re scheduled to play, and who might be financially backing those festivals. They call out KKR specifically, saying how they “invest in Israeli cyber security among other fucked up things.” Read the band’s lengthy but explanatory statement and action plan below: “So a week ago we found out that some of the festivals we’re playing this summer are backed by an entertainment conglomerate called Superstruct in which a bad bad actor named KKR is part owner. KKR invests in Israeli cyber security among other fucked up things. Our first instinct was to immediately jump ship, to boycott. We communicated this to the festivals and the organizers wrote back saying they shared our values and felt like we did, that they loved what they did and were proud of the festivals they’d created, that the majority of their audience would be sympathetic to our position and that they were gutted that bastards like KKR had bought into Superstruct after they started working with them, staining their life’s work by extension. One of them also questioned our other associations (cheeky, but he was right), saying that live nation are behind some other festivals and shows we’re playing, one of whose owners are Blackrock, a multinational heavily invested in weapons manufacturing, and that our music is on Spotify which donated money to Donald Trump’s inauguration and also invests in military AI. The scum of the earth basically. These festivals also told us they wanted us to make noise for the Palestinian cause, one of them even offered to give us a large amount of money just to donate to pro-Palestine organizations. So, the conundrum became: boycotting these festivals would make us feel good about ourselves, the band’s legacy wouldn’t be tarnished by association with these disgusting companies. it would feel nice. But it wouldn’t do any good; being morally superior doesn’t put food in the mouths of starving Palestinians. also, it wouldn’t make headlines; we’re not top billing on these festivals because, although we have a strong following within a specific subgenre of heavy music, we’re not a huge band. Some Swedish leftists sitting out a few festivals wouldn’t raise many eyebrows. We’ve mulled this over and although there’s a strong argument for taking a stand against KKR and this development of amoral private equity and hedge funds buying into the arts because it’s non-controversial and comparatively safe, it would be naive to think our boycott would even register for them. Rather the opposite, if people like that knew what we talked about on stage they would rather have us stay home, and with the charred bodies of Palestinians burned alive stacking up in the concentration camp/graveyard that Gaza has become, we have decided to make some noise, to go meet our people, to celebrate the resistance and raise money for the Palestinian cause this summer. To us, it is the right thing to do, to get out there and be a thorn in the side of Zionists, fascists, venture capitalists and to fan the flames of discontent together with our bright, informed comrades all over Europe. A lot of you have already bought tickets and are expecting us, so we’d love to get suggestions from local organizations and activists we could work with in all the countries and cities we’re playing. Free Palestine!!!” In a follow up post, they continued their statement with: “These kinds of deliberations are not new to us. In our late teens, coming out of the DIY underground, we were obsessed with ending our involvement in systemic oppression through the power of boycott, through spreading awareness of the human rights abuses in the countries that produced the consumer objects our generation coveted, the environmental impact of eating meat, the horrific abuses carried out by the USA in South America in order for us to have cheap bananas. These were all hot topics in the leftist punk underground at the time (and if we’re being self-critical for a moment, it’s obvious now that we were deluded in thinking that creating leftist utopias outside of the mainstream would achieve the great system change we were aiming for. Instead we left the parliaments to the neo-Nazis we used to fight in the streets [Antifa did the lion’s share of the fighting, but once or twice we fought them as a band, though most of the time we were too outnumbered and out-menaced to do shit], who gladly put on suits and toned their rhetoric down in order to gain power, an endeavor in which they succeeded beyond our wildest nightmares, as we can see all over the west right now), and it took us uneducated working class morons a while to learn what many picked up during two or three classes at UNI: that all of us in the west are complicit in the exploitation and subjugation of a huge part of the non-western world and while we worked hard to rid ourselves of this complicity by becoming incredibly conscious consumers, we slowly started to understand the immense machine of oppression that Europe and the US have constituted from the 1500s to this day, a fact that made our twenty-something consumer choices in the north of Sweden seem pretty insignificant. This didn’t deter us, but it definitely put us in check. What we quickly realized though was that we were always gonna be a gateway band. The underground community is a beautiful place, but after having seen the hundredth band preaching about the evils of capitalism or organized religion to a crowd of people dressed exactly the same as them, reading the same books, listening to the same bands, you start to wonder what the point really is: do we want to be right or do we want change? Refused was always a different animal than the pure, DIY or die-bands, and we did things they could not. That was kind of the point, to try and bring these ideas into the light. The centre-right government of Sweden gave us an award once (thank you @psl) and although we fucking hated their guts, we accepted the award just so we could stand right there in the corridors of power and ridicule them, humiliate them to their faces. There were minor deals with minor devils made, but through it all, we reached kids who would never have been exposed to these ideas otherwise: we turned a lot of people on to vegetarianism and veganism through our music, and there’s no counting the amount of people who have come up to us and said that our songs sowed the first seed of what grew to be a radical political life. It’s what we’re most proud of, the many activists, teachers, human rights lawyers, doctors and environmentalists for whom we were a companion (or even a stepping stone) on the way to a life of serving the greater good. They didn’t preach to the converted, they didn’t freak out about bar codes on CDs, they actually went out there and did shit. I guess what we’re trying to say is, these choices are not easy for us but we take them very seriously, and we’ve driven ourselves mad trying to bat a hundred in a crooked game. Which is why our next project will be DIY, more on that later…” Refused are sticking to their justice-forward, equal rights, mutual aid roots, and that’s what we need right now.

KKR invests in Israeli cyber security among other fucked up things. Our first instinct was to immediately jump ship, to boycott. We communicated this to the festivals and the organizers wrote back saying they shared our values and felt like we did, that they loved what they did and were proud of the festivals they’d created, that the majority of their audience would be sympathetic to our position and that they were gutted that bastards like KKR had bought into Superstruct after they started working with them, staining their life’s work by extension. One of them also questioned our other associations (cheeky, but he was right), saying that live nation are behind some other festivals and shows we’re playing, one of whose owners are Blackrock, a multinational heavily invested in weapons manufacturing, and that our music is on Spotify which donated money to Donald Trump’s inauguration and also invests in military AI. The scum of the earth basically. These festivals also told us they wanted us to make noise for the Palestinian cause, one of them even offered to give us a large amount of money just to donate to pro-Palestine organizations. So, the conundrum became: boycotting these festivals would make us feel good about ourselves, the band’s legacy wouldn’t be tarnished by association with these disgusting companies. it would feel nice. But it wouldn’t do any good; being morally superior doesn’t put food in the mouths of starving Palestinians. also, it wouldn’t make headlines; we’re not top billing on these festivals because, although we have a strong following within a specific subgenre of heavy music, we’re not a huge band. Some Swedish leftists sitting out a few festivals wouldn’t raise many eyebrows. We’ve mulled this over and although there’s a strong argument for taking a stand against KKR and this development of amoral private equity and hedge funds buying into the arts because it’s non-controversial and comparatively safe, it would be naive to think our boycott would even register for them. Rather the opposite, if people like that knew what we talked about on stage they would rather have us stay home, and with the charred bodies of Palestinians burned alive stacking up in the concentration camp/graveyard that Gaza has become, we have decided to make some noise, to go meet our people, to celebrate the resistance and raise money for the Palestinian cause this summer. To us, it is the right thing to do, to get out there and be a thorn in the side of Zionists, fascists, venture capitalists and to fan the flames of discontent together with our bright, informed comrades all over Europe. A lot of you have already bought tickets and are expecting us, so we’d love to get suggestions from local organizations and activists we could work with in all the countries and cities we’re playing.

Free Palestine!!!” Free Palestine!!!” In a follow up post, they continued their statement with: “These kinds of deliberations are not new to us. In our late teens, coming out of the DIY underground, we were obsessed with ending our involvement in systemic oppression through the power of boycott, through spreading awareness of the human rights abuses in the countries that produced the consumer objects our generation coveted, the environmental impact of eating meat, the horrific abuses carried out by the USA in South America in order for us to have cheap bananas. These were all hot topics in the leftist punk underground at the time (and if we’re being self-critical for a moment, it’s obvious now that we were deluded in thinking that creating leftist utopias outside of the mainstream would achieve the great system change we were aiming for. Instead we left the parliaments to the neo-Nazis we used to fight in the streets [Antifa did the lion’s share of the fighting, but once or twice we fought them as a band, though most of the time we were too outnumbered and out-menaced to do shit], who gladly put on suits and toned their rhetoric down in order to gain power, an endeavor in which they succeeded beyond our wildest nightmares, as we can see all over the west right now), and it took us uneducated working class morons a while to learn what many picked up during two or three classes at UNI: that all of us in the west are complicit in the exploitation and subjugation of a huge part of the non-western world and while we worked hard to rid ourselves of this complicity by becoming incredibly conscious consumers, we slowly started to understand the immense machine of oppression that Europe and the US have constituted from the 1500s to this day, a fact that made our twenty-something consumer choices in the north of Sweden seem pretty insignificant. This didn’t deter us, but it definitely put us in check. What we quickly realized though was that we were always gonna be a gateway band. The underground community is a beautiful place, but after having seen the hundredth band preaching about the evils of capitalism or organized religion to a crowd of people dressed exactly the same as them, reading the same books, listening to the same bands, you start to wonder what the point really is: do we want to be right or do we want change? Refused was always a different animal than the pure, DIY or die-bands, and we did things they could not. That was kind of the point, to try and bring these ideas into the light. The centre-right government of Sweden gave us an award once (thank you @psl) and although we fucking hated their guts, we accepted the award just so we could stand right there in the corridors of power and ridicule them, humiliate them to their faces. There were minor deals with minor devils made, but through it all, we reached kids who would never have been exposed to these ideas otherwise: we turned a lot of people on to vegetarianism and veganism through our music, and there’s no counting the amount of people who have come up to us and said that our songs sowed the first seed of what grew to be a radical political life. It’s what we’re most proud of, the many activists, teachers, human rights lawyers, doctors and environmentalists for whom we were a companion (or even a stepping stone) on the way to a life of serving the greater good. They didn’t preach to the converted, they didn’t freak out about bar codes on CDs, they actually went out there and did shit. I guess what we’re trying to say is, these choices are not easy for us but we take them very seriously, and we’ve driven ourselves mad trying to bat a hundred in a crooked game.

Title: Is Ethereum Preparing For A Move To $3,800? Analysts Predict Bullish Phase Ahead

Trading in the mid-$2,000 range, Ethereum (ETH) has repeatedly teased a move toward $3,000, only to fall short and retreat back into its current range. However, several crypto analysts remain confident that ETH’s ascent to $3,000 and beyond is only a matter of time. In a recent X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted ETH’s bullish price action. The analyst shared the following daily ETH chart, showing the cryptocurrency breaking out of a bullish flag following a period of consolidation – potentially setting its sights on a target of $3,800. Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto shared Titan’s outlook, saying that ETH is “holding up really well right now.” In a separate X post, the analyst added: It looks like a breakout is coming, and $3K is just around the corner. The fact that it’s outperforming #BTC this quarter is a strong sign that altcoin season is warming up. Meanwhile, crypto trader Jelle urged patience. Sharing the following chart of ETH’s recent price movement, he emphasized that ETH is behaving as expected as it continues to challenge a key resistance level. According to Jelle, the “real fun” will begin once ETH hits $3,000. Notably, ETH continues to attract strong institutional interest. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows for Ethereum topped $91 million yesterday, with BlackRock alone accounting for $50.4 million of that total – a clear sign of sustained confidence in the digital asset. Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez also highlighted significant whale accumulation. According to Martinez, wallets holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 ETH acquired over 1 million ETH in the last 48 hours – a strong signal of long-term bullish sentiment. Large ETH ETF inflows and whale purchases signal rising institutional confidence and aggressive accumulation – trends that often precede bullish price action. By reducing the available supply on the market, these moves can help fuel upward momentum and price appreciation. From a technical standpoint, Ethereum is showing encouraging signs. Crypto trader Merlijn The Trader pointed out that ETH appears to be closely following the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern. In this pattern, the spring phase involves a false breakdown below support to shake out weak hands, followed by a test to confirm waning selling pressure. This sets the stage for the jump – a strong rally above resistance with significant volume, marking the start of a new uptrend. According to Merlijn, ETH has already completed the spring and test phases and is now poised to enter the jump phase – potentially setting the stage for a move toward a new all-time high (ATH). That said, all eyes are on the FTX creditor payouts expected later today. Experts warn that the massive $5 billion distribution could temporarily dampen ETH’s bullish momentum by increasing short-term selling pressure. At press time, ETH trades at $2,603, down 2.4% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

IRISH RAIL HAS announced that its services between Dublin’s Connolly Station and Dún Laoghaire will be unavailable this weekend as commuters flock to a series of bank holiday events. Between today and Monday, 2 June, restrictions and alterations will apply to both rail and bus services because of limited capacity due to annual summer gatherings such as the Bloom festival and the VHI Women’s Mini Marathon taking place. Here are the main changes to note across the primary public transport services. A revised timetable will be in place for the weekend, with Monday’s times operating as Sunday schedules for Dart and commuter services. Dart services between Connolly Station and Dún Laoghaire will be unavailable due to major works on the line between Connolly and Blackrock which will also impact Rosslare Intercity services. However, rail tickets on affected routes are valid on Dublin Bus. Dart services are operating between Malahide/Howth and Connolly, and between Dún Laoghaire and Bray/Greystones. All other rail services are also off between Connolly and Dún Laoghaire for the entire bank holiday weekend, and Rosslare services will be operating from Bray only. (You can find full details here). Advertisement Irish Rail is reminding customers to pre-book tickets to ensure a seat on intercity trains because of high demand on Heuston-bound rail for the purpose of attending the Bord Bia Bloom festival in Dublin’s Phoenix Park. Some Dublin-bound trains from Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford are already fully booked, so additional trains will operate out of Cork and Galway to accommodate passenger numbers heading to Bloom Extra early trains from Cobh, Midleton and Mallow will be laid on to provide for high numbers attending the Cork City Marathon on Sunday. The company says all services will operate to a Sunday schedule this weekend. This will include Dublin’s Expressway services serving Ballina, Cavan, Donegal, Dundalk, Letterkenny, Monaghan, Sligo, Waterford and Wexford as well as serving Cork, Galway, Limerick and Tralee. Customers are strongly advised to pre-book their tickets and allow for delays if heading to and from Dublin Airport on Expressway due to holidaymakers jetting abroad. The VHI Women’s Mini Marathon in the capital will cause road closures, so Bus Éireann says people must check service updates on its website for the latest travel information. The company’s Monday service will operate to a Sunday schedule. Its Nitelink service will continue today, but will not be in place tomorrow. Customers are told to be aware of traffic diversions in place across the city to facilitate the Women’s Mini Marathon tomorrow. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Dublin is ridiculous. Here's why I still love it
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/05/31/ruby-eastwood-why-would-anyone-choose-to-live-in-a-city-as-ridiculous-as-dublin/
Time Published: 2025-05-31T05:30:00Z
Full Content:
You hear stories about how people survive in this impossibly expensive city. Couples who stay in loveless relationships because they can’t afford to separate. Strangers from Facebook groups sleeping in the same room. A bed rented by one person in the day and a different person at night. Tenants paying their landlords with sex. Artists squatting illegally in their studios. People sleeping in storage units. These stories are full of human ingenuity and degradation. They’re really quite strange when you think about them properly. The strangest part is how common they’ve become. [ Ireland’s rising rents: ‘Our budget would have been €1,300 a month, there isn’t even anything listed for that’Opens in new window ] About a year ago, my best friend in Dublin moved to Berlin, where he says it’s still possible to be broke and live well. When he left his damp, windowless room near Connolly Station – which cost just under a thousand euros a month – there were people queuing for the privilege of being next. Now he lives in a sunlit attic for a fraction of the price, and drinks Fritz Colas and Berliner Pilsners on the rooftop. Every so often, during our calls, he tries to convince me to join him. His logic is hard to fault: Dublin is untenable. Unless you have private wealth or can stomach a corporate job, you resign yourself to chronic financial dread – the kind that squats over your life like Fuseli’s goblin in the painting. At least in other expensive cities, such as New York or London, you can escape your overpriced room into a pulsing metropolis, with endless distractions and some of them free. In Dublin, all you can really do is go to the pub, and even that costs too much. The city is very small, and it seems to constrict as the years pass. You can’t leave the house without seeing a face you know. In fact, there are no faces you don’t know. They approach from all sides. And the rain. The constant rain. I recognise the truth in this, and it’s hard to argue with. Why would anyone choose to live in such a ridiculous city? I don’t know if I really understand my own reasons for staying. I suspect they’re quite shameful: they have more to do with a romantic or aesthetic impulse than with anything practical. I just like Dublin. I like the harsh beaches and the Martello towers. The silvery, rinsed-out light. I like walking through the sprawling industrial wastelands on the city’s fringes. I like the canals in spring, all fragrant with weeds and strewn with sunk bicycles. Strangers here seem to want to tell you things – like the old lady who, for no discernible reason, wanted to talk about the time she heard Bob Marley singing Redemption Song at Dalymount Park. You witness things. Once, on Talbot Street, I saw a man with an arm in a cast get into a physical fight with a man on crutches. I like Dublin on the rare occasions when it snows. I like the hot, malty smell from the Guinness factory. I like the Liberties, where you can hear the quiet rush of subterranean rivers, and church bells, and horses’ hooves. I like that ugly statue of Oscar Wilde with the pervert’s smile. I even like the loud, sentimental music on Grafton Street, and the whiskey-soaked ballads streaming from the pubs in Temple Bar. The idea of leaving Dublin becomes more, not less, appealing as I become more entrenched here ... we can weather all sorts of adversity, but banal contentment is the real deadener Mainly, though, I like Dublin because I chose it. The first time I visited, I was 21. I had some half-baked but very attractive notion of what Ireland represented: something to do with resistance, with migration and nostalgia and alcoholism. I had a copy of Finnegans Wake and I think I got about three pages in on the bus ride into town before falling asleep. When I woke up, I scrambled off and left the book behind. I had oysters for lunch that day and pictured my whole life in the city. It felt just the right size to make mine. I’ve lived in bigger cities: Barcelona, where I grew up, and London, where I lived before coming here; and smaller, random places: Brighton, Siena. I’ve spoken to quite a few Dubliners who are desperate to move to other European cities and can’t understand my decision to stay. There’s a kind of faith involved in choosing a city. You respond to its atmosphere, its pace and texture, the way it opens up to you – or doesn’t. Dublin, for all its flaws, felt like it might yield something if I stayed long enough. The beginning in a new place is always the hardest part: slow, bitty, full of doubts. I didn’t know anyone. I’d been accepted into a master’s programme but couldn’t fund it and had to defer my place by a year. When my sublet ended, I had to return to London for a while because I couldn’t find another room. I worked in bars and signed up with a temp agency that sent me on scattershot catering shifts around the city. The jobs were mostly tedious, but they offered a kind of education. I learned how the different bits of the city fit together, like a giant jigsaw. The glassy conference rooms down by the Quays. The Leopardstown racecourse, where West End men come on weekends to get extravagantly drunk. The grand Georgian hotels and restaurants, where they throw out so much good food it makes you want to cry. The methadone clinic at the end of the bus line where you hear the wildest conversations and sometimes get drawn in. [ Dublin: The 13th best city in the world ... supposedlyOpens in new window ] It occurs to me that the difficulty of establishing yourself in a city confers a special kind of meaning on your relationship to it. Like in a toxic romance, if you can weather the lows, the highs are incredible. Who knows – maybe the expensiveness and impossibility of a place like Dublin, far from being deterrents, actually deepen its appeal, the way we fetishise designer handbags but never their identical fakes. I’ve always had this wrong-headed idea that the value of something is revealed by the sting of its attendant sacrifice. Gradually, my life in Dublin took on more solidity. I was lucky enough to receive a university grant. I met people. I signed a lease. I moved in with a friend and we painted all the walls fresh white. She bought velvet floral curtains in pastel colours and hung them in the livingroom. I found a few prints in charity shops. I got a Persian carpet from a lady in Blackrock Market. A friend gave me a desk she no longer needed. Sometimes the city sends you little signs of progress. The quiet, stoical man in the corner shop at the end of my road has started calling me “honey”, and occasionally smiles. I have a friend’s spare keys on my keyring. I know the name of my neighbour’s dog. I know which cobbler to go to for the best deal. Still, there are days when I fantasise about leaving. It would be nice to buy lunch in a cafe without feeling frivolous. It would be wonderful not to feel like I’m stuck in a recurring nightmare every time rent comes around. Oddly, the idea of leaving Dublin becomes more, not less, appealing as I become more entrenched here. Maybe that’s no coincidence. To return to the toxic romance analogy: we can weather all sorts of adversity, but banal contentment is the real deadener. Recently, I spoke to a friend in London who’s moving to Iowa City for a master of fine arts degree. He told me he’s spent hours on Google Maps, exploring the place through Street View. The images all seem to have been captured on sunny days – it looks green and beautiful, full of classic American wood-frame houses. He’s begun to associate the town with Iowa Dream by Arthur Russell, all melodic guitar lines and soft lyrics. The self he pictured living there was different from the one he knows in London: less anxious, more social, content to spend long afternoons drifting around and hanging out with friends. [ Trevor White: I love Dublin. But there’s no point in pretending it’s a great small cityOpens in new window ] I also indulge in this kind of cartographic dreaming. I explore prospective cities on Street View: Beirut, Paris, Berlin. It’s a surreal activity. You pick a spot on the map and drag yourself along, imagining a parallel life. Sometimes, from one click to the next, the sun disappears and rain slicks the tarmac. Figures with blurred faces vanish or are replaced by others in different clothes further down the road. You realise the map is stitched together from footage taken on different days, in different moods. Another thing my friend hinted at stayed with me: that emigration can be indistinguishable from escapism. When I imagine myself in another city, I don’t picture myself as I am now, but a physically and intellectually tweaked version. In Paris, I’m gaunt with a perfect bob; I smoke straights and read Lacan for pleasure. In Beirut, I am somehow fluent in Arabic; I drink less; I am sharper and more spiritual. I study ancient manuscripts. In Berlin, I am reunited with my best friend and we live together like Robert Mapplethorpe and Patti Smith before it all fell apart, looking cool and making great art. The fantasy isn’t really about the new city. It’s about becoming a new person. [ Emer McLysaght: Five lessons Dublin can learn from ZurichOpens in new window ] There’s a way of reading this that feels a little bleak. You could say it reflects a kind of ambient self-disgust, or an inability to accept life as it is. A symptom of being stuck in the wheel of samsara: trapped in a cycle of craving and disappointment, forever projecting some improved self just over the horizon, never quite admitting that the old self follows you everywhere. There’s truth in that, but it’s not the whole story. There’s another, more generous way to see it. Maybe it isn’t escapism, but a kind of unconscious recognition that we are always in the process of becoming. Cities aren’t just stages on which our lives play out. They are the biggest collaborators. They shape how we speak, how we move, how we think. They alter our trajectories. When you choose to stay in a place, you’re submitting to its influence. To live in a city is to enter into a kind of contract. You agree to spend your time, your energy, and your labour in its service. In return, it promises transformation, but on its own terms. Like the enchanted gift in a fairy tale, the city will change you in ways you can’t predict, and not all of them will be kind. The point is you don’t get to choose. It’s a gamble. Is it one worth taking? Ruby Eastwood is a writer living in Dublin © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Financials Shift from ‘Green’ Agenda to Greenbacks

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change By Vijay Jayaraj In a slow but steady retreat, the world’s most powerful financial institutions are abandoning their once-lauded climate pledges in the beginning of a long-overdue correction. From BlackRock’s quiet exit to the mass defection of U.S. banking giants, the climate bandwagon is losing passengers. And what replaces it could finally bring a necessary focus on real-world developmental finance for both Western economies and the Global South. In 2024, the U.S. banking sector staged a collective retreat from the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). Exiting the alliance were six of America’s largest banks – Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase. Their reasons: legal and fiduciary concerns, coupled with mounting pressure from Republican-led states accusing the banks of violating antitrust laws by coordinating climate policies that could limit the financing of fossil fuel enterprises. Wells Fargo went further, explicitly dropping its pledge to achieve “net-zero” and stating it would instead “meet clients where they are in their chosen energy and transition strategies.” HSBC diluted its 2050 goals, acknowledging the impracticality of abrupt decarbonization. In January, BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager with approximately $11.5 trillion under management – left the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. BlackRock’s exit was a body blow to Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), the U.N.-backed coalition launched in 2021 to align institutions with decarbonization goals. These reversals coincided with Trump-era policy shifts: rescinding clean energy subsidies, green-lighting fossil fuels and prioritizing energy security. Republican-led lawsuits, such as the one filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, alleged that climate-focused investment strategies suppress industries like coal. These political headwinds have made finance executives wary of aligning with the likes of GFANZ On April 29, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) quietly abandoned its $500 billion commitment to decarbonization efforts. The reason? Canada’s updated Competition Act now treats exaggerated environmental claims as potential greenwashing – a criminal offense. The delicious irony is that this announcement came just one day after Mark Carney – former U.N. climate finance czar and a founder of GFANZ – was elected Prime Minister of Canada. Carney’s GFANZ, launched at COP26, boasted 450 firms managing $130 trillion. Today, it’s a ghost town. RBC’s exit epitomizes the alliance’s collapse. GFANZ demanded banks phase out fossil fuels. Instead, banks phased out GFANZ. RBC said the new legal framework made it “infeasible” to quantify progress on the goal without risking regulatory breaches. The entire edifice of net-zero commitments – built on ambiguous projections and unverifiable metrics – has begun to collapse under the weight of the laws meant to enforce them. Crying “betrayal,” critics of banks and asset managers departing climate coalitions lament a “backward slide.” But how could regulating atmospheric CO₂ reasonably be the job of your neighborhood bank? Wall Street was never meant to be an environmental regulator. It is supposed to allocate capital where it generates value. And the green agenda, riddled with faulty science, speculative technologies and political overreach, simply does not qualify as valuable. The green exodus has exposed the folly of policymakers at the U.N. and other global institutions that coerced financial giants into a quixotic crusade bereft of rationality. The world’s big banks have handed nearly $7 trillion in funding to the fossil fuel industry since 2016, the year when the Paris Agreement was formed to decapitate fossil fuel expansion. Critics decried this as an abandonment of climate goals, but for 2.2 billion households globally, it meant affordable energy and economic stability. The exit from climate politics heralds a crucial return to prioritizing genuine economic development. Sluggishness in many Western economies is, in part, a consequence of misallocation by climate hysteria. Some have questioned whether this shift is permanent, noting the powerful political forces that have driven the climate industrial complex may be disinclined to surrender. However, there is no doubt that to the extent financial institutions unshackle themselves from impractical climate pledges, they can refocus on supporting innovation, infrastructure and industries that generate real growth and jobs. This commentary was first published at RealClearEnergy on May 28, 2025. Vijay Jayaraj is a Science and Research Associate at the CO₂ Coalition, Arlington, Virginia. He holds an M.S. in environmental sciences from the University of East Anglia and a postgraduate degree in energy management from Robert Gordon University, both in the U.K., and a bachelor’s in engineering from Anna University, India.

The people that Reeves is most likely to target https://inews.co.uk/news/tax-rises-reeves-most-likely-target-3718040 Yes. A whole lotta evidence-free speculation. I would bet they’ll just borrow the shortfalls, and leave it as a problem for the next government. UK’s Government borrowed £150,000 million in the 12 months to the end of April 2025. So they – and their predecessor, the Useless Tories – are already borrowing substantially. Interest is the 12 months to end March 2025 was £109,000 million, so they’re already borrowing to pay the interest. Borrowing to pay the interest bill rarely ends well. . . . Auto 150,000 million = 150,000,000,000,000. That is 150 trillion and does not seem right. A thousand million is a billion, and a million million is a trillion. Therefore 150,000 million is 150 billion. 150,000 million does not equal 150,000,000,000,000. A million is 6 zeros, not 9. This is the lawsuit being formed against them. https://app.screencast.com/ZMpNTvkLD7DDJ Imagine being a finance MBA trying to explain to a judge this science and why they were so willing to put other people’s money to back this nonsense. https://app.screencast.com/DFd1viHxsRjq7 Countless investors were defrauded into funding this political agenda. In conclusion, a clear message emerges from our analysis: those who viewed responsible investing as the definitive solution to address sustainability issues in the corporate world may need to reconsider. While responsible investing has clear merits and can lead to positive impacts, our research highlights the importance of scrutiny and regulation to disentangle true sustainability from greenwashing. https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/smoke-and-mirrors-look-inside-esg-fund-portfolios Wall Street Firms deliberately ignored the political risks of these investments. https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/chris-wright-department-of-energy-carbon-capture/2025/05/30/id/1213033/ None of these Green Industries were self sustaining and yet Wall Street poured billions of other people’s money into them. “Imagine being a finance MBA trying to explain to a judge this science and why they were so willing to put other people’s money to back this nonsense.” First I’d have to imagine a judge that was listening. If they have a talent it would be figuring out what I’m going to say in the next 2 hours during the first 2 minutes. ‘They’ really believed they could entice/force people off the living standard cliff to bankrupt Capitalism. They bought the media and drove it into the ground with lies and thought they could sustain the lies and people wouldn’t care their lives were upended and deteriorating. Now their media is unbelievable and worthless. Couldn’t happen to a nicer bunch of Marxists. It’s good to see the big banks and investment institutions coming to their senses by realizing their clients are concerned primarily with steady returns. As long as the money isn’t being used to finance the sex trade, recreational drug production, and illegal arms smuggling, they don’t want to see it being used to prop up fashionable social and environmental issues like supposedly fighting the mythical climate crisis. And when they’re informed that despite billions in subsidies for renewable energy initiatives, fossil fuels still provide 82% of the world’s primary energy, they realize that using their investment proceeds to prop up wind and solar is a classic case of backing the wrong horse. In the situation with Mark Carney, he knew the only way to win the recent Canadian election was to dump the much-reviled carbon tax that was just increasing living costs while having an almost-imperceptible impact on reducing national emissions. Ah yes, it looks like the plutes are finally drifting away from climate madness, and following Marcus Aurelius’s advice: “The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.” Login Sign up to comment or become a paid supporter: Click Here “Walk toward the fire.
