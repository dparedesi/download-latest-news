Title: Nvidia plans large-scale investment in US chip manufacturing over four years

Nvidia is reportedly planning a significant investment in semiconductor production and electronic components within the US. Over the next four years, total spending is expected to reach approximately $500bn, according to reporting by the Financial Times. Huang, in an interview with the publication, indicated that a substantial portion of this investment could be directed towards domestic chip production. He suggested that the Trump administration may play a role in accelerating the growth of the AI industry in the US by supporting manufacturing initiatives. Nvidia has been addressing investor concerns about continued demand for its high-cost AI chips, particularly amid increased competition. This follows the launch of a chatbot by China’s DeepSeek, which reportedly operates with fewer AI chips, raising questions about potential shifts in the AI hardware market. Huang has confirmed that Nvidia’s latest AI systems can now be manufactured in the US through partnerships with major suppliers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Foxconn. He noted that TSMC’s investment in US-based manufacturing represents a significant step towards strengthening supply chain resilience, reducing dependency on overseas production, and ensuring steady access to critical semiconductor components. The company’s expansion strategy comes at a time of heightened global competition in the AI sector, particularly from Chinese technology firms. Nvidia has acknowledged Huawei’s growing influence in the market, underscoring the need for continuous investment in advanced chip production and infrastructure to maintain its leadership position. At the company’s developer conference in California on Wednesday, Huang told analysts that demand for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI chips could be significantly higher than current projections. He noted that orders for 3.6 million units from four major cloud firms underestimated overall market demand, as they did not account for purchases from Meta Platforms, smaller cloud providers, or AI-focused startups. Beyond manufacturing, Nvidia is expanding its role in AI infrastructure development through its participation in the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP). The consortium, which includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft, and MGX, aims to drive investment in AI-ready data centres and energy infrastructure. Initially, AIP plans to unlock $30bn in capital, with total investment potential reaching $100bn when including debt financing. Nvidia will continue to serve as a technical advisor to AIP, leveraging its expertise in AI computing and data centre infrastructure. The initiative is expected to foster collaboration across a diverse network of investors, corporations, and technology firms, focusing on scalable AI solutions. AIP’s investments will be primarily directed toward the US and partner countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Last month, Nvidia forecasted revenue of approximately $43bn for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, surpassing market expectations. The company expects gross margins to be around 70.6%, with operating expenses estimated at $5.2bn on a GAAP basis. It also anticipates additional income of approximately $400m, excluding gains and losses from equity securities. Give your business an edge with our leading Tech Monitor

Title: Buyout Firm CVC Eyes US Private Credit in Expansion Drive

CVC Capital Partners Plc has identified private credit in the US as an area for potential acquisitions, according to Chief Executive Officer Rob Lucas. There are “huge opportunities” for CVC in private wealth and insurance business, Lucas said during a media call on Thursday after the company posted its full-year earnings . “We have consistently said that if the right opportunity to build our business inorganically, arises, then we are very open to that and we will look carefully at those opportunities,” Lucas said. “We have in the past identified US private credit as as one of those areas.” Bloomberg News reported this week that CVC is interested in acquiring Fortress Investment Corp. and has held talks with Fortress and majority owner, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co., though discussions aren’t active at the moment. CVC had also expressed interest in a potential combination with HPS Investment Partners before BlackRock Inc. agreed to buy HPS in a $12 billion all-stock deal in December. Insurance business is another focus of growth for CVC, which has raised more than €15 billion of capital from insurance clients over the past five years. Insurers are keen to tie up with private markets operators to help manage the assets on their balance sheets, according to Fred Watt, CVC’s chief financial officer. “It’s something we look at,” Watt said. “We’re well placed to do that and we can see why insurance companies are interested in in that sort of arrangement.” Market Dislocation CVC made €1.33 billion in management fees last year, beating analyst estimates of €1.23 billion, its latest earnings showed. Its assets under management totaled €200 billion at the end of 2024. The private equity firm said it has €40 billion of capital available to deploy across all its strategies. It expects “strong growth” in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2025. Shares of CVC rose as much as 4.8% Thursday, the most since Dec. 12. The stock has fallen about 7% this year, giving the company a market value of around €21 billion. Recent market volatility and geopolitical concerns have sapped dealmaking activity globally. Initial public offerings have slowed as well. The private equity owners of Stada Arzneimittel AG have decided to push back the German drugmaker’s IPO until September, Bloomberg News reported this week. German regional lender Oldenburgische Landesbank AG has abandoned plans for an IPO and will instead be sold to a subsidiary of France’s Crédit Mutuel Alliance Fédérale. CVC, however, views volatility as an opportunity, according to Lucas. “We thrive in periods of change,” he said. ‘The last time, we saw something like this, I suppose would be in the market dislocations post the global financial crisis,” CVC’s Watt added. “I can think of many examples in those periods where we were one of the few buyers of assets. And we can see that happening as we speak.” ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Photo Credit: Unsplash/ Markus Winkler Tech companies are deploying thousands of chips in clusters to meet AI-related energy demands Nvidia and Elon Musk's xAI have joined a consortium backed by Microsoft, investment fund MGX and BlackRock to expand AI infrastructure in the US, the companies said on Wednesday, as a global race to dominate the nascent technology intensifies. The group, formed last year with a goal to initially invest more than $30 billion (roughly Rs. 2,58,984 crore) in AI-related projects, is one of the biggest efforts to bankroll data centers and energy facilities needed to power AI applications such as ChatGPT. The additions come two months after US President Donald Trump announced Stargate, a private sector AI infrastructure initiative backed by SoftBank Group, OpenAI, and Oracle, with plans to mobilise up to $500 billion (roughly Rs. 43,16,626 crore). Investors have committed $100 billion (roughly Rs. 8,63,500 crore) for immediate deployment, with the rest expected over the next four years. The consortium - which includes BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners - on Wednesday renamed itself as AI Infrastructure Partnership. Nvidia, a technical advisor, will continue in the role. Training AI models and large-scale data processing require huge computational power, which increases energy consumption. To meet the demands, tech companies are deploying thousands of chips in clusters, driving a surge for specialised data centers. To fund the computing and power needs, the consortium has been looking to raise money from investors, asset owners and corporations, with a goal to mobilise up to $100 billion (roughly Rs. 8,63,500 crore), including debt financing. "AIP has attracted significant capital and partner interest since its inception in September," the group said, but did not disclose the total funds raised so far. GE Vernova and utility firm NextEra Energy will also be a part of the group, it said, adding the renewable energy company will work on supply-chain planning and high efficiency energy solutions. AIP said its investments will also focus on US partners and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. © Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Title: Panama ports deal: Who is billionaire Li Ka-shing? How did Hong Kong's richest man anger China?

United States President Donald Trump is reportedly “very pleased” with the sale of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings' Panama ports assets to a consortium that includes US investing giant BlackRock. Amid lashing from Chinese media for “disloyalty” and CK Hutchison's defence that the transaction was purely commercial in nature, we take a look at who Li Ka-shing is, and why Beijing is displeased and the significance of Li Ka-shing's Panama deal amid US-China tensions and Donald Trump's tariff wars. ‘Rags-to-riches’ business mogul,96-year-old Li Ka-shing built Hong Kong's prestigious CK Hutchison Holdings, according to an AP report. He is the richest man in the region and among the top 50 richest in the world according to Forbes. The publication puts his net worth at $38 billion. While Li retired from his post of Chairman in 2018 and was suceeded by his son, the billionaire, nicknamed “Superman” is still among the region's most influencial figures, the AP report added. He rose to prominence from the former British colony to expand interests in real estate, telecom, supermarkets and utilities. The company also operates Superdrug (British chemist franchise) and Three (European mobile network firm), the report added. Li is now in the spotlight since his company's deal (announced on March 4) to sell its subsidiaries' ports in the Panama Canal — an asset it had held since 1997. The biggest rub is that the buyer is a consortium that includes US investment firm BlackRock and comes while US President Donald Trump has accused China of interfearing in the Panama Canal. Li is not a stranger to Beijing's reach in Hong Kong — he was part of the committee that helped select the financial hub's new leader when it was brought under administrative control of China, the report said. The past week has seen local media outlets push criticism against the deal sourced to Beijing's local affairs office, the report noted. And while Chinese leaders acknowledge that support for local business tycoons can help preserve Hong Kong's capitalistic system, Li who has lent has influence, is not free from criticism. In 2015, Li faced accusations of “immorality” for selling assets in mainland China; then in 2019 during the pro-democracy protests some in Beijing were unhappy by his “percieved ambivalence”. Now in 2025, the Panama posts deal has opened a can of worms. Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed he would seize control of the Panama Canal, which is a key global trade channel. The ports held by CK Holdings are on each end of the Canal and strategically important. US-based BlackRock having some control over its operations has been music to Donald Trump's ears. But China is fuming. The nearly $23 billion deal, will give the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. In its commentary, a Beijing-backed newspaper termed the deal a “betrayal of all Chinese” and asked to company to choose a side and warned against “dance with” US politicians. AP cited some local reports say that Chinese leaders were also angered about not being consulted before the deal was made, given that ports are a strategic asset and make for sensitive transactions on a good day. At present it is unclear whether China will pull the plug on this deal and the country's foreign ministry did not respond to questions about investigations into the matter. Wilson Chan, co-founder of the Pagoda Institute, a think tank focusing on public policy and the global political economy, told the agency that cancelling the deal now would be risky. “Strictly speaking, you just let Trump take credit for it, then you later say ‘Sorry, I’m canceling the deal.’ You can imagine what Trump’s reaction would be,” he said. Longer term, while Li could try to make good with Chinese leaders, and use the money from the deal for investments in the mainland, relations between companies and the government may still be rough, the report noted. "If Beijing steps up pressure on Li to scrap the Panama deal, the Trump administration could hit back with more sanctions and restrictions on Hong Kong and Chinese businesses and some individuals. The situation shows that Washington’s concerns about Hong Kong's business autonomy are valid. This is bad when it comes to the defense of ‘one country, two systems,’” George Chen, managing director for Hong Kong at The Asia Group, a Washington-headquartered business and policy consulting firm told AP.

Title: Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, is in hot water

Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s business empire is in the crosshairs after CK Hutchison Holdings chose to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., apparently angering Beijing HONG KONG -- Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s business empire is in the crosshairs after CK Hutchison Holdings chose to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., apparently angering Beijing. Over the past week, Beijing's Hong Kong affairs offices have posted scathing commentaries from a local state-backed media outlet over the tentative deal by Hutchison, which is controlled by Li’s family. That raises questions about the deal and highlights the difficulties Hong Kong businesses face as they balance demands from Beijing for national loyalty and their own capitalist interests in the once free-wheeling Asian financial hub. Here's what to know about the issue. Nicknamed “Superman,” Li is among the world’s 50 richest people, with Forbes calculating his net worth at $38 billion. Li, 96, retired from his position as chairman of CK Hutchison in 2018, succeeded by his elder son Victor. But he's still one of Hong Kong's most influential figures. Li's rags-to-riches story paralleled the former British colony’s rise. His business empire touches almost every aspect of daily life in Hong Kong, from properties and supermarkets to telecommunications and utilities. Globally, his conglomerate owns assets including British drugstore chain Superdrug and European mobile phone network operator Three. A Hutchison subsidiary has operated ports at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997. That was one reason U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged Chinese interference with the critical shipping lane's operations. Li’s influence extends beyond business. He has met with top Chinese leaders and has served on the elite committee that selected Hong Kong’s leader. Experts on ties between Beijing and Hong Kong said ruling Communist Party leaders once understood that support from the business sector was crucial for maintaining Hong Kong’s capitalist system. It's has been strategically vital for mainland China’s economy, given the role their global networks and resources play in the country’s development. So, Li has had notable political influence. But Li has faced criticism over some business decisions. When he sold off some mainland Chinese assets in 2015, an article published by a think tank affiliated with Chinese official news agency Xinhua accused him of being immoral. During pro-democracy protests in 2019, Li was blasted by some pro-Beijing supporters for his perceived ambivalence about the unrest. Some other Hong Kong business leaders adopted a harsher stance. CK Hutchison announced March 4 that it would sell all its shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium that also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, which is chaired by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte, whose family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with Li’s. If approved, the deal, valued at nearly $23 billion including $5 billion in debt, will give the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. The transaction does not include ports in Hong Kong or mainland China. CK Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial in nature. The deal pleased Trump but angered Beijing. One of the Beijing-backed newspaper commentaries described the deal as a betrayal of all Chinese and said the company should think about which side to take. The other said great entrepreneurs are patriots, suggesting that businesspeople who “dance with” predatory American politicians would be doomed to infamy. Comments on popular posts about the deal on Chinese social media platform Weibo tend to be more critical than favorable toward Li. Chief Executive John Lee avoided direct criticism of the deal or Trump, but told reporters on Tuesday his government opposes bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations, reiterating Beijing's stance. Some unconfirmed reports have suggested Chinese leaders were angry not to have been consulted in advance about the deal. George Chen, managing director for Hong Kong at The Asia Group, a Washington-headquartered business and policy consulting firm, said Beijing may have been disappointed because it had almost no time to devise a response in advance. Ports are valuable strategic assets and transactions involving them are always sensitive, said Wilson Chan, co-founder of the Pagoda Institute, a think tank focusing on public policy and the global political economy. It is unclear whether pressure from Beijing will affect the deal, which has to be approved by Panama's government. China’s Foreign Ministry deflected a question about whether authorities are investigating the deal, saying reporters should ask other authorities. CK Hutchison has not commented on the controversy. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it was not planning a news conference. Cancelling the deal would be risky, Chan said. “Strictly speaking, you just let Trump take credit for it, then you later say ‘Sorry, I’m canceling the deal.’ You can imagine what Trump’s reaction would be,” he said, adding that would also affect how the outside world views Hong Kong businesses. The first Trump administration sanctioned Chinese and Hong Kong officials for undermining the autonomy of the territory promised when Britain handed its colony to Beijing in 1997 under a concept dubbed “One country, two systems.” It promised the city could keep its Western-style civil liberties and economic autonomy for at least 50 years, but following the 2019 protests, Beijing has doubled-down on its political control of the city. Li could try to placate critics who deem him insufficiently patriotic, Chan said, by using proceeds from selling the port assets for investments aligned with Beijing’s policies, particularly in developing Hong Kong and mainland port businesses. But relations between private businesses and Beijing remain uncertain, said The Asia Group's Chen. Even though Chinese President Xi Jinping recently met with private sector business leaders in a show of support, some may wonder if they must follow the party line even if that might conflict with their business interests, he said. If Beijing steps up pressure on Li to scrap the deal, the Trump administration could hit back with more sanctions and restrictions on Hong Kong and Chinese businesses and some individuals, he said. The situation shows that Washington’s concerns about Hong Kong's business autonomy are valid, Chen said. “This is bad when it comes to the defense of ‘one country, two systems,’” Chen said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Bitcoin Price Still Ignores Wall Street Demand, BlackRock Exec Warns
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-ignores-wall-street-demand-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-03-20T05:00:29Z
Full Content:
In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Robbie Mitchnick—Global Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock—addressed Bitcoin’s recent stagnation and shared why he believes institutional demand may be stronger than its price implies. Despite significant hopes pinned on regulatory developments and a “crypto-friendly” turn at the White House, Bitcoin has spent the early months of 2025 hovering around the mid-$80,000 range, prompting questions about what catalysts might drive the next price rally. Mitchnick acknowledged that Bitcoin started showing considerable strength toward the end of 2024. “Bitcoin is still up, let’s call it 15% or so since the beginning of November,” he noted. This rally, he explained, was fueled by a combination of institutional interest and optimism surrounding potential government endorsement by the Trump administration. However, he cautioned that “accelerated, perhaps premature expectations of just how quickly some of these catalysts would start to arrive” might have contributed to the market’s more recent price stagnation. According to Mitchnick, many investors and traders anticipated an immediate spike following the White House’s pro-crypto moves. When those gains failed to materialize, some short-term participants began unwinding positions, contributing to downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. BlackRock made headlines with its Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, widely recognized for bringing a new wave of institutional exposure to the crypto market. Even so, Mitchnick revealed that inflows have softened: “2024 was pretty incredible, pretty historic on that front. 2025 to start has been more negative. We’ve seen some outflows in the category—relatively modest in the context of the overall asset base, which is close to $100 billion.” He attributed this downturn mostly to hedge funds unwinding a spot–futures arbitrage trade that had “double-digit” yields in 2024 but has since dipped into the single digits. Mitchnick underscored that these outflows are mainly from short-term traders, rather than the more traditional “buy-and-hold” investor base. A central question raised in the interview was why Bitcoin has not acted as a safe haven—similar to gold—despite persistent economic uncertainty. While gold has rallied on investor concerns about the economy, Bitcoin has not mirrored that trajectory. Mitchnick suggested that this discrepancy stems from market psychology and what he called “short-term correlation spikes.” “Bitcoin fundamentally on a long-term basis … should be uncorrelated or even inversely correlated against certain risk factors … But now it’s been extrapolated to things that don’t really make any sense at all—tariffs, economic fears—and the market’s commentary doesn’t reflect what Bitcoin fundamentally is,” Mitchnick said. He went on to emphasize Bitcoin’s unique attributes—its scarcity, decentralized nature, and existence “outside of any one country’s economic, political, or monetary system.” Over the long term, Mitchnick sees these properties as justifying Bitcoin’s “digital gold” comparison, but concedes that investor behavior often treats it as a high-volatility, “risk-on” asset in the short run. When asked about the US government’s stance—particularly in light of a Trump administration authorization for a strategic Bitcoin reserve—Mitchnick was cautious, noting that “a lot still [remains] to be determined on that front.” He emphasized that: “What we have clearly seen is a pretty emphatic signal of support and conviction in this industry and particularly in Bitcoin and Bitcoin’s uniqueness … Whether and on what timeline … that might be funded, there’s a few different sources … but it’s certainly not the only source of adoption catalyst in 2025.” Although speculation is building around whether the government will officially begin stockpiling Bitcoin, Mitchnick stressed that the broader institutional and wealth advisory community continues accumulating positions. These investors, in his view, remain “very excited” by current market conditions despite the recent downturn. Mitchnick also addressed recent headwinds, including the ByBit hack that briefly dampened market sentiment. He suggested that heightened volatility can shake short-term traders out of the market, but longer-term, more sophisticated holders often see price dips as buying opportunities. According to Mitchnick: “Some of them were taking chips off the table a little bit in the [$100,000] range … Now they see this correction and a lot of them view it as sort of an irrational selloff … We’re trying to bring some quantitative rigor to that as well.” At press time, BTC traded at $84,197.

Title: Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz61vwjel2zo

"This has been our family car for three years, and it has been an absolute dream," says Ben Kilbey as he shows me his gleaming pearl-white Tesla Model Y. Ben is a staunch electric car advocate. He runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK. Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go – because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees. "I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness," he says. "There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement." Ben is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending. Musk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer. For some who do not share his views, it has all become too much. There have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal. Although most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire. In the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps. US President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as "domestic terrorism". Musk has also been unequivocal in his response. "This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong," he said in a recent interview with Fox News. "Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks." What is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers. And if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm? Two decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical. Musk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence. "Tesla was the pioneer," says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. "They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness." It is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth. Nowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless "robotaxis". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus. Like the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts. But recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges. Although its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million. The decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down. This year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February – although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% – as well as in Australia. Meanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month. In early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day – adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year. Sales can fall for many reasons, and people within Tesla have suggested that a drop in sales was to be expected as the company geared up for the launch of the new Model Y – with potential customers holding off for the latest version. But research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada – although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets. In the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: "Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago." Tesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales. But experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO. To start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market. "If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche," says Ms Valdez Streaty. "They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there." Prof Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: "We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem." Competition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars. At the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology. "China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs," says Ms Valdez Streaty. "You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well." The extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes – significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network. Musk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles. In January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time. In 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's "Full Self Driving" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a "hands-on" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times. "Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from," says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy. Arguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket. Asked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded "with great difficulty". "It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk," says Prof Wells. "If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly." Ever since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake – currently worth more than $95bn. That is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes. For those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation. Today, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings – a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth. "Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles – which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers – or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles," says Mr Nagley. None of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment – although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down. But analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. "A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now," says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research. "It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand." "I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment." says Prof Wells. "I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business. "It needs a significant change of direction now."

Title: Nvidia, xAI and two energy giants join genAI infrastructure initiative
URL: https://www.networkworld.com/article/3849735/nvidia-xai-and-two-energy-giants-join-genai-infrastructure-initiative.html
Time Published: 2025-03-19T22:49:34Z
Full Content:
An industry generative artificial intelligence (genAI) alliance, the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), on Wednesday announced that xAI, Nvidia, GE Vernova, and NextEra Energy were joining BlackRock, Microsoft, and Global Infrastructure Partners as members. But given that the announcement specified no financial commitments or any other details, analysts doubted it would make much of a difference. Still, even though the massive global momentum behind genAI is unlikely to be changed by the announcement, the addition of the two energy companies to the group was an implicit acknowledgement that the ever-increasing power requirements of genAI data centers need serious attention. Scott Bickley, advisory fellow at Info-Tech Research Group, said that the massive resources behind this initiative, including Blackrock, which reported in January that it held assets worth $11.6 trillion, making it the world’s largest money manager, can make the difference. “When deep pockets like Blackrock get involved at scale, it matters,” Bickley said. “This particular news release doesn’t specify any dollar amounts. However, we can infer from the players involved and the scale of AI investments that this will be a massive initiative that will move the needle in the AI infrastructure space.” Forrester senior analyst Alvin Nguyen was more skeptical. “The problem is that this has all been done by PR. So what is real and what is true isn’t obvious, at least not to me. I think it changes nothing.” The statement from the group said it was changing its name from the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership to the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP). This initiative is not to be confused with another genAI effort called Stargate, which is backed by the US government and focuses on explicitly combatting China’s genAI efforts. The new AIP members will “further strengthen the partnership’s technology leadership as the platform seeks to invest in new and expanded AI infrastructure. Nvidia will also continue in its role as a technical advisor to AIP, leveraging its expertise in accelerated computing and AI factories to inform the deployment of next-generation AI data center infrastructure,” the group’s statement said. “Additionally, GE Vernova and NextEra Energy have agreed to collaborate with AIP to accelerate the scaling of critical and diverse energy solutions for AI data centers. GE Vernova will also work with AIP and its partners on supply chain planning and in delivering innovative and high efficiency energy solutions.” The group claimed, without offering any specifics, that it “has attracted significant capital and partner interest since its inception in September 2024, highlighting the growing demand for AI-ready data centers and power solutions.” The statement said the group will try to raise “$30 billion in capital from investors, asset owners, and corporations, which in turn will mobilize up to $100 billion in total investment potential when including debt financing.” Forrester’s Nguyen also noted that the influence of two of the new members — xAI, owned by Elon Musk, along with Nvidia — could easily help with fundraising. Musk “with his connections, he does not make small quiet moves,” Nguyen said. “As for Nvidia, they are the face of AI. Everything they do attracts attention.” Info-Tech’s Bickley said that the astronomical dollars involved in genAI investments is mind-boggling. And yet even more investment is needed — a lot more. “We are currently witnessing a generational level of investment in AI never seen before. Only the entities — sovereign wealth funds, major corporations, governments, hedge funds — can even play in this game,” Bickley said. “At the infrastructure level, this may parallel what we have seen in the 5G space, which has become the current standard for communications networks but has not lived up to expectations on performance and ROI. Investments in 5G have now eclipsed $700B, but has your cell phone experience changed materially over the past few years? Ultimately, these mega projects will be good for IT leaders and, in general, as they will facilitate energy infrastructure buildout, drive efficiencies and innovation, and ultimately make the core AI horsepower a commodity.” Evan Schuman has covered IT issues for a lot longer than he'll ever admit.

In an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box, BlackRock Digital Asset Head Robert Mitchnick said the cryptocurrency industry has promoted the idea that Bitcoin is a risk-on asset, despite the fact the token is “global, scarce, non- sovereign, decentralized.” A risk-on asset is an investment such as a stock that poses at least some possibility of financial loss to investors. “What we've seen lately seems to be self- fulfilling and actually a self-inflicted wound by some of the research and commentary that the industry does, leaning into this idea of it as a risk- on asset at times,” Mitchnick told CNBC. U.S. regulators approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds exchange-traded funds early last year, widening institutional investors’ access to the world's oldest cryptocurrency. BlackRock’s application for a bitcoin ETF is widely considered a turning point in issuers’ efforts to win long-sought approval for these funds. BlackRock’s application for a bitcoin ETF is widely considered a turning point in issuers’ efforts to win long-sought approval for these funds. The ETFs now manage about $100 billion in assets with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) controlling $46.5 billion of that total. IBIT reached $10 billion assets faster than any fund in the ETF industry’s 32-year history. That rush of institutional dollars helped catapult Bitcoin to an all-time-high price of over $108,000 late last year. But, the asset's ever-volatile price has fallen more than 20% as investors wrestle with the effects of U.S. President Trump's aggressive tariff policies and the possibility of a recession in the U.S. The funds shed assets for five consecutive weeks amid this price downturn. Mitchnick argued that a steep economic downturn in the U.S. could affect Bitcoin's price “don't really make any sense at all.” “It's not clear that tariffs are a fundamental bad for Bitcoin,” Mitchnick said. “[As for] economic fears, I don't know if we have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin.” And while a potential hike in interest rates might negatively affect Bitcoin's value, the same would be for other asset classes, such as equities, according to Mitchnick. The executive also noted that, despite fears over the effect of macroeconomic uncertainties on the token, it is still up roughly 15% since the beginning of November. “Obviously, 2024 was pretty incredible, pretty historic,” he said. “That fundamentally, we think, is what the long term is. That's why people think of it like digital gold.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: BlackRock exec believes Bitcoin’s price does not reflect its strong institutional demand

BlackRock sees Bitcoin’s scarcity and independence as crucial in buffering against economic downturns. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Institutional investment in Bitcoin (BTC) has strengthened, but its price has struggled to reflect the growing demand, according to BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, Robbie Mitchnick. Despite continued adoption by large financial players, Bitcoin has experienced significant ETF outflows and cautious sentiment in early 2025, which have kept prices below previous highs. Mitchnick noted that short-term market behavior and macroeconomic uncertainty have slowed momentum despite optimism surrounding regulatory shifts in Washington initially drove gains, Speaking with Yahoo Finance on March 18, Mitchnick argued that Bitcoin’s fundamental characteristics — scarcity, decentralization, and independence from traditional monetary systems — position it as a strong hedge against economic downturns. He further suggested that a US recession could serve as a major catalyst for Bitcoin’s next rally. According to Mitchnick: “A recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin. It’s long liquidity, meaning it benefits from increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, and lower interest rates — all typical features of a recessionary environment.” Mitchnick highlighted that while gold has surged to record highs amid growing economic uncertainty, Bitcoin has not yet mirrored that trend. He attributed this divergence to Bitcoin’s short-term trading trends, where it is often treated as a risk-on asset rather than a store of value. Additionally, he explained that recent Bitcoin ETF outflows have been primarily driven by hedge funds unwinding spot-futures arbitrage trades rather than long-term investors exiting the market. He emphasizing that institutional confidence in Bitcoin remains strong despite short-term volatility, saying: “The core long-term holders are still in.” Mitchnick also weighed in on President Donald Trump’s move to establish a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, calling it a strong signal of support for BTC’s unique status within the digital asset space. However, he noted that the specifics of how the government plans to acquire and manage Bitcoin remain unclear, which does not help with the current uncertainty prevalent in the market. Mitchnick also indicated that institutional capital is still flowing into the market. He noted that professional investors appear to be taking advantage of the current dip, with many treating Bitcoin’s price weakness as an accumulation opportunity. He said: “Some of the most sophisticated Bitcoin accumulators we speak with are treating this dip as an opportunity.” Despite ongoing regulatory uncertainties and security concerns in the broader crypto industry, Mitchnick remained optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term role. He also argued that investors will increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional financial instability, potentially driving renewed momentum in the months ahead amid the uncertain economic landscape.

UPDATED 18:18 EDT / MARCH 19 2025 by Maria Deutscher Nvidia Corp. and xAI Corp. have joined a consortium that plans to invest $30 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The companies announced their decision to participate today. In conjunction, the consortium has renamed itself from Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership to AI Infrastructure Partnership, or AIP for short. AIP was launched last September by Microsoft Corp., BlackRock Inc. and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm. BlackRock’s recently acquired GIP subsidiary is also a founding backer. It’s an infrastructure-focused fund that operates assets such as data centers, wind farms and airports. The consortium’s initial goal is to invest more than $30 billion in AI projects. In the longer term, AIP hopes to raise as much as $100 billion from companies and other backers. The consortium disclosed today that the fund has “attracted significant capital and partner interest since its inception in September.” Last year, Microsoft detailed that AIP plans to invest in data centers and energy infrastructure. The fund expects to invest the bulk of its capital in the U.S. Prior to the announcement that Nvidia is joining AIP, the chipmaker was a technical advisor to the consortium. Last year, it agreed to provide technical input on the AI data centers in which the fund will invest. Nvidia plans to continue providing technical advice going forward. “The global buildout of AI infrastructure will benefit every company and country that wants to achieve economic growth and unlock solutions to the world’s greatest challenges,” said Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang. Separately, AIP’s backers today disclosed that GE Vernova Inc. and NextEra Energy Inc. will also work with the consortium. GE Veronva is a supplier of energy generation equipment such as wind turbine engines. It spun off from General Electric Co. last year as part of the latter company’s split into three firms. According to BlackRock, GE Veronva will work with AIP and its partners on supply chain planning initiatives. NextEra Energy, the other company that will collaborate with the consortium, is the largest electric utility in the U.S. It’s the world’s top provider of wind energy. The utility will help “accelerate the scaling of critical and diverse energy solutions for AI data centers.” Several of AIP’s backers are also involved in other AI infrastructure investment initiatives. Last year, Microsoft partnered with utility Constellation Energy Generation LLC to reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. The latter company will invest $1.6 billion to renovate the facility. After it comes online in 2026, the power plant will supply 835,000 megawatts of electricity for Microsoft data centers. Nvidia, meanwhile, is participating in OpenAI’s Stargate Project. The ChatGPT developer and its partners plan to build $500 billion worth of AI infrastructure in the U.S as part of the initiative .

Title: U.S. Says Social Security Recipients Need to Visit Offices to Get Benefits as DOGE Closes Offices Nationwide

As Elon Musk’s DOGE targets the Social Security Administration for cuts and reorganization, the agency is rolling out new rules for benefit recipients that could spur chaos and dysfunction at the agency. This week, the agency announced that it will no longer allow new benefit recipients to verify their identities over the phone. Instead, those participants will either have to use an online ID verification software or, if that doesn’t work, make a visit to a government field office to do it in person. Similarly, returning benefit recipients who want to update their direct deposit information will either have to pass the online ID verification process or visit a government office. “The Social Security Administration (SSA) is taking proactive steps to enhance the security of its services by implementing stronger identity verification procedures,” the agency said, in a press release published Tuesday. “SSA will permit individuals who do not or cannot use the agencyâs online ‘My Social Security’ services to start their claim for benefits on the telephone. However, the claim cannot be completed until the individualâs identity is verified in person. The agency therefore recommends calling to request an in-person appointment to begin and complete the claim in one interaction.” It’s unclear how well the government’s ID verification software works, though it’s worth noting that a Federal Communications Commission report published last year found that between 14 and 24 million Americans still lack access to broadband. A similar report from the AARP found that an estimated 42 percent of older adults (some 22 million people) lack reliable access to the internet. Many elderly Americans may not be “digital natives” and, even if they have internet access, may be bad at navigating websites and digital platforms. A Pew Research survey from 2021 showed that about a quarter of the U.S. population that is 65 or older (i.e., the people most likely to be on social security) report “never going online.” In other words, as the Associated Press has reported, the SSA’s policy shift is likely to force “millions of [social security] recipients and applicants” to visit government offices to get their retirement benefits. That’s really bad news because, as it happens, DOGE has also been targeting SSA field offices across the country for lease termination and closure. Currently, on DOGE’s website, it says that 47 offices across the country have been or will have their leases terminated. Those offices are spread across a variety of states, including many MAGA-heavy places like Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, and North Dakota. Problematically, DOGE has also been working to downsize the SSA’s staff. Indeed, the agency’s new DOGE-linked director reportedly announced plans to halve the agency’s staff in the coming months. It seems reasonable to assume that such a staff reduction would functionally decapitate the government’s ability to dispense benefits, especially at the field offices where recipients must now apparently show up to verify their identities. A recently unearthed memo seemed to show that the SSA’s own staff are aware that the new policies being put in place under the auspices of DOGE could effectively drive down service delivery and cause the agency to slide into dysfunction. The memo notes that the policy changes will create “increased field office traffic,” “longer call wait times,” and “delayed processing” among other negative outcomes. Americans should not be surprised by the policy changes ushered in under the watchful eye of Musk’s government “efficiency” organization. The billionaire has spoken about the program with open hostility, calling it a “Ponzi scheme.” The changes at Social Security also follow on the heels of comments made by Larry Fink, the CEO of mega-corporation BlackRock, who recently expressed interest in privatizing Social Security. “The problem we have now, we have a plan called Social Security that doesnât grow with the economy,” Fink said while speaking with Semafor. “If we create a plan that every American can grow with our economy, theyâre going to feel more attached to our economy,” Fink said, implying that Americans’ retirement funds should be tied up with the stock market.

Title: US spies urged to refocus efforts on America's backyard, new House Intel chair says

DEA assistant special agent in charge David Olesky joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss how Tren de Aragua has infiltrated the nation as the Trump administration cracks down on violent illegal aliens. The two-decade War on Terror in the Middle East has left America overlooking the security issues in its own neighborhood, at least according to the House’s new Intelligence Chair Rick Crawford, R-Ark. "We were so focused on the global war on terror, what that's done is opened up opportunities for countries like China," the Arkansas Republican told a small group of reporters as he laid out his priorities for the committee. "But even going back before China, you know, obviously the Russians have been very aggressive in the hemisphere, in particular in countries like Nicaragua, Cuba, Venezuela and elsewhere," Crawford added. "They’ve taken every opportunity to try to carve out a niche of influence in areas… in our backyard." GABBARD ANNOUNCES CRACKDOWN ON INTELLIGENCE LEAKS The two-decade War on Terror in the Middle East has left America overlooking the security issues in its own neighborhood, at least according to the House’s new Intelligence Chair Rick Crawford. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration has pushed a new Monroe Doctrine-like focus, most notably with Trump calling for the U.S. to take back the Panama Canal from China. That call was answered with a deal for U.S.-based BlackRock to take over two ports of entry to the canal from Hong Kong-based C.K. Hutchison. Now, Chinese authorities are threatening to thwart that deal. As China increasingly threatens U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific, Crawford believes the U.S. could win a war with the Chinese if it needed to — for now. "But we don’t have a lot of time. We can’t sit back and ponder the situation much more." China and Russia are aggressively testing offensive capabilities in space, Pentagon officials have said, while China-watchers warn the CCP is ahead of the U.S. in shipbuilding capabilities, hypersonics, anti-ship ballistic missiles, cyber and is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal. Crawford said the U.S. may need to rethink its policy from a focus that leans heavily on cybersecurity to one that considers offensive attacks. As China increasingly threatens U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific, Crawford believes the U.S. could win a war with the Chinese if it needed to — for now. (Andy Wong/AP Photo) Crawford’s predecessor, former committee Chair Mike Turner, fired off an ominous public warning calling on President Joe Biden to declassify information about a threat that was later reported to be Russian anti-satellite capabilities. That warning and the public scare it caused later factored into Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to replace Turner as head of the committee in January, sources familiar with the situation have told Fox News Digital. Crawford’s views also fell closer in line with those of Trump than Turner’s. Asked if he shared Turner’s concern, Crawford said: "Everything that Russia does is a concern to me as it applies to, you know, their belligerent behavior, the potential that they have." "The reason they punch above their weight is, I mean, they have a GDP about the size of Spain. It's not that they're a huge economy, it's that they're willing to do things that other countries aren't, and they're willing to be belligerent. They're willing to invade their neighbor, and that's a problem." RUBIO THREATENS VENEZUELA WITH NEW SANCTIONS Venezuela, whose dictatorial leader Nicolas Maduro is backed by China, Russia and Iran, has claimed swaths of Guyanese territory as its own. (Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters) It’s a different message than one might expect to hear from a Trump-aligned Republican, amid a thawing in U.S.-Russia relations as Trump tries to negotiate peace between President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. "[Russia’s] willingness to do things that most civilized nations wouldn’t do puts them in a unique category," Crawford said. "So let’s engage in trying to end the hostilities in Ukraine, bring that to a peaceful end to the extent that we can. But, you know, as Reagan said, trust, but verify." Crawford also said that the intelligence community [IC] needed a "retooling of the culture" to address recruitment and retention issues. He called the IC’s handling of the Havana Syndrome a "slap in the face" to its sufferers. The IC’s assessment that Havana Syndrome, also known as anomalous health incidents (AHI) was likely not the work of a foreign adversary "missed the mark grossly." "If we've got problems with recruiting and retention because the workforce doesn’t think the seventh floor [where leadership sits] has their back, that's a real problem for national security." Crawford continued: "If analytic integrity or lack of is driving that, that's something we're going to have to pay close attention to. And we're going to exercise rigorous oversight." In December, Crawford's CIA subcommittee released a report finding it "increasingly likely" a foreign adversary had been behind a number of the anomalous health incidents, and that the IC's assessment finding just the opposite "was developed in a manner inconsistent with analytic integrity and thoroughness." Trump officials have repeatedly stressed that this administration will put renewed attention on the Western Hemisphere, with an eye for what Secretary of State Marco Rubio calls "missed opportunities and neglected partners." (Mark Schiefelbein/Reuters) Trump officials have repeatedly stressed that this administration will put renewed attention on the Western Hemisphere, with an eye for what Secretary of State Marco Rubio calls "missed opportunities and neglected partners." Crawford added that the U.S. needed to hold close to its relationship with Guatemala. "Guatemala is probably our best ally in the hemisphere," he said. "They want to be a partner. There are others where we see some great opportunity — Guyana and Suriname are sort of beneficiaries of some huge mineral wealth that has developed in the last four or five years." Venezuela, whose dictatorial leader Nicolas Maduro is backed by China, Russia and Iran, has claimed swaths of Guyanese territory as its own. The U.S., which does not recognize Maduro's regime, removed sanctions loopholes for Venezuelan oil in January, and threatened to ramp up financial penalties even further if Maduro will not accept deported migrants. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For the U.S.'s northern neighbor, Crawford believes the current quarrel with Canada over tariffs and Trump suggesting it become the 51st U.S. state will quiet down due to the important national security partnership.

Title: South Korea just opened its largest EV charging hub
URL: http://electrek.co/2025/03/19/south-korea-just-opened-its-largest-ev-charging-hub/
Time Published: 2025-03-19T19:33:24Z

South Korea just got its largest outdoor EV fast-charging hub, and it’s at the Korea International Exhibition Center (KINTEX) in Goyang. The new hub, built by charging network Water, features 46 fast chargers capable of juicing up everything from electric cars to buses and trucks. KINTEX hosts around 5.8 million visitors a year, so a major charging hub like this makes a lot of sense. Water installed eight 200 kW and 38 100 kW EV chargers. The station is split across two sections of an outdoor parking lot near Exhibition Center 2. Drivers can easily access the chargers from Ilsan Lake Park, and there are no height restrictions, meaning electric buses and trucks won’t have to struggle to find a compatible spot. The hub is also topped with Water’s signature wooden canopy, which not only makes it easier to spot but also lowers the construction carbon footprint compared to steel or concrete structures. Dongyoon Lee, Water’s director of business development, says the 46 chargers eliminate the hassle of hunting for multiple stations and provide a one-stop fast-charging experience. Even during peak hours, wait times should be minimal. KINTEX has nearly 7,000 parking spaces, and South Korean regulations require that at least 5% of spaces at large public venues be designated for EV charging. This new hub goes above and beyond that requirement, which is especially needed as KINTEX expands and some parking areas close. The project is part of a broader push to improve Goyang’s green infrastructure. Water was chosen last April to install 107 chargers across 14 locations in the city, and the entire network is expected to be up and running by the end of the month. Daewon Yu, managing partner at Water, calls KINTEX a prime location for charging infrastructure and notes that “the hub will also support green mobility initiatives in Goyang by serving EV owners, taxis, buses, and other commercial vehicles.” Water is the EV charging network brand of Brite Energy Partners, a South Korean renewable energy infrastructure company backed by BlackRock.

Title: Notebooks as reusable Python programs
URL: https://marimo.io/blog/python-not-json
Time Published: 2025-03-19T18:14:14Z
Full Content:
We've launched our YouTube channel! Subscribe for tutorials and demos. Akshay @akshaykagrawal Myles @themylesfiles Dylan Madisetti @dmadisetti marimo is free and open source, available on GitHub. This blog post is also accompanied by a YouTube video. In a previous post, on lessons learned redesigning the Python notebook, we wrote: A lot of important work happens in notebooks — research, large scale experimentation, data engineering, and more. But this kind of work should be treated as Python software, and it shouldn’t be done in error-prone JSON scratchpads. In that post we described design decisions that allowed us to create a new kind of notebook (marimo), one that blended the best parts of interactive computing with the maintainability, reusability, and interoperability of software. Part of our solution was to represent notebooks as Python programs — not just as flat scripts, but as reusable modules. In this post, we dive deep into our representation of notebooks as Python files — showing how our file format makes notebooks versionable with Git, importable as modules, testable with pytest, executable as scripts, and much, more, while still being compatible with other languages like SQL and Markdown. We also discussing how we design around tradeoffs, such as keeping a record of visual outputs. Contents The status quo is not working Python, not JSON: a new plaintext file format Anatomy of a notebook file Examples Version with Git Test with pytest Test with doctests Reuse functions and classes in other Python files Reuse cells and notebooks in other notebooks Run as Python scripts Script metadata for packaging and configuration Embed SQL and Markdown Edit as plaintext files Output storage It just works AI developers, data engineers, data scientists, and researchers do a lot of their work in Python notebooks like Jupyter. We know this from first-hand experience; we’ve worked as engineers at Google Brain and Palantir, and lived in notebooks, for better or worse, during PhDs at Stanford and Johns Hopkins. Traditional notebooks’ usefulness is severely limited by the JSON-based ipynb file format (among other things). This file format combines code and outputs in what Pydantic creator Samuel Colvin calls a “horrid blob”, and is directly responsible for the following sad state of affairs: While it’s true that you can get cleaner diffs by using Jupytext (if you’re sufficiently motivated) or Databricks source notebooks (if you’re a paying customer), naively storing notebooks as flat Python scripts like these tools do won’t solve the other problems enumerated above. In particular, importing a Jupytext-processed or Databricks source-format notebook as a module will also run all its cells — a potentially very expensive side-effect if all you wanted was to import a function or class. nbdev is a framework that lets developers “write, test, document, and distribute software packages and technical articles” using Jupyter notebooks, a goal that we consider orthogonal to our goal of making a new kind of Python notebook that is a simple software artifact, just like any other Python file. We are not interested in replacing traditional software development with notebooks. When working with Jupyter, too often you end up with directories strewn with spaghetti-code notebooks, counting up to Untitled12.ipynb or higher. You the notebook author don’t know what’s in these notebooks, you don’t understand their Git history, you don’t know what packages were used in each notebook, you haven’t tested anything because how do you even test notebooks, and you’re unsure if you — let alone your colleagues — will be able to run them in the future. Despite these problems (and others — by one study, less than four percent of Jupyter notebooks on GitHub are reproducible), people continue using traditional notebooks for production tasks like pipelines (e.g., Databricks workflows), as well as areas where reproducibility is paramount, like AI development and science. Why? Because, until recently, Jupyter notebooks were the only programming environment that let you see your data while you worked on it. Interactivity is so crucial to data work that hundreds of thousands of data professionals decided the trade-offs were worth it. Instead of accepting this sad state of affairs, or trying to work around it with clunky extensions or complicated frameworks, we decided it was worth it to reinvent notebooks as regular Python programs — we wanted to make something that just worked. It was from this belief that the marimo notebook was born. marimo stores notebooks as plaintext Python files (e.g. notebook.py) with the following properties: After a lot of careful consideration, we landed on files that look like this: This file format encodes how data flows across the notebook: as we explained in our previous post, marimo represents notebooks as dataflow graphs to improve reproducibility (eliminating hidden state) and enable seamless interactivity with UI elements. marimo automatically generates notebook files on save from the marimo editor, but developers can also create or edit these files in their text editor of choice (ours are neovim and Cursor). Header. The notebook file starts with a header that imports marimo, notes the version of marimo that created the file, and instantiates an App object to which cells are added. Cells. Cells are stored in notebook presentation order. Each cell is serialized as a function that accepts its variable references and return its definitions; cells are added to the notebook via the app.cell decorator. Users can optionally name their cells, which become the names of the decorated functions. This serialization strategy departs from Jupytext-style (or Databricks-style) flat scripts, which demarcate cells with comments instead of wrapping them in functions. Importing Jupytext or Databricks notebook files runs all their cells, which is expensive and almost never what you want. In contrast, in our file format, cells are not executed on import because they are wrapped in functions. Functions and classes. This part of our notebook specification is slated for release in version 0.12.0. Cells that define top-level functions or classes are serialized directly in the file, so they can be reused by other Python modules (from my_notebook import my_function). An optional top-level setup cell, not shown here, can make symbols available to these functions, such as imported modules and constants. Footer. An if __name__ == "__main__" guard protects a call to app.run(), which executes the notebook’s cells in a topologically sorted order. Our simple file format makes it possible to treat notebooks like any other Python program. Here are some examples of what our file format enables: Version with Git Test with pytest Test with doctests Reuse functions and classes in other Python files Reuse cells and notebooks in other notebooks Run as Python scripts Script metadata for packaging and configuration Embed SQL and Markdown Edit as plaintext files Small changes to notebook code are guaranteed to make small localized changes to the notebook file, yielding easy-to-read Git diffs. For example, consider a one character change, modifying to marimo notebook diff. Here’s the Git diff for a marimo notebook file: It corresponds exactly to the code change, with the notebook file changed in just one place. Jupyter notebook diff. In contrast, because ipynb files stores base64-encoded blobs of outputs, the diff for the equivalent Jupyter notebook contains 42,571 characters. Moreover, the notebook contains many changes unrelated to the actual single character code change. Here is an abbreviated version of the diff, with truncated blobs. Not only are these diffs impossible to read for an individual, they also make resolving merge conflicts very difficult. Because marimo notebooks are just Python files, they are interoperable with other tools for Python — including pytest. In contrast, there is no standard way to test code in Jupyter notebooks, which is part of the reason why so many traditional notebooks fall over from incorrectness. Testing cells. Any cell named as test_* is automatically discoverable and testable by pytest. The same goes for any cell that contains only test_ functions and Test classes. Importantly, because cells are wrapped in functions, running pytest test_notebook.py doesn’t execute the entire notebook — just its tests. Example. Consider running pytest on the following code: This prints: marimo also supports doctest out of the box: just call doctest.testmod() in your notebook, in a cell that references the functions you’d like to test. This can be especially helpful when defining and documenting functions in marimo notebooks that will be used elsewhere. Coming soon, in version 0.12.0. Our file format also makes it easy and natural to reuse functions and classes defined in your notebook; just import them like you would from a regular notebook file: This works for cells that have just a single function definition or class definition. Additionally, the functions and classes must have no other references other than imported modules or other symbols that you the notebook author define in a special setup cell (functions and classes can also refer to other top-level functions). For example, the below notebook contains a setup cell that imports numpy, and a cell that defines a function that uses numpy. Unlike other cells, the setup cell’s body is at the top-level of the file (it’s not wrapped in a function), so its variables are made available to the notebook’s functions. You can define the setup cell by simply editing the notebook file in a text editor, or through the marimo editor. Cells. Named cells can be used in other notebooks: Here, defs is a dictionary containing the variables the cell defines, and output the value of the cell’s last expression (i.e., its visual output). By default, running a cell in this way will also run its ancestors. The run method can be parametrized to override the values of its references and prevent ancestor execution. (This API was inspired by Observable notebooks.) See our docs for an example. Notebooks. Entire notebooks can be embedded in other notebooks: This lets you reuse the user interface of a marimo notebook as a component (since marimo makes it easy for notebooks to be rendered as interactive web apps). Our docs include a usage example. Every marimo notebook can be run as a script; This runs the notebook cells in a topologically sorted order. You can also pass command-line arguments to your notebook, which can be read with the library function marimo.cli_args(): Since marimo notebooks are just Python, you can also use argparse to declare and parse arguments. And, since marimo does not support magic commands (we don’t need them), your notebook is guaranteed to work as as script. Thanks to PEP 723, there is now an agreed-upon Python specification for storing metadata in single-file Python scripts. This metadata is similar to a pyproject.toml and stored as a header comment, such as: Because marimo notebooks are just Python files, we can use this spec to communicate metadata to other tools in the Python ecosystem. Package requirements. For reproducibility, marimo users can document their notebook’s dependencies in script metadata. When given a notebook with inline dependencies, marimo uses uv to run it in an isolated virtual environment. marimo can even automatically maintain this dependency list on the user’s behalf. Configuration overrides. Users can use script metadata to easily override marimo configuration on a per-notebook basis. Even though marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python, other languages can be used by embedding them in Python. For example, marimo has native support for “SQL cells”, powered by DuckDB or other databases. Though the marimo editor renders these cells as SQL, under the hood they are represented as The marimo parser even statically analyzes SQL code to build a dataflow graph jointly across Python and SQL. Markdown is embedded in marimo notebooks in a similar way: As you can see above, a benefit of embedding other languages in Python is that it enables users to interpolate Python values into SQL and Markdown at runtime. As a final example, our plaintext format makes it easy to edit marimo notebooks in a text editor of your choice; marimo will pick up your changes and reflect them in the browser. The plaintext file format also means you can lint and format notebook files using your preferred tools. While you don’t need to maintain the cell arguments and returns, doing so can help your IDE provide completions. We have changes queued up that will make this feel like a first-class experience. Our file format has tradeoffs — in particular, storing as a Python file means that notebook outputs are no longer serialized in the notebook file. We accommodate output persistence in the following ways: We regularly get feedback from users telling us how much they appreciate marimo’s embrace of pure Python. For example, one user at a large company told us how marimo’s Python-first design means his notebooks are, for the first time, actually reusable and reproducible software artifacts: My colleagues used to ask me what I did to reach certain conclusions … I would just send them my Jupyter notebook, but rarely did it ever actually run properly without issue, and it was always a mystery what specific order I ran the cells in to get them to work. I would end up just redoing a lot of the analysis in pure Python to replicate what was done, which was so inefficient. marimo has definitely solved that issue. Others tell us they came for marimo’s interactivity, but stayed for the ability to run notebooks as scripts. Conversely, others tell us they came for git-versioning, or for the tight integration with uv, and stayed for reactive execution or rich dataframes. Here’s a quote from a user that speaks to this: I haven‘t touched Jupyter or Pandas for a while now and not regretting it. My basic data stack is now uv, polars, marimo. One of my favourite features is that the notebooks are pure Python files and integrate uv script headers to make them out-of-the-box executable. More generally, when we ask our users why they keep using marimo, we hear quotes like this one: Well it just works! It just works. While marimo was originally developed with input from Stanford scientists, it is now used by developers at dozens of companies across the world, including OpenAI, BlackRock, and Moderna; it is also used by researchers and educators at Berkeley, Stanford, NASA, CZI, and other institutions. marimo is quickly establishing itself as a new standard for interactive computing. The marimo package is downloaded hundreds of thousands of times a month, and the marimo GitHub repository has over 11,000 stars, with over 100 contributors.

Title: Elon Musk Is Joining Microsoft in $30 Billion Data Center Project

Elon Musk somehow manages to win again. Microsoft, along with BlackRock and UAE-based MGX, have announced they are partnering with his artificial intelligence startup xAI on a $30 billion project to develop data centers and other infrastructure. Microsoft, being the largest backer of OpenAI, is essentially teaming up with one of its rivals. That relationship has increasingly cooled as Microsoft loosens its reliance on the startup and develops its own in-house AI models including MAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is no fan of Musk, recently describing him as insecure in an interview, and must be screaming inside. Altman probably is not wrong about Musk’s insecurity, but insecurity is a powerful motivator. Gizmodo has reached out to xAI for comment. Musk’s companies do not often respond to media inquiries. The details of the new deal with xAI are unclear, like how much money Musk’s startup will commit to the data center venture. xAI has raised $12 billion since its founding in 2023, nearly the same amount as OpenAI, and is reportedly looking to raise another $10 billion. Its data center in Memphis, dubbed Colossus, is said to be the largest in the world with more than one million GPUs powering the Grok chatbot that is deeply integrated into X. xAI has received criticism for using gas turbines to feed its significant power demands, and receiving significant concessions from the city of Memphis even though data centers usually do not employ many people, and AI threatens to eliminate jobs. Most companies in the space hope to build out nuclear energy to power their demands, which could be a positive for the green energy transition, but building out nuclear takes many years. In the meantime, President Trump has advocated for building out coal power plants next to data centers. Every company in the artificial intelligence space is racing to build out computing infrastructure they believe will be necessary to stand out in an incredibly competitive field. Forming partnerships could help spread the costs of these expansive projects, and Bloomberg reports that other investors might join the Microsoft-xAI project: The Microsoft-backed group will be renamed the AI Infrastructure Partnership, or AIP, and focus on infrastructure investments â including energy projects â mostly in the US, with a portion of the funds to be deployed in partner countries, according to the companies. The plan foresees bringing on additional investors. Clients, including pensions and insurers, are eager for such long-term infrastructure projects, BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said in the statement. OpenAI early this year announced its own $100 billion infrastructure project with Oracle and SoftBank, one of the earlier signs that it was distancing itself from Microsoft. The big tech company has been building out its own in-house models that could be faster and less expensive to run than ChatGPT, and Microsoft likely does not want to be reliant on an independent company for its AI models if the technology is going to be as revolutionary as many in the industry believe. It is better to control your own destiny than rely on a wild and frenetic company like OpenAI, which has seen a slew of scandals and ongoing drama, including the brief ouster of Altman. The whole thing must be very satisfying to Musk, who clearly launched xAI out of jealousy of OpenAI’s sudden and massive rise. He co-founded the startup, after all, but left following disputes surrounding its direction, only to see the company launch ChatGPT and kickstart a new AI generation. Now he is teaming up with OpenAI’s largest backer on his own rival startup. Musk also continues to try and sue OpenAI over its transition to a for-profit company, among other issues. It is viewed as a convenient way to try and slow OpenAI’s growth as he builds a competitor. Musk’s close relationship with the Trump administration has aided him significantly, even if it has hurt one leg of his empire, Tesla. The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that X is now privately valued at $44 billion, the exact same price he paid for what was then called Twitter back in 2022. Once a bastion of coastal elites, X has become something more of a Republican media outlet and microphone to promote President Trump’s agenda. xAI similarly has had no problems raising funding from sovereign wealth funds and others who want to be close to power. OpenAI’s ChatGPT remains far and away the most popular AI chatbot in use today with a reported 400 million weekly users and name recognition that none of its competitors enjoy. xAI is banking on its access to real-time posts from X to differentiate Grok as a powerful chatbot, even though the social network is littered with misinformation. Grok is deeply integrated with X, with buttons allowing users to ask for more context about specific posts. But the general idea seems to be that cozying up to Trump and making X the town square of the Republican party will support xAI’s rise as a major AI player. The chatbot, like all the others, suffers from serious issues producing accurate responses. Last year, Musk gave shares in xAI to investors in his Twitter takeover, as well as preferential access to xAI’s funding rounds, effectively ensuring they would make their money back. The new deal with Microsoft cements xAI as a legitimate player in the AI race. While it remains a major question how impactful AI chatbots will really become in the world, it is understood that should they be as successful as hoped, having access to significant compute will help the few survive. Anyone can run a model like DeepSeek, but “agents” that control computers and do work for users will be resource-intensive, and users will go to competitors if their usage is rate-limited by another.

Title: Fed keeps interest rates unchanged in March

Share this article The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged today, maintaining the federal funds rate between 4.25% and 4.50% for the second consecutive meeting amid growing recession concerns fueled by the Trump administration’s economic policies. The central bank has adjusted its 2025 economic forecasts, lowering GDP growth projections to 1.7% from the previous 2.1% in December, while simultaneously raising forecasts for unemployment to 4.4% from 4.3%, PCE inflation to 2.7% from 2.5%, and core PCE inflation to 2.8% from 2.5%. The Fed projects two 50-basis-point interest rate cuts in 2025, consistent with both market expectations and its December forecast. The decision matched widespread market expectations. The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicated a 99% probability of the Fed maintaining its current target interest rates, reflecting near-unanimous market confidence in that outcome. In its FOMC statement, the central bank highlighted a resilient labor market but voiced concerns about persistent inflation and global economic challenges. The Fed indicated it would carefully monitor inflation and labor market data before adjusting policy. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell echoed this cautious approach last month, noting a strong economy that doesn’t yet warrant changes. With his press conference minutes away, markets await clarity on what conditions might prompt future rate moves—and how the Fed views mounting economic risks. This Wednesday’s meeting was the first since the enactment of Trump’s trade policies targeting China, Mexico, and Canada. The Fed had already flagged these tariffs as a source of uncertainty at its January meeting, where rates also held steady. Economists warn that Trump’s tariffs could reverse recent inflation progress by driving up consumer prices and inviting retaliation, potentially straining the economy. US inflation data supports a cooling trend—the consumer price index rose 0.2% in February, lowering the annual rate to 2.8% from 3%, with core CPI also up 0.2%—yet tariff fears persist. In an interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, Trump did not rule out the possibility of a recession. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added to recession concerns on March 10, stating he could not guarantee the US would dodge one. Powell’s upcoming remarks are poised to address these tensions—tariffs, inflation, and recession risks. Since the rate decision met expectations, his words will carry extra weight, potentially shaping market sentiment on whether Trump’s policies could tip the economy into downturn territory. As concerns over tariffs and recession mount, talk about Bitcoin heats up. BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, Robbie Mitchnick, sees a recession as a potential catalyst for Bitcoin, noting that increased liquidity and monetary stimulus could fuel its rise. “Bitcoin is long liquidity in the system. It’s catalyzed by more fiscal spending and debt and deficit accumulation. That happens in a recession,” he said during Yahoo Finance’s Market Domination Overtime on Tuesday. “It’s catalyzed by lower interest rates and monetary stimulus.” Comparing Bitcoin to gold, Mitchnick explained that while Bitcoin is fundamentally an uncorrelated asset, market sentiment sometimes creates short-term price correlations. He argued that Bitcoin should act as a global, decentralized, and non-sovereign asset akin to digital gold but acknowledged that short-term interest rate expectations and investor sentiment could influence its price. Despite recent market pullbacks, Bitcoin is still up approximately 15% since the beginning of November. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

PROPERTY PRICES CLIMBED by 8.1% in the 12 months to January this year, according to figures released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). In January, property prices rose for the 17th month in a row, leaving the average cost significantly higher than at the peak of the Celtic Tiger property boom in 2007. The CSO’s latest property price index shows that the median price of a home sold in Ireland was €359,999 in the last year. Prices in Dublin rose by 7.5%, while prices outside Dublin were up by 8.6% compared with January 2024.

House prices rose by 8.5%, while apartment prices climbed by 5.8%. The continued property price increases were announced just one day after the Central Bank’s latest forecasts show it estimates the Government will miss its housing targets over the next three years. This year, the Central Bank estimated that 35,000 homes will be built – 6,000 less than the revised government targets. Rachel McGovern, Deputy Chief Executive at Brokers Ireland, said this is exacerbating the home ownership desires of huge swathes of the population. “The Central Bank’s report yesterday is just the latest in a string of reports pointing to the loss of momentum in the housing market,” she said. McGovern added that there needs to be “a shake-up” in the State’s response to housing. “We need to hear less about targets and more about solid initiatives to change policy, such as the new Strategic Housing & Infrastructure Delivery Office promised in the Programme for Government 2025,” McGovern said. “We need to hear what is being done to speed up housing infrastructure such as water services and land re-zoning.” She said the Government needs to be “brave and decisive” and not let another year pass before it acts on the recommendations of the Housing Commission.

ЛОНДОН – Изменение климата ставит под угрозу прибрежные и морские экосистемы, от устойчивости которых зависит глобальная стабильность, экономическое процветание и выживание всего живого на Земле. Нужно срочно защитить эти экосистемы, но у многих жителей прибрежных районов нет финансовых ресурсов даже на восстановление после климатических бедствий – ураганов, тайфунов и штормовых приливов. Критически важно устранить этот недостаток, чтобы смягчить худшие последствия изменения климата. Мощным фактором позитивных изменений может стать страховая отрасль, повышая с помощью методов риск-менеджмента долгосрочную климатическую устойчивость прибрежных районов и океанов. После урагана «Берил», обрушившегося на Карибский бассейн и Мексиканский залив в июле прошлого года, стала очевидна необходимость целевых страховых решений в климатически уязвимых районах. Ураган повредил или уничтожил почти 90% всего рыболовного флота Барбадоса. Лишившись доходов и не имея достаточного страхового покрытия, многие рыбаки и их семьи остались без средств на восстановление. Несмотря на возросшие риски, страховщики признают, что с хорошо продуманными продуктами, точной оценкой рисков и мерами повышения устойчивости можно сделать климатически уязвимые рынки финансово привлекательными. Во многих случаях партнёрства с госсектором и организациями развития, помогающие разделить риски и повысить уровень защиты, дополнительно стимулируют страховщиков оставаться на рынке. Тем самым страховщики не только сохраняют важный сегмент рынка, но и способствуют устойчивости в прибрежных районах. Одно из перспективных решений – полисы параметрического страхования. Эти полисы играют роль финансовой защиты для частных лиц, малого бизнеса и даже стран после природных катастроф, гарантируя мгновенные выплаты, которые помогают населению и правительствам быстро восстановиться. Не менее важно то, что параметрические полисы играют ключевую роль в смягчении рисков, поскольку позволяют правительствам и бизнесу инвестировать в долгосрочные стратегии устойчивости. Ярким примером такого решения на государственном уровне стал полис параметрического страхования для Белиза британско-американской страховой компании WTW. Он призван обеспечить обслуживание страной долга по «синим облигациям». Этот инновационный финансовый механизм автоматически выдаёт средства в случае наступления заранее оговорённых природных событий, что гарантирует выполнение Белизом долговых обязательств и достижение поставленных целей климатической устойчивости даже после природных катастроф.

Subscribe Now Помимо снижения рисков, страхование может сыграть важную роль в привлечении частного капитала в проекты, повышающие климатическую устойчивость. Долгосрочные институциональные инвесторы, включая страховщиков, обладают огромными капиталами, которые можно направить на создание устойчивой инфраструктуры. Однако до сих пор очень трудно привлекать эти средства, особенно в масштабные проекты в развивающихся странах и регионах с высокими рисками. Фонд развития устойчивой инфраструктуры (IRDF) – совместная инициатива Форума развития страхования (IDF) и компании BlackRock – пытается решить эту проблему, привлекая капиталы страховой отрасли для инвестиций в устойчивую инфраструктуру в развивающихся странах. Фонд поддерживает коммерческие проекты (предполагающие строительство с нуля или перестройку существующих объектов) в таких отраслях, как возобновляемая энергетика, водоснабжение, управление отходами, транспорт, телекоммуникации. Подтверждая соответствие проектов страховым требованиям, связанным с кредитоспособностью и рисками, фонд открывает канал столь необходимого финансирования инфраструктуры в этих странах (включая инвестиции в природные решения), особенно в прибрежных районах, что способствует повышению долгосрочной климатической устойчивости. Другой пример – «Компания синих гарантий Nautilus». Это совместная инициатива Альянса за повышение устойчивости и снижение рисков океана (ORRAA) и Группы гарантий развития (DGG); её поддержало правительство Британии. Nautilus использует гарантии (по сути, страхование инвестиций) для масштабного привлечения частного капитала в проекты повышения прибрежной и океанической устойчивости. Nautilus предлагает структуру «обещанных выплат», которая снижает риски дефолта для инвесторов, и старается, опираясь на собственные капиталы, поддерживать проекты устойчивой синей экономики, начиная с малых и средних предприятий и заканчивая крупными инфраструктурными проектами. Такая стратегия помогает уменьшить воспринимаемые риски, повысить уверенность инвесторов и привлечь частное финансирование в океанические инициативы во всём мире, способствующие климатической устойчивости и регенерации экосистем. Чтобы уменьшить дефицит защиты устойчивой синей экономики, мы должны создавать партнёрства между страховыми компаниями, инвесторами и властями, задействуя опыт, знания и ресурсы как государственного, так и частного сектора. Такие частно-государственные партнёрства будут преследовать одну цель: помогать находить инновационные решения для климатической адаптации и управления рисками, которые помогут уязвимым группам населения. Совместная работа участников форума IDF и альянса ORRAA стала ярким примером использования государственных, частных и филантропических ресурсов для масштабного увеличения инвестиций в природные решения (защиту коралловых рифов, восстановление мангровых зарослей и так далее). Объединив суверенные риски, островные государства смогли вместе получить доступ к недорогому страхованию и показали ещё один полезный пример повышения финансовой устойчивости в условиях климатических катастроф. На Форуме синих финансов и экономики и Конференции ООН по океану, которые пройдут в июне в Монако и Ницце, будет подчеркиваться возросшая роль страховой отрасли в повышении климатической устойчивости океанов. Но для значимого прогресса нужна многогранная стратегия расширения доступа к таким видам страхования, как параметрическое покрытие. Повысить доступность и адаптировать страхование к местным реалиям можно, инвестируя в сбор данных и моделирование рисков, что улучшит наше понимание и оценку угроз, связанных с океаном. «Индекс прибрежных рисков», публикуемый ORRAA и AXA, показывает, как подходы с опорой на данные могут радикально улучшить ситуацию с климатической устойчивостью. Но что, наверное, самое важное, учитывая беспрецедентные масштабы климатической проблемы, для обеспечения защиты потребуются комплексные подходы, которые объединят знания отрасли о риск-менеджменте, инновационные финансовые инструменты, стратегическое использование капиталов. Массовое внедрение природных страховых продуктов позволит не только уменьшить физические риски, но и поддержит биоразнообразие, здоровье экосистем. Укрепляя природную береговую защиту, мы сможем полностью раскрыть экономический и экологический потенциал устойчивого океана, создать процветающую синюю экономику.

LONDRES – El cambio climático es una amenaza creciente para los ecosistemas costeros y marinos, de cuya resiliencia dependen la estabilidad mundial, la prosperidad económica y la supervivencia de todas las formas de vida en la Tierra. Pese a la urgencia de tomar medidas que protejan estos ecosistemas, muchas comunidades costeras carecen de los recursos financieros necesarios para recuperarse de desastres relacionados con el clima como huracanes, tifones y marejadas ciclónicas. Para mitigar los peores efectos del cambio climático, es fundamental cubrir el faltante de financiación; y en esto, la industria de los seguros puede ser un poderoso motor de cambio positivo, poniendo sus soluciones de gestión de riesgos al servicio de fortalecer la resiliencia costera y oceánica a largo plazo. El huracán Beryl, que en julio del año pasado arrasó el Caribe y el golfo de México, puso de relieve la necesidad de mecanismos de aseguramiento específicos para las regiones vulnerables al clima, ya que la tormenta dañó o destruyó casi el 90% de la flota pesquera de Barbados. Privados de ingresos y con poca o ninguna cobertura de seguro, muchos pescadores y sus comunidades se quedaron sin medios para la reconstrucción. A pesar del aumento de riesgos, las aseguradoras saben que con productos bien diseñados, una adecuada cotización de aquellos y el fortalecimiento de las medidas de resiliencia es posible dar viabilidad financiera a mercados vulnerables al clima. En muchos casos, acuerdos de asociación con gobiernos y organismos de desarrollo que permitan compartir riesgos y resolver deficiencias en el área de las medidas de protección pueden alentar a las aseguradoras a seguir en el mercado. Permaneciendo en estas regiones, las aseguradoras no sólo conservan un importante segmento del mercado, sino que también ayudan a crear comunidades costeras más resilientes. Una solución prometedora son las pólizas de seguro paramétricas. Están diseñadas para ofrecer una red de seguridad financiera después de una catástrofe ambiental a individuos, pequeñas empresas e incluso países, con una entrega rápida de desembolsos que ayuden a comunidades y gobiernos a acelerar las medidas de recuperación. Además, las pólizas paramétricas cumplen un papel fundamental en la mitigación de riesgos, al permitir a gobiernos y empresas invertir en estrategias de resiliencia a largo plazo. Un ejemplo notable de solución en el nivel nacional es la póliza paramétrica de la aseguradora británico‑estadounidense WTW para Belice, diseñada para ayudar al país a cumplir los pagos de sus bonos azules. Este innovador mecanismo financiero libera fondos en forma automática si se producen determinados fenómenos ambientales, de modo tal que Belice pueda cumplir sus obligaciones financieras y sus objetivos de resiliencia climática incluso después de una catástrofe natural.

Subscribe Now Además de su función de transferir riesgos, las pólizas de seguro también pueden facilitar la movilización de capital privado para proyectos de creación de resiliencia. Los inversores institucionales con un horizonte temporal largo (entre ellos las aseguradoras) poseen grandes reservas de capital que pueden destinarse a la inversión en infraestructuras sostenibles. Pero liberar estos fondos sigue siendo difícil, sobre todo para proyectos a gran escala en países en desarrollo y regiones de alto riesgo. En respuesta a esta dificultad, el Fondo para el Desarrollo de Resiliencia en Infraestructuras, una iniciativa conjunta del Insurance Development Forum (IDF) y BlackRock, apunta a movilizar capital del sector asegurador hacia la inversión en infraestructuras resilientes en economías en desarrollo y emergentes. El fondo da apoyo a proyectos comerciales de desarrollo o reutilización de terrenos en sectores como las energías renovables, el agua, la gestión de residuos, el transporte y las telecomunicaciones. Certificando que los proyectos cumplen los requisitos crediticios y de riesgo de las aseguradoras, ofrece un canal a la muy necesaria financiación de infraestructuras en estos países, incluida la inversión en soluciones basadas en la naturaleza, sobre todo en comunidades costeras, con lo que promueve la sostenibilidad a largo plazo. Otro ejemplo es Nautilus, the Blue Guarantee Company, una iniciativa conjunta de la Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA) y del Development Guarantee Group, con el apoyo del gobierno británico. Nautilus utiliza garantías (básicamente, seguros de inversión) para liberar capital privado a gran escala con destino a proyectos de resiliencia costera y oceánica. Mediante una estructura de «promesa de pago» que reduce los riesgos de incumplimiento para los inversores, Nautilus busca poner su base de capital al servicio de respaldar proyectos de economía azul sostenibles, desde pequeñas y medianas empresas hasta proyectos de infraestructura a gran escala. Esta estrategia puede mitigar los riesgos percibidos y mejorar la confianza de los inversores, de modo tal de atraer financiación privada a iniciativas oceánicas regenerativas y con resiliencia al cambio climático en todo el mundo. Para cubrir los faltantes de protección en la economía azul sostenible, también es necesario fomentar acuerdos de asociación entre compañías de seguros, inversores y gobiernos, que permitan aprovechar la experiencia y los recursos de los sectores público y privado. Estas asociaciones público‑privadas compartirían un mismo objetivo: facilitar soluciones innovadoras de adaptación y gestión de riesgos que beneficien a comunidades vulnerables. El trabajo de los miembros del IDF con la ORRAA es un buen ejemplo de cómo aprovechar los recursos públicos, privados y filantrópicos para aumentar las inversiones en soluciones basadas en la naturaleza, por ejemplo la protección de arrecifes de coral y la restauración de manglares. Otro modelo útil para aumentar la resiliencia financiera frente a desastres relacionados con el clima son los fondos de riesgo soberano, que permiten a los estados insulares acceder a coberturas de seguro asequibles en forma conjunta. El próximo Foro sobre Economía y Finanzas Azules y la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Océanos, que se celebrarán en Mónaco y Niza en junio, ponen de relieve el papel cada vez más importante del sector de los seguros en la creación de resiliencia oceánica. Pero para lograr avances significativos se necesita una estrategia multifacética que amplíe el acceso a soluciones de seguro como la cobertura paramétrica. Para que la cobertura sea más accesible y adaptada a las realidades locales, debemos invertir en datos y modelos de riesgo que mejoren nuestra comprensión, evaluación y cotización de las amenazas relacionadas con los océanos. El Índice de Riesgo Costero de la ORRAA y AXA demuestra de qué manera un enfoque basado en datos puede generar grandes mejoras en resiliencia climática. Pero lo más importante tal vez sea que por la escala inédita del desafío climático, la solución a los faltantes de protección demanda un enfoque holístico que integre las capacidades de gestión de riesgos del sector asegurador, instrumentos financieros innovadores y un empleo estratégico del capital. La adopción generalizada de productos de seguro basados en la naturaleza no sólo mitigará los riesgos físicos, sino que también dará apoyo a la biodiversidad y a la salud de los ecosistemas. Con el fortalecimiento de las defensas costeras naturales, podemos liberar todo el potencial económico y ecológico de un océano resiliente y crear una próspera economía azul.

Title: Insuring Coastal and Ocean Resilience

Protecting high-risk coastal communities from the worst effects of climate change requires increased investment in critical adaptation and mitigation projects. With innovative tools like parametric policies, the insurance industry is uniquely positioned to drive long-term climate resilience. LONDON – Climate change poses a growing threat to coastal and marine ecosystems, whose resilience is vital for global stability, economic prosperity, and the survival of all life on Earth. While urgent action is necessary to protect these ecosystems, many coastal communities lack the financial resources needed to recover from climate-related disasters like hurricanes, typhoons, and storm surges. Closing the financing gap is critical to mitigating the worst effects of climate change – and the insurance industry can be a powerful driver of positive change, leveraging risk-management solutions to strengthen long-term coastal and ocean resilience. Hurricane Beryl, which tore through the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico last July, underscored the need for targeted insurance solutions in climate-vulnerable regions, as the storm damaged or destroyed nearly 90% of Barbados’s fishing fleet. With no income and little to no insurance coverage, many fishers and their communities were left without the means to rebuild. Despite the heightened risks, insurers recognize that well-designed products, accurate risk pricing, and strengthened resilience measures can make climate-vulnerable markets financially viable. In many cases, partnerships with governments and development organizations to share risk and address protection gaps further encourages insurers to stay in the market. By remaining in these regions, insurers not only preserve an important market segment but also help build more resilient coastal communities. Parametric insurance policies offer one such promising solution. These policies are designed to serve as a financial safety net for individuals, small businesses, and even countries following environmental disasters, ensuring rapid payouts that help communities and governments recover faster. Equally important, parametric policies play a key role in risk mitigation, enabling governments and businesses to invest in long-term resilience strategies. A notable example of a country-level solution is the British-American insurer WTW’s parametric insurance policy for Belize, designed to support the country’s ability to service its blue-bond debt. This innovative financial mechanism automatically releases funds when predefined environmental events occur, ensuring that Belize can meet its debt obligations and achieve its climate-resilience goals even after natural disasters.

Subscribe Now Beyond risk transfer, insurance can be instrumental in mobilizing private capital for resilience-building projects. Long-term institutional investors, including insurers, hold vast capital reserves that can be directed toward sustainable infrastructure. But unlocking these funds remains a challenge, particularly for large-scale projects in developing countries and high-risk regions. The Infrastructure Resilience Development Fund, a joint initiative of the Insurance Development Forum (IDF) and BlackRock, seeks to tackle this challenge by mobilizing insurance-sector capital for investments in resilient infrastructure in developing and emerging economies. The Fund supports greenfield and brownfield commercial projects in sectors such as renewable energy, water, waste management, transportation, and telecommunications. By certifying that projects meet insurers’ credit and risk requirements, it offers a channel for much-needed financing of infrastructure in these countries, including investments in nature-based solutions, particularly in coastal communities, thereby promoting long-term sustainability. Another example is Nautilus, the Blue Guarantee Company, a joint initiative of the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA) and the Development Guarantee Group, supported by the UK government. Nautilus uses guarantees – essentially investment insurance – to unlock private capital at scale for coastal and ocean resilience projects. By offering a “promise to pay” structure that reduces default risks for investors, Nautilus aims to leverage its capital base to back sustainable blue economy ventures, ranging from small- and medium-size enterprises to large-scale infrastructure projects. Such a strategy could mitigate perceived risks and enhance investor confidence, attracting private financing to climate-resilient and regenerative ocean initiatives around the world. To close the sustainable blue economy protection gap, we must also foster partnerships among insurance companies, investors, and policymakers to harness the expertise and resources of the public and private sectors. These public-private partnerships would share a single goal: facilitating innovative adaptation and risk-management solutions that benefit vulnerable communities. IDF members’ work with ORRAA is a prime example of leveraging public, private, and philanthropic resources to scale up investments in nature-based solutions like coral-reef protection and mangrove restoration. Sovereign risk pools, which enable island states to band together and access affordable insurance coverage, are another useful model for greater financial resilience in the face of climate-related disasters. The upcoming Blue Economy and Finance Forum and the United Nations Ocean Conference, which will be held in Monaco and Nice in June, underscore the insurance sector’s growing role in building ocean resilience. But achieving meaningful progress requires a multifaceted strategy for expanding access to insurance solutions like parametric coverage. To make coverage more accessible and tailored to local realities, we must invest in data and risk modeling, thereby improving our understanding, assessment, and pricing of ocean-related threats. ORRAA and AXA’s Coastal Risk Index demonstrates how a data-driven approach can drastically improve climate resilience. Perhaps most importantly, given the unprecedented scale of the climate challenge, closing the protection gap demands a holistic approach that integrates industry risk-management capabilities, innovative financial instruments, and strategic capital deployment. The widespread adoption of nature-based insurance products will not only mitigate physical risks but also support biodiversity and ecosystem health. By strengthening natural coastal defenses, we can unlock the full economic and ecological potential of a resilient ocean and create a thriving blue economy.

Title: Nvidia and xAI Sign On to $30 Billion AI Infrastructure Fund

Elon Musk’s xAI and chipmaker Nvidia have joined a $30 billion artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure project. The AI Infrastructure Fund, backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX, announced the two-high profile sign-ups Wednesday (March 19), noting that their ultimate goal was to raise up to $100 billion for artificial intelligence (AI) development. “The global buildout of AI infrastructure will benefit every company and country that wants to achieve economic growth and unlock solutions to the world’s greatest challenges,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in the announcement. “AI factories built on Nvidia full-stack AI infrastructure will convert data into intelligence that will accelerate every industry and help society achieve unimaginable breakthroughs,” he added. Microsoft and Blackrock launched the fund last year, aiming to raise money to construct data centers and find sources of power for those facilities. The announcement comes one day after Huang told attendees at the Nvidia developer conference that massive computing power is required to enable the current trajectory of AI as it moves toward agents and reasoning models. “AI is going through an inflection point,” the CEO said at the event, nicknamed “AI Woodstock,” adding that the shift to agentic and reasoning means “the amount of computation necessary to train those models, and to inference those models, has grown tremendously.” Traditional large language models need much less computing power than AI agents and reasoning models, but they also answer immediately. Reasoning models need much more power because they go back and forth reasoning among themselves before responding, which in many cases would take longer. “In order for us to keep the model responsive, so that we don’t lose our patience waiting for it to think, we now have to compute 10 times faster,” Huang said. “The amount of computation we have to do is 100 times more, easily.” As PYMNTS noted, Huang was making the case that the AI industry will still require a lot of Nvidia GPUs following a flurry of news in January surrounding the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. That company said it had trained its high-performing foundation AI model using only 2,000 slower Nvidia H800 chips instead of typically tens of thousands or more for companies like OpenAI. The BlackRock/Microsoft fund isn’t the only multi-billion dollar effort to finance AI infrastructure projects. In January, SoftBank and OpenAI unveiled their “Stargate” project to develop AI infrastructure, with plans to spend up to $100 billion.

Title: What Levers Do China and Hong Kong Have Over CK Hutchison’s Port Deal?

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo HONG KONG, March 19 (Reuters) – Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison is facing intense criticism from Beijing over its ports sale to a BlackRock-led consortium, fueling speculation as to whether China could take steps to scupper the deal. China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office has reposted two state media commentaries over the past week depicting the deal, which includes the sale of assets near the Panama Canal, as a betrayal of China and contrary to its national interests. The deal could give BlackRock control of 10.4% of global container throughput, making it the world’s third largest port operator, Chinese state media reported, which could result in higher port and logistics costs for Chinese entities and pose a risk to Chinese supply chains. Here’s a look at what potential legal or policy levers Beijing and Hong Kong could deploy against the company. While some analysts say China’s regulatory reach is limited as none of the ports being sold are in China or Hong Kong, some legal experts say Beijing could still review the transaction. The State Administrative Market Regulation Authority could have extra-territorial jurisdiction by applying the anti-monopoly law, if a deal outside mainland China has the effect of eliminating or restricting competition in China’s domestic market. Authorities could also use the Measures for Security Review or Foreign Investments, implemented in 2021, to examine foreign direct investments in important fields relating to national security, including infrastructure. Felix Ng, a partner at law firm Haldanes, said the measures removed the exclusion of acquisitions of interest held by foreign companies, “suggesting that PRC authorities may have the power to review foreign-to-foreign transactions if the target involves PRC-related entities”. While CK Hutchison is registered offshore, it has businesses and a presence in China and Beijing may be able to use this as justification for weighing in, Ng said. The company did not respond to questions about the potential scrutiny. Lawyers said Hong Kong lacked regulations requiring government screening of sales of strategic assets, reflecting its traditional role as a free-wheeling entrepot. That left the government with few options beyond the blunt and broad instrument of the 2020 National Security Law to probe foreign deals involving local firms. The Beijing-imposed law punishes terrorism, collusion with foreign forces, subversion and secession with possible life imprisonment. “Given the sensitivities, there would be room for further investigation under the broad sweep of the National Security Law, particularly over collusion or espionage,” said Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong law school. The offense of collusion would have to involve a person or company intending to disrupt the policies of the Chinese or Hong Kong governments to create serious consequences, Young said. Likewise, espionage would have to involve a person intending to endanger national security by communicating or providing information useful to an external force. “I don’t know if there is evidence of an intention to endanger national security by entering into the ports agreement,” he said. The Hong Kong government did not respond to a request for comment. While some politicians and analysts also say it’s hard to see how the deal could violate security laws, the Secretary for Security can give notice that relevant persons or organizations must not, directly or indirectly, deal with a property that is reasonably suspected to be related to offenses endangering national security. The Secretary for Justice, the Secretary for Security or a police officer may exercise the power to freeze, restrain, confiscate and forfeit property relating to the commission of an offense endangering national security. Article 29 of the law states that an act “seriously disrupting the formulation and implementation of laws or policies” by the Chinese and Hong Kong governments “which is likely to cause serious consequences” could constitute an offense under collusion with foreign forces. The law also has an extrajudicial scope, and applies to both residents and non-residents. Hong Kong authorities used the security legislation and the implementation rules in 2021 to freeze the assets of Next Digital, invoking powers to force the liquidation of the listed company of jailed pro-democracy tycoon Jimmy Lai.

Two of the biggest forces in artificial intelligence (AI) — Elon Musk’s xAI and Nvidia — have joined BlackRock, Microsoft and investment fund MGX’s group to expand AI infrastructure across the U.S., the companies announced Wednesday. The fund — called the AI Infrastructure Partnership — at its formation in September of last year, said that it plans to launch with more than $30 billion in initial funding. The goal is to build data centers and energy projects which are required to power large-scale AI models. Nvidia will also serve as a technical advisor for the group, which it had announced last year. Musk and Nvidia join the effort two months after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the formation of Stargate, a private venture that plans to build up to 20 large AI data centers in the U.S. in partnership with OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. The first data center will be built in Abilene, a small city in Texas, which will be completed by mid-2026, Bloomberg reported yesterday. It will have space for roughly 400,000 of Nvidia’s AI chips and a capacity of 1.2 gigawatts of power.

Australia-based digital asset firm Zerocap is in a prime position to observe the development of the structured product space, having operated OTC, market making, derivatives and crypto custody businesses since it was founded in 2018. Here Zerocap’s head of sales Mark Hiriart discusses how these products are changing, a new semi-principal protected product his firm is launching, how demand for structured products varies by geographical region, and the most unusual structured product request he’s seen. Tell us about Zerocap. Zerocap is Australia's leading institutional digital assets firm, established in 2018. We operate multiple business lines including an OTC desk, market making and derivatives business, all underpinned by our custody offering. We operate as a Corporate Authorised Representative of an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) holder, which authorizes us to trade financial products like derivatives with wholesale accredited investors. We have also established a number of high-profile partnerships with institutions like ANZ Bank for their stablecoin, and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) for various proof of concepts and pilots. While we've become the leading liquidity player in Australia over the last 18 months, our reach extends to clients in over 50 countries. You recently announced a new product — tell us about it. We've partnered with CoinDesk Indices to launch a semi-principal-protected structure on the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20). The product offers upside exposure to the CD20 with principal protection limiting downside risk to 5%, while offering up to 40% return potential on the upside. This is the first in a series of structured products we'll be creating with CoinDesk Indices, featuring different payoffs for various risk appetites. The timing is particularly relevant given the current market sentiment. With the rally in digital assets around Trump and potential global trade headwinds to navigate, we anticipate some sideways action in the near term. This medium-risk exposure product is well-suited to the current macro environment. What gap in the market does your new product fill, and who is it designed for? In the digital asset space, we don't have established benchmarks like there are in traditional markets. For example, if an Australian investor or someone in Hong Kong wants U.S. tech exposure, they typically look for products linked to the NASDAQ or QQQ ETF. In crypto, we haven't had that level of indexization yet. This product is designed for three groups: family offices and high-net-worth individuals seeking to enter the space; investors wanting broad-based crypto exposure without deep diving into individual assets; and those who understand bitcoin but want diversified exposure with managed risk. Why did you choose to base it on the CoinDesk 20 Index? We selected the CoinDesk 20 Index for four key reasons. One, we deeply respect the CoinDesk brand and their index team's quality. Two, our strong relationship with Bullish provides access to futures contracts for hedging. Three, there's a clear market need for index products in the crypto space. And lastly, my background in equity derivatives at investment banks shows me how people use these products, and it's a natural evolution for crypto. How are structured products evolving? Two main factors have historically limited structured product adoption: one, high crypto volatility meant simple spot positions could provide significant returns, and two, the prevalence of perpetual futures with high leverage reduced demand for options markets. That balance is shifting, however, as more participants hold structural positions. Venture funds, portfolio managers with value-based allocation policies and large mandate holders need specific hedging solutions that perpetuals can't provide due to path dependency. What impact is the advent of crypto ETFs having on structured products? ETFs serve as a "gateway drug" to structured products rather than cannibalizing them. The introduction of products like the BlackRock ETF has brought new participants into the crypto space. As these investors become comfortable with crypto exposure through ETFs, they naturally progress to exploring more sophisticated products for enhanced returns or risk management. What institutional demand patterns are you seeing for crypto structured products in Asia versus other regions? Asia typically shows a strong appetite for auto-call structures, where investors sell downside or puts to receive large coupons based on price targets on the upside. This differs from the more conservative approach in U.S. and European markets. Having worked at JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley in equity derivatives trading, I've seen these regional differences firsthand. Australia sits somewhere in between, and at Zerocap, we've successfully converted non-structured product players into crypto structured product users. We're looking to expand this expertise into Asia, subject to regulatory requirements. Are we at risk of over-engineering crypto's volatility out of existence? As crypto develops, different assets naturally have different volatility profiles. While stablecoins maintain stability and bitcoin's volatility may dampen with institutional adoption, there's still plenty of opportunity for high-volatility exposure down the market cap curve, from Solana to memecoins. The market is maturing to cater to different investor needs. For portfolio allocation, whether it's 1%, 2% or 5%, investors need broad beta exposure through established assets like bitcoin and ether, complemented by smaller allocations to emerging opportunities. What’s been the most unusual structured product request you’ve seen? We are one of the few desks globally that offer derivatives on alt coins and hence we get asked to price some wild and wacky things. I can officially confirm that we have traded an option on FARTCOIN recently, which is quite something for someone who has spent his career at the big US banks! With that in mind, where do you see DeFi and traditional structured products intersecting? While DeFi and structured products present interesting opportunities, we need to acknowledge that crypto is already complex, and structured products add another layer of complexity. However, tokenization makes sense for legal documentation and fungibility, since you can audit source code to understand exactly what you're getting. This space will grow with real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, but widespread adoption may take time. When do you think digital assets will become long-term investments? The transition from trading vehicles to long-term investments will occur as protocols and tokens demonstrate clear value propositions and use cases. Bitcoin has proven itself to be viewed as digital gold, while it is still debatable to callEthereum "ultrasound money”. Other protocols are still fighting to find their niche and demonstrate tangible value in the digital economy. As these assets become more integrated into economic systems, their long-term value propositions will become more measurable. For more information visit https://zerocap.com/.

Title: China Market Update: Tencent’s Terrific Q4 AI-Nnounced!

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern , Senior Contributor. CLN Tencent reported Q4 financial results after the Hong Kong close that beat analyst expectations. The solid quarter was driven by “AI-powered enhancements to our advertising platform, higher engagement in Video Accounts, and growth in our evergreen games,” according to Founder, Chairman, and CEO Ma “Pony” Huateng. The company emphasized AI in their press release with Ma’s quote “we have reorganised our AI teams to sharpen focus on both fast product innovation and deep model research, increased our AI-related capital expenditures, and increased our R&D and marketing efforts for our AI-native products”. The presentation dedicated an entire section to AI, noting the company spent $10.7 billion on AI in 2024, which has a capex of 12% of revenue, up from 2023’s $3.4 billion when capex accounted for 4% of revenue. The press conference and analyst Q&A were dominated by AI talk as well. In a good sign for the company and China’s economy, the company noted, “Advertising spending rose across most major categories during the quarter.” Advertisers don’t spend ad dollars if no one is buying! Hat tip to management for the shareholder-friendly buyback and dividend policies! Here are some highlights: Asian equities were mixed overnight on light volumes as Indonesia and Thailand outperformed, and investors waited for Wednesday’s U.S. Federal Reserve announcement. Hong Kong and Mainland China bounced around the room as value stocks outperformed growth stocks in both markets. Utilities were the best-performing sector in both Hong Kong and Mainland China, up +0.92% and +1.26%, respectively, after the NDRC promoted renewable energy. Some media/press attention to BofA’s China strategist calling for a correction by comparing today’s rally to the 2015 rally. I’ve not read the report, but I am skeptical as I find the comparison ridiculous. The 2015 rally was driven by legal and illegal margin debt. As noted yesterday, U.S. flows into U.S.-listed China equity ETFs is less than $1 billion year-to-date despite significant outperformance versus U.S. stocks. U.S.-listed European-focused ETFs have received $5.8 billion YTD. Going back to mid-January 2024’s China equity bottom, the outperformance versus U.S. stocks is very significant, but there are no flows and no love from U.S. investors The geopolitical headwind and constant negative U.S./Western media headlines would change with a Trump-Xi meeting. Some chatter that this could occur in June, though nothing definitive yet Corrections will occur and are healthy, though I suspect dips will be bought. Wednesday’s Hong Kong dip was bought by Mainland investors with a healthy $1.52 billion of net buying of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect. Alibaba and the Hong Kong Tracker ETF were significant large buys. Hong Kong internet stocks were mixed ahead of Tencent’s Q4 results, with KE Holdings down -10.71% post yesterday’s Q4 results. BYD gained +3.89% in Hong Kong and +3.25% in Mainland China following yesterday’s 5-minute battery recharge release. The Ministry of Transport announced a subsidy for cities to trade in their gas buses for electric vehicle buses, which is in the company’s sweet spot. The Financial Times has an article stating that BYD was told to tap the brakes on building a plant in Mexico due to the Chinese government’s worry the technology might “leak” to U.S. rivals. I have one minor issue with the article. BYD has an EV bus plant in California. Maybe BYD should wait for Trump and Xi to meet and build an EV car plant in the U.S. Interesting that the Hong Kong government CEO criticized CK Hutchison (1 HK), which gained +1.22%, for selling their Panama ports to BlackRock. The company got $19 billion, and the stock ripped higher on the news, indicating they got a good deal. Worth noting that Premier Li signed a State Council decree on “Regulations of the State Council on the Handling of International Intellectual Property Disputes.” The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech diverged +0.12% and -1.05%, respectively, on volume down -4.92% from yesterday which is 167% of the 1-year average. 240 stocks advanced, while 231 declined. Main Board short turnover increased by +12.75% from yesterday, which is 170% of the 1-year average, as 16% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). Quality and large capitalization stocks outperformed value, growth, and small capitalization stocks. The top sectors were utilities, up +0.92%, healthcare, up +0.92%, and materials, up +0.87%, while real estate fell -0.98%, consumer discretionary fell -0.86%, and communication services fell -0.4%. The top sub-sectors were consumer services, national defense, and media, while household appliances, real estate management, and telecommunication services were the worst. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were 3x pre-stimulus levels as Mainland investors bought $1.52 billion of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs led by HK Tracker ETF and Alibaba large net buys, XPeng, Xiaomi, and Dobot small net buys, Tencent and SMIC small/moderate net sells, and Meituan a large/moderate net sell. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board fell -0.10%, -0.40%, and -1.18% on volume -3.53% from yesterday, which is 123% of the 1-year average. 1,448 stocks advanced, while 3,531 declined. Value and large capitalization stocks outperformed growth and small capitalization stocks. The top sectors were utilities, up +1.26%, financials, up +0.61%, and industrials, up +0.48%, while communication services fell -3.77%, technology fell -1.93%, and real estate fell -0.83%. The top sub-sectors were precious metals, banking, and power, while telecommunication services, communication equipment, and electronic components were the worst. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were above average. CNY and the Asia dollar index barely fell versus the U.S. dollar. Treasury bond prices gained. Copper rose, and steel fell.

Most Widely Read Newspaper Kindly share this story: The crypto industry moves fast, and often, unanticipated tokens are the biggest winners. In 2021, Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) helped meager investors amass fortunes. Analysts predict a fresh wave of highly valuable currencies from Rexas Finance (RXS), Pi Network (PI), and Mantra (OM). With proper timing, $2,500 in these coins might become $95,000 or more. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Next 100x Crypto in RWA Tokenization Boom Rexas Finance (RXS) is revolutionizing asset investment so anyone may invest in tokenized real-world assets. Historically, only institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals could access these assets. However, Rexas Finance democratizes access by allowing low-cost, borderless trading of tokenized valuable assets like real estate, commodities, collectibles, etc. Despite being in its early stages, Wall Street heavyweights like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs have already embraced RWA tokenization. By 2030, experts project market growth of $30 trillion. With a strong ecosystem, Rexas Finance is tipped to outperform most trending crypto projects in the niche. It offers advanced tokenization, DeFi, and AI-driven features like the Rexas Token Builder, which helps non-coders build blockchain tokens. Businesses, developers, and institutions seeking to tokenize assets or start new projects will find this innovative. Rexas DeFi is a decentralized financial ecosystem that offers yield farming, staking, and liquidity pools. Projects like Rexas Finance, which use RWA tokenization and DeFi to provide investors with passive income and foster a growing financial sector, will lead this transformation. By automating NFT and other digital art generation using AI, Rexas GenAI offers an additional advantage. As AI and blockchain become disruptive technologies, Rexas Finance combines them for exponential acceptance and growth. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance prioritizes security, and their latest Certik audit bolsters investor confidence. This certification attests to the robustness of the platform’s security. The Rexas AI shield automates smart contract auditing and prevents illicit attacks, ensuring safe user assets. The ongoing $1 million giveaway is another opportunity for the top 20 participants to win $50,000 in RXS. Crypto incentives like this help boost token demand and adoption through viral marketing. This campaign and Rexas Finance’s powerful presale are setting up a stunning debut on major exchanges. As of this writing, RXS is in its final presale stage (Stage 12), with 90% of tokens sold. The price has risen from $0.03 in Stage 1 to $0.20, representing a 567% increase before trading began. The project has raised $46.9 million, selling 454 million tokens, making it one of the year’s most successful presales. Meanwhile, RXS investors eagerly await its official debut on June 19, 2025. At least three of the top ten worldwide exchanges are expected to list RXS, predicting a surge following its debut. Analysts anticipate a 38x price increase due to significant liquidity and investor demand. If these forecasts are correct, $2,500 spent today may grow to $98,000 in only a few months. Pi Network (PI): A 293% Rally with More Growth Potential Pi Network (PI) surged 293% in six days, bucking the gloomy market. This extraordinary rise drove PI’s price to $2.62 as of writing, and its market value climbed to $15.91 billion. The token trading volume has increased by 170% to $1.66 billion, indicating investor enthusiasm. Pi’s introduction of its Open Network, which connects external platforms to Pi’s blockchain, has fueled this trend. The anticipation surrounding Binance’s community vote to list PI Coin has fueled a positive mood. Over 86% of voters supported the listing. If approved, PI might experience an enormous price increase, with some analysts anticipating a rise to $10 soon, making it one to watch in the coming months. Mantra (OM): Breaking Records with a 159% Price Surge Mantra (OM) is another exceptional performer. It rose from $3.50 to an all-time high of $9.11, representing a 159% rise. Despite a recent retracement to $7.48, OM is in a solid uptrend and aims to break over the critical $10 mark. The token’s on-chain volume has increased from $128.3 million to a 30-day high of $991.7 million, indicating significant network activity. Currently, 91.44% of the OM supply is profitable, reflecting great holder trust. Integrating real-world assets and decentralized finance has benefited Mantra. The Mantra RWA Accelerator Program, created in collaboration with Google Cloud, is increasing institutional acceptance, reinforcing OM’s optimistic view. Experts forecast a potential OM rally to $15 soon, making it a top buy for massive upside in 2025.
