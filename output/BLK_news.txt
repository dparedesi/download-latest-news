Title: George Will Says Migrants -- Not Generation Z -- Will Revive America
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/11/10/george-will-says-migrants-not-young-americans-rejuvenate-america/
Time Published: 2025-11-10T08:58:31Z
Full Content:
Op-ed writer George Will, a pillar of the old-guard GOP establishment, is disgusted with Congress’s refusal to enforce more migration and used the Washington Post to air his grievances. Migrants “could improve the nation’s dynamism, and its understanding of itself. … [but] neither political party will seize the moment for immigration reform,” wrote Will, who was born in 1941, five years before the first Baby Boomers arrived in 1946, and 24 years before Congress restarted mass immigration in 1965 after a fifty-year shutdown. Will’s endorsement of more migration comes amid the growing public recognition of the economic damage caused by President Joe Biden’s inflow of illegal migrants and visa workers, including H-1Bs from India. The damage has exacerbated the widening optimism gap between older Americans and the younger Generation Z, of adults younger than forty. “Went to an event tonight, talked to three different people with zoomer kids,” said a Nov. 9 tweet from Rasmussen Reports pollster Mark Pitchell. “They’re demoralized.” “My friend group from high school, all graduated, great degrees from great schools,” recent graduate Nalin Haley told UnHerd, adding: It’s been a year and a half, and not one of them has a job — not one. So I’m angry at that, because I’m having to try and help my friends get jobs when their parents got jobs immediately — not just after graduating college, but out of high school. “I see Boomers are trying to make their counter-argument” towards younger Americans, said Rich Baris, director at Big Data Poll, and the chairman of the National Association of Independent Pollsters. He continued: It’s pretty damned insulting to listen to people in older generations act as if these younger generations have all the options and opportunities they did. They do not. Boomers made sure of it. It’s even more insulting to see fools quote “Locke” in some ridiculous attempt to threaten them for not submitting to their way of thinking. “In 10 years, there won’t even be an argument, and the younger generations will make sure history remembers you as the generation who inherited it all, and left nothing to be inherited,” Baris wrote. Older Americans gained housing values and stock-market wealth from the huge technological advances since the 1940s, and from the vast economic stimulus provided by Congress’s policy of stimulating the economy with vast waves of legal and illegal migrants. But young Americans have seen their wages flatline, their debts grow, and their housing costs spike amid the Boomers’ imported population of roughly 50 million legalized, quasi-legal, or illegal migrants. RELATED: Sean Duffy — Gavin Newsom’s California Is Ignoring the Law on Illegal Alien Truck Drivers Yet columnist Will, aged 84, is all-in for more migration, saying migrants can rejuvenate the economy by forcing Americans out of low-wage jobs: Immigrants who fill jobs as domestic helpers, cleaners, waiters, car-wash attendants, meatpackers and other low-skill jobs drive productivity and social dynamism by allowing, even compelling, other workers to advance to more-skilled work. Migrants can also act as servants to free up better-educated Americans for commerce and possible childbirth, says Will, who was 29 when migrants were just 5 percent of the population in 1970 Regarding America’s sagging birth rate, research finds that low-skill immigrants (nannies, housekeepers, meal-preparers) “substantially” reduce hesitation about having children. The flood of migrants — presumably including clan migrants from Somalia, casteist migrants from India, and Jew-hating Muslims from Syria — can replace complacent Americans because it will “improve the nation’s dynamism, and its understanding of itself,” said Will, who has an estimated net worth of $4 million and who voted for Vice President Kalama harris in 2024. The main danger, Will argues, is that economic growth might be somewhat curbed by reduced migration: Three economists writing for the American Enterprise Institute have estimated that net U.S. migration might be negative this year — for the first time in history — by more than 200,000. Most economists think the question is not whether but how much this will subtract from economic growth. Will was referring to a report from a business-backed advocacy center, which concluded that “We find that the large drop in net migration in 2025 compared with 2024 will result in significantly slower labor force growth, slower employment growth, and a decrease in GDP growth of around 0.3–0.4 percentage points.” Mass migration is good for the stock market, but less migration is better for per-capita wealth, according to an investor-funded study described by Breitbart News in October. “At medium and low immigration levels, labor-based [skilled professional] immigration, characterized by fewer but more skilled population, produces higher GDP [Gross Domestic Product] per capita [emphasis added] growth,” compared to mass inflow of migrants and their extended families, says the September study published by Springer, titled “Demographic and Economic Implications of Alternative U.S. Immigration Policies.” “That should be a no-brainer because we know we could annex Mexico and our GDP would be enormously higher, but our per capita income would drop,” Rosemary Jenks, cofounder of the Immigration Accountability Project, told Breitbart News. “That’s just ‘Duh!’” The study is useful because “you have the advocates [for mass migration] themselves saying immigration is not a good deal for the average American,” Stephen Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart News. “It may be good for Wall Street, it’s not good for Main Street, ” he added. The study matches reality in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, where the estimated quality of life is declining and productivity is stalling because elites are importing consumers, renters, and workers to grow the nation’s real-estate prices and stock values. In contrast, President Trump and his deputies are pushing for greater productivity and automation instead of the mass migration favored by Will, progressives, and investors. We’re going to need robots … to make our economy run because we do not have enough people,” Trump told Breitbart News in August, adding: We don’t have enough people to do it. So we have to get efficient … we’ll probably add to [the existing workforce] through robotically—it’s going to be robotically. The promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told an audience of Silicon Valley investors in May. He added: And whether we’re offshoring factories to cheap labor economies, or importing cheap labor through our immigration system, cheap labor became the drug of Western economies. And I’d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you’ve seen productivity stagnate. That’s not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” Fink added.

Title: Changing Times Brewery expects to double sales next year
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/11/10/changing-times-brewery-expects-to-double-sales-next-year/

Changing Times Brewery, which was founded by the families behind some of Dublin’s best known pubs, is expecting sales to double next year with total keg sales of about 10,000, the group has said. The €2 million brewery, based in Glasnevin along the banks of the Royal Canal, is celebrating one year in operation this week. The brewery said it expects to see further growth in demand for its products, and that the increased sales will be driven by rising customer demand for its beers, expansion of the number of venues stocking their products and a further widening of their product range. A new product, called Bleedin Red Ale, becomes the fourth draft product offered by the brewery. Changing Times believes it will sell 3,000 kegs of Bleedin Red Ale by the end of 2027. A fifth beer is expected to be introduced in the first half of 2026. Changing Times products are now available in 33 venues across the country, up from the initial 15 pubs which stocked its products. The new venues include The Storyteller Pub on Grand Canal Street, Bill Ahernes on Aston Quay, The Oval on Abbey Street, Lock 13 in Sallins, Thomas Connollys in Sligo as well as Paul Flannerys, Jerry Flannerys, Patsy Flannerys and Phil Flannerys all in Limerick. The brewery’s backers include Dublin publicans Willie Aherne and Paul Sheehan of The Palace Bar on Fleet Street and Sheehans Pub on Chatham Street respectively, as well as Benny McCabe, who owns a number of bars in Cork, and brewer Shane Long. [ Changing Times Brewery beers to be stocked in nine new premises as it moves outside DublinOpens in new window ] Other backers include the publican families behind venues such as Arthur Mayne’s in Donnybrook, The Bank on College Green, The Blackrock, The Bridge 1859, Devitt’s, Doheny and Nesbitt, The Ferryman, The Long Hall, McSorley’s and The Swan. Pat Rigney, owner of The Shed Distillery, which is home of Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin, is another backer of Changing Times Brewery and also the group’s chairman. David Chawke, chief executive of Changing Times and owner of The Bank Bar and Restaurant on College Green, said: “We expect to see the number of keg sales double next year. “Practically since the day we launched we have had requests from customers for a red ale and thankfully we now are able to offer them a product we believe is as good as any other red ale on the market. “We see this product launch as another key marker for us. Adding a fourth product tap also further highlights the growing strength of our range on pub counters, creating more brand visibility for our brewery and for our existing strong line-up of beers. “It has been a really positive first year of operation for Changing Times and we are very happy with how everything has progressed. Launching a new brewery in this market was always going to be a risk, but we are very pleased with how our brewery has been received.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bringing in a new generation of hardware wallets: An interview with Adam Budínský
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bringing-in-a-new-generation-of-hardware-wallets-an-interview-with-adam-budinsky/
Time Published: 2025-11-10T05:55:34Z

Most people don’t realize how deeply hardware wallets have influenced traditional industries. These devices proved a critical point: protecting digital identity, whether it’s a private key, a certificate of origin, or machine credentials, demands uncompromising hardware-based security. No shortcuts. No partial fixes. That idea of no compromise is key. For years, industries like industrial IoT, critical infrastructure, and manufacturing treated security as a checkbox. Think of PLCs controlling factory lines, smart meters on utility grids, or remote maintenance modules in power plants, threats seemed distant. Systems stayed offline. Security was someone else’s problem. But the landscape has shifted. Today, attacks are accelerating not just in volume, but in sophistication. And while attackers level up, the cost of launching an attack drops. This isn’t theory. It’s exactly what Trezor experienced when dealing with closed secure elements, and why Tropic Square was founded: to expose and address the hidden risks in hardware. The core issue is trust, or the lack of it. Can you trust the devices you operate? The machines that manufacture your products? In many cases, the answer is no. Most embedded systems weren’t built with serious security in mind. And that’s a problem, because low-assurance hardware is easy to hijack and repurpose by attackers. Now we’re seeing a shift: the same principles that drove the evolution of hardware wallets are being applied to industrial systems. Devices that look like wallets are appearing in factories and field deployments, anchoring machine identity, securing communication, and enforcing hardware-level trust. In an interview with Adam Budínský, Head of Hardware Product at Trezor, we discussed the technical challenges the team aimed to solve, and how the device reflects broader shifts in usability, transparency, and long-term crypto security. The crypto market is clearly maturing. We’re witnessing a major shift toward institutional adoption — from the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to large asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity adding significant crypto exposure to their portfolios. Global Bitcoin ETF assets under management have already surpassed $170 billion in 2025, which shows how mainstream digital assets are becoming. At the same time, retail participation hasn’t returned to the levels we saw in previous bull markets. Institutional flows are now shaping the market more than retail sentiment, and that’s one reason why we haven’t experienced the same kind of retail-driven frenzy this cycle. Many newcomers prefer the simpler path of owning crypto through ETFs or custodial platforms instead of holding it themselves. But that convenience comes at a cost. The fundamental truth still applies — “Not your keys, not your coins.” True ownership means self-custody, and hardware wallets remain the only secure and transparent way to actually control your digital assets. At Trezor, our mission is to make that level of security accessible and intuitive for everyone, so users can enjoy the same confidence and independence as institutions — without relying on third parties. Trezor Safe 7 was shaped by a clear signal from our users: they wanted a hardware wallet that delivers not just security, but also modern convenience and premium quality. As our lives have become increasingly wireless and intuitive, people have begun to expect the same from their self-custody tools. This device brings those expectations to life — with secure Bluetooth connectivity, wireless charging, a seamless aluminum unibody, and a larger high-res display. At the same time, it introduces the world’s first transparent secure element, TROPIC01, built specifically to bring verifiability into the heart of hardware security. Each decision was guided by user feedback — and by our belief that the safest wallet should also be the easiest to use. Everything in our digital lives has become seamless and wireless — and we believe self-custody should be no exception. For too long, hardware wallets have lagged behind the level of convenience, durability, and premium design we expect from modern devices. With Trezor Safe 7, we set out to close that gap. From its aluminum unibody to encrypted Bluetooth connectivity and wireless charging, every detail was designed to make secure self-custody feel intuitive and sophisticated. But that seamless experience rests on a rock-solid foundation. We pioneered a new security model: the world’s first transparent secure element working in tandem with a trusted industry-grade chip — offering users both verifiability and resilience. That commitment to innovation is reflected across the hardware, from the safer, long-lasting LiFePO₄ battery to the fully auditable Trezor Host Protocol. This is what the new standard for hardware wallets should look and feel like — not someday, but today. We focused on solving two key issues: convenience and the trade-off between usability and verifiable security. Many users felt that hardware wallets lacked modern ease of use. We addressed that by introducing Bluetooth connectivity, Qi2 wireless charging, a larger color touchscreen with haptic feedback, and a durable aluminum unibody. We also designed a long-lasting LiFePO4 battery — built to endure years of use and deep discharge — so users can trust their wallet to stay ready whenever they need it. These improvements make self-custody feel intuitive, reliable, and accessible for everyday use. At the same time, we tackled long-standing concerns around secure element transparency. Trezor Safe 7 is the first wallet to pair a fully auditable secure element (TROPIC01) with an industry-trusted chip. This dual architecture offers both physical resilience and cryptographic transparency — giving users security they can verify, not just trust.” Trezor Safe 7 reinforces what Trezor has always stood for: open-source, user-first security. But with this release, we’ve taken that commitment to a new level. By giving users a device that’s both transparent and elegant — built with verifiable components like the TROPIC01 chip and backed by years of trusted engineering — we’re showing that we listen, we evolve, and we lead. This device isn’t just an upgrade in specs; it’s a statement of our long-term promise to the community. Every design choice, from the secure Bluetooth protocol to the unibody aluminum shell, was made to deepen user confidence. We want people to feel proud to use Trezor — and to trust that we’ll always put their needs and safety first. The goal was to create a device that feels reassuring from the first moment — precise, robust, and thoughtfully engineered. Trezor Safe 7 is milled from a single block of aluminum, giving it a clean and durable form. The Gorilla Glass 3 screen adds both clarity and protection, supporting long-term daily use. It’s compact and lightweight, but built to handle the responsibility of securing your crypto. We wanted the physical design to reflect the same principles as our software: security, transparency, and simplicity. The future of wallets will be defined by a convergence of strong security principles with the usability standards of modern consumer technology. As digital assets become more embedded in daily life, users will expect wallets to offer the same level of simplicity, portability, and design sophistication as other smart devices — without sacrificing transparency or control. This means moving beyond purely utilitarian designs toward tools that are both secure and accessible to a broader audience. At Trezor, we believe that true security starts with open-source — especially at the hardware level. You can’t prepare for the future if your most critical component, the secure element, is closed and unverifiable. That’s why Tropic Square committed to developing open-source secure elements like TROPIC01. It allows independent experts to inspect and verify how the hardware protects private keys, ensuring real trust rather than blind faith. Equally important, every true hardware wallet must have a screen. It’s the only way for users to independently verify what they are signing. Any product that claims to be a hardware wallet without a display is simply giving users a false sense of security. The ability to see and confirm transaction details directly on the device — not on a potentially compromised computer or phone — is the foundation of secure self-custody. Ultimately, the wallets of the future won’t just protect coins — they’ll embody a philosophy of verifiable trust and transparency. Open hardware, open firmware, and open cryptography are the only sustainable path toward long-term, quantum-resistant security. Disclaimer: This article may be in collaboration with a valued partner.

Title: PayPal, BlackRock, Fidelity – Inside Ethereum’s $18.6B tokenization boom

The network is fast becoming the home of real-world finance. PayPal’s PYUSD hit $18.6B in transfer volume and tokenized fund AUM jumped 2,000%. ETH remains range-bound below $3,500, with weak momentum and neutral derivatives data. Ethereum’s [ETH] on-chain economy is entering a new phase. PayPal’s stablecoin volume keeps climbing, and major financial institutions are now moving real funds on-chain. Tokenization isn’t just an idea anymore. It’s quickly becoming one of Ethereum’s strongest growth engines. PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD, hit its strongest quarter yet: $18.6 billion in transfer volume on Ethereum. This is a massive 260% jump year-over-year. The chart showed a steady climb across every quarter since early 2024, showing growing usage among both retail and institutional users. Source: X What’s driving this surge is simple: PayPal’s integration with onchain payments is turning PYUSD into one of Ethereum’s most active stablecoins. Tokenized funds on Ethereum have exploded, up nearly 2,000% since January 2024. The chart showed a clear inflection point earlier this year, driven by traditional giants like BlackRock and Fidelity launching on-chain versions of their funds. Source: X What started as a niche experiment in tokenized treasuries has turned into a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem. Simply put, the world’s biggest asset managers are validating Ethereum as the base layer for real-world finance. Ethereum was struggling to regain strength above the $3,500 mark at press time. The chart showed price action consolidating below the 9-day EMA, so short-term momentum was muted. RSI was at 37.7, indicating weak buying pressure, while the CMF at -0.10 indicates capital outflows from the market. Source: TradingView Trading volumes were subdued, which proves a lack of conviction among bulls. Source: Coinalyze Derivatives data support this caution. ETH’s Open Interest (OI) has slipped to around $17.6 billion, while Funding Rates remain near neutral at 0.0098%. ETH is seeing low leveraged activity. With volumes thinning and sentiment cooling, ETH remains range-bound unless a decisive breakout above $3,500 restores bullish conviction.

Title: Why BlackRock remains bullish on Bitcoin despite recent price slowdown

BlackRock frames Bitcoin's adoption, liquidity depth, and legacy system decline as drivers of long-term strategic value. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s recent struggle to hold the $100,000 level has revived familiar doubts about whether institutional demand is durable. However, in a new filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, BlackRock signals the opposite conclusion, saying its conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term relevance remains intact despite short-term market weakness. The firm frames Bitcoin as a decades-long structural theme shaped by adoption curves, liquidity depth, and the declining credibility of legacy monetary systems. While this view acknowledges volatility, it argues that Bitcoin’s strategic value is accelerating faster than its price suggests. That tone contrasts with a market where each pullback often renews questions about institutional endurance. A central pillar of BlackRock’s argument is Bitcoin’s network-growth profile, which it describes as one of the fastest seen in any modern technology cycle. The filing cites adoption estimates showing that Bitcoin surpassed 300 million global users roughly 12 years after launch, outpacing both mobile phones and the early internet, which each took significantly longer to reach similar thresholds. For BlackRock, this curve is more than a data point. It reframes Bitcoin as a long-duration asset whose value reflects cumulative network participation rather than month-to-month price moves. The firm also includes a decade-long performance matrix showing that, despite wild swings in individual years, which often place Bitcoin at either the top or bottom of annual return tables, its cumulative and annualized performance still exceeds that of equities, gold, commodities, and bonds. That framing positions volatility as a built-in cost of exposure rather than a structural flaw. For an asset manager whose products are designed for multi-decade allocations rather than short-cycle momentum trades, temporary stagnation appears less like a warning and more like a familiar feature of Bitcoin’s cyclical rhythm. The filing also emphasizes that the asset’s current slowdown has not dented institutional participation. If anything, BlackRock argues, Bitcoin’s underlying fundamentals of digital adoption, macroeconomic uncertainty, and the expansion of regulated market infrastructure continue to strengthen even as spot prices cool. A second theme in the filing is the argument that BlackRock’s own product, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has reshaped access to the asset in ways that support deeper institutional involvement. The firm highlights three areas, including simplified exposure, enhanced liquidity, and the integration of regulated custody and pricing rails. BlackRock stated that IBIT reduces operational frictions by allowing institutions to hold Bitcoin through a structure they already understand. According to the firm, custody risks, key-management issues, and technical onboarding, which have historically been barriers for institutions, are abstracted away in favor of traditional settlement channels. At the same time, BlackRock also highlighted liquidity as one of the most significant impacts IBIT has had on the market. Since its launch, the product has become the most actively traded Bitcoin ETF, contributing to tighter spreads and deeper order books. For large allocators, execution quality acts as a form of validation: the more liquid the product, the more institutionally acceptable the underlying asset becomes. Moreover, BlackRock also highlighted its multi-year infrastructure work with Coinbase Prime, regulated price benchmarks, and strict audit frameworks as evidence that Bitcoin exposure can now be delivered with standards comparable to equities or fixed income. Because of that design, the firm has processed more than $3 billion in in-kind transfers — a sign, it says, of institutional and whale confidence in its custody architecture. Notably, IBIT flows reinforce all of the points above. Since its launch, IBIT has emerged as the dominant Bitcoin ETF product in the market, with cumulative net inflows of $64.45 billion and over $80 billion in assets under management. In fact, IBIT’s inflows for this year have outpaced all of the combined flows recorded by the other 10 Bitcoin products in the market, according to K33 Research data. The most assertive section of the filing is labeled “global monetary alternative.” BlackRock describes Bitcoin as a scarce, decentralized asset positioned to benefit from persistent geopolitical disorder, rising debt burdens, and long-term erosion in fiat credibility. The firm does not frame Bitcoin as a direct replacement for sovereign currencies, but the implication is clear: the asset’s relevance increases as traditional monetary systems face stress. BlackRock also situates Bitcoin within a broader technological transition. As the most widely adopted cryptocurrency, Bitcoin functions as a proxy bet on the mainstreaming of digital-asset infrastructure, including blockchain-based payments, settlement systems, and financial market rails. In this context, Bitcoin has two intertwined identities as a monetary hedge and a technological exposure. This dual narrative helps explain BlackRock’s sustained bullishness. One pillar of the thesis is macroeconomic, tied to inflation dynamics, fiscal trajectory, and geopolitical fragmentation. The other is structural, tied to the ongoing global expansion of blockchain networks. Considering this, the recent slow price action does not meaningfully disrupt either thesis.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Paul Sperry / @paulsperry_ Paul Sperry is an investigative reporter for RealClearInvestigations. When Sen. Elizabeth A. Warren recently traveled to the Big Apple to endorse New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, she was asked if overt socialism is really the best model for Democrats to adopt. “You bet,” she replied in her signature folksy style. The Boston lawmaker wasn’t just jumping on the sudden trendiness of socialism three-and-a-half decades after its near-extinction. With Senate fellow traveler Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Warren has been a catalyst for moving her party to the left since her first campaign in 2012. She and Sanders are, in many ways, the godparents of the self-avowed democratic socialists such as Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who are providing the youthful energy for the Democrats in the Trump era. As Warren’s attacks on Wall Street and the wealthy are gaining even wider traction among liberals—a recent Gallup poll found 66% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism—the apparent contradictions between her public economic positions and private financial decisions are receiving new scrutiny, particularly as the onetime presidential candidate appears to be testing those waters again. Financial records examined by RealClearInvestigations show that Warren has hardly followed the path of socialism in her personal finances. Start with the redistribution of wealth. Warren tirelessly bashes the “selfish” and “greedy” rich for not paying their “fair share,” and demands the government step in and redistribute their income to the poor. But charity does not always begin in the Warren home. While Warren hauls in nearly $1 million a year, she donated less than 3% of her household income to charity in 2024, according to her tax returns. This is much less than the charity of the Obamas, for instance, who typically donate more than 20% of their earnings to the needy and philanthropic causes, and low for the average American in her income bracket, studies show. The average millionaire donates more than twice her share. It also appears that Warren opens her pocketbook wider when she’s running for national office and under a bigger media microscope. The $26,669 in charitable deductions Warren reported on her tax returns last year pales in comparison to the $81,858, or 9% of income, she reported as she launched her campaign for the White House in 2020. And the outspoken Democratic leader keeps her own tax burden down while calling for higher taxes on “millionaires and billionaires.” Records show Warren is not averse to taking maximum advantage of provisions in a tax code she denounces as unfair. She has, for example, written off used articles of clothing on her taxes and has had to correct past returns for inflating the value of those items. She’s also written off thousands of dollars in used books—and even in-flight Wi-Fi—to expense down business income. And she would exempt herself from her proposed “Ultra-Millionaire Tax,” which levies a surtax on those with a net worth above $50 million. With a net worth of at least $8 million (with estimates as high as $12 million), Warren has benefited handsomely from free market capitalism—even as she has spent most of her career in the public and educational sectors. Despite her frequent complaints that “the wealthiest 10% of U.S. households own 84% of American-held shares” of stock, she has invested the bulk of her money in stocks and bonds managed by Wall Street investment funds. These accounts are valued at between $1.9 million and $6.8 million, according to her most recent Senate financial disclosures, filed in April. (Values are given as ranges in the disclosure reports that members of Congress are required to file each year.) Although Warren has rarely traded individual stocks, records show the mutual funds where she has parked her millions—Vanguard and TIAA-CREF—hold a number of companies in industries that Warren has demonized, including Big Oil, Big Tech, and Big Pharma. Through these funds, for example, Warren has invested in Apple, Amazon, and NVIDIA; Exxon and Shell; Wells Fargo; Goldman Sachs; Monsanto; Johnson & Johnson; and even NewsCorp.—the owner of conservative Fox News and the New York Post. Nevertheless, Warren has ripped “fat cat bankers” at Wells Fargo for preying on minority homebuyers and customers with “predatory” rates and “junk” fees, and also for “screwing” their own employees. She even demanded the Federal Reserve revoke Wells Fargo’s status as a financial holding company over “abusive and unlawful” practices. Warren has called for regulators to break up tech giants Amazon and Apple, which she claims are running monopolies. “I’m sick of freeloading [tech] billionaires” who “roll over everyone,” she said recently. Warren has described Exxon as a “bad actor” that contributes to global warming. She’s even accused the energy giant of “corporate perjury” by publicly denying its alleged role in warming and producing “fake research” to “mislead the American people about climate change.” The senator has also slammed Exxon for “imposing massive price increases on Americans [sic] families,” arguing “this corporate greed is inexcusable.” Environmental activist groups have called on her chosen retirement fund, TIAA, to divest from Exxon, along with the rest of its more than $78 billion in oil, gas, and coal assets, according to a recent estimate by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. They argue the fund is using contributions from investors like Warren to “destroy communities and the environment.” Last year, Warren bashed Donald Trump for capitulating to the oil industry. “Donald Trump has a deal for Big Oil: if they raise $1 billion and send him back to the White House, he’ll gut environmental protections and roll back Joe Biden’s progress in fighting climate change,” she asserted on the social media platform X. “It’s corruption, pure and simple. And it would be a disaster for our planet.” Slamming the president’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill” earlier this year, Warren complained, “Trump’s tax cuts stand to benefit [the] highest-income earners.” She would know: She’s one of them. The $919,583 in household income Warren reported on her 2024 tax return she filed jointly with her husband puts her in the top 1% of highest-earning Americans. The year before she entered the Senate, Warren reported earning $616,181. The lawmaker’s base Senate salary of $174,000 accounts for just one-fifth of the total income she reported to the IRS. The rest comes from book royalties, dividends, capital gains, earned interest, retirement income, and husband Bruce Mann’s salary as a tenured Harvard professor. The Senate is often described as a Millionaire’s Club, and she fits right in: Her $8 million net worth would rank her as the 18th wealthiest member of the Senate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Warren’s net worth has risen each year since she was first elected to the Senate in 2012, while the median wealth of senators overall has declined, according to the think tank. Although Warren is just one of many millionaires in Congress, government watchdogs note her wealth is at odds with the stridency of her class-warfare rhetoric. “Elizabeth Warren poses as the champion of the underdog, but her policies strip middle- and lower-income Americans of opportunities to advance their lot and build wealth,” said John Berlau, director of finance policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, referring to her calls for more taxes and financial red tape. “By pursuing policies that keep others from moving up, Sen. Warren has emerged as an unlikely champion of the existing 1%.” Warren did not reply to requests for comment. Critics note that several of Warren’s former staff members have moved on to positions in the sectors she decries. In 2023, she declared, “The abuse of the revolving door is appalling,” particularly in the financial sector, which she claims is “rigged to help the wealthy and well-connected.” But records show her own office has served as a revolving door for the banks. For example, Wally Adeyemo, who served as her chief of staff when she was standing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, went on to work as a senior adviser at investment giant BlackRock. At least six other Warren staffers who worked in her Senate office have worked as lobbyists, records show. In addition, several of her senior campaign aides have worked on K Street. “There is a history of a revolving door of Warren staffers and protégés at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau taking jobs at big Wall Street firms, such as BlackRock,” Berlau said. Homeownership is also key to wealth-building, but zoning restrictions often price the working class out of homes. Warren has fought against so-called NIMBY (“not in my backyard”) rules and has fiercely advocated for building more affordable housing in cities. She even backs Mamdani’s “social housing” proposal to let the New York state government seize private properties and convert them into public housing. However, Warren has chosen to live in affluent neighborhoods in Boston and in Washington, D.C., that are heavily zoned to exclude the construction of new housing units and price out the average homebuyer. Public financial statements do not disclose the 76-year-old legislator’s real estate holdings, but other records show she owns at least two homes valued at more than $5 million. Her primary residence is located in the leafy Avon Hill section of Cambridge, Mass., which has enforced a century-old zoning system of minimum lot sizes, minimum parking requirements, floor area ratios, limits on units per building, and height restrictions. The restrictions have yielded a housing shortage in the city that has driven up the value of existing homes—including Warren’s 1876 Victorian mansion, which has risen eightfold to an estimated $4 million since she bought it in 1995. Records show she and her husband owe no mortgage on their nearly 4,000-square-foot home, which features three stories, high ceilings, marble mantels, hardwood floors, and a four-car garage. The median price for a home in Cambridge now tops $2.2 million. “The astronomical increase in the value of Warren’s home, and home prices in Cambridge more generally, has not happened in a vacuum,” said Scott Van Voorhis, a Boston real estate analyst. “The city’s special blend of upscale NIMBYism and restrictive zoning laws and regulations kept new house, condo, and apartment construction to a trickle at best, even as demand for living in the city increased leaps and bounds.” Though the Cambridge City Council earlier this year loosened its zoning ordinances to permit more housing across the city, Warren’s neighborhood remains largely exempt from reforms. That’s because Avon Hill is a conservation district further regulated by the Cambridge Historical Commission. Records show Warren’s street and home are located within the historic district, which protects old Victorians from being torn down for multifamily housing. That makes her neighborhood the ultimate safe NIMBY zone. “Nothing has been built [in her neighborhood] for decades beyond the occasional mansion upgrade,” Van Voorhis noted. Warren clearly understands there is a housing supply problem in Boston. In July, she helped shepherd the ROAD to Housing Act through the Senate, which, among other things, would provide grants to communities that change their land-use rules to make it easier to build new housing units. “We have a real problem here in Massachusetts that we simply don’t have enough housing,” Warren explained to The Boston Globe, noting the state is about 200,000 units short of what is needed. “If we don’t start building more housing here, the housing crisis will continue to intensify.” But when it comes to her own neighborhood—one of the least affordable in the state—she remains silent. Cambridge City Council members noted they didn’t hear “a peep” from Warren when they were recently debating zoning reforms to deal with the city’s growing housing affordability crisis. In 2013, when Warren bought her home in Washington, D.C., she also happened to select an area of the capital city where zoning restrictions have entrenched the status quo. Valued at more than $1 million, her condo is in the trendy Penn Quarter section of the District of Columbia, which is a historic area protected by land-use rules. Most famously, Warren’s personal decisions seem at odds with the Left’s leavening of traditional socialist positions with identity politics. Before moving to the Senate, Warren was a tenured professor at Harvard with a lucrative salary. Although the school denies that her claims to Native American ancestry influenced their decision to hire her, she and the administration trumpeted her diverse background. Warren also listed herself as a racial minority in a legal directory distributed by the Association of American Law Schools and was listed as a Native American in federal forms filed by Harvard Law School. When she launched her political career in 2012 and released a memoir, “A Fighting Chance,” Warren described her alleged “Native American roots” as a Cherokee. Henry Holt & Company paid her a $525,000 advance for the book, which became a national bestseller that still earns her royalties. She also helped publish a cookbook, “Pow Wow Chow,” exploiting the myth of her Native American lineage. Warren took in $430,000 a year as a tenured Harvard Law professor by claiming a Native American heritage—even as she has railed against whites appropriating minority culture or pretending to understand minority experiences. But, as she ramped up her run for the White House, Warren responded to persistent challenges of this claim by taking a DNA test. In late 2018, her campaign maintained it showed “strong evidence” of Native American ancestry dating back generations. When that failed to quiet her critics, Warren basically had to acknowledge that the test revealed that she is as little as 1/1,024th Native American, making her less of that ancestry than the average white American. She also eventually apologized to the Cherokee Nation in 2019. The year before that admission, however, she lectured others during her Senate campaign about stolen valor: “It is wrong and cowardly for people to make fraudulent statements in order to receive distinctions that they have not earned. We need to ensure that no one can benefit from making false claims and steal the true valor of the courageous.” “If there ever were a genuine case of cultural appropriation, Sen. Warren is guilty of it,” said Gad Saad, a business professor at Concordia University, adding: She literally appropriated Native American culture as her own by constructing a false narrative about her ancestry. “And yet,” he added, “she benefited for several decades from this false narrative, both in her academic and political career.” Saad and others who have closely followed her career suggest the progressive senator appears to have a “good for me, but not for thee” ethic when it comes to her own personal ambitions. Though she’s carefully groomed a reputation as a fighter for the “have-nots” against the “haves,” the record shows that, outside the spotlight, she has often pursued her own interests and followed the path of the haves.

Title: Home debut a 'pretty special' experience for O'Brien

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist After his short international career to date had taken him through Tbilisi, Lisbon and Chicago, Tommy O'Brien was finally able to enjoy the real deal at home. The 27-year-old Dubliner won his fourth Irish cap in Saturday's 41-10 win against Japan, but his first in front of an Aviva audience. Friends and family in the crowd, Amhrán na bhFiann, and a different kind of nervous excitement. "That was pretty special," he said of the experience. "I had some family out. My grandparents came out; they haven’t been to a game since I was probably 18. They’re proper glory supporters, they came out for the Irish game. No, I’m only messing. "I was having a look during the anthems to see if I could spot anyone but I didn’t, which was probably a good thing. It might have sent me over the edge. But it was good, really special." The Leinster wing (below) was the standout player in an otherwise forgettable game of rugby, earning the man of the match award for a performance that saw him run for 143 metres off 12 carries, while making four clean breaks and winning two turnovers. He capped the day off with a try right at the end, but it was a score that capped off an excellent individual display rather than one which defined it. Drifting inside Sam Prendergast off a turnover, O’Brien steamed onto a delicate offload from the out-half before stepping on the gas to score his fifth international try, and first at Lansdowne Road. "Me and Sammy were on the same page, I could see he was going across but he didn’t have the wheels to take it the whole way so I dropped under him and he knew what I was going to do. It was nice to be on the same page like that. "I gave a nice little fist pump into the crowd afterwards, which was cool, but I was blowing hard getting back. "Sammy gave me a nice 50-metre run-in so I had to give it my all. I couldn’t get caught there!" The Blackrock man has taken to international rugby excellently after injuries forced his career to stutter during his mid-20s. He dipped his toe into the Test game during the summer versus Georgia and Portugal, scoring two tries in each of those games, and with Mack Hansen out injured, he was retained in the 14 shirt for the first two matches of this Quilter Nations Series block. "Obviously the summer tour was great to get in and get a taste of it, and then the last few weeks were a step up in terms of the level," he said. "The All Blacks game was very physical but I felt like I belonged at that level. I didn’t feel like I was shocked or anything like that but it’s just the margins are very small and you’ve got to nail every little small moment." FT: Ireland 41-10 Japan Much better from Ireland in the second half with Tommy O'Brien with their final try in their win over Japan at the Aviva Stadium. 📺 RTÉ2 🖥️ https://t.co/b2OI4OoWVJ ✍️ https://t.co/x26q4bjNM0 pic.twitter.com/B3s3dgkVmz It has taken O'Brien longer than he would have liked to become an Ireland international, but that isn't necessarily a negative as he reflects on the player he is today. "I'm also probably a lot more mature than I would have been, maybe if I was 22 or 23 or whatever. "So that probably helps me in terms of not being as nervous coming into the games. "I feel like I've worked very hard. I've had so many downs, so I just enjoy these kind of experiences, in these days. "I guess when you’re in [the game] it’s another rugby game, you’ve been doing it your whole life. I’ve been playing it since I was four years old. It’s kind of what I’ve been telling myself before I go out, 'it’s just another game of rugby’. "Obviously, you want to be able to feed off the crowd and the magnitude of everything and allow yourself to go to another level in terms of finding stuff within you physically that you didn’t realise you had, and using the crowd in that capacity. "But in terms of weighing on you and nervousness, I’ve actually been okay thankfully. Yeah really enjoying myself so far." © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Liberal Elites Kicked the Door Wide Open for Trump’s Flagrant Corruption

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED The president’s corruption is audaciously out in the open, but decades of letting the wealthy play by their own rules enabled him. Dylan is a senior researcher at the Revolving Door Project, where she leads RDP’s Economic Media Project. In his first term, Donald Trump appeared to be gunning for the title of most corrupt president in U.S. history. But after taking advantage of four years on the sidelines to ruminate about how to do better, he’s blown all competition completely out of the water in the nine months since retaking the Oval Office. Trump set off a media firestorm in 2017 by breaking from tradition and not placing his assets in a blind trust, instead choosing to entrust them to his children. The conflicts of interest invited by this farce were met with lawsuits, and #Resistance activists spoke about the emoluments clause of the Constitution as though they were constitutional law professors. Some reporting called this a “halfway blind” trust, which is sort of like a halfway-cooked chicken in that, for practical purposes, it’s a nonstarter. But after Trump left office in 2021, the Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuits, and Merrick Garland, Biden’s spineless attorney general, slow-rolled any investigations into the former president. Faced with few consequences for this first round of graft, Trump and company have flouted even the appearance of adhering to ethical guidelines since his reelection in November. The presidential transition process was delayed by the Trump campaign not filing internal ethics guidance for the transition team, and the inauguration fund’s coffers were filled with many millions of dollars from donors eager to get on the president’s good side. That panhandling set the tone for the administration. In October, a Trump benefactor gave $130 million to stave off what would have been a major political liability and cover the paychecks for service members during the government shutdown. The office space Eleanor Roosevelt once occupied has been unceremoniously bulldozed to make way for a gargantuan ballroom, also being funded by corporate “donations” from the likes of BlackRock, Booz Allen Hamilton, and tech giants like Apple and Amazon. The sticker price of the project has soared from $200 million to $350 million. To add insult to injury, the donors will likely write off their bribes to the latest Trump event venue as charitable contributions, as economist Dean Baker laid out. The president is working to intervene in negotiations around the sale of Warner Brothers–Discovery to ensure that his longtime supporters, the Ellisons, are able to add on to their growing media empire. And that’s just the past couple of weeks! It’s not for nothing that my colleagues at the Revolving Door Project have had more than enough material for a biweekly rundown in our Corruption Calendar. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington also recently published a timeline tracking national and state corruption since January 20. While Trumpian corruption is striking in frequency, scale, and just how routine it is starting to feel, this administration was the logical endpoint of the long-standing tradition of elite impunity. The second Trump administration is a striking monument to governmental misconduct, but the ground was broken long ago, with both parties laying the foundation. For the past half century, corporate and white-collar crime have gone largely unenforced. This was the result of both a widespread shift in views of governance (à la the Reagan Revolution) and a coordinated plan orchestrated to enable private wealth to hijack our democracy, as David Sirota and Jared Jacang Maher documented in their new book “Master Plan,” building on a podcast of the same name. Trump himself is a byproduct of the wealthy being empowered to violate the law. Seemingly his entire pre-government career was predicated on getting away with gaming bankruptcy law, committing widespread financial fraud, and racial discrimination. Now, in government, he is employing the “blitzscaling” model pioneered by firms like Uber to break the law faster than anyone can keep up with. The relentlessness of the Trump administration’s criminality is the point; it becomes borderline impossible to tackle any single instance of corruption if two more spring up by the time you finish reading up on it. This “flood the zone” strategy has been the hallmark of Trump 2.0. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept? By signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Calls for Democrats to find their way back from the wilderness by forcefully rebuking corporate influence and corruption, something we at the Revolving Door Project have been urging as the cornerstone of progressive politics for years, are multiplying. Politicians, notably Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, both Democrats, are emerging as anti-corruption champions. To mount a real anti-corruption agenda, though, Democrats must go farther than just condemning the sundry glad-handing of Trump world. There is no appetite for going back to the halcyon days when everyone knew the legal code was merely a suggestion for corporate titans and the ultra-rich, even as they masqueraded as law-abiding citizens. “ Since 2008, it has only become more apparent that the wealthy play by an entirely different set of rules.” The Great Recession was a turning point; the extent of corporate lawbreaking in the financial sector was laid bare. And, famously, hardly anyone ever went to jail. Obama-era regulators, in many ways the acme of our last half-century of the hands-off approach to ruling-class misconduct, earned rebuke and scorn as “the chickenshit club,” afraid to square up against the powerful, if not overtly committed to serve elite interests. Since 2008, it has only become more apparent that the wealthy play by an entirely different set of rules. Trump’s first election was, in part, built on the argument that he knew “how to play the game.” In this telling, his ability to break the rules was actually an asset because he would break them for you rather than just for the powerful. It was always a dubious pitch, but it’s understandable why — faced with the choice between someone trying to convince you the game that’s obviously been fixed is actually not rigged, and someone who tells you how they cheat and promise to help you get ahead a little bit — people would gravitate toward the latter. Part of the early MAGA mythos was built on resignation to the fact that our rule of law is fundamentally perverted to create two parallel tracks of justice: an unforgiving, punitive, carceral system for most people, and a cushy, consequence-free dinner party circuit for the ruling class. The answer isn’t simply to go back to electing more reasonable politicians. As long as the two tracks of our justice system diverge, the game stays rigged. Dethroning Trump will not be enough to restore real rule of law; the Biden administration is proof enough of that. Donald Trump was excised from the White House with historically bad public sentiment in the immediate aftermath of a failed coup. Under Biden, the Garland Justice Department tried to wind the clock back to 2016 and resume operating the way establishment politicians did in the 1990s and 2000s. It failed spectacularly, allowing bad actors like Elon Musk to grow ever more powerful while continuing to flout the law with impunity. The result was an embittered Trump who faced no real repercussions for his corruption — the worst-case scenario. If and when Democrats control the executive branch again, they will have an even more daunting task after the second Trump term than they did the first, and their existing body of work does not inspire confidence. Business-as-usual enforcement did not fail to rein in corruption over the last four years because of strategic missteps. It failed because it is incapable of rooting out undue elite influence that’s baked into the very essence of the way we became accustomed to enforcing the law. Trump is an extreme example, but he is the logical extreme. As Trump pardons business associates, sets up meetings for his children’s business interests with foreign leaders, and grows his personal wealth, the consequences of failing to hold the powerful to account are more obvious than ever. The answer isn’t simply to go back to electing more reasonable politicians. As long as the two tracks of our justice system diverge, the game stays rigged and the Trumpian appeal to America’s id will stay firmly entrenched. To dislodge the hold that corruption has on our government and restore the rule of law, Democrats will need to decide who they really are — and who they’ll fight for. IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT. What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. This is not hyperbole. Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy. Jessica Washington Sen. Dick Durbin said the fight proved “Republicans are not sensitive to health care insurance premiums and we are.” That won’t keep costs down.

Title: JPMorgan Discloses 64% Increase In BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Holdings In 2025 Q3 — Details

Global banking behemoth JPMorgan Chase has disclosed its increased exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency through BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). In the latest 13-F filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), JPMorgan disclosed its holding of 5,284,190 IBIT shares, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, as of September 30. This third-quarter figure represents a sharp 64% increase in the firm’s exposure to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. JPMorgan’s IBIT holdings, which were worth about $333 million as of September 30, are now valued at around $312 million. While the bank’s expanded position places it amongst one of the major institutional holders of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, it still sits behind other firms, like Goldman Sachs, with significantly larger holdings. Goldman Sachs disclosed that it held 30.8 million shares of IBIT in the first quarter of 2025. Furthermore, the filing with the SEC shows that JPMorgan held IBIT call options worth $68 million and put options worth $133 million as of September 30. The increased investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs is consistent with the bank’s price expectations for the flagship cryptocurrency. In a recent report, strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team shared that deleveraging in the crypto derivatives market, especially Bitcoin perpetual futures, appears to be mostly over. The JPMorgan analysts revealed that the recent rise in gold volatility has made BTC a more attractive investment option on a risk-adjusted basis. Using this gold-based model, the pundits argued that Bitcoin is fairly undervalued compared to gold and could see a significant upward movement to around $170,00 over the next 6 to 12 months. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $102,900, reflecting an over 1% jump in the past 24 hours. However, the premier cryptocurrency is still deep in the red on medium-term timeframes. According to data from CoinGecko, the BTC price is down by more than 6% in the last seven days. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has somewhat struggled over the past few weeks, registering significant withdrawals in the last two. According to data from SoSoValue, the exchange-traded fund posted a weekly net outflow of over $403 million in the previous week. Excluding its performance on Friday, November 7, BlackRock’s IBIT looks set to record a weekly net outflow of roughly $450 million. Nevertheless, the iShares Bitcoin Trust still ranks as the largest spot BTC exchange-traded fund with a net asset of $80.58 billion under management.

Title: Ian O’Riordan: Booming club numbers is not all good news

Rian Farrell was likely caught unawares this week when carving his name into the long annals of Irish athletics history. In registering with North Sligo AC, Farrell helped grow the Athletics Ireland club membership to 75,000 and it’s already tipped beyond that. November registration – when annual membership is counted – has now peaked at 75,078. It may have been a small gesture to name Farrell as their 75,000th member, but this is a big deal for Athletics Ireland, the governing body of the sport which has existed under various guises going back to the Irish Champions Athletic Club (ICAC) founded in 1873. It marks a 7 per cent increase on last November’s registration figure of 70,320 (the first to surpass the 70,000-mark), which in turn was a 9 per cent increase on the peak 2023 registration. All indications are the only way is up. Athletics, like many sports, also suffered a significant drop off in club membership during Covid-19. Registration more than halved in the first 12-month period during the pandemic, from 45,306 at the end of February 2020 to 19,702 at the end of February 2021. Growing that number above 75,000 is certainly impressive, and can be attributed to a variety of factors – not least in seeing Irish athletes enjoy their most successful ever year on the international stage. From the World Championships down to the European Youth Olympics, 21 medals were won, seven more than the previous best of 14 in 2019. In 2016, the international medal tally was three. [ Sonia O’Sullivan: With awards season upon us, Kate O’Connor should pick and chooseOpens in new window ] Role models and inspirations like this will help boost any sport and membership numbers are soaring across all ages and competitive levels. There is also a return of the running boom, the global phenomenon witnessed again last Sunday when there were 59,266 finishers in the New York City Marathon – breaking the previous record of 56,640 which finished the London Marathon last April. Athletics Ireland also pointed to the increased engagement at schools and community level and the rise in the number of athletics coaches trained through its education programmes. Until recent decades, Athletics Ireland and its many predecessors – including the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and Bord Lúthchleas na hÉireann (BLE) - were only concerned with the competitive end of the sport. As, in turn, were most of the athletics clubs. Not anymore. It’s not the winning that matters, it’s the taking part, and that goes for the roughly 360 clubs throughout all 32 counties. [ Ireland’s Fionnuala McCormack finishes 10th in New York City MarathonOpens in new window ] Yet, behind these numbers, many clubs are struggling to meet the demand for new membership. Particularly at juvenile level, with significant waiting lists now being the norm, especially among the biggest clubs in the country. That’s not good news, not if any young aspiring athletes are ultimately lost to other sports. Dundrum South-Dublin AC, better known as DSD, is a case in point. It’s far from the oldest club in Dublin – and positively modern compared to the likes of Clonliffe Harriers, founded in 1886, and Donore Harriers, founded in 1893. With 1,200 members, DSD is now the biggest athletics club in Ireland, but not alone in turning away younger members because there simply isn’t enough room. The club was founded 40 years ago, with the merging of Dundrum AC and South Dublin AC, and for lifelong DSD member Gerry McGrath, the first decade or two was about maintaining club membership at around 150. Enough to keep everyone happy, even if there was a struggle sometimes to find that critical fourth man on the club cross-country team. The 1,200 members are now perfectly split between a 50:50 gender balance, all the way up from under-8s to over-70s, and an even half of which, around 600, are juveniles (under-18). There is also that waiting list, which averages about 200. [ ‘Setting big dreams’: Where Ava Crean, Ireland’s newest marathon sensation, might go nextOpens in new window ] “It’s a pity we can’t take everyone,” says McGrath, “but that primary school age is quite intensive, in that you need one coach for every 10 kids. A kid at that age could also be on the waiting list for a few different athletics clubs. Because most of the Dublin clubs do have a waiting list at those ages. “We did have a strategic plan, a few years ago, to grow the club to 2,500 members. But we’re not actively recruiting in any area at the moment, we stalled all that last year, until we could get more of a grip on it. That might change, but we still have physical limitations. Even though we’re one of the best served clubs in terms of our own track and our own running trails.” It’s just three years since DSD opened its own home track and trails off Tibradden Road, just up the hill from its former natural training ground at Marlay Park. That project continues to expand with the addition of new indoor running straight and club hall, set to open next year. As well as the surge in demand for juvenile membership, McGrath also points to the growth in DSD’s training group – now rebranded as the Meet, Train & Race. “That started 15 years ago, with maybe three or four guys, maybe in their late 40s, who wanted to run a marathon for the first time. “Now our Meet & Train is well over 200 members, attracting a few new members every week. We had 80 members in the Dublin Marathon last month. The sport is surging at all levels like that. “The problem isn’t getting volunteer coaches. We have 130 volunteers, some who would do seven days a week, all voluntary, to maybe a mother or father, who helps out for an hour. But it still takes tremendous coordination.” Blackrock AC is another southside Dublin club that is booming, with a celebratory dinner in January to mark its 1,000 members for the first time. On the northside, Raheny Shamrock is developing its first home facility at St Assam’s Church, again to help meet the growing demand for membership. It all makes for healthy reading for Athletics Ireland, as long as waiting lists for juveniles don’t come at the cost of kids being lost to the sport.

Paul Henry’s Coastal Landscape with Galway Hookers Late taoiseach John A Costello is believed to have bought the painting directly from Henry A painting believed to have been bought directly from Irish artist Paul Henry by the late taois­each John A Costello will be offered for sale at auction later this month. Coastal Landscape with Galway Hookers, which is estimated to be worth €150,000, is one of two Henry paintings Costello left to his children. He died in 1976, aged 85. Dubliner Costello was also a barr­ister, attorney general and Fine Gael TD. He was taoiseach twice, from 1948 to 1951 and 1954 to 1957. James O’Halloran, director of ­Adam’s auction house in Dublin, said they sold one of the paintings “almost a decade ago and now we have been consigned the second”. The previous painting was sold for €115,000. Mr O’Halloran said it “is thought by his family that John A purchased the two paintings directly from the artist as there is no record of them being in any exhibition. The painting is unusual as it has two Irish traditional sailing boats, known as hookers, in it”. It has remained in the family since. Costello’s son Declan was also attorney general, and president of the High Court. He died in 2011 at the age of 84. Other works of interest in the upcoming auction is an oil painting by Jack B Yeats, dated to 1912 and entitled In a Dublin Waxworks, with an estimate of €70,000. Previously belonging to Guinness heir Garech Browne, it hung for many years in Luggala Estate in Co Wicklow. Late taoiseach John A Costello is believed to have bought the painting directly from Henry Yeats visited the old Dublin Waxworks in Henry Street in 1905 and made a sketch that he used as the basis for the work. It has a historical significance as a glimpse of a lost Dublin institution, which burnt down two years after the painting was completed. Sculpture is prominent in the sale, with works in bronze by Melanie Le Brocquy, John Behan, Imogen Stuart and Rowan Gillespie. Adam’s pre-Christmas sale of Important Irish Art will take place on November 26 in their St Stephen’s Green rooms at 6pm, and includes about 150 lots. Last week, deVeres auction house on Kildare Street in Dublin saw demand for Eileen Gray-designed items soar. Her famous Transat chair was sold for €10,500. It had an estimate of between €4,000 and €6,000. A blue leather bar stool designed by the renowned architect sold for €4,200; it had an estimate of €1,200. A Jumo lamp designed by Gray was valued at between €600 and €900 but went for €2,800. A set of six rosewood dining chairs by Danish designer Neils Moller made €10,500 - more than three times the asking price. A Svend Ge Madsen-designed Rosewood desk went for €7,000, more than double its estimate of between €2,000 and €3,000. Elsewhere, Adams Blackrock has an exclusive one-off jewellery auction featuring more than 750 pieces consigned by a long-established Irish jeweller that is closing its doors. Elena McCrory, senior associate with Adams Blackrock, said there has been an increase of “younger people interested in vintage jewellery due to sustainability and price. The price of gold has increased substantially, so nine-carat gold pieces garner a lot of interest”. The selection showcases a wide range of contemporary gold jewellery set with precious gemstones. The auction will take place online on Thursday.

Title: The forgotten Irish artist: How does an artist make thousands of artworks, then just disappear?

Great work tends to announce itself even without the benefit of hype. Many moons ago, when Paul Finucane was involved in setting up the medical school at the University of Limerick, in 2007, he and his colleagues decided to establish a collection of medicine-related art for the benefit of students at the college. “I came across a painting called Embryo with Gas Mask at an auction house,” Finucane says. A provocative piece, the work had been used, with its artist’s permission, on an anti-nuclear-power poster in the 1970s. “It’s the notion of an embryo needing to be protected from the environment by having a gas mask,” Finucane says. “While it’s a challenging image, there’s no question about the quality of the draughtsmanship.” Its creator’s name was Donal O’Sullivan. Finucane, a keen collector as well as founding dean of the school of medicine, embarked on a little detective work to learn more about him. This obscure artist, he discovered, had been prolific in the 1970s and 1980s. Based in Dublin, he had gone against the expressionism that was fashionable in Irish art circles at the time, trading instead in powerful, elegant and melancholy figurative art that often discomfited its viewers. A prize winner and college activist, O’Sullivan had been a mover and shaker in his early life; at one point he appeared in the front row of the audience of The Late Late Show to protest against inadequate facilities at the National College of Art, resulting in important reforms. Then mental-health frailties set in. O’Sullivan died by suicide in 1991, aged just 46. In subsequent decades, he was largely forgotten by the art world, his work left to gather dust. It was, Finucane says, an unfortunate lack of recognition. That oversight is being addressed in a handsome book about O’Sullivan’s life and work, which gathers together his creations with reminiscences from Robert Ballagh, Vincent Browne, Annie West, Una Sealy and Cóilín Murray, among other well-known names, along with deeply felt reflections from family and other friends. Finucane and Brendan Lyons of Red Barn Publishing, in west Co Cork, who suggested the book to mark what would have been O’Sullivan’s 80th birthday this year, hope to establish him as an important artist. “We tend to gravitate to stories around people who have not received the attention they deserve,” Finucane says. “Donal was someone who was able to argue for a cause but unable to do the same for his own work and career,” Lyons says. “He was a conundrum.” Ballagh, who wrote the foreword to the book, knew O’Sullivan as a young man – he had been friends with his brother – and appreciated his hard-won skill as a figurative artist. “My studio is in Stoneybatter, and opposite where I am there’s a rather large house which he had a flat in,” Ballagh says. “I used to bump into him. To develop the kind of skills that Donal had takes years and years of endeavour and commitment. Anyone who had an interesting face interested Donal. He was fascinated with Samuel Beckett’s face, with Alberto Giacometti’s face.” Born in 1945 in Dublin, O’Sullivan was, Ballagh says, a shy man who was “also quite convinced of what he was doing”. When he was growing up, his parents, Mary and Patrick, ran a grocery in Ranelagh called Lily’s Dairy. Donal was the fifth of six children, a dreamy character who loved playing with his toy soldiers and drawing constantly, taking the greaseproof paper that separated the layers of Coconut Cream biscuits and working faces into the stains left on the paper. [ How did a small Irish architectural firm come to design one of the world’s biggest museums?Opens in new window ] “He enjoyed a bit of craic – as family we’d all have a loud laugh, and we’d sit together and the craic would bounce back and forth – but he was anxious nearly all of the time,” says his sister Marie O’Sullivan, a fellow artist, who also contributes to the book. “Even to go out the door it took effort.” After studying architecture for a year at Bolton Street College of Technology, in an effort to do something sensible, O’Sullivan switched to the National College of Art, then based on Kildare Street. It wasn’t long before his talents were noticed. He won the Taylor Prize twice, in 1967 and 1968, while at the college. Gerald Davis, of the Davis Gallery on Capel Street, offered him an exhibition while he was still a student, and Suzanne MacDougald showed his work at her Lad Lane Gallery. A distinctive presence dressed in black, with a helmet of hair and a Crombie coat, O’Sullivan had a painstaking working method that relied on sometimes frowned-upon techniques. He drew from images ripped from newspapers – a practice forbidden at art college – and would etch on bread paper, the thin tissue used to wrap loaves. He wasn’t a natural agitator, but he’d had the benefit of a good education as a student at Blackrock College, in South Dublin, and was dismayed by the deficiencies he found at the National College of Art, which was using outmoded methods of teaching, and in any case had inadequate premises. After months of peaceful protest, O’Sullivan, a charismatic spokesman for the student body, decided enough was enough. The students staged a sleep-in from April 22nd until May 28th, 1969. “If you want to protest about a situation, after everything else has failed, you just bring it to a halt, you have a work-in. If you want to stop something happening in a college, you occupy it,” he told The Irish Times on June 19th that year. The protests succeeded. In 1971 the college moved to its current location, on Thomas Street in the Liberties. “He’d be shy and anxious and on edge,” Marie O’Sullivan says of her brother. “But he wouldn’t let that stop him protesting. He would force himself to go in and talk to Brian Lenihan” – minister for education at the time – “and be that public if he felt strongly about something”. Donal’s work was very lyrical, romantic, meticulously drawn, at a time when people were painting brutal commentaries After graduating with an honours diploma, O’Sullivan set himself up in a chaotic studio in an old henhouse in the garden of his family home, on the corner of Ranelagh Road and Sallymount Avenue. A few chickens that remained would cluck over the work he discarded, leaving deposits to which he paid little heed. The hens weren’t his only challenge. The climate at the time was harsh on artists. O’Sullivan was prolific: his studio was crammed with discarded drawings in charcoal and pencil, some of famous names, such as Sinéad O’Connor. Over his lifetime he would make thousands of artworks. But they didn’t seem to offer a vital critique of Ireland in the manner of work by other artists of the day, and he struggled to promote himself, failing to turn up even to his own exhibition launches. He found his main employment as a teacher at Dún Laoghaire School of Art and Design. “Dublin was a grim city,” says Una Sealy, an artist and former student of O’Sullivan’s. “A lot of it was falling down. A lot of the Georgian buildings were either being demolished or held up with girders. There was massive unemployment. Donal’s work was very lyrical, romantic, meticulously drawn, at a time when people were painting brutal commentaries.” Figures such as Patrick Graham and Brian Maguire drove a particular creative vision. “They would have been the artists that people looked up to in the late 1970s and 1980s. Donal’s work was of a high standard, and it has held that quality. But there was a couple of decades when that would not have been in fashion.” Persuading people to buy art was itself quite a feat. “I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s,” Paul Finucane says, “and about the only thing you’d ever see in somebody’s house was a Sacred Heart lamp and a photograph of the pope and maybe John F Kennedy. To have any kind of original art would have been considered a gross waste of money.” A notice from the Evening Press in 1981 carps that O’Sullivan is “too shy to attend his own exhibition but has no handicap when it comes to putting a price on the tag. It’s a pity, really, that people of undoubted talent gain their exclusivity by putting their work out of reach of the many who have vacant places on their walls.” [ A Syrian artist who took refuge in Dublin: ‘Picasso came to this life to open a door. I hope I can open a door’Opens in new window ] Then there was the melancholy aspect to his work that sometimes put people off. “There’s a sadness to his work,” his sister says. “That’s what hits people. People see a kind of darkness. If I was to show his work to someone who has never seen it before, they would nearly always come back and say there’s a darkness or sadness to it.” At certain times in his life O’Sullivan was on medication for anxiety and depression. He became a heavy drinker. He had lengthy stays in hospital, where he seemed to have undergone electroconvulsive therapy: a handwritten poem reflects on the experience. There is great pain in Marie O’Sullivan’s voice when she talks about those periods. A section of the book is devoted to recollections of the Ana Liffey Drug Project, the addiction-aid service where O’Sullivan gave some art-therapy and counselling time. “It was amazing for him to put himself forward to try and help while he was still struggling,” she says. “He was involved in so many things.” By the time the artist died, in 1991, he had fallen out of touch with many of his old friends. When Brendan Lyons began tracking them down, many were delighted to have the opportunity to talk about O’Sullivan and his effect on them. At the book’s recent launch at Cnoc Buí Arts Centre, in Union Hall in west Cork, where Mel Mercier performed an original composition set to O’Sullivan’s poetry, several contributors spoke about their relationship with O’Sullivan, reflecting on his many gifts as a listener, encourager and friend. “I learned so much from him,” Joan Cronin, his former girlfriend, said. “He was generous with his knowledge. I enjoyed the arts, but he gave me the confidence to be critically thinking about it.” For Marie O’Sullivan, who has spent years seeking to re-energise interest in her brother’s art, the attention has been hugely gratifying. “There were so many stories. At the launch, things came up that I didn’t realise. Each person had their own little story of the time they spent with him. I didn’t actually break down – I was afraid I would – but I was very close to tears.” The contributors hope that the book will go some way towards restoring O’Sullivan to his rightful place in Irish art and that curators might pay more attention to his work. “I’d be much more interested in some of the institutions taking an interest in him than the auction houses,” Ballagh says. For Sealy, it’s important that a younger generation of artists become acquainted with him. “Younger artists won’t know who he is,” she says. “He was a very important part of Irish art. What he has done has contributed to what people are doing now. It’s important that this record of his life has been compiled by Brendan and Paul. It’s cementing his legacy.” In a life cut short, the work still speaks, even now. “I’m optimistic,” Marie O’Sullivan says of the future. “Very optimistic.” Donal O’Sullivan: An Artist Remembered, by Paul Finucane and Brendan Lyons, is published by Red Barn; it is available from cnocbuiarts.ie/publications and selected bookshops Sign up to the Irish Times books newsletter for features, podcasts and more © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ethereum: How $10B short squeeze could fuel ETH past $4,500

Here are top three factors that increased the odds of a short squeeze on Ethereum. Massive shorts above price on top of buyer activity and bullish sentiment increased the chances of a short squeeze. Only if the current momentum persists, breaking all resistances below the mark, can Ethereum reach $4,500. Ethereum[ETH] surged by only 5% in the recent market bounce after liquidating shorts that came in at the bottom. The market was showing signs of a reversal, with massive shorts at risk of liquidation. The addition of buy orders from whales and institutions on top of shifting sentiment all set the altcoin up for a run toward $4,500. As of press time, Ethereum price liquidated late short orders that came in below the $3,600 mark after dropping to $3,200. Massive shorts were building above the $3,600 zone, while those of latecomers were disappearing. Over $10 billion in Ethereum liquidity was stacked between $3,600 and $4,500, just above the current prices. Source: CoinGlass Based on current market patterns, Ethereum’s price may be approaching a key breakout zone. If buy orders push past the $3,600 level, it could trigger a rapid short squeeze, potentially driving the price beyond $4,500. Because liquidity is tightly clustered near these levels, short sellers may not have time to react. Whales and institutions were capitalizing on the dip as they were accumulating between $3,000 and $3,400. For instance, a Bitcoin insider whale who had shorted BTC just before the tariff crash took a long position on Ethereum. The whale placed a 5x leverage long on Ethereum, with the position amounting to 40,000 ETH valued at $138 million. His closure of the BTC long position was a hint that ETH could rise faster than Bitcoin in the current conditions. Source: Mister Crypto/X That was not the only buy on ETH. BlackRock also bought $35 million worth of Ethereum, as per CryptoGoos. This further supported a potential comeback for ETH price amid shifting market sentiment. Speaking of market sentiment, the crowd and smart money were all bullish on Ethereum. In fact, the informed money was more convinced than the retailers, as the sentiment gauge read 0.23 against 0.21. Source: Market Prophit This was reflected across the entire crypto market, which rose by 1.35%, at press time. All these observations pointed to a looming short squeeze that could take the price past $4,500. However, the charts indicated that for this price to be hit, short-term levels at $3,460, $3,900, and $4,200 had to be cleared. Source: TradingView Therefore, breaking these zones could push the price past $4,500, as all factors were aligning for such an undertaking.

Title: ZCash (ZEC) Euphoria Is Finally Here — Time To Cash In?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. ZCash (ZEC) has been one of the highlight performers in the cryptocurrency market over the past few months. Although the general digital asset market has faltered in recent weeks, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency has continued to ascend to new price highs. While the large-cap assets have been waxing and waning in terms of market value, the price of ZCash has been on a tear in the past week, breaking into the list of the top-20 largest cryptocurrencies in the sector. Now, the latest on-chain data suggests that euphoria is setting in the ZEC market. In a November 7 post on social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson revealed that the ZCash market might be overheating after weeks of significant upward price movement. According to the on-chain expert, the sentiment surrounding the coin seems to have finally reached the euphoria stage. Wedson noted that the group of network participants mostly behind this euphoria is the ZEC miners. This on-chain observation revolves around two primary metrics, including the Puell Multiple and the Hash Rate. For context, the Puell Multiple is a metric that correlates the issuance value of an asset to its 365-day moving average. This metric measures miners’ profitability on an annualized basis, signaling potential market tops or bottoms. According to the highlighted data from Alphractal, the ZCash Puell Multiple just hit an all-time high, indicating significantly high profitability for the miners. This on-chain signal also suggests that the ZEC price could still have more room for upside movement. Furthermore, Wedson revealed that the ZCash Hash Rate is on a rapid ascent, meaning that miners are devoting more computational resources to the privacy-focused network. As seen with the premier cryptocurrency, a rising Hash Rate often coincides with extended price rallies. Ultimately, the increasing Puell Multiple and rising Hash Rate signals strong network fundamentals for ZCash, which suggests that the price growth seen so far is not solely market speculation. As of this writing, the price of ZCash stands at around $714, reflecting an over 30% jump in the past 24 hours. Price action data shows that the ZEC coin is having the second-strongest annual performance in its history, having soared roughly 1,500% in the past year. In an earlier post on X, Wedson projected an extreme upside of around $1,650 for the price of ZCash. While the current ZEC price already suggests elevated risk for investors, reaching as high as $1,650 would represent full-on market euphoria.

Title: Here’s Why The Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Prices Are Down
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-are-down/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T19:30:34Z
Full Content:
The Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices are down today after a brief rebound yesterday. Crypto pundit Nobler has suggested that these price declines are due to price manipulation rather than a wave of sell-offs among investors. CoinMarketCap data shows that the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices are on the decline today, following significant gains yesterday. In an X post, Nobler stated that Binance, Wintermute, and BlackRock were all selling Bitcoin ahead of the Federal Reserve’s announcement. This explains the DOGE and SHIB decline given the meme coins’ correlation with the flagship crypto. Nobler alleged that these firms have sold over $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and continue to sell more. The pundit added that there was too much market manipulation. Bitcoin is currently struggling to hold above the $100,000 level, which has sparked a bearish sentiment towards the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. The Dogecoin price is currently trading way below the psychological $0.2 level, while the Shiba Inu price continues to underperform, down over 53% since the start of the year. The foremost meme coins are also at risk of a further decline, with speculations that the crypto market might already be in a bear market. Market maker Wintermute recently claimed that liquidity has stopped flowing into the crypto market, which is why the bull market has halted while the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices decline. The market maker further noted that momentum in stablecoins, ETFs, and digital asset treasuries (DATs) has slowed, highlighting a liquidity drain in the market. Notably, companies such as CleanCore and Bit Origin had accumulated DOGE earlier in the year but have since slowed their purchase of the foremost meme coin. Meanwhile, Santiment data also showed that there has been a drop in DOGE and SHIB whale transactions, which also explained the decline in the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. Despite the recent decline in the Dogecoin price, crypto analyst XForce stated that the macro target for DOGE remains between $1 and $2, which would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the foremost meme coin. He noted that DOGE has arguably been one of the best idealized Elliot wave 5-wave structures on the macro up to the wave 4 termination point. Furthermore, XForce remarked that the only bullish option left will be observed as an Expanding Ending Diagonal, as impulsive options are now off the table. Meanwhile, crypto pundit SHIB Booster stated that the Shiba Inu price could rally soon as tokens from last bull season are now recording significant gains. The pundit added that a small wave of momentum could send the SHIB price back toward the mid-range, around $0.00001603. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: T Rowe Price’s Calculated Bet: Why the Quintessential “Singles Hitter” Is Swinging for Crypto
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/11/t-rowe-prices-calculated-bet-why-the-quintessential-singles-hitter-is-swinging-for-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T17:26:09Z
Full Content:
In the buttoned-down world of institutional asset management, T Rowe Price has long been the firm that makes boring look brilliant. While competitors chased hot trends and flashy returns, the Baltimore-based firm built its reputation as the quintessential “singles hitter,” compounding modest, steady gains into industry-leading long-term performance through disciplined, research-driven processes. Which makes the 87-year-old firm’s October 2025 filing for the T Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF seem, at first glance, utterly out of character. Cryptocurrencies? The asset class synonymous with wild volatility, 70%+ drawdowns, and a $6.2 million banana duct-taped to a wall? For a firm that has weathered every market cycle since 1937 by staying boringly sensible? Yet for those who understand T Rowe Price’s culture, the move is precisely in character. Because when Price’s research leads somewhere, the firm follows, even when it means moving ahead of the crowd into uncomfortable territory. Price is decidedly not an early mover. The filing comes nearly two years after the SEC’s watershed January 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which triggered what one analysis called “a 400% acceleration in institutional investment flows” and have since attracted over $150 billion in assets. BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK dominated that first wave, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) becoming the third-largest ETF by inflows in 2024—trailing only broad S&P 500 index funds and accumulating over $50 billion in assets in less than a year. By late 2025, the landscape will have exploded into what Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas describes as an impending reality where there will be “more crypto ETF filings than stocks.” Over 92 cryptocurrency ETF applications now await SEC review, covering everything from single-asset Solana and XRP funds to multi-crypto index products, staking-enabled ETFs, and even proposals for memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. (sigh) Price’s filing, which Balchunas called a “semi-shock” from a “top 5 active manager,” sits frozen with dozens of others during a federal government shutdown that has left the SEC with skeleton staffing and no clear timeline for approvals. Yet Price’s approach differs fundamentally from the herd. While most applications target passive index tracking or single-coin exposure, Price is proposing an actively managed multi-asset fund (holding 5-15 cryptocurrencies) that applies its core competency – fundamental research, valuation analysis, and active portfolio management – to the crypto space. This isn’t about being first to market. It’s about being right. “If you don’t start out as a crypto skeptic, there’s something wrong with you,” writes Blue Macellari, T Rowe Price’s head of digital assets, in one of three recent research papers on cryptocurrencies the firm shared with us. It’s a revealing admission that captures Price’s approach: start with skepticism, follow the data, and let the conclusions emerge. Price hired Macellari, a former crypto hedge fund executive, in 2022, not to chase trends but to build genuine expertise. The firm has spent years “monitoring developments in the digital assets space closely and developing the ability to trade digital assets,” according to company statements. Those conclusions, detailed in research by Justin Thomson (Head of the T Rowe Price Investment Institute) and Stefan Hubrich (Head of Global Multi-Asset Research), suggest that digital assets have reached an inflection point. They’re not just speculative toys anymore; they’re potentially evolving into a legitimate asset class. The key insight: while Bitcoin has endured four drawdowns exceeding 70%, each near-death experience has been followed by stronger recoveries. Despite extreme volatility (daily price swings of 5-10% remain common), the asset class refuses to disappear. More importantly, Price’s analysts have identified a potential path from “risk-on” to “risk-off” status for digital assets. If volatility dampens and cryptocurrencies decorrelate from other risk assets like high-growth equities, they could transition from speculative investments to mainstream portfolio components. For a firm built on fundamental analysis, cryptocurrencies posed a unique problem: how do you value an asset with no cash flows, no earnings, and no balance sheet? T Rowe Price analyst David Kroger addressed this by adapting traditional discounted cash flow frameworks, using staking rewards as a substitute for cash flow in the valuation process. The methodology acknowledges that cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks with different consensus mechanisms; Bitcoin uses energy-intensive “proof of work” mining, while Ethereum employs “proof of stake” validation. (No, I have no clue what those phrases mean.) The critical distinction: unlike gold (another non-cash-generating asset), Bitcoin is actually used for real-world transactions. With Bitcoin’s programmatically fixed supply of 21 million tokens, growth in transaction volume measured in USD necessitates a rising price for Bitcoin. This creates a potential return framework if Bitcoin transaction volumes grow alongside the broader economy. Over the 12 months ended August 2024, more than $1.3 billion in fees were expended on the Bitcoin network to support a total transaction volume of $2.4 trillion, demonstrating real economic utility. The crypto ETF filing comes at a pivotal moment for T Rowe Price. Like many active managers, the firm has faced persistent outflows as investors gravitate toward lower-cost passive strategies. The firm manages $1.77 trillion in assets but has been “seeking to diversify into new areas,” according to industry analysts. In response, Price has launched 24 ETFs in recent years—a dramatic expansion for a firm historically focused on mutual funds. Last month, it announced a partnership with Goldman Sachs to develop new private market products for retail investors. The Active Crypto ETF represents both a continuation of this ETF strategy and something more: evidence that Price’s research apparatus sees genuine opportunity in digital assets, not just a need to check a product box. As VettaFi’s Todd Rosenbluth noted, “It’s exciting to see them expand their ETF lineup beyond stock and bond exposure.” Price’s researchers acknowledge sympathy for the “digital gold” thesis: the view that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against financial collapse, similar to physical gold but with advantages like algorithmic scarcity rather than mere physical limits. But they’ve moved beyond that framework. Understanding value in crypto means “applying alternative notions of utility; it is a parallel world to ‘Trad-Fi,’ with a different lexicon,” Thomson writes. That lexicon includes concepts like decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and token burning, all of which create potential economic value flows. The comparison to gold is instructive but incomplete. Both Bitcoin and gold have scarcity value and bear a cost of carry since neither generates income. But Bitcoin’s algorithmic supply limit (the “halving” that occurs every four years until 2140, when the maximum 21 million tokens will exist) distinguishes it from paper currencies printed without theoretical limits. Thomson opens his research with a cautionary tale about a 1999 stock called Fyffes that jumped 40% in one day merely by announcing a virtual fruit market, then contrasts it with a 2024 crypto entrepreneur paying $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall before eating it in front of journalists. Both stories feature “a whiff of alchemy and transience—that wealth can be created and destroyed from fumes,” Thomson writes. Yet his conclusion is not to dismiss crypto but to separate “the ephemeral from the permanent, the froth from the substance, Ponzi from probity.” Price’s framework suggests that for digital assets to merit inclusion in diversified portfolios, they need an expectation of positive future returns, specifically, excess returns above cash that reward investors for accepting risk. Traditional assets like stocks (with equity risk premiums) and bonds (with duration premiums) have decades of data supporting this expectation. Digital assets have reached what Price calls the “gold stage.” They have economic value greater than zero. The next step is establishing a durable long-term return thesis beyond merely betting on continued adoption or financial collapse. The fact that Price is willing to file for a crypto ETF suggests its research team believes that thesis is taking shape. Hubrich’s analysis is particularly telling: “To formulate a long-term return thesis for digital assets (Das), investors will need to determine whether passive holders should expect to participate in the value added by the blockchain. The answer is likely to depend on the DA, so this analysis will need to be conducted on a case-by-case basis.” This is precisely the type of granular, security-by-security analysis that Price has applied to stocks and bonds for decades. Dominic Rizzo, who manages some of T Rowe Price’s ETFs, signaled the firm’s direction at an ETF conference earlier in 2025, noting that “now is a good time to consider bitcoin exposure” and comparing cryptocurrency pricing to commodities, saying it “closely tracks the cost of mining it.” These weren’t off-the-cuff remarks but deliberate signals from a firm that doesn’t speculate publicly. When the government shutdown ends and the SEC resumes processing applications, Price won’t be first out of the gate. But if the firm’s research proves prescient, the T Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF could establish the standard for how thoughtful, non-speculative institutional investors approach digital assets by applying rigorous fundamental analysis to select among cryptocurrencies based on network usage, staking rewards, adoption trends, and value creation. For a firm that has navigated the Great Depression, multiple wars, the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis, and countless market cycles, launching a crypto ETF is not a panic move or a desperate grab for assets. It’s a calculated decision backed by years of research and a belief that digital assets are evolving into something durable. As software engineer Jameson Lopp observes in Thomson’s research: “First step to understanding crypto: admitting you don’t understand crypto. Final step: realizing that ‘understanding’ is a moving target.” For T Rowe Price, that journey from skepticism to cautious embrace reflects the same discipline that has defined the firm for nearly nine decades. The research led somewhere uncomfortable, somewhere new, somewhere volatile—and Price followed. Whether that decision proves prescient or premature won’t be known for years. But it demonstrates that even the most conservative firms must evolve when the research is clear. Sometimes the most characteristic move is the one that looks uncharacteristic.

Title: Consumer sentiment is sinking across the board — except for Americans with the most stocks

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. The ongoing government shutdown has helped push confidence to near-record lows, but one segment of the population is actually feeling more optimistic. The initial reading for the University of Michigan’s sentiment index fell to 50.3 in November from 53.6 last month, almost matching the all-time low of 50 from June 2022, when the annual rate of inflation hit its post-pandemic high. “With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a statement Friday. The decline was widespread and was seen across different age groups, income brackets, and political affiliations, she added. But not everyone followed that trend. “One key exception: consumers with the largest tercile of stock holdings posted a notable 11% increase in sentiment, supported by continued strength in stock markets,” Hsu said. The survey closed before Tuesday’s elections, which revealed continued voter discontent about affordability as food and energy prices creep higher. The timing is also notable given that it didn’t capture the most recent stock market selloff that sent the Nasdaq to its worst weekly loss since April’s trade war chaos. That came as investors grew more concerned about the AI boom looking like a bubble that could pop soon. Until this past week, the stock market was on a hot streak, notching fresh record high after record high, with the S&P 500 even closing in on the 7,000 milestone. The market’s impact on consumer sentiment comes as stock ownership has broadened over past five years into more income and age groups. A separate University of Michigan report from last month said the increase in market participation has been especially large among lower-income consumers, while participation rates of younger and older consumers have caught up with middle-aged consumers. In fact, a survey released last month from the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth showed that over 54% of Americans earning $30,000 to $79,999 a year are now retail investors in the capital markets. And more than half of that cohort began investing in the past five years. Stock ownership has highlighted a divergence in consumer sentiment in recent months: investors are turning more upbeat while non-investors have turned more pessimistic, according to University of Michigan data from October. And participants with the top 20% of stock holdings are especially optimistic. The spilt even mirrors the K-shaped economy that has emerged as higher-income Americans continue to spend and prop up overall consumption, while others have pulled back. Meanwhile, the so-called wealth effect of higher asset prices on consumer spending has become more potent in the last 15 years, making it harder to separate the stock market from the economy. Today, a $1 increase in stock wealth leads to a $0.05 marginal propensity to consume, up from less than $0.02 in 2010, according to Oxford Economics. The University of Michigan pointed out in October that sentiment among stock market participants had been on the rise since May—after tumbling in April when President Donald Trump shocked global markets with his “Liberation Day” tariffs. By contrast, sentiment for non-stockholders continued to decline and had already hit post-pandemic lows. “These patterns are consistent with the fact that strong asset values support consumer sentimentonly for those who own those assets,” the report said. “Meanwhile, given that wealthier, higher-income consumers generate a disproportionate share of aggregate spending, the recent uptick in sentiment among these households may may help buoy consumption spending even amid views of the economy that are relatively subdued from a historical perspective.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Refining My Conservative Retirement Target Portfolio

Using historical data on funds to make assumptions about future performance involves correctly interpreting the trends. Over the past six years, the U.S. has experienced an extraordinarily unusual period: During the next six years, we will probably experience another bear market and modest to moderate inflation. Interest rates are likely to continue falling in the short-term, but not as low as the decade following the financial crisis because of less Quantitative Easing and higher deficits and national debt. High valuations are a headwind to equity returns, and high interest rates are a tailwind for bond returns. In January 2020, before the start of the COVID bar market, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 was an elevated 26 and is currently 31. I believe that the full COVID Cycle from January 2020 to December 2021 and 2025 are more representative of market conditions for the next six years than the period from January 2022 to December 2024. In this article, I explore how alternative investments and mixed asset funds with flexible strategies can be used to develop a conservative portfolio. To evaluate funds, I selected thirty-six funds in twenty-three different Lipper Categories that had good risk-adjusted performance during the full COVID cycle and 2025. I created an optimizer using Excel Solver to maximize the Martin Ratio for the full COVID cycle with constraints for portfolio concentration, minimum returns, drawdowns, yields, allocation to “junk bonds”, and consistency across the individual years and bear markets. Figure #1 shows the performance during the past four bear markets by allocation to stocks for all of the 461 mixed asset funds in the Lipper global dataset with at least six years of history. Note that the severity of the bear market has a larger impact on the portfolio performance than the of the stock to bond ratio. The two black dashed lines show a range of likely maximum downturns for the three bear markets, excluding the dotcom bear market, which was associated with a mild recession. The three maroon squares are the maximum drawdowns of the “Conservative” and “Moderate” portfolios that I created and the target portfolio that I described last month in Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control. The two portfolios created for this article had low to average drawdowns. Figure #1: Mixed Asset Fund Drawdowns During Four Bear Markets Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #1 shows the average annualized returns over the past six years for the mixed asset funds and the “Conservative”, “Moderate”, and original target portfolio. The two new portfolios outperformed both the mixed asset funds and the original target portfolio. Table #1: Mixed Asset Fund Returns for Past Six Years Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I am currently reading “A Crash Course on Crises: Macroeconomic Concepts for Run-Ups, Collapses, and Recoveries” by Princeton University economics professor Markus K. Brunnermeier and London School of Economics professor Ricardo Reis, which researches the interrelationship between financial markets and the economy during a crisis. They describe part of their audience to be “members of the informed public wanting to absorb some of the concepts that should be guiding both macroeconomic and financial policy.” The book contains some wonderful insights into investing behavior, such as “Why don’t other, more sophisticated investors, lean against the bubble, preventing it from arising in the first place?” They continue, “These investors try to forecast how long the bubble will persist, which is governed by the trading behavior of the other (sophisticated) investors.” I have no illusions that I can predict the behavior of other sophisticated investors. As described by Hyman Minsky, many crises are preceded by some type of innovation (such as artificial intelligence) followed by long periods of price increases, speculation, and leverage. These are followed by a period of instability and traders becoming risk-averse and de-leveraging. Stock market price-to-earnings ratios were around 18 before the 1929 stock market crash, peaked at 34 prior to the bursting of the dotcom bubble, hit 21 prior to the start of the financial crisis, and are now at an elevated 31. There are usually “triggering events” that set off chain reactions between asset markets and financial markets that determine the severity of corrections and whether a macro-financial crisis results. At the National Association for Business Economics, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, “When COVID-19 struck in March 2020, the economy came to a near standstill and financial markets seized up, threatening to transform a public health crisis into a severe, prolonged economic downturn.” The stage is set for a correction, and there are plenty of potential “triggering events” such as a slowing economy, rising inflation, potential supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical risk. Figure #2 represents the investing environment for the past six years. Fiscal and monetary stimulus contained the economic fallout from the COVID bear market lasting from January 2020 through March of that year, but Personal Consumption Price inflation rose from a half percent following the COVID bear market to nearly seven percent by January 2022. Charles Boccadoro described The Great Normalization (TGN) in which interest rates normalized to higher rates, hurting bond performance. The TGN bear market lasted from January 2022 to September of that year. By December 2023, the price-to-earnings ratio had crossed the high valuation level of $25 per dollar of earnings. The debasement trade is partly the result of investors and global central banks buying gold and the increased acceptance of cryptocurrency. I believe that the dollar will weaken but not be replaced as the global reserve currency, and the debasement trade is overbought. Figure #2: The COVID and Great Normalization Full Cycles Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. The full COVID Cycle was from January 2020 to December 2021 and includes the COVID bear market and inflation. I expect cycles of bear markets and inflation to be more frequent in the coming decade than in the decade following the financial crisis. Rates are high, so “The Great Normalization” of rising rates is unlikely to occur to such extremes for many years. Finally, valuations are currently high and more likely to fall than rise either over time or in a correction with a “triggering event”. I set up my Excel optimizer for both the Conservative and Moderate portfolios to maximize the Martin Ratio for the January 2020 to December 2021 period by changing allocations to 36 funds with constraints that I wanted to have drawdowns of less than nine percent for both the COVID and TGN bear markets. Maximum allocations were set for Alternative, Bond, Equity, and Mixed Asset fund types to ensure diversification. The Conservative portfolio has additional constraints of having yields at least 4% with less than 13% allocated to lower quality “junk bonds”. Figure #3 contains the inflation-adjusted results from Portfolio Visualizer assuming 4% annual withdrawals for the Conservative, Moderate, and Original Target Portfolio compared to the Fidelity Asset Manager 40% (FFANX), which is a good global mixed asset fund. The link is provided here. The Conservative and Moderate portfolios had similar returns through 2023, with the Moderate portfolio having higher volatility. Both beat inflation over the six years after adjusting for withdrawals. During the period of rising valuations and the debasement trade, the Moderate Portfolio has outperformed. Both outperformed the Original Target Portfolio from my last article because of a wider selection of funds under consideration, improvements in methodology, and an increase in the maximum allocation for a fund from 10% to 15%. All three outperformed the 40/60 baseline fund, which was negatively impacted during the rising rates period. Figure #3: Conservative and Moderate Portfolio Growth – Six Years Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #2 contains the resulting allocations with the funds sorted from the lowest Ulcer Ratio over the past six years to the highest. I own shares in FPFIX/FFIRX, PCBAX, PMAIX, PZRMX, and AVALX. It will take a couple of years to fill out the rest of the portfolio, depending upon cash flows, and I will lean towards the less risky funds next. Table #2: Portfolio Allocations Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #3 contains the portfolio metrics for the period May 2019 to September 2025 from Portfolio Visualizer. Annualized returns are after withdrawals, while Time-Weighted Rate of Return reflects investment performance. Table #3: Portfolio Performance Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #4 contains the metrics and ratings from MFO for the funds for the past six years. They are sorted from the lowest Ulcer Index, which measures the depth and duration of drawdowns from the lowest to the highest. MFO Risk is based on the Ulcer Index comparing all funds, while the Ulcer Rating is for funds within the same category peers. Martin Ratio is the risk-free return divided by the Ulcer Index. The MFO Rating is based on the Martin Ratio for funds within the same Lipper Category. The Batting Average Rating (BA) is based on the percentage of the months that a fund beat its peers. One takeaway is that some of the funds outperformed during down markets but lagged peers overall. Table #4: Fund Metrix – Six Years Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Optimization depends on having funds with low correlations to each other. Notice that some funds had their maximum drawdowns during the COVID (2020) bear market, and some had them during the Great Normalization (2022) bear market. Table #5 shows how the funds performed in each of the bear markets and the bull markets. The lower-risk funds provide some safety during downturns, while the riskier funds provide growth potential. Blue shaded cells indicate the best performers, and red are the worst performers.

Columbia Thermostat bases its stock to bond allocation on valuations. During the financial crisis, the strategy was to invest in all stocks or bonds, and it did not perform well. It has improved its strategy to have a range of allocations depending on price levels and performed well during the COVID bear market. The Fact Sheet indicates that the fund is currently 70% invested in fixed income and 30% invested in equity. It contains the allocation to stocks by the S&P 500 level. BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PBAIX, PCBAX) is an Alternative Global Macro fund that has performed well since the 2008 financial crisis, but during the financial crisis fell nearly 27% in 2008 and returned 26% in 2009. I own shares in PCBAX, but limit allocations to alternatives because they use derivatives, which can be less predictable during a crisis. Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) is another good Alternative Global Macro fund that had a maximum drawdown of 7% during the financial crisis. I included it in the original target portfolio from last month. The Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) is based on the concepts developed by Harry Browne in the 1980s to provide steady, long-term growth with low volatility without trying to time the market. The fund managers describe Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) as, “Designed as a core portfolio holding, Permanent Portfolio seeks to preserve and increase the purchasing power value of each shareholder’s account over the long-term, regardless of current or future market conditions, through strategic investments in a broad array of different asset classes.” It invests fixed percentages of its net assets in dollar assets (35%), gold (20%), aggressive growth stocks (15%), real estate and natural resource stocks (15%), Swiss Franc assets (10%), and silver (5%). The PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) is described by the fund managers as “By investing in a blend of inflation-related asset classes, the fund seeks to help preserve and grow purchasing power, enhance portfolio diversification, and guard against market shocks across varying inflation environments.” It currently has a composition of Inflation Linked Bonds 68%), Commodities (22%), Currencies (15%), REITS (10%), and Precious Metals (10%). I own shares in PZRMX. Figure #4 contains some of the funds that did well during 2020 to 2022 with high inflation. These are mostly in the Flexible Portfolio Lipper Category plus DIVO in equity income, Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX, maroon line) in the Alternative Global Macro category, and the PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX, red line) in the Flexible Portfolio Category. During the period in between the bear markets, the S&P 500 rose 89% while core bonds rose a paltry 2.5%. Figure #4: Fund Performance During Inflation (2020 – 2022) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset and St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database. From 2012 through 2019, Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) had very similar performance. From 2019 through 2021, PRPFX outperformed PZRMX and greatly outperformed starting in 2023. I prefer owning PRPFX and PZRMX to directly owning gold because it is much more volatile. Over the past year, I decreased my allocation to stock from 65% to 50% which is a small decrease in risk. Rebalancing during high market valuations and downturns is a modest way of “buying low and selling high”. I believe that risk risk-adjusted performance of bonds to be greater than equities for the next few years. Using the bucket approach to match risk assets with spending needs and using bond ladders does more to reduce portfolio risk than lowering the allocation to stocks. As a qualifier, I use financial advisors to manage the majority of my portfolio using a traditional, globally diversified 60/40 portfolio. I am developing this “Conservative Portfolio” strategy for a subset of the portfolio that I manage in addition to traditional bond funds and bond ladders to have liquidity available in any market condition, and with some growth potential.

Title: Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle is Dead, Here’s Why Bull Run is Not Over

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Bitcoin price has seen a significant pivot from its historic 4-year cycle that is supported by halving events. Science Author, Shanaka Anslem Perera, on X, pointed out that Bitcoin has pivoted from its historic 4-year cycle, which is driven by halving events. As a result of this shift, the coin’s traditional playbook of significant positive momentum has now become obsolete. Still, the crypto enthusiast does not think that Bitcoin’s bull run is over. Historically, Bitcoin’s performance has followed a four-year cycle, largely driven by halving events, which result in a reduction in the block reward. At every point in this cycle, the crypto ecosystem experienced a massive bull run, followed by sharp price corrections. Fast forward to the present day, and there seems to be a notable shift that has now rendered this traditional playbook obsolete. On October 6, 2025, Crypto Twitter declared Bitcoin’s cycle peak at $126,270. Then this was followed by a 21% drop in the coin’s price levels. BITCOIN’S 4-YEAR CYCLE JUST DIED AND NOBODY NOTICED Crypto Twitter exploded calling October 6th the cycle peak. Eighty-four percent crashes incoming. Bear market confirmed. Pack it up. Except the math says they are catastrophically wrong. Every indicator that called previous… pic.twitter.com/b6sj1kGn5e — Shanaka Anslem Perera ⚡ (@shanaka86) November 8, 2025 As a result, several influencers and analysts, armed with historical patterns, predicted an 84% crash and a prolonged bear market. However, Perera believes that there may be a different story to tell. There may still be hope, as he claims that the bull run is far from over. Apparently, key indicators such as the Pi Cycle, MVRV Z-Score, and Puell Multiple, which would usually signal the onset of a bull run, are unusually quiet. According to these metrics, the crypto market is in a mid-cycle consolidation, and not the end of the road. Perera believes that Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) may have played a vital role in redirecting the four-year cycle. Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed a staggering $64 billion, with giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and corporate treasuries acting as a vacuum for every whale dump. The influx of institutional investors into the sector may have rid Bitcoin of certain rollercoasters. On November 4, Coinspeaker reported that Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of up to $186.5 million, led entirely by BlackRock’s IBIT. Within the last six days leading up to November 7, there were consistent outflows totaling $660 million. Within the last 24 hours, the sector has seen up to $240 million flood back into ETFs. In the wake of this situation, the Bitcoin price has recovered by 2.38% and is currently trading at $101,997.13. Consequently, Market experts have concluded that settlement, not sentiment, now governs Bitcoin’s price. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: ‘Sell Your House, Clothes And Buy XRP’ — Solana Exec’s Wild Advice Goes Viral

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Solana Foundation manager Vibhu Norby jumped into a heated XRP discussion on X, adding a sharp dose of humor to an already intense online conversation. The debate began when Tradeship University founder Cameron Scrubs urged followers to sell all their other crypto assets and buy XRP. Scrubs, known for extreme XRP optimism, previously predicted that XRP would surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum within five years. He reignited that vision this week, telling investors to sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZCash, and Dogecoin — essentially, “sell everything” — and move into XRP. The statement quickly went viral, drawing reactions from multiple crypto communities. X user Caspian responded, saying it wasn’t meant literally. He added that the point was to align belief with action — if investors truly see value in XRP, they should act with conviction. “Own your stack, protect it, and stay ready,” he wrote. Sell your house. Sell your bed. Sell your kids. Sell your cardboard box. Sell your clothes. Buy XRP. — vibhu (@vibhu) November 7, 2025 Vibhu Norby joined the thread with satire. He joked, “Sell your house, bed, kids, cardboard box, clothes, and buy XRP,” making it clear he was mocking the hype rather than endorsing it. Another user, Slorg, claimed he had already gone all in and asked what step to take next. Norby replied that the next move was to wait for major firms like BlackRock and Mastercard to tokenize trillions in assets, potentially sending XRP to $1,000. Despite the humor, the exchange highlighted the community’s real optimism about institutional involvement and the possibility of massive price growth. Ripple added fuel to the discussion by announcing a $500 million funding round at its Swell 2025 event. Investors included Galaxy Digital, Fortress, Brevan Howard, and Pantera Capital. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the investment confirmed faith in a business “built on the foundation of XRP.” Reports also showed Ripple partnered with Mastercard to use RLUSD on XRPL for fiat settlement, while Ripple Prime is integrating XRP for institutional transfers. These developments gave long-term holders more reason to stay confident in XRP. Holding XRP is the hardest part because conviction gets tested in every wave of volatility. But when you understand the fundamentals, the liquidity infrastructure @Ripple is building and how $XRP underpins the next phase of global settlement, patience becomes your leverage. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 5, 2025 Meanwhile, Versan Aljarrah, the founder of Black Swan Capitalist, acknowledges that it is a constant emotional struggle holding XRP. He explains how investor patience is tested in every market cycle, and the challenge of remaining dedicated to your investment when the price moves materially can be one of the hardest things to do as an XRP holder. Engineer Vincent Van Code responded, saying that it requires “serious conviction – or mental illness” to not sell when the price moves. It comes as no surprise that the mixture of irony, crazy predictions and institutional news keeps XRP relevant. For some of them, the “sell your house” comments are simply an exaggeration, but it showcases the passion and belief of the XRP community, which has planned and endorsed their position, and has continued to show the strength of their will no matter how volatile XRP price action has remained.

When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: JPMorgan doubles down on Bitcoin with $343M BTC bet – Details

Here’s why institutions are suddenly racing to get in. JPMorgan now holds 5.28 million shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, a 64% increase from last quarter. It reflects rising institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a core asset in global investment portfolios. JPMorgan is significantly ramping up its exposure to Bitcoin [BTC], highlighting a surge in institutional confidence toward the leading cryptocurrency. According to the bank’s latest 13F regulatory filing, its brokerage clients now hold 5.28 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), valued at approximately $343 million as of the 30th of September. This represents a 64% increase from the previous quarter’s 3.21 million shares. The report further reveals that JPMorgan’s exposure spans multiple divisions, including those managing high-net-worth and institutional portfolios. This broad participation reflects a strategic shift within the bank and its clients, who are seeking regulated, low-risk entry points into Bitcoin amid ongoing market fluctuations. The timing and scale of the investment signal that Wall Street’s largest players are no longer sitting on the sidelines. Instead, they are positioning themselves ahead of what they perceive as the next major leg in Bitcoin’s institutional adoption. Yet, while JPMorgan’s crypto exposure deepens, not all corporate holders are faring well. Firms like Metaplanet, a known Bitcoin accumulator, are now facing steep paper losses, holding 30823 BTC at an average purchase price of $108,036, with losses of 5.37% as per Bitcointreasuries.net data. Still, the broader institutional landscape shows resilience rather than retreat. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), for instance, continued its steady Bitcoin accumulation, recently adding 397 BTC to its reserves. This happened at a time when Bitcoin was trading around $102,260, at press time, showing modest gains, while BlackRock’s IBIT recorded $131.4 million in outflows, according to Farside Investors. Despite this, Bitcoin’s dominance stood firm at 59.84%, meaning it now represents nearly 60% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Meanwhile, in traditional markets, JPMorgan’s stock rose 0.25% to $314.21, and BlackRock climbed 1.19% to $1,082.20, according to Google Finance. These slight upticks mirror the cautious optimism in financial circles, where institutions like JPMorgan are positioning themselves to capitalize on Bitcoin’s next potential leg upward. That being said, BlackRock’s exposure is not just limited to Wall Street. In fact, the upcoming launch of iShares Bitcoin ETF on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) by mid-November 2025 marks another strategic step in its global digital asset expansion. Therefore, with Australia emerging as one of the key frontiers for Bitcoin ETFs and institutional inflows surging, BlackRock’s move signals growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a core asset within global portfolios.

Title: Ethereum Price Surge To $5,500: What To Watch Out For To Mark The Bottom

Time Published: 2025-11-08T09:30:37Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Coming out of weeks of downtrend, the Ethereum price could be looking to establish the next bottom as it sets up for a campaign toward new all-time highs. This is highlighted by crypto analyst MMBTtrader, who explained that the Ethereum price crash could be coming to an end. This is evidenced by a number of formations on the Ethereum price chart that suggest where the next lift-off might begin. In an analysis shared on the TradingView website, the crypto analyst explained that the Ethereum price is now testing the next crucial technical level. The importance of this level comes with a 50% retracement of the Fibonacci sequence. Thus, it means that the Ethereum price is seeing major support at this level. This support lies just above the $3,200 level, which the Ethereum price had managed to maintain through the market crash. This puts the critical level at the 0.5 Fibonacci support, which currently serves as the next make-or-break level for the cryptocurrency. If the Ethereum price is able to bounce off from here, then it could trigger the next wave of recoveries for the cryptocurrency. Not only that, it would be the signal that the bottom is finally in and the crash is over. The analyst further explains that this could lead to “a high-probability setup for a resumption of the primary bullish trend.” Such a breakout would lead to a rather strong bullish move for the digital asset, and the target from here would be a brand new all-time high. The first target from here would be $5,500 as bulls push the price higher. “This target is derived from the magnitude of the prior uptrend and represents a key resistance zone on the higher timeframes,” the analyst explained. The 0.5 Fibonacci level, as explained above, is a make-or-break level. This means that whichever direction the Ethereum price takes after hitting this level could determine where the cryptocurrency is headed next. With the bullish side already explored, there is still the possibility that Ethereum fails to establish support and a bottom. In the event of the Ethereum price actually breaking below this crucial level, then it would confirm the bearish pressure that has plagued the market. The analyst highlights on the chart that if the support breaks, then Ethereum could dump further below $3,000, with the major support lying just above $2,400. Such a decline would mean an over 30% crash for Ethereum, on top of the already struggling price. Therefore, it is imperative that bulls hold above $3,200 to prevent further decline.

Title: Looking for an interesting Christmas present? Start bidding for bargains at auction
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fine-art-antiques/2025/11/08/looking-for-an-interesting-christmas-present-start-bidding-for-bargains-at-auction/

As Christmas shopping season begins, savvy searchers for gifts will be browsing auction catalogues for ideas. Buying presents at auction is a sustainable shopping option, because such purchases keep things in circulation for longer. Buying at auction often also represents good value for money, although prospective buyers should always be aware that most auctioneers add 20 per cent buyer’s commission plus VAT at 23 per cent on the buyer’s commission to the hammer price. So, for example, a painting bought for a hammer price of €1,000 will cost €1,246. There can also be an extra charge for online bidding. With these caveats in mind, there are plenty of auctions in the next few weeks that are worth checking out. Take, for example, the live auction of railway memorabilia at Mullen’s showrooms in Laurel Park, Bray, Co Wicklow on Monday November 10th, starting at 11am. The lithographs, watercolours, paintings and photographs of trains and 20th-century tourist posters promoting rail travel all belonged to Col Raymond O’Neill, the Lord O’Neill, who is the current owner of Shane’s Castle, near Randalstown in Co Antrim. From the early 1970s, Shane’s Castle had its own miniature railway line running from a platform near the Antrim Gate lodge to Shane’s Castle on the shores of Lough Neagh. It closed to the public in 1994. An avid collector of all kinds of “railwayana”, from enamelled advertising signs to model train sets, train timetables, maps, postcards and guide books, the Lord O’Neill is the former chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, a past president of the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland and a member of several other heritage bodies. He is the nephew of the late Terence O’Neill, former prime minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. His stepfather was Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond novels. Some buyers will be drawn to the illustrious provenance of items, while others will be enticed by their collectability. Take, for example, the colourfully illustrated travel posters Come to Ulster (€700-€1,000) or the poster for London, Midland and Scottish Railway, Connemara by the artist Paul Henry (€600-€1,200). The Dublin and Blessington Tramway passing Russborough Estate in Co Wicklow by Sean Boylan in 1924 (€400-€600) is one of several paintings of trains travelling through scenic spots in this collection. The auction also includes vintage Airfix model kits and model trains including the North Pole locomotive and carriage on a display track (€100-€200) and a collection of die-cast models of trams (€40-€80). Mullen’s timed online auction of classic and contemporary interiors also has plenty of potential Christmas gifts, with reasonable estimates on lots of glassware, crockery and paintings. The lots will begin closing on November 9th from 6pm. Meanwhile, Adams Blackrock is hosting an online jewellery auction of 750 pieces consigned by a long-established Irish jeweller that is now closing its doors. “The selection showcases a wide range of contemporary gold jewellery set with precious gemstones, ideal for both everyday wear and special occasions,” says Elena McCrory from Adams Blackrock. The online auction, which closes at 7pm on November 13th, is on view until Sunday November 9th from 12-4pm daily at 17 Kildare Street, Dublin. And Lynes & Lynes auctioneers in Carrigtwohill, Co Cork, is selling an eclectic range of items from several Cork residences, the recently closed Cotton Ball pub and recently closed Canty’s Garage, both in Cork City. The most striking item in the Lynes & Lynes auction has to be the 1914 Buick Tourer (€15,000-€20,000). Made by General Motors in Michigan, US, it was a luxury car at a time when motor vehicles were still relatively rare. Vintage photographic prints of Canty’s garage with delivery vehicles (€20-€30) will appeal to vintage car enthusiasts. Those seeking Christmas gifts will also have plenty to choose from at the Lynes & Lynes auction, including a set of antique glass decanters (€30-€50), Shanagarry pottery (€40-€60) and a selection of china teapots (€20-€40), all with reasonable estimates. Fans of antique fairs should note forthcoming fairs in Limerick Racecourse on November 15th and 16th and at Claregalway Castle in Co Galway on November 22nd and 23rd. Both are run by Hibernian Antique Fairs and feature dealers from the Republic and Northern Ireland. Finally, the Grace O’Malley Foundation will have a small auction at its annual fundraising lunch in the Westbury Hotel on Friday November 14th at 12.30pm.

Title: XRP Price To Reach $1,000 By End Of 2025? Rumor Mills Are On Fire With BlackRock Speculations

Speculations across the crypto space have ignited a wave of excitement for the XRP price as rumors linking BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and Ripple, a crypto payments company, continue to spread. The possibility of XRP reaching $1,000 before the end of 2025 has become the latest hot topic, fueled by bold claims from top analysts who believe that this rumored partnership could set the stage for one of the most explosive bull runs in this cycle. Crypto market analyst ‘The Real Remi Relief’ has stirred significant interest with his post on X social media, claiming that if ongoing rumors about a potential partnership between BlackRock and Ripple prove true, the XRP price could reach $1,000 by the end of 2025. He advised holders to secure their XRP in cold wallets and prepare for a potential market-wide supply shock. His optimism stems from reports shared by another well-analyst @DelCrxpto, who revealed that sources deep within the crypto industry are hinting at a major development involving BlackRock and Ripple. According to these claims, the global asset manager may be preparing to collaborate with Ripple to establish infrastructure for the tokenization of all $5.3 trillion of its ETF liquidity. If such an initiative were to materialize, it would represent one of the largest integrations of blockchain into global finance. Ripple’s network, designed for fast and cost-effective asset transfers, could provide the foundation for tokenized ETFs, potentially transforming traditional investment markets. Additionally, the crypto payments company, which is already expanding into the Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization sector, will broaden its technology and services to support a broader range of financial products. The possibility of such a partnership has reignited optimism within the XRP community, especially after the recent Ripple Swell event, which featured participation from prominent names including BlackRock, Nasdaq, Franklin Templeton, The White House, and several other global institutions. Notably, an ETF tokenization deal between Ripple and BlackRock could elevate XRP’s role in the digital asset and financial ecosystem, driving institutional adoption, which could propel its price. Despite growing optimism about XRP’s price outlook, the rumors remain unconfirmed, and neither Ripple nor BlackRock has issued any official statement. Market analyst @Steph_iscrypto has added fuel to the bullish excitement surrounding the XRP price with a technical analysis suggesting that the cryptocurrency could soon enter another parabolic phase. He announced in his X post that “XRP will shock everyone in the next 1-3 months.” His accompanying weekly chart highlights bull rallies from past cycles, where XRP surged 2,117% in 2013, 110,466% in 2017, and 1,208% in 2020. Building on this trend, XRP has recently broken through a long-term resistance level, mirroring the early stages of its previous explosive bull cycles. If historical patterns repeat, the analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of another explosive bull run this cycle.

Title: Billionaire Bill Ackman Clowned For Mamdani Appeal After Mayoral Win

Billionaire Bill Ackman is being laughed at for his humble words towards Zohran Mamdani after his NYC mayoral win. A billionaire behind some of the biggest attacks on New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is being raked over the coals for being highly conciliatory to him after his decisive win. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman congratulated Mamdani. “Congrats on the win,” he wrote, adding: Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do.” The tweet was a surprising pivot from his previous words about the Queens assemblyman during his campaign. Ackman, who is a noted supporter of President Donald Trump, had been backing independent candidate and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in the race and was one of Mamdani’s most vicious critics, hammering him with false claims of him being antisemitic and “amplifying hate” against Jewish New Yorkers. Mamdani has been a firm critic of Israel’s policies, particularly in their conflict in Gaza. Those attacks were often seen in multi-paragraph posts on X, where he also tore down Mamdani’s campaign positions of making New York City more affordable for residents (which include increasing taxes on corporations and billionaires, free bus service, city-run grocery stores and rent freezes for stabilized apartments), claiming it would make the city “much more dangerous and economically unviable,” and spur an exodus of billionaires. Ackman went so far as to donate $1.75 million to two super PACs – Defend NYC and the pro-Cuomo group Fix The City. But now, his conciliatory words have been accepted by the 34-year-old mayor-elect. “I appreciated his words,” Mamdani said while appearing on Good Morning America on Wednesday (Nov. 5). “I think what I find is that there is a needed commitment from leaders of the city to speak and work with anyone who is committed to lowering the cost of living in the city—and that’s something that I will fulfill.” Ackman would be the first of a group of other wealthy figures making overtures to Mamdani. Blackrock co-founder Ralph Schlosstein also publicly pledged support. “I do care deeply about the city, and I’m not going anywhere, whoever the mayor is. I’m going to do whatever I can to help him be successful,” he remarked, according to Forbes magazine. Mamdani is keeping his grassroots structured, as he begins the work of assuming office next January, announcing an all-woman transition team headed by former Federal Trade Commission head Lina Khan.

Title: Warren Buffett-Inspired Strategy Drives Canadian Bitcoin Treasury Growth | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. What happens when long-term investment wisdom meets the fast-moving adoption of Bitcoin? A Canadian fintech is quietly blending patience, discipline, and digital assets, showing that a Buffett-inspired approach might find its footing in crypto. Mogo Inc., a Canadian fintech company, is demonstrating that Warren Buffett’s value investing principles can coexist with digital assets. In May 2024, the company adopted what it calls the Berkshire Hathaway playbook, integrating long-term, disciplined investing principles into its wealth platform. The move marked a deliberate pivot away from speculative trading. It emphasized patience, temperament, and behavioral discipline, core tenets of Buffett’s approach. Eighteen months later, that philosophy is showing tangible results in Mogo’s digital asset strategy, particularly Bitcoin. “Mogo reports continued platform growth and record assets under management in Q3 2025,” said Mogo Inc. President and co-founder Greg Feller. In Q3 2025, the company increased its Bitcoin holdings by over 300% quarter-over-quarter, bringing the total to $4.7 million. This follows a July 2025 move, where Mogo’s board approved a strategic initiative authorizing up to $50 million in Bitcoin allocations as a long-term reserve asset and capital benchmark. The Q3 allocations were funded through excess cash and monetization of other investments, all while maintaining operational liquidity. The board has formally designated Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset and capital benchmark. This signals a structured, treasury-focused approach to crypto holdings rather than short-term speculation. The initiative forms part of a broader evolution of Mogo’s Intelligent Investing platform, which integrates both self-directed and managed investing. The system utilizes behavioral science to reduce impulsive trading and encourage measured, long-term decisions. These principles align with the Berkshire Hathaway ethos. By pairing this disciplined framework with a growing crypto allocation, Mogo is bridging traditional value investing and modern digital assets in a way rarely seen in the fintech space. Mogo’s approach contrasts sharply with the typical retail crypto market, dominated by high-frequency trading and leveraged bets. By treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the company is signaling that disciplined, long-term investment principles can survive, and even thrive, in crypto markets. The firm intends to continue building its Bitcoin treasury while expanding the behavioral investing features of its platform. “With the wind-down of our legacy trading business now behind us and continued execution of our Bitcoin treasury strategy, we’re entering 2026 with a stronger foundation and multiple tailwinds supporting our momentum,” read an excerpt in the press release, citing Feller. Its Q3 report makes clear that the fintech sees this as a structural shift, one that combines Buffett-inspired discipline with the opportunities of the digital asset economy. Investors fatigued by speculation can emulate the Canadian company’s approach, which showcases a rare model for measured and thoughtful participation in Bitcoin.

Title: First-Time Home Buyer Share Falls to Historic Low of 21%, Median Age Rises to 40

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2025 6:09:57 AM PST by yesthatjallen The share of first-time home buyers dropped to a record low of 21%, while the typical age of first-time buyers climbed to an all-time high of 40 years, according to the National Association of REALTORS®' 2025 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers. This annual survey of recent home buyers and sellers covers transactions between July 2024 and June 2025 and offers industry professionals, consumers, and policymakers detailed insights into homebuying and selling behavior. "The historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory," said Jessica Lautz NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research. "The share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007 – right before the Great Recession. The implications for the housing market are staggering. Today's first-time buyers are building less housing wealth and will likely have fewer moves over a lifetime as a result." "Unfolding in the housing market is a tale of two cities," Lautz explained. "We're seeing buyers with significant housing equity making larger down payments and all-cash offers, while first-time buyers continue to struggle to enter the market." "For generations, access to homeownership has been the primary way Americans build wealth and the cornerstone of the American Dream," said Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer. "Delayed or denied homeownership until age 40 instead of 30 can mean losing roughly $150,000 in equity on a typical starter home. FHA and VA programs have helped millions of Americans access homeownership, join the middle class, and create intergenerational wealth – a testament to smart government policy in support of homeownership."

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: OKSooner This is a socialist, anti-capitalist red herring. We’re talking less than 0.5% by *all such* firms. The rate of “investor-owned” properties was higher 40 years ago, before the 1986 tax bill changed mortgage interest deductibility, limiting it to primary homes. This data over the long haul is a function of two things: 1) Plummeting marriage rates. Easier to afford a home on two incomes than one. 2) Unwillingness of buyers to look outside of their “preferred” areas. Both are a function of individual choice - particularly the latter. If first-time homebuyers *insist* their first home has to be a townhome in Brooklyn, condo in Miami, or SFH in bazillion dollar California? I can’t help you. There are great deals to be had all over in places like Ohio and the plains - and I guarantee folks, there are jobs in Omaha, Kansas City, etc to be had with affordable first homes nearby. Hey, I believe in personal choice and freedom - so absolutely, if you insist on living in a HCOL area? You’re going to pay HCOL prices and they’re likely beyond the means of a first-time homebuyer. That’s your choice. It’s nobody’s job to “fix” that - certainly not the government’s job. I do agree that those HCOL areas could lower costs by cutting regulations/zoning/barriers to building, so I suppose THAT would be the (local) government’s job to do less... but ultimately, people have a choice: Either pay the premium or consider areas where you don’t have to pay a premium. 17 posted on 11/07/2025 6:55:15 AM PST by Capn Hayek (Capital is not responsible for Labor's lack of planning) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: yesthatjallen Get that age back down OR younger people are going to go for socialism instead of MAGA and the birthrate will remain very low. This is a critical issue.Right now MAGA has a chance to do something about it. I'd force Blackrock and the banks out of owning residential real estate, I'd ban non resident aliens from owning residential real estate and loosening any environmental regulations that hinder home building would be good steps. State and local governments need to ease strict zoning restrictions. Also, getting more younger Americans in good paying jobs by slashing H1Bs, imposing tariffs on foreign goods and deporting all the illegal aliens are positive steps. 18 posted on 11/07/2025 6:56:45 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: yesthatjallen Cantillon Effects. 19 posted on 11/07/2025 6:58:31 AM PST by PGR88 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble California’s prices are insane.

Thank you Sierra Club and Democrat Party. Lower the price of land and construction. Change zoning and eliminate stupid enviro rules and a ton of land goes in the market. Lower regs on products that go into a house, most notably lumber harvest restrictions to increase supply and lower cost. Eliminate all the racist stuff that banks have to comply with to make sure they are not “discriminating “ against unfit borrowers who happen to be black which will lower the costs of loans (and lessen defaults). Remove regs that require fake “green” HvAC ( like no freon) and raise cost of appliances. The Buck Stops Here. Trump is going to get the blame, though he doesn’t deserve it. yeah, I bought my first house when I was 26 and now that house is worth over 300k. Importing a gadzillion legal immigrants didn’t help, either, don’t see how they can afford it. I blame the education system. If I had known what I know NOW, I’d have 4 homes and be much better off than I am now. And right now I’m pretty well off with my two homes. What about Blackrock buying up residential properties and selling them back to itself, inflating the price of new homes? These equity firms do unfortunately affect the housing market. Their being in the market as they are , helps constrict the supply of houses available for people who want to buy a house to live in the house. So based on supply and demand, that will force the rest of us to have to pay more for a house. I know I have oversimplified it here, but this is definitely part of what’s happening in the housing market. It doesn’t matter. The average idiot will still blame it all on Trump. When you let 100M people into your country over a period of just 50 years, it’s little surprise that there’s a “housing shortage”. The US is a small fraction of the overall world population. If we simply let 7B people come here at will, there will ALWAYS be a “housing shortage”. Ending mass immigration is one way to reserve space for American kids, not India or China or Africa or South America’s people. And please don’t spam me with the “whole world can live in Texas” meme. It’s juvenile and merely spatial, you couldn’t actually do anything like that and we don’t want to live in Calcutta anyway. Such is what happens when governments reduce interest rates over the last 15 years and house prices skyrocket. Additionally, when governments promote off-shoring of manufacturing to foreign countries over the last 35 years, good paying jobs are gone. So I am not surprised that the average first-home-buyer age is now 40 years. “””yeah, I bought my first house when I was 26 and now that house is worth over 300k.””” Likewise for me, I bought first house at age 26 for $44,000 and according to Zillow is now worth more than $2 million. My husband and I - two humble teachers - we able to afford a nice home in California in the early 90s. That same home is now worth $1.5 million in today’s market. We’d be able to afford nothing now. My son works in tech with a salary over $150k, his wife in real estate management does OK too. Homes in this state are unaffordable for them. “””If we simply let 7B people come here at will, there will ALWAYS be a “housing shortage”.””” Mass immigration hits two ways. 1. Creates a housing shortage so prices go up. 2. Reduces the wages of American Citizens. First time homeowners cannot get past the 6 1/2 to 7% interest rate. They were so spoiled by their parents buying homes at 2 1/2 to 3%. That’s what they think they should get. Older homeowners understand that this is still good compared to the rates in 2000 for example which were about 9%. And in the late 70s when they were 15%.

Title: RWA Platforms Keep Launching—Then Hitting the Same Regulatory Wall

Time Published: 2025-11-07T14:00:29Z

Real-world asset (RWA) platforms that offer regulated securities keep launching with the same playbook. They build for one jurisdiction, secure regulatory approval, and announce institutional partnerships, only to hit a wall when they need licensing to offer those assets across borders. The SEC, MiFID II and Singapore’s MAS all impose different rules on who can legally purchase securities, which means platforms need jurisdiction-specific approvals and must navigate conflicting investor eligibility rules for each new market.

You can opt out anytime. Recent projections by Standard Chartered suggest that the tokenized asset market could grow to $30 trillion by 2034. With BlackRock’s launch of tokenized fund BUIDL and Coinbase’s acquisition of crypto fundraising platform Echo, the institutional interest just keeps rising. But talk to anyone trying to put capital into tokenized assets at scale, and you’ll hear the same complaint: compliance has become a fragmentation nightmare. It’s not that institutions don’t want in. They do. The efficiency gains are obvious: fractional ownership, instant settlement and global liquidity pools. The problem is that every jurisdiction wants something different, and nobody’s built infrastructure that handles all of those differences without duct tape and manual workarounds. Launch a tokenized bond meant to work across multiple markets, and you’re navigating regulatory frameworks that fundamentally contradict each other. The SEC demands specific investor disclosures and accreditation checks. MiFID II requires different transparency standards. Being compliant means something entirely different depending on where your investors are located. Most platforms respond by staying in one jurisdiction. That’s fine for pilots and small-scale tests, but fails once you need institutional capital distributed across global markets. Those that attempt international expansion end up layering custom compliance systems for each region, often rebuilding core infrastructure every time. That approach caps your addressable market before you start. It explains why the technology keeps advancing while institutional adoption stalls. BlackRock can tokenize funds across seven blockchains, but if each blockchain operates in regulatory isolation, you haven’t solved the problem; you’ve just multiplied it. The next generation of RWA platforms won’t eliminate regulatory complexity, because that’s unrealistic given how different jurisdictions operate. What they can do is abstract it so the complexity becomes invisible to the end user. Think of it like payment processing. Stripe doesn’t ask merchants to build separate integrations for Visa, Mastercard, American Express and every regional payment method. You plug into Stripe once, and it handles all the backend complexity of routing transactions through different networks, applying the right fraud checks and managing compliance requirements across payment types. The merchant gets a single API, but customers can pay however they choose. Modular compliance tokenized assets should work the same way. You build your platform once with compliance layers that plug into a unified technology stack. When you tokenize an asset, the system automatically enforces jurisdiction-specific rules based on each investor’s location. It all happens programmatically, without anyone manually coordinating fifteen different regulatory regimes. The technology to do this already exists. Smart contracts can encode transfer restrictions by jurisdiction. Automated AML systems flag suspicious activity in real time. Reusable digital identity solutions handle cross-border KYC without forcing investors to resubmit documents for every platform they touch. What’s been missing is someone building these capabilities into a unified system that institutions trust and regulators can audit. Institutional investors don’t just want compliance in the abstract sense. They want concrete proof that they can show to regulators on demand. That means real-time reports that update automatically, immutable transaction records that can’t be altered after the fact, and the ability to demonstrate—at any time to any regulator—that every single trade followed all applicable rules from day one. Every question of who owned which asset, when and under what legal framework should have a clear, auditable answer. The platforms that win institutional adoption will be the ones where compliance isn’t something you retrofit onto an existing system but is something that’s native to how the platform operates from its core architecture. Every transaction should generate a proper audit trail automatically, every token transfer should validate all regulatory requirements before execution and every corporate action should get logged in ways that satisfy both blockchain transparency standards and traditional financial oversight requirements. If the first generation of RWA platforms proved that tokenization can work, the next must prove that it can scale. That won’t happen through more pilots or technical proofs of concept. It will require infrastructure designed for a fragmented regulatory world from day one. The future of tokenized finance won’t belong to whoever builds the flashiest blockchain integrations, but to whoever builds compliance that travels. Until platforms can offer global reach with local precision, the trillion-dollar opportunity in tokenized assets will remain trapped behind national borders.

Title: WealthStack Roundup: GeoWealth Launches Private Model Marketplace

A flurry of wealthtech announcements from Asset-Map and eMoney, Evergreen Wealth, Alphathena, d1g1t, and PreciseFP this week. November 7, 2025 GeoWealth, a turnkey asset management platform, introduced a Private Model Marketplace that coalesces strategies it's been amassing for the past year using models constructed by Apollo, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Through GeoWealth’s unified managed account technology, advisors using the platform can build custom models or pick from pre-built ones that include exposure to private markets. Users can create standalone models or combine them with public models in the same custodial account. “We built the Private Model Marketplace to provide advisors with a turnkey, fully managed solution that delivers private market exposure without the operational burden,” GeoWealth CEO Colin Falls said in a statement. “We believe the industry is in its early days of private markets adoption, and our purpose-built technology will help RIAs meet client demand in these asset classes.” The move is the culmination of a series of announcements. In June 2024, the firm raised $18 million in growth investment funding, with BlackRock as a new lead investor. Then this past August, it raised $38 million in Series C funding led by Apollo. The two firms also announced a partnership centered on public-private model portfolios. Related:The Word on WealthTech for October 2025 In addition, just over one year ago, GeoWealth announced partnerships with Goldman Sachs and iCapital centered around bringing private market options to models. It forged a similar pact with J.P. Morgan Asset Management last month. Advisors using both Asset-Map and eMoney Advisor are now able to import their clients’ planning data from the latter and take full advantage of the visual storytelling tools in the former, thanks to a new integration announced between the two this week. Simply put, vast numbers of advisors rely on eMoney to perform complex and comprehensive financial planning for their clients, but using Asset-Map, advisors can visually illustrate the context of entire households and their assets, helping to simplify conversations and more clearly delineate and present household recommendations. And with the integration, Asset-Map reports can be easily dropped into the eMoney vault. A live demonstration from both teams online is scheduled for Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET (registration required). A month after a splashy launch, the new RIA created by former Personal Capital CEO Bill Harris, Evergreen Wealth, has announced a key third-party technology partnership. Related:Summit Financial: A Wealthstack For All Apex Fintech Solutions Inc. will provide its AscendOS a real-time, cloud-based investment platform, to power Evergreen’s investing platform, Dynamic Portfolios. Evergreen’s mission, once its technology stack is in place, is to serve “investors with a hyper-personalized, tax-optimized index of individual securities tuned to their specific goals, risk tolerance, tax rate and values, to deliver sophisticated, after-tax wealth management once reserved for ultra-high-net-worth clients,” according to a statement. Alphathena, which specializes in AI-enhanced direct indexing for financial advisors, announced this week the launch of Long/Short Leveraged Direct Indexing, providing advisors with access to an investing approach that was previously used by and mainly available only to institutional investors. Using the new technology will require margin accounts at Schwab, Fidelity or Interactive Brokers, but there are no additional fees or setup required at this time. The company launched at the end of 2022 and was named Best in Show at the 2023 Morningstar Fintech Showcase, and this year was the winner of the 2025 WealthManagement.com Industry Award for Direct Indexing. Related:The WealthStack Podcast: The Digital Experience Platform Playbook with Tom Fields d1g1t (pronounced “digit”), an enterprise provider of advisory technology headquartered in Canada that serves the U.S. advisory market, announced this week that it has re-engineered the core data and processing layers of its platform to deliver better performance, scalability and resilience, enabling it to support millions of accounts and accelerate more complex operations, including reporting, rebalancing and billing. According to the firm, the updates allow for faster load times, boosted performance for real-time calculations and data rendering. Core components have also been upgraded to reduce disruptions and ensure uptime. There have also been improvements in linking research to individual securities meant to help streamline due diligence. The firm rolled out extensive billing features and a Unified Managed Accounts framework a year ago. PreciseFP, the venerable client engagement and data gathering tool popular with advisors and acquired by Docupace in 2021, announced a significant upgrade to its user interface as well as new AI tools this week. The interface refresh is meant to streamline navigation and present a cleaner, more simplified layout, while the AI Template Builder, which is in beta, enables firms to create complete, client-ready forms in seconds, drastically reducing prep times. Docupace recently rolled out integrations with Focal, Flextract and Zocks.

Title: U.S. investors dump $700M in Bitcoin – Is BTC’s $100K support at risk?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/u-s-investors-dump-700m-in-bitcoin-is-btcs-100k-support-at-risk/

Here’s why Bitcoin could drop to $95K in November. Major economic zones were aggressively selling Bitcoin, with the US at the forefront. The odds of Bitcoin reaching $95,000 have climbed to 48%. Bitcoin [BTC] was trading near the $100K mark at press time. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has dropped by 1.5%, with further downside possible due to widespread selling pressure globally. The U.S. was leading in selling BTC, at the time of writing, as seen in the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index. The index has been in the red region since the 30th of October, reflecting the massive dumping by U.S. entities. For instance, BlackRock sold 6,800 BTC valued at more than $700 million, averaging about $30 million per transaction. The entity did not seem to stop this capital outflow from Bitcoin and its products ahead of the Fed announcement. Source: CoinGlass Additionally, Bitcoin ETF flows turned positive after six consecutive days of outflows. As per a post by Satoshi Staker, BTC ETFs saw about $240 million in inflows in the past 24 hours, though it was not enough to counter the outflows. The aggressive dumping by US entities made any reversal difficult, as other jurisdictions also mirrored this behavior. The chances of a market reversal were low, as selling pressure extended across Asia and the European Union. Over the past week, Bitcoin’s Cumulative Return By Session fell from roughly +3% to -4%, reflecting growing bearish momentum. Bearish sentiment intensified, with sellers dominating each session. On the 6th of November, sell orders far outweighed ETF inflows, effectively wiping out buy-side demand. Source: Velo This sentiment was reflected in Polymarket’s prediction markets about “What price will Bitcoin hit in November?” The chances of BTC dipping to $95,000 rose to 48%, while the odds of a decline to $90,000 now stand at 24%. Meanwhile, chances of BTC climbing to $115,000 or higher have fallen, averaging between 2% and 8%. Overall market sentiment remains tilted toward selling, likely influenced by the AI bubble, record job cuts, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. In addition, global tariff tensions have added further pressure on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. As the odds of a reversal continue to shrink, the CVD divergences could hint at when to anticipate one. According to Hyblock Capital data, whenever selling exceeded buying on shorter timeframes, prices tended to close higher, and vice versa. Source: Hyblock Capital Altogether, Bitcoin was undergoing massive sell pressure across the globe, explaining the current weakness. Therefore, a recovery could happen only when bids outweighed asks and aggressive selling halted.

Title: It’s Part of the Game: Matt Tuttle on Closing ETFs and Looking to the Stars

ETF Upside sat down with Tuttle to discuss his approach to ETFs and what has him so interested in alien technology. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com Matthew Tuttle isn’t necessarily looking to be in most portfolios. In fact, he said his company’s strategies are better fits for clients seeking high risks and high rewards, and they often speak more directly to Reddit day traders with Robinhood accounts than moms and pops with IRAs. Tuttle Capital Management has a slew of 2x single-stock funds, and tries to avoid strong correlation with major indexes. It’s also not afraid to bet on out-of-this-world ideas. “The S&P 500 is great, but launching an S&P 500 fund is never going to work from our standpoint,” Tuttle said. ETF Upside sat down with Tuttle recently to discuss his approach to ETFs, what happens when a fund doesn’t work out and what has him so interested in alien technology. ETF Upside: What’s the philosophy behind your ETFs? Matt Tuttle: I’m an active trader, so a good idea is something I would buy. I’m not going to launch a product that I wouldn’t touch with a 10-foot pole. It’s also got to be something that I can market. My space is with self-directed investors and some independent advisors. I can’t compete with BlackRock, so I’m never getting into Merrill Lynch, UBS or anything like that. A fund needs to be different from what’s already out there. Being first is huge, especially for us. BlackRock can be 10th, and it doesn’t matter. For me, we’ve got to be first. If we’re not first, I’m probably not interested. The UFO Disclosure AI Powered ETF turned some heads. What prompted filing for that fund? This is something I’ve been fascinated with since I was a kid. Where that fascination turned into a product started in 2017 when The New York Times broke a story about a secret Pentagon group that was tracking UFOs. They provided footage of fighter pilots chasing these Tic Tac things that moved in ways that theoretically are impossible. Everyone’s asking, “Are they aliens? Are they Chinese? Are they this or that?” which are all great questions. But I’m looking at that and saying, “What energy source are they using?” We’ve been having these Congressional meetings where people are testifying, saying we are reverse-engineering some of this technology. This topic has so much disinformation in it that it’s hard to know what to believe, but if that technology were to ever surface, it would be a game-changer. I was trading in the early days of the internet. I’m now actively trading AI stocks. If a source of free energy were made available, it would be the biggest thing ever, so I filed an ETF for it. I had serious people, not the tinfoil hat people, but serious people reaching out to me — people high up in big investment firms, reporters, venture capitalists, academics, those who had been in the defense industry — saying this was really cool and the tech exists. Also, if we’re ever going to get the truth, I think this [Trump] administration is going to be the one that does it. You’ve filed for and issued a lot of single-stock or single-asset funds. What advantages do you see in those? We’ve really created an ecosystem with them. When we first started doing this, it was Tesla and Nvidia, and that was it. But now there’s more and more money going into more and more stocks, and post-covid, that market has gotten more thematic. There’s a group of stocks today that I think people would call meme stocks, but I don’t like that. Yesterday’s meme stocks were AMC and GameStop, which were crap companies that hedge funds would short, rightfully so. But then a bunch of retail investors banded together to crush the hedge funds. Now you’ve got a bunch of companies that are positioned to take off tomorrow. You could argue these are companies that don’t have any earnings, but they’re also positioned at the forefront of where the world is going. A lot of these stocks are not crap companies, they’re just early. Covid changed everything because you had these guys working from home, no boss over their shoulders, and they started trading stocks. They got fed up with just putting their money in the S&P 500 and earning 8% to 12% a year. They started connecting on social media, and they’re a powerful force. I just got back from Korea, and they love this stuff. You’re not allowed to gamble in Korea, so I think this is their gambling. There’s also a lot of places where people can’t buy Bitcoin, but they can buy a 2x long in MicroStrategy, so that’s what they do as the alternative. There’s a lot going on that has contributed to the rise of these 2X long single-stocks. What happens when an ETF just doesn’t work out and has to fold? It’s part of the game. As long as I have the vision of getting the fund to $15 million, I’m going to launch something. But sometimes, that doesn’t come to pass. The one that really bothered me was the inverse [Jim] Cramer fund. A lot of it was timing. If I had come out with it in 2022, we’d have billions of dollars in it, and it would’ve been awesome. I came out with it in 2023 a few months before Nvidia shared its earnings, showed the world AI is here, and the Mag 7 basically quadrupled. Everything else he calls turns to crap, but he got the Mag 7 right, and he wasn’t moving off of it. I can’t have an inverse Cramer fund and be intellectually honest about it when my personal account is loaded to the gills with the Mag 7. That one sucked. I really wanted to make it work. The company, which is planning to add mutual fund share classes to some of its ETFs, recently rebranded and put the State Street name on many ETFs while taking SPDR off of some. More than half of millennial ETF investors told Schwab that they can and will outperform boring old index funds. While far from the biggest ETFs on the market, spaced-themed funds are skyrocketing in 2025. ETFs that focus on clean energy investments in the US and globally have been outperforming the wider market this year, and by no small margin. The success of money market funds and their ETF counterparts has coincided with low interest rates and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Net flows of ETFs reached yet another record last month, and actively managed products also captured more market share. The pace of ETF launches and fund conversions is picking up, but there is a challenge to find shelf space at broker-dealers. Nearly a dozen ex-China funds have launched since 2023. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners, along with venture capital firm General Catalyst, is trying to buy Janus Henderson, and an AI makeover could be in its future. Investors who want in on Alpha Architect’s next 351 exchange ETF no longer need at least $1 million — as long as their account is at Charles Schwab. The legacy mutual fund provider has filed for a crypto index fund, bringing TradFi and DeFi one step closer together. Pictet Asset Management, which oversees $800 billion, recently launched three ETFs that lean on AI, with plans to add two emerging markets strategies early next year. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: How Tesla has prepared to defend Musk's mega pay package from legal challenges

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tesla won the war for Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay package. Now it's prepared to win future legal battles. Shareholders voted to approve the record-breaking compensation plan by a 75% margin on Thursday, paving the way for Musk to become the world's first trillionaire should he meet a series of ambitious product and financial goals. It came after the Tesla CEO's previous $56 billion pay package, which was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018 and again in 2024, was struck down by a Delaware judge last year following an investor lawsuit. Since then, Tesla has made a series of moves to ensure Musk's $1 trillion payday doesn't suffer the same fate. The EV giant has relocated its legal home from Delaware to Texas after gaining shareholder approval for the move at its 2024 annual meeting. In May, the Lone Star State passed SB 29 and SB 1057, two bills that make it much harder for small shareholders to bring legal challenges against companies. Under SB 29, litigants must now prove in a lawsuit that a company's directors are not acting in good faith and that they have engaged in fraud or violated the law. The bill also introduced a new rule that shareholders have to own at least 3% of the company's shares to bring legal action, also known as a derivative lawsuit. The threshold is not automatically applied to companies, but Tesla incorporated it into its bylaws in May. Only Musk himself and a handful of large, institutional investors, including BlackRock and Vanguard Group, own more than 3% of Tesla — and although shareholders can club together, $42 billion worth of shares is a high bar to meet. By contrast, the lawsuit that led to the Delaware Court of Chancery's ruling on Musk's previous pay package was bought by Richard Tornetta, a former heavy-metal drummer who owned just nine Tesla shares at the time. The judge in the Tornetta case ruled that Musk was too close to some of Tesla's board members for them to act independently, and that Tesla's board did not do enough to justify how it arrived at the package's $56 billion figure. Legal professors told Business Insider that it would be far more difficult for shareholders to bring legal challenges against Musk's new pay package in Texas. "I think that it would be a very hard road to challenge this in court," said William Magnuson, a professor of law at Texas A&M University, citing the changes to Texas law that have granted heightened legal protection for company directors. "All of these really have greatly limited the ability of shareholders to challenge misbehavior by boards of directors," he said. James Spindler, a corporate and securities law professor at the University of Texas, agreed. He said that while Tesla shareholders could still challenge the level of disclosure surrounding the pay package under Texas law, as Tornetta did in Delaware, the 3% standing threshold made the prospect of a similar lawsuit unlikely. "For a public company, that's probably going to be the end of the matter. When you're talking about a multibillion-dollar company, there just aren't going to be that many people that own 3% of the shares," Spinder added. After a Delaware court struck down his last pay package, Musk urged other companies to leave the state, and several have followed Tesla and SpaceX's lead. The Diamond state has since tweaked its corporate law provisions to make it harder for small shareholders to bring derivative lawsuits. Delaware's move came as states like Texas and Nevada attempt to woo big companies with their own director-friendly regulations, and Magnuson said that companies are increasingly seeking to move to states with "friendlier" corporate law statutes that place more limits on shareholder's rights. "I think that we're at the beginning of a real sea change in the way that corporate law works," he added. Jump to

Title: Bitcoin ETFs snap 6-day outflow streak as key trendline is back in focus

BlackRock and Fidelity led a rebound in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows on Thursday, as traders shifted their focus to the 50-week EMA at about $100,000. Key takeaways: Bitcoin ETFs recorded $240 million in inflows on Thursday, ending a six-day outflow streak. Bitcoin’s failure to drop below the 50-day EMA suggests strong support in this area. Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) ended a six-day outflow streak with inflows returning on Thursday, leading traders to say they believe that a recovery is imminent as long as the BTC price holds the 50-week EMA. US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs ended a six-day streak of net outflows on Thursday, with $240 million in daily inflows. The outflow streak started on Oct. 29 and extended through Wednesday, with the biggest outflows comprising $577.74 million on Tuesday. Related: Crypto ETFs ‘punching above weight’ as almost half of ETF investors plan buys The streak of outflows followed a Bitcoin market correction that saw BTC price plunge below $100,000 for the first time since June. On Tuesday, the BTC/USD pair reached a four-month low of $98,900. The price had recovered 3% on Friday. The largest inflow was to BlackRock’s ETF, IBIT, at $112.4 million. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $61.6 million, while ARK Invest’s ARKB added $60.4 million. Bitwise’s BITB posted moderate inflows of $5.5 million and $2.48 million, while the rest of the ETFs saw no inflows or outflows. Cumulative net inflows remain robust at $60.5 billion, and total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs stand at $135.43 billion, accounting for 5.42% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. After dropping to $98,000 on Tuesday, Bitcoin quickly reclaimed the $100,000 psychological level, which coincided with the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA). This suggested that bulls were aggressively defending this level. Note that this trendline (yellow line in the chart below) has supported the price since September 2023, and losing it would be detrimental for the bulls. Bitcoin is “sitting right at the 50-week SMA, the line in the sand,” wrote YouTuber Lark Davis in a Thursday post on X, adding: “So far Bitcoin is still holding the 50-week EMA,” pseudonymous technical analyst Chad said, adding that it is important for the BTC/USD pair to close the week above this level. Fellow analyst Rekt Capital wrote that Bitcoin appears to be bottoming out around the 50-day EMA and must make a “cluster of lower lows” at this level to establish a bottom. As Cointelegraph reported, the MVRV ratio (market value to realized value) suggested $98,000 may have indeed marked the local bottom for BTC, suggesting that the price can recover due to seller exhaustion.
