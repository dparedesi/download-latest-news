We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest Dividend Cuts and Suspensions of 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) stands against the other stocks. Dividends hold great appeal for investors—they appreciate receiving them and strongly dislike reductions. Despite this, numerous major companies have reduced their dividend payments over time for various reasons. This trend, which gained momentum in 2020, persists as many companies continue to recover from the financial impact of the pandemic, leading to further dividend cuts. According to research by McKinsey, outside of financial crises, only 1% to 2% of dividend-paying companies reduce their payouts annually, typically involving seven or eight major firms. The key for investors is to identify such companies in advance and avoid them until after the dividend has been reduced, which can present new opportunities. However, predicting which companies might cut dividends can be challenging. Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek highlighted three warning signs: excessively high yields, which may indicate underlying problems; high debt levels, which divert cash flow to interest payments rather than shareholders; and a high payout of free cash flow, leaving little cushion for the company in times of economic downturns or recessions. Also read: 10 Dividend Stocks For Steady Income While dividend cuts are generally disappointing for investors, Morgan Stanley offers an interesting perspective on them. Although dividend stocks typically suffer when payouts are reduced, some of these stocks might still present opportunities, according to the firm. Companies often cut dividends due to financial difficulties or economic challenges. Research from Morgan Stanley shows that investors usually sell off these stocks in the six months after the cuts are announced. However, once the initial negative reaction is factored in, there may be attractive buying opportunities in certain cases, as noted by strategist Todd Castagno. Here are some comments from the analyst: “In the 6-months following a change in regular quarterly dividend policy, we found companies that announced a dividend cut of more than -25% underperformed the market by -1,200 bps, on average, while smaller dividend reductions outperformed by +480 bps, on average.” According to Castagno, one year after announcing a dividend reduction, companies that cut their payouts by 30% or less outperformed the market by 1,900 basis points, while those with cuts deeper than 30% lagged the market by 1,800 basis points on average. Morgan Stanley analyzed Russell 1000 dividend-paying companies that reduced their dividends between 1962 and 2024. Over the past year, numerous companies have lowered their payouts, and the firm compiled a list of 30 such companies, excluding those in the financial, utilities, and real estate sectors. While many firms implemented significant dividend cuts, several reduced their dividends by 30% or less. That said, many companies have regained strong footing and recovered quickly after the pandemic, which has led to a decline in the number of dividend cuts over the years. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices revealed that only 27 companies reduced their dividends in Q3 2024, marking a 56.5% decrease from 62 companies in Q3 2023. The total value of these cuts was $4.6 billion in Q3 2024, down from $9.2 billion in the same quarter the previous year. Over the 12 months ending in September 2024, 140 companies reduced their dividend payments, a significant 70.8% drop from 479 cuts in the prior 12-month period. The overall value of dividend decreases for the current period was $19.5 billion, a 26.4% reduction compared to $26.4 billion during the previous 12 months. Despite these encouraging numbers, many major companies have disappointed investors by reducing their dividend payouts in 2024. Our Methodology: For this list, we checked companies that have announced dividend reductions in 2024 due to the current market conditions and other factors and picked 10 prominent names from that list. Next, we ranked these stocks according to the number of hedge fund investors having stakes in them at the end of Q3 2024, according to Insider Monkey's database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:EL) is an American multinational cosmetics company that offers a wide range of related products and services. Due to the complexities of the prestige beauty market, including the challenges in predicting the timing of recovery in mainland China and Asia travel retail, the company slashed its dividend to a more suitable payout ratio. This reduction also provides greater financial flexibility for the incoming leadership team to accelerate the company's profitable growth. The company still considers dividends an important part of its capital allocation strategy, provided the payout ratio is appropriate. In fiscal Q1 2025, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) reported revenue of $3.36 billion, down by 4.5% from the same period last year. Despite its challenges, the company is working to overcome its struggles. It has seen strong organic sales growth in the Skin Care category, particularly in the EMEA markets, driven by the popularity of its night-time innovations. In addition, the company achieved significant share gains in prestige Skin Care in China for the second consecutive quarter, led by La Mer. The company has also advanced its strategy to capitalize on the growth opportunities in Fragrance. It expanded the reach of its luxury and artisanal portfolio and launched BALMAIN Beauty, aiming to solidify its strategic position in the luxury Fragrance market. This was reflected in the quarter when the company became the top-ranked player in Japan’s Fragrance category, driven by Le Labo and Jo Malone London. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) ended the quarter with $2.35 billion available in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, it returned $0.24 billion to shareholders through dividends. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share for a dividend yield of 1.88%, as of December 22. As per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 49 hedge funds owned stakes in The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), up from 47 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $1.87 billion. Among these hedge funds, D E Shaw was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall EL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks with the biggest dividend cuts in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of EL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21 Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) is a Missouri-based manufacturing company that mainly specializes in products found in homes and automobiles. Before slashing its dividend this year, the company was a Dividend King with 52 consecutive years of dividend growth under its belt. Unfortunately, the company can no longer be considered a dividend grower following its decision to implement an 89% dividend cut earlier this year. This move wasn’t unexpected, as the company's cash flow had been persistently volatile, putting pressure on its balance sheet. Free cash flow, which stood at over $602 million in 2020, declined to $497.2 million by 2023. As a result, the stock is down by over 63% since the start of 2024. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) reported mixed earnings in the third quarter of 2024. The company's revenue of $1.10 billion fell by 6.27% from the same period last year. The revenue also missed analysts' estimates by $2.12 million. Despite this, the company managed to reduce its debt by $124 million, and its adjusted EBIT margin improved by 60 basis points sequentially during the quarter. That said, Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) is not completely out of the woods as management indicated that weak demand in residential end markets is likely to continue into the fourth quarter, driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment and reduced consumer spending. Furthermore, the Automotive segment remains under pressure due to challenges associated with the shift to electric vehicles, affordability concerns among consumers, and economic weakness in Europe. Consequently, the company has revised its sales and earnings per share (EPS) guidance downward. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.06%, as recorded on December 22. As per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 21 hedge funds held stakes in Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG), the same as in the previous quarter. The overall value of these stakes is over $127.7 million. With over 2.1 million shares, D E Shaw was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall LEG ranks 7th on our list of the stocks with the biggest dividend cuts in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of LEG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Time Published: 2024-12-23T17:26:53Z

The recently-released 2025 Crypto Market Outlook report by Coinbase Institutional provides a comprehensive analysis of the cryptocurrency industry’s trajectory. Cryptocurrencies are evolving beyond their speculative origins, with the total market capitalization surging 96% in 2024 to reach $3.4 trillion by December. Coinbase attributes this growth to significant milestones such as the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. and the rapid proliferation of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Coinbase highlights the pivotal role of institutional players in driving crypto adoption. Inflows into spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, led by BlackRock and Fidelity, totaled $30.7 billion in 2024, illustrating the confidence of traditional asset managers in digital assets. Beyond ETFs, tokenized government securities and private credit have been embraced by firms such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Tokenized RWAs grew by 60% in 2024 to a market size of $13.5 billion, with projections suggesting growth could exceed $30 trillion over the next five years. This transformation is expected to streamline cross-border settlements and create 24/7 markets for traditionally illiquid assetshe “Killer App” of Crypto** Coinbase calls stablecoins the “killer app” of the crypto ecosystem, noting their 48% market cap growth in 2024 to $193 billion. Stablecoins settled $27.1 trillion in transactions during the year, triple the amount in 2023. According to Coinbase, innovations in programmable stablecoins and their integration into global payment systems are unlocking unprecedented efficiencies for remittances and cross-border commerce. Coinbase looks at the role of stablecoins in addressing systemic challenges like the U.S. debt burden, and says policymakers are increasingly recognizing their potential . The report sheds light on groundbreaking innovations such as Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade in March 2024, which cut rollup transaction costs by up to 90%. The adoption of layer-2 solutions has surged, with daily transactions on Ethereum-based rollups growing by 289% in 2024. These advancements are making blockchain technology more scalable, cost-effective, and user-friendly. Further upgrades, like Ethereum’s Pectra fork planned for early 2025, aim to enhance network efficiency while laying the groundwork for smart wallet adoption . Regulatory clarity is highlighted as a key driver for crypto market growth in 2025. Coinbase notes that progress in global regulatory frameworks has improved institutional confidence in the asset class. Developments in major jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, and Asia, are expected to shape a more predictable environment for both investors and developers. Coinbase emphasizes that clearer regulations will foster greater consumer trust and accelerate mainstream adoption of digital assets. The integration of arlligence (AI) and blockchain technology is identified as a major trend. Coinbase describes the emergence of autonomous AI agents capable of managing crypto wallets and facilitating transactions as a potential game-changer. While the long-term implications remain uncertain, the convergence of AI and crypto could unlock novel use cases and drive further adoption .

Title: Is Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings (KNX) the Best Trucking Stock to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 9 Best Trucking Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KNX) stands against the other best trucking stocks. Trucking stocks are businesses that offer both local and long-distance freight and cargo transportation and transfer services. According to Global Market Insights, the growing urbanization and infrastructure development are expected to fuel the global freight trucking industry, which was valued at $2.5 trillion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.2% between 2024 and 2032. The market is divided into local and long-haul groups based on distance. The local segment’s market share was approximately 55% in 2023, and by 2032, it is anticipated to surpass $1.5 trillion. The freight trucking market is divided into many segments based on trucks, including refrigerated trucks, flatbed trucks, truck trailers, and lorry tanks. In 2023, the truck trailer segment’s market share was approximately 36%. In terms of revenue share, the North American freight trucking market had a 35% position in 2023. Connectivity is anticipated to be crucial in changing these market segments as the industry develops further. Rupert Stuetzle, general manager of EMEA manufacturing and mobility, stated, “When we look at full logistics-as-a-service solutions, connected services could support higher-level services beyond road transport.” According to a research report by McKinsey & Company, improvements in fleet management, driver assistance, and the adoption of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) could open up a profit pool of over $3 billion by 2035 because of connected, data-enabled services in commercial vehicles. For instance, fleet management systems already assist big retailers in reducing their diesel usage by up to 8%, and linked ZEVs allow for charge planning and route optimization. By 2030, it is projected that 20–25% of new vehicle sales in the US and 40% in Europe will be ZEVs. Additionally, generative AI is simplifying aftermarket services and vehicle design, with OEM-neutral solutions and new data marketplaces opening up new revenue streams. Initiatives like Eclipse SDV and COVESA are building open data standards, which will improve fleet connection and operational efficiency. The truck sales industry is anticipated to stay stable in 2024 as a result of these standards. According to the S&P Mobility report, truck sales are likely to stay unchanged in 2024, but due to better economic conditions and the incentive to purchase before 2027 diesel-truck pollution regulations take effect, momentum is anticipated to rise toward a record-setting 2026. Through the midterm, the industry’s adoption of electric cars will be shaped by federal Greenhouse Gas Phase 3 emission regulations and California’s Advanced Clean Trucks law. As per S&P Mobility, the industry’s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) ambitions and aspirations are at a crossroads in the next 36 months. However, recently, the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI) claimed that the trucking business is suffering greatly as a result of traffic congestion on US highways. According to ATRI’s Cost of Congestion research, operating expenses soared despite fewer hours of congestion, costing the U.S. trucking industry $108.8 billion in 2022—a 15% increase from 2021. This translates to $7,588 per registered truck and more than 430,000 truck drivers sitting idle for a year. Texas, California, and Florida led state costs with $9.17 billion, $8.77 billion, and $8.44 billion, respectively, accounting for 52% of overall costs. The cities with the largest urban delays were Chicago ($3.14 billion), Miami ($3.2 billion), and New York City ($6.68 billion). Fuel expenses rose by $32.1 billion due to the waste of 6.4 billion gallons of diesel. With the holiday season around the corner, the trucking and logistics industry is experiencing strong Christmas demand, fueled by high consumer spending and e-commerce. According to the National Retail Federation, retail sales are projected to surge by 2.5% to 3.5% over 2023, with a near-record 197 million shoppers expected over Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. In addition, According to a survey, 48% of small and medium-sized businesses anticipate more holiday sales than they did the year before. “Despite negative expectations, the U.S. consumer is still in healthy shape,” remarked Mazen Danaf, staff applied scientist and economist at Uber Freight. Despite supply chain issues and port disruptions, growth has been fueled by investments in fulfillment and route optimization, record Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales, and faster delivery times.

(see more details here) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 30 One of the Best Freight Stocks, Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KNX), is the largest truckload carrier in the United States, delivering a wide range of transportation services. According to the company’s asset-based trucking business, approximately 82% of revenue comes from the U.S. Xpress deal pro forma. Full truckload (for-hire dry van, refrigerated, and dedicated contract) accounts for 69% of revenue, while less than truckload accounts for 13%. Intermodal accounts for around 6% of revenue, while truck brokerage and other asset-light logistics services account for 9%. The firm’s intermodal operations comprise drayage (regional trucking services to and from inland intermodal ramps/terminals) and the underlying movement of its shipping containers on Class I railroads. Services provided to shippers and third-party truckers, such as equipment leasing and maintenance, make up the remaining revenue. Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KNX)’s bull case is its rising less-than-truckload (LTL) business, which had a 16.7% revenue increase yearly in Q3 of 2024, due to network development with 16 new locations and the DHE purchase. Improvements in the operating ratio also indicate operational efficiency, and the logistics segment’s increased revenue per load by 13.6% YoY shows pricing power. Additionally, in Q3 of 2024, the operating cash increased by 41.46% yearly. Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KNX) price objective was increased from $62 to $68. According to the company, significantly higher less-than-truckload multiples indicate that the market is excited about opportunities beyond the current slowdown.

The company argues that an upcycle study reveals the group has a lot of volume potential, which is strengthened by share increases in addition to demand recovery. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey’s database. It owns 3.75 million shares worth $202.11 million as of Q3.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 12 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) stands against other oil and gas stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. With a record average production of 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023, the United States is the Biggest Oil Producing Country in the World. Every year, the indigenous production of oil and gas helps save American consumers an estimated $203 billion, or $2,500 for each family of four. Moreover, the oil and gas industry supports over 12 million American jobs, provides billions of dollars in tax revenue, and ensures energy security. READ ALSO: 11 Best Cannabis Stocks to Invest In According to OPEC, the global oil demand increased by 2.5 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2023 to average 102.2 mb/d, surpassing pre-pandemic levels for the first time. The major part of this uptick came from the non-OECD countries, which posted YoY growth of about 2.4 mb/d to average 56.4 mb/d, surpassing pre-pandemic levels for the second consecutive year. As per the IEA’s recent market outlook, growth in the global demand for oil is expected to slow down in the coming years as energy transitions advance. However, despite the sluggish growth, the world oil demand is still forecast to be 3.2 mb/d higher in 2030 than in 2023, unless stronger policy measures are implemented or changes in behavior take hold. As 2024 comes to a close, oil prices have moved in the narrowest range this year since 2019, with Brent crude oil prices exhibiting a minimal average monthly change and a monthly range-bound movement between $69 and $90. The general opinion is that a soft demand, coupled with an abundant supply, even on hold, has contributed to the relative stability we witnessed this year. China’s faltering economy and its shift towards electric vehicles and LNG-fueled trucks weighed heavily on the crude oil demand this year. According to a recent report by the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, the world’s largest oil-importing country may see its demand peak in 2025, five years earlier than expected, as the shift away from fossil fuels accelerates. The report reveals that China’s oil demand could reach 770 million tons next year, before gradually falling to 240 million tons by 2060. As a consequence of the slowdown in the global oil demand, Brent futures prices have shed more than 5% so far this year, setting up a second consecutive annual loss. J.P. Morgan analysts have predicted that the global oil market is widely expected to be in a surplus in 2025, as supply will outpace demand to the tune of 1.2 million b/d. Brent crude prices are forecast to average around $73 a barrel next year, according to a Reuters tally of 11 brokerages that have issued price targets. The bleak outlook has inevitably caused the oil and gas stocks to tumble and the broader market’s Energy sector has dropped by 13.42% over the last month, while the overall market has stayed relatively stable and lost only 0.3% during the same period. However, despite the falling prices and decreasing margins, the oil and gas industry is contributing massively to the global economy and shareholder return. A recent report from Deloitte has revealed that the O&G sector distributed nearly $213 billion in dividends and $136 billion in buybacks between January 2024 and mid-November 2024. Also, over the last four years, the industry’s capital expenditures have increased by 53%, while its net profit has risen by nearly 16%. Moreover, an increasing number of oil majors are now investing in low-carbon technology projects to help balance the risks associated with the traditional fossil fuel market. To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 8 companies operating in the oil and gas sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. When two or more companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year instead. Following are the Best Energy Stocks Held by the Most Hedge Funds. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A pipeline worker overseeing the flow of crude oil into storage tanks from an integrated water system. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) is a Texas-based independent oil and natural gas company, specializing in unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin of West Texas. In September, Diamondback completed its merger with Endeavor Energy Resources, creating a leading operator focused on the Permian Basin. Moreover, the company has also announced an asset trade agreement with TRP Energy, enhancing its Midland Basin position. Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) had a strong Q3 as it reported a revenue uptick of 13%, driven by higher production volumes following the merger and an increase in oil sales. It also had a net income of $659 million and adjusted net income of $698 million for the third quarter. The company reported a free cash flow of $708 million and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.9 per share. Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) has experienced six straight years of dividend growth and has a 5-year dividend CAGR of almost 49%. The company has also increased its share repurchase authorization to $6 billion, demonstrating a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. At the end of Q3 2024, shares of Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) were held by 49 hedge funds in the IM database with a total stake value of $1.67 billion, up by a significant 85.5% from the previous quarter. Chartwell Investment Partners, LLC, said the following about Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) in its Q3 investment letter: “Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) is an exploration and production company with operations focused on the Mid-land and Delaware basins, both located within the Permian Basin in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. While fundamental performance remains solid, shares were pressured by lower oil prices.” Overall, FANG ranks 10th on our list of oil and gas stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for FANG to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: 7 Predictions For Crypto In 2025: Bitcoin, ETFs & Global Adoption
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeorshimron/2024/12/23/7-predictions-for-crypto-in-2025-bitcoin-etfs--global-adoption/
Time Published: 2024-12-23T15:00:23Z
Full Content:
7 Predictions for Crypto in 2025: Bitcoin, ETFs & Global Adoption The year 2024 marked a historic turning point for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. It saw the launch of the first Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, signaling genuine institutional adoption. Bitcoin shattered the $100,000 milestone for the first time, while stablecoins continued to reinforce the global dominance of the US dollar. Adding to this momentum, the winning U.S. presidential candidate made support for Bitcoin a central pillar of his campaign. Collectively, these milestones cemented 2024 as the year the crypto industry proved itself to be an unstoppable force on the global stage. As the industry shifts its focus to 2025, here are my seven predictions of major events we can expect to take place next year. 1) A major G7 or BRICS nation will establish and announce a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The Trump administration’s proposal to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) for the United States has sparked widespread debate and speculation. While adding Bitcoin to the U.S. Treasury’s balance sheet would require considerable political willpower and congressional approval, the mere suggestion of such an initiative carries profound implications. By signaling the possibility of an SBR, the U.S. effectively invites other major nations to consider a similar move. Game theory suggests that these countries may feel incentivized to preemptively act, potentially front-running the U.S. to secure a strategic advantage in diversifying their national reserves. Bitcoin’s limited supply and its emerging role as a digital store of value could heighten the urgency for nations to act quickly. The race is now on for the first major country to integrate Bitcoin into its reserve strategy, diversifying alongside traditional holdings like gold, foreign currencies, and sovereign bonds. Such a move would not only solidify Bitcoin’s status as a global reserve asset but could also reshape the dynamics of international finance, with far-reaching implications for economic and geopolitical power structures. The establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by any leading economy could mark the beginning of a new era in sovereign wealth management. 2) Stablecoin growth will continue, doubling to exceed $400 billion Stablecoins have emerged as one of crypto's most successful mainstream use cases, offering a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem. Across the globe, millions use stablecoins for remittance payments, everyday transactions, and as a hedge against the volatility of local currencies by accessing the relative stability of the U.S. dollar. In 2024, stablecoins reached an all-time high of $200 billion in circulating supply, dominated by market leaders Tether and Circle. These digital currencies rely on blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Solana, and Tron to facilitate seamless, borderless transactions. Looking ahead, stablecoin growth is poised to accelerate in 2025, potentially doubling to exceed $400 billion. This growth will be fueled by the likely passage of stablecoin-specific legislation, which could provide much-needed regulatory clarity and foster innovation within the sector. U.S. regulators are increasingly recognizing the strategic importance of stablecoins in strengthening the global dominance of the U.S. dollar, reinforcing its status as the world’s reserve currency. Stablecoins reached a new all time high this year exceeding $200 billion in total supply for the ... [+] first time. The growth was led by Tether and Circle's USDC. 3) Bitcoin DeFi enabled by L2s will be a dominant growth trend Bitcoin is evolving beyond its role as a store of value, with Layer 2 (L2) networks like Stacks, BOB, Babylon, CoreDAO, and others unlocking the potential for a thriving Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. These L2s enhance Bitcoin's scalability and programmability, enabling decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to flourish on the most secure and decentralized blockchain. In 2024, Stacks had a transformative year with the launch of the Nakamoto Upgrade and sBTC. The Nakamoto Upgrade allowed Stacks to inherit 100% Bitcoin finality and introduced faster block speeds, significantly improving user experience. Meanwhile, sBTC, a trustless Bitcoin-pegged asset launched in December, enabled seamless participation in DeFi activities such as lending, borrowing, swapping, and staking—all anchored to Bitcoin’s security. Previously, Bitcoin holders seeking DeFi opportunities were forced to wrap their Bitcoin on other networks like Ethereum. This process relies on centralized custodians such as WBTC (BitGo), BTCB (Binance), and cbBTC (Coinbase), exposing users to centralization and censorship risks. Bitcoin L2s reduce these risks, offering a more decentralized alternative to put Bitcoin to work natively within its own ecosystem. Looking ahead to 2025, Bitcoin DeFi is poised for exponential growth. I predict that the total value locked (TVL) on Bitcoin L2s will surpass the $24 billion currently represented by wrapped Bitcoin derivatives, which accounts for about 1.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. With Bitcoin’s market cap at $2 trillion, L2 networks will enable users to more securely and efficiently unlock this immense latent value, solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a cornerstone of decentralized finance. Wrapped Bitcoin derivative tokens on other blockchains make up over $24 billion or about 1.2% of the ... [+] total Bitcoin supply. 4) Bitcoin ETFs will continue their surge and new crypto-focused ETFs will emerge The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs marked a historic milestone, becoming the most successful ETF debut in history. Attracting over $108 billion in assets under management (AUM) within its first year, these ETFs demonstrated unparalleled demand from both retail and institutional investors. Major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest played pivotal roles in bringing regulated Bitcoin exposure to traditional financial markets, setting the stage for a wave of innovation in crypto-focused ETFs. The Bitcoin ETFs were the most successful ETF launch ever. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, almost ... [+] doubled its Gold ETF, IAU, just in its first year. Following the success of Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum ETFs debuted, offering investors exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Looking ahead, I anticipate that staking will be integrated into Ethereum ETFs for the first time in 2025. This feature would enable investors to earn staking rewards, further enhancing the appeal and utility of these funds. I anticipate that ETFs will soon launch for other leading crypto protocols such as Solana, which has gained prominence for its high-performance blockchain, thriving DeFi ecosystem, and rapid growth in gaming, NFTs and memecoins. Additionally, we are likely to see the introduction of weighted crypto index ETFs designed to offer diversified exposure across the broader crypto market. These indices could include a mix of top-performing assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and others, along with emerging protocols, providing investors with a balanced portfolio that captures the growth potential of the entire ecosystem. Such innovations will make crypto investing more accessible, efficient, and appealing to a wide range of investors, further driving capital into the space. 5) A “Magnificent Seven” company will add Bitcoin to its balance sheet (beyond Tesla) The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has introduced fair value accounting rules for cryptocurrencies, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. These new standards require companies to report their crypto holdings, such as Bitcoin, at fair market value, capturing both gains and losses from market fluctuations in real-time. Previously, digital assets were classified as intangible assets, which forced companies to write down impaired holdings while prohibiting the recognition of unrealized gains. This conservative approach often understated the true value of crypto holdings on corporate balance sheets. The updated rules address these limitations, enabling more accurate financial reporting and making cryptocurrencies a more attractive asset for corporate treasuries. The Magnificent Seven—Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta—together hold over $600 billion in cash reserves, offering them significant flexibility to allocate a portion of their capital to Bitcoin. With the enhanced accounting framework and increasing regulatory clarity, it’s highly plausible that one of these tech giants, beyond Tesla, will add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Such a move would reflect prudent financial management by: As the new accounting rules take effect and corporate treasuries adapt, Bitcoin could emerge as a key reserve asset for the world’s largest tech companies, further legitimizing its role in the global financial system. 6) Total crypto market cap will exceed $8 trillion In 2024, the total cryptocurrency market cap surged to an all-time high of $3.8 trillion, encompassing a broad array of use cases, including Bitcoin as a store of value, stablecoins, DeFi, NFTs, memecoins, GameFi, SocialFi, and beyond. This explosive growth reflects the sector's expanding influence and the growing adoption of blockchain-based solutions across diverse industries. By 2025, the influx of developer talent into the crypto ecosystem is expected to accelerate, driving the creation of new applications that achieve product-market fit and onboard millions of additional users. This wave of innovation is likely to spawn breakthrough decentralized applications (dApps) in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and other emerging fields still in their infancy. These transformative dApps, offering tangible utility and solving real-world problems, will fuel increased adoption and economic activity within the ecosystem. As user bases expand and capital flows into the space, asset prices will follow suit, pushing the overall market capitalization to unprecedented heights. With this momentum, the crypto market is on track to surpass $8 trillion, marking continued growth and innovation for the industry. 7) A renaissance for crypto startups, the US will return as the global crypto powerhouse The U.S. crypto industry is on the brink of a transformative resurgence. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s controversial “regulation by enforcement” approach, which stifled innovation and drove many crypto startups offshore, will conclude with his departure in January. His successor, Paul Atkins, brings a starkly different perspective. A former SEC commissioner (2002–2008), Atkins is renowned for his pro-crypto stance, support for deregulation, and leadership in initiatives like the Token Alliance, a pro-crypto advocacy group. His approach promises a more collaborative regulatory framework, fostering innovation rather than suppressing it. The end of Operation Chokepoint 2.0, a covert initiative that limited crypto startups’ access to the U.S. banking system, further sets the stage for a renaissance. By restoring equitable access to banking infrastructure, the U.S. is creating an environment where blockchain developers and entrepreneurs can thrive without undue constraints. The improved regulatory clarity and renewed support for innovation will also lead to a significant increase in token launches within the U.S. Startups will feel empowered to issue tokens as part of their fundraising and ecosystem-building efforts without the fear of regulatory backlash. These tokens, ranging from utility tokens for decentralized applications to governance tokens for protocols, will attract domestic and international capital while encouraging participation in U.S.-based projects. Conclusion As we look ahead to 2025, it’s clear that the crypto industry is entering a new era of growth and maturity. With Bitcoin solidifying its role as a global reserve asset, the rise of ETFs, and the exponential growth of DeFi and stablecoins, the groundwork is being laid for widespread adoption and mainstream attention. Supported by clearer regulations and groundbreaking technologies, the crypto ecosystem is set to push boundaries and shape the future of global finance. These predictions highlight a year brimming with potential, as the industry continues to prove itself as an unstoppable force. One Community. Many Voices.

We recently published a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. On December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss his playbook for 2025. Following two years of significant gains, his playbook suggests an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market next year. Lee anticipates that the S&P 500 will rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025, before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This reflects an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, which is consistent with historical averages for stock market returns. In terms of Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimates Lee projects EPS for the S&P 500 at $260 in 2025 while estimating $300 for 2026. This is slightly below the consensus estimates from Wall Street, which average around $268 for 2025. READ ALSO: 11 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Right Now and 11 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now. Explaining his investment thesis, Lee pointed towards several themes that could drive the market in 2025. He predicts a "tale of two halves," where the first half of the year will see stronger market performance due to factors like Federal Reserve policies and business-friendly initiatives under President Trump. Conversely, he expects a pullback in the second half, reflecting historical trends after strong consecutive years. He sees potential in small-cap stocks, which have underperformed relative to large-cap stocks historically. Lee also talked about the mega caps that are leading. He mentioned that investors reach for these companies when there is even slight risk in the market. Secondly, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. With the December cut in effect, the market is bullish for tech, thereby further solidifying the investment case for megacaps. Despite his generally positive outlook, Lee acknowledges several risks that could impact market performance. For instance, he thinks the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Moreover, the implementation of tariffs could adversely affect economic conditions and corporate profits. Lee pointed out that historical patterns suggest that after two years of substantial gains, markets often experience declines in the latter half of the third year. A smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone. To compile the list of 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years, we applied a consensus approach. We sifted through recent articles to get an aggregated list of the best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. Next, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, sourced from Insider Monkey’s database. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Funds: 57 Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is a major telecommunication company in the United States. It is one of the largest wireless carriers in the country and holds over 37% market share. The company operates through Verizon Consumer Group and Verizon Business Group segments providing wireless and wired communication and data services. Several points make Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) one of the best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. Firstly the company has been successful in growing its customer base in a highly competitive market. According to its third-quarter results of fiscal 2024, it achieved 239,000 retail postpaid phone net additions, more than doubling the figure from the previous year. As a result total wireless service revenue reached $19.8 billion, indicating a 2.7% increase year-over-year. The growth has not been limited to merely the Wireless segment, its Broadband Segment also witnessed an addition of 389,000 broadband connections. This marked the ninth consecutive quarter with over 375,000 net additions. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has been actively working to expand its fiber network to accelerate its offering of premium broadband and mobility services. To achieve this, management on September 5 announced a strategic acquisition of Frontier Communications, the largest pure-play fiber provider in the United States, for $20 billion. The acquisition will increase its fiber customer base to approximately 25 million subscribers. Management has set an ambitious goal to reach 30 million fiber customers by 2028, with a long-term target of between 35 million and 40 million. Third Point Management stated the following regarding Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “While some economic activity has been showing signs of slowing, the defensive composition of the current high yield market with a high mix of higher quality credit and short duration has let the rates tailwind overwhelm such concerns. The lowest quality sectors of the market have performed best, fueled by both soft/no landing expectations, as well as two positive events in the beleaguered telecom space. Telecom/cable have been poor performers year to date due to overhang from the growth of FWA (aka “wireless cable”) and increased fiber building, however the sector re-rated materially on two deals. Second, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) announced a deal to acquire Frontier Communications (FYBR), a transaction which the fund benefited from by virtue of its investment in FYBR debt. This transaction, aimed at increasing’s VZ fiber footprint, has led to broad revaluation of fiber retail networks that we think is appropriate. While we continue to expect to see FWA rapidly erode non-upgraded cable and especially copper’s share of the low-end broadband market, the VZ deal underscores the value of the higher end footprint.” Overall, VZ ranks 10th on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential of VZ to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VZ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

December 23, 2024 09:17 ET | Source: Bitget Bitget VICTORIA, Seychelles, Dec. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitget, the leading cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 company, has listed Usual (USUAL). Trading for the USUAL/USDT pair has started, with deposits and withdrawals available. Usual is an innovative fiat-backed stablecoin protocol focused on security and decentralization. As a multi-chain infrastructure, Usual integrates tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) from entities such as BlackRock, Ondo, and Mountain Protocol, converting them into a permissionless, on-chain verifiable, and composable stablecoin USD0. When users deposit RWAs or USDC/USDT (with a third party providing RWA collateral), they receive USD0, which represents the initial value of the deposit and can be traded freely. $USUAL is the revenue-based governance token of the project. Different from conventional revenue-sharing models redistributing part of the revenue generated by stablecoins, the platform prioritizes user-centric mechanisms by redistributing 100% of value and control through its governance token. This mechanism not only redistributes revenue, it also redistributes ownership of the system, providing incentives for early adopters and offering token holders long-term upside potential. By listing USUAL, Bitget reinforces its commitment to supporting innovative DeFi projects. The inclusion of USUAL aligns with the platform’s broader vision to empower users with access to forward-thinking financial solutions that drive Web3 development.

December 23, 2024 07:30 ET | Source: Matador Technologies Inc. Matador Technologies Inc. TORONTO, Dec. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Matador Technologies Inc. (“Matador” or the “Company”) (TSXV: MATA) is proud to announce that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved adding Bitcoin and USD-denominated assets to its corporate treasury as part of its long-term capital preservation strategy. The Board has identified risks associated with its current treasury, which is primarily denominated in Canadian dollars. Canada’s reliance on oil exports and its rising national debt raise concerns about potential devaluation and loss of purchasing power for Canadian denominated assets. To address these risks, the Board has approved adding Bitcoin and USD-denominated assets to its corporate treasury.1 Matador plans to front-load an initial allocation of $4.5 million into Bitcoin in the month of December 2024 and will continue to explore additional purchases at the board level via measured buying programs. Additionally, Matador plans to move the majority of its cash balance sheet from CAD to USD. The decision reflects Matador’s belief in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value asset that mitigates the downside risk of currency debasement. This move follows global trends, as institutional adoption of Bitcoin grows among corporations seeking alternatives to bonds and depreciating currencies.2 “Matador’s Board and management believe in using Bitcoin to future-proof our treasury,” Sunny Ray, President of Matador, added. “This step also supports our mission to explore using Bitcoin as a platform for our gold-based products.” This move will continue to support the development and launch of Matador’s digital gold platform, which is a technology-based system that enables users to own, trade, and store digital representations of gold, backed by physical reserves with the physical gold being held at the Royal Canadian Mint. These holdings are expected to underpin the company’s product development efforts and reinforce confidence in the Company’s treasury management strategy. After an initial review of alternative platforms, including Ethereum and Solana, the Board believes that Bitcoin stands apart in its ability to deliver the security, stability, and trustworthiness required for a digital gold asset platform. Bitcoin’s deep liquidity and widespread institutional adoption further support the belief that Bitcoin is the ideal foundation for Matador’s vision of a trustworthy, digital gold platform.3 “For Matador’s focus on creating a product that exemplifies trust, permanence, and value, we expect Bitcoin to be the platform of choice,” said Deven Soni, CEO and Chairman of Matador. The Board will further evaluate its technology platform alternatives in the near future, with the objective of making a decision on which technology platform will underpin its digital gold product in Q1 2025. Once a decision has been made, Matador intends on launching its digital gold product to a limited audience. Matador will continue to update shareholders regarding its treasury execution and custody strategy in the coming weeks. About Matador Technologies Inc. Matador Technologies Inc. is a digital gold platform leveraging blockchain technology to digitize real-world assets like gold. Focused on building innovative financial solutions, Matador is at the forefront of integrating blockchain technology to preserve and grow value. It’s digital gold platform aims to democratize the gold buying experience, combining the best of modern technology and time-proven assets, to create an app that will allow users to buy, sell, and store gold 24/7, with the added security and flexibility of an encrypted mobile application.

Title: US House committee targets another investor climate group
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-house-committee-targets-another-investor-climate-group-3786695
Time Published: 2024-12-23T12:20:48Z

By Ross Kerber (Reuters) - The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee is seeking information from some 60 U.S. asset managers about their involvement with an investor climate group, adding pressure against environmental efforts by large investors. Letters sent on Friday to members of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, or NZAM, were signed by committee Chairman Jim Jordan and Representative Thomas Massie. They made claims in line with a committee report released on Dec. 13 that Republicans say showed fund firms colluded to cut emissions. The committee's Democrats have dismissed such claims, and big fund firms have denied similar charges. Representatives for companies that received the letter including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), State Street (NYSE:STT) and JPMorgan Asset Management did not immediately comment when contacted late on Friday. Republicans previously have taken credit for prompting those three fund managers to step back from another investor group, the Climate Action (WA:ACT) 100+. NZAM says it is an international group with more than 325 signatories managing $57.5 trillion, according to its website. Members pledge to support the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, using influence such as how they vote their proxies at corporate meetings. The letters from Jordan and Massie state that companies' efforts with NZAM and the affiliated Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero "may violate U.S. antitrust law," citing the earlier report. They ask for information such as how companies' participation in NZAM changed their stewardship strategies. Mindy Lubber, CEO of Boston-based environmental advocacy group Ceres, an organizing partner of NZAM, said in an interview that the letters were "consistent with other efforts to suggest that investors ought not to consider climate risk, when of course they should be aware of climate risk as part of their fiduciary duty."

Title: Can Ethereum Break $3,500 Before End Of 2024? Analyst Weighs In

As 2024 nears its conclusion, Ethereum price fluctuations are being closely monitored. The trajectory of the cryptocurrency is critically influenced by key resistance and support levels, as indicated by recent analysis from crypto experts, which suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook. Analyzing cryptocurrencies, Justin Bennett emphasized the importance of Ethereum recovering the $3,540 level over the weekly period on December 22. This pricing range is regarded as necessary to show a potential change in the market toward optimism. Should Ethereum be unable to clear this barrier, it runs the danger of sliding below the significant support zone of $3,000, leading to a drop toward $2,600. For investors as well as speculators, a drop of this degree would be costly. As bullish as I’m turning with the overall setup going into 2025, buyers still have work to do. For example, $ETH needs to recover $3,540 on the weekly time frame to look bullish next week. Buyers have 33 hours to get it done.#Ethereum pic.twitter.com/cAChCbJxjd — Justin Bennett (@JustinBennettFX) December 21, 2024 The analysis by Titan of Crypto who utilized the Ichimoku cloud approach to predict probable recovery further strengthens the optimism surrounding Ethereum. The analyst noted that Ethereum has retested some critical levels, which gives the impression that the present correction cycle is about nearing its end. The strength of Kumo Cloud’s support line indicates that Ethereum may well form a base for higher moves if it can manage to hold on to the existing levels. Meanwhile, Ethereum whales have increased their holdings and amassed about 340,000 ETH, which is worth more than $1 billion, in just a few days. This rise in accumulation shows that big investors are becoming more confident of the prospects of the altcoin. Ethereum Whales Bought $1 Billion ETH In The Past 96 Hours – Details https://t.co/fZe8jWmQ3S — Jose JM (@CryptoJoseJM) December 22, 2024 In addition, spot Ethereum ETFs have garnered inflows of over $2 billion since their introduction in the US market, which is indicative of the growing interest in these instruments. If regulatory authorities permit staking yields within these funds, analysts anticipate that this trend could surpass Bitcoin ETFs by 2025. At the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,330, down 0.7% and 15.7% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. Based on how the Ethereum market is doing right now, there will likely be a positive upward trend within the next week, despite Ether’s numbers flashing red in the charts. Analysts are hopeful about its chances of recovering, even though it is selling at a 21% discount to what they think it will be worth in a month. A potential breakout that could test critical resistance levels is being indicated by technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Averages. Ethereum is anticipated to experience a robust development trajectory in the medium to long term, with a 35% price increase within the next three months and a remarkable 100% growth within a year, according to projections.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Jim Cramer Highlights the ‘Under $11 Meal At Chili’s Owned By Brinker International, Inc. (EAT)’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed These 11 Restaurants and Retail Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE:EAT) stands against the other restaurant and retail stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently took a closer look at the state of the consumer, focusing on restaurants and retailers to understand the broader economic picture. According to Cramer, there is a common misconception about the economy, where people tend to think of the consumer as one homogenous group. He pointed out that there isn't a single consumer whose behavior can explain the overall economic trends. Instead, Cramer identified two distinct types of consumers in today's market. “One consumer's going out looking for absolute bargains. The other consumer's looking for what I call “premium value” or “value at a price”. More expensive, but relative to similar offerings, you get a great deal.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 7 Stocks and 6 Stocks Jim Cramer Talked About This Week This conclusion came after Cramer listened to a variety of retail and restaurant earnings calls. He expressed skepticism about relying on broad aggregate data, such as national retail sales, which he believes doesn’t capture the full picture. Instead, Cramer prefers analyzing individual companies, piecing together information from different sources to form a clearer sense of the consumer landscape. He believes this approach provides a more accurate snapshot than relying on overarching statistics. Cramer also noted that the rise of these two different consumer types has perplexed Wall Street. In the past, there was typically one consumer who either spent or didn’t, but that has changed. Now, there are two groups of consumers, each spending in different places. In his conclusion, Cramer urged investors to stop focusing on whether consumers are struggling financially or facing challenges. The key, he said, is understanding choice. “The bottom line: Stop trying to figure out if the consumer's cash strapped. Forget the headwinds. What matters is choice. Right now, consumers are lapping up absolute value at the lowest price or premium value, meaning better stuff that's a good deal versus the competition. But everything else? Maybe not so much. Hence why the aggregate numbers just don't tell the story.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on December 19. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A Chili's Grill & Bar restaurant filled with happy customers enjoying a meal. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41 Cramer highlighted Brinker International, Inc.’s (NYSE:EAT) Chilli’s low-priced meals and said: “At the same time, there's the other consumer who only seeks absolute bargains, the under $11 meal at Chili's owned by Brinker…” Brinker (NYSE:EAT) owns, operates, and franchises casual dining restaurants, with two main brands: Chili’s Grill & Bar and Maggiano’s Little Italy. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, it reported a 13.0% increase in comparable restaurant sales, driven by a 14.1% rise at Chili’s and a 4.2% increase at Maggiano’s. The growth at Chili’s was mainly attributed to menu price adjustments and a boost in customer traffic. Popular menu items, including the “Big Smasher” burger and Triple Dipper, have resonated well with guests, while the “3 for Me” combo meals have been particularly effective in attracting customers. Brinker (NYSE:EAT) management highlighted that the “3 for Me” deal, in particular, has been a key driver of traffic, appealing to a broad range of demographics by offering significant value. The data also showed that this offering has brought in more new guests, with those who purchase “3 for Me” returning to Chili’s more frequently than those who did not opt for the deal. Management emphasized that the appeal of high-quality, affordable meals, coupled with a great dining experience, is driving repeat visits across all income levels. Overall EAT ranks 7th on our list of the restaurant and retail stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of EAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: AI ignited a private market boom. Now wealthy investors want more

Wealthy investors are flocking to artificial intelligence startups — and fueling a private market renaissance. To get a piece of today’s pioneering AI firms, investors have to go through private markets, where most tech startups still reside. Waves of new technology have long meant new companies and eager investors hoping to be among the first to pour money into the next big thing. But the AI boom comes at a time where there are significantly more private companies, and they are tending to wait longer to go public. The draw of getting in on AI is serving as a gateway for well-heeled investors to pour more money into a wider array of private companies, wealth managers and others say. The rise of AI has sparked a constellation of startups promising to provide the data, infrastructure, chips, energy, and models to support the technology. Some of the biggest players in AI, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, are private companies. While anyone can buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies, private markets are more restricted, typically open only to accredited or institutional investors. Over the past two years, nascent interest in private market investment has grown into considerable activity, said Michael Gaviser, head of private markets at Morgan Stanley (MS+2.10%) Wealth Management. The total size of all companies on U.S. private markets grew to $11 trillion in 2023, up from $242 billion in 2010, according to the latest EY Global Alternative Fund Survey. That’s largely due to an ongoing generational wealth transfer, said Jun Li, who heads global and Americas wealth and asset management at EY. One estimate suggests that $84 trillion in assets could change hands over the next 20 years. Recent research by consultancy Bain & Co. projects that private market assets under management will jump to as much as $65 trillion by 2032 — growing at more than twice the rate of public assets. Michael Weisz, co-founder and CEO of the private markets investment platform Yieldstreet, said the recent uptick in activity is just the tip of the iceberg. “I think for the next five to seven years, the private markets are going to accelerate,” he said. Another key to the private markets boom is that investors, including institutional portfolio and asset managers, are hedging against public market concentration and volatility by investing in private funds, Li said. The growth in private investment is giving rise to even more valuable private companies: Some 87% of firms with revenues of $100 million or more are private, according to S&P Capital IQ (SPGI+1.30%). That means private markets represent a growing and increasingly lucrative opportunity. “If I’m an investor and I want to hitch a ride on economic growth... and I’m not doing private [companies], I’m missing out on a huge piece of the economy,” said Gaviser, of Morgan Stanley. With a significant portion of AI development happening at private companies, investors are being drawn to private markets — and then staying there, Gaviser said. “While AI has been the big story of this year, I think it’s a catalyst for private markets to continue to grow interest in the space,” he said. “We have people coming to us all the time saying, ‘Well, what else is there for me to do?’” One of the most important investing rules is to keep a diversified portfolio. Next year, Gaviser expects to see “a broadening out of private market activity generally, where the deal flow is not going to be as concentrated in a few sectors.” “We’re looking at deals all over the map,” he said. Outside of tech, areas such as consumer goods, real estate, hospitality, and healthcare are already seeing a pickup in activity, Gaviser said. Private credit will also continue to be a “hot asset class” in 2025, Yieldstreet’s Weisz said, in addition to private equity and real estate given that asset prices remain attractive. The number of public companies in the U.S. has shrunk from more than 7,000 at its peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s, to less than 4,000 today. In that same period, the number of private companies has ballooned to more than 25 million. That’s partly because companies are staying private for longer. As of 2022, the median age of a company before going public was 12 years, according to one study. That’s at least double what it was in 1980. (Gaviser puts the figure closer to 14 years now.) To keep up with the rapid pace of growth, major Wall Street firms and asset managers are expanding their offerings to snag a slice of the private market pie. Morgan Stanley launched its private markets transaction desk in March. It’s designed to help clients looking to buy and sell private company shares. BlackRock (BLK+1.46%) made three major private market acquisitions this year, including plans to buy private credit firm HPS Investment Partners for about $12 billion earlier this month. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the deal will grow the firm’s private market client assets to more than $410 billion, and is a recognition of the growing demand among investors for access to private equity. “Private markets are no longer a separate or a standalone exposure for our investors,” Fink said in a call with analysts earlier this month. “The blending of public and private in today’s reality is a part of the entire market of today.” In September, Citigroup announced a $25 billion private credit and direct lending program in partnership with Apollo (APO+1.88%), which will allow Citi’s (C+1.76%) large banking client base to tap into burgeoning private markets. In the “last couple of years you saw the private market advantaged,” Citi CEO Jane Fraser told Bloomberg last month. “The goal here from our perspective, give the client as much choice as possible.” Some on Wall Street are more skeptical about the shift toward private markets. JPMorgan Chase (JPM+1.64%) CEO Jamie Dimon has repeatedly questioned whether the rise in private companies is good for investors and markets. “Private markets have grown dramatically, and they don’t have the same transparency and liquidity and research,” Dimon said in September at the Council of Institutional Investors conference. “You may think that’s a good thing, and there are good attributes, so it’s not a criticism, but is that what you want?” As asset managers try to woo retail investors and newer entrants into private markets, startups could feel pressure to increase the frequency and accessibility of financial reporting, said EY’s Li. “Some of that is going to be really led by the retail investors getting access to private markets products,” he said. “I think that on its own is going to require a lot more transparency, just from a customer experience and reporting perspective.” Tender offers have also become a driver of private markets activity this year. Tender offers allow stockholders in a private company to sell some or all of their shares, either to another investor or back to the company itself. It’s a way for private firms to both raise cash and reward employees. Tender activity climbed 44% year-over-year in the third quarter, according to data released by software platform Carta earlier this month. Jamie Hutchinson, a partner in the private equity group at Goodwin, told Carta that the market for tender offers is busier than he’s ever seen. OpenAI has reportedly given employees the chance to sell roughly $1.5 billion worth of shares to Japan’s SoftBank Group (SFTBY-0.61%). Employees have until Christmas Eve to decide whether to participate, according to CNBC. That comes on the heels of a $6.6 billion funding round that valued the ChatGPT maker at $157 billion, making it the second-most valuable private company in the world, behind TikTok parent ByteDance. But as private companies get bigger — especially companies with massive demand for their products — going public ultimately provides more permanent access to capital, said Gaviser, of Morgan Stanley. “Once you get to be a certain size, the public markets do a better job than the private markets do,” he said. “If you look at some of these tenders out there, they’re a fraction of the value of the company.” History offers some guidance when it comes to the 2025 market. After the 2008 financial crisis, a rise in tender offers set the stage for an upswing in initial public offerings, Hutchinson said. He expects a similar dynamic next year. “I think there’s a direct correlation between tenders and IPOs,” he said. “If history repeats itself — which it tends to — this moment of time tells us that a year to a year and a half from now, we will be seeing an increase in IPOs.” Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said on a call with analysts in October that while private markets are booming, there is pent-up demand for IPOs that will likely begin to unravel next year. “There are a whole bunch of great companies that are owned privately that do want to make their way into the public markets,” Pick said. “I think we’re going to see the IPO market slowly work its way back, larger names coming to market.” At Yieldstreet, Weisz sees growing investor confidence in the direction of the market, the U.S. economy, and risk-taking in investing that could help fuel another year of healthy returns. “That’s going to drive a bullish economy,” he said, “both in terms of the public market and the private markets.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Wells Fargo Says It’s Quitting Climate-Banking Group

Wells Fargo & Co. said it’s leaving the world’s biggest climate alliance for banks, in the latest sign that Wall Street is breaking away from such groups. The company said in a statement Friday that it ended its membership in the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. The bank, based in San Francisco, didn’t provide an explanation for its decision. Wells Fargo’s departure follows Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which announced earlier this month that it was quitting NZBA. Financial companies have been under increasing pressure from Republican lawmakers, which have launched investigations and filed lawsuits related to the industry’s efforts to address climate change. The House Judiciary Committee, led by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, said last week that it’s found “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by financial companies. Separately, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. have been sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investments. In a report, Jordan’s committee specifically criticized financial environmental alliances, saying they have created what it calls “a climate cartel.” NZBA is part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which was launched ahead of a key climate summit in Scotland in 2021. Back then, the world’s biggest lenders, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., joined the coalition. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement that Wells Fargo’s withdrawal from NZBA was linked to his office’s review of the bank’s “status as a potential boycotter of energy companies.” “I urge other financial institutions to follow their example and end ESG (environmental, social and governance) policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries” Paxton said. Wells Fargo’s decision was based on the company’s internal analysis, said a person familiar with the matter who declined to be identified. A spokesman for NZBA said in a statement that Wells Fargo’s departure was “based on its own individual circumstances.” He added that five banks have left the group since it started in 2021, while more than 100 have joined. NZBA’s member banks have made “significant progress” in setting net zero targets, he said. Wells Fargo is one of the largest financiers for the fossil-fuel industry. It ranks as the second-leading arranger of bonds and loans for oil, gas and coal companies since the start of the decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan is first. Banks and money managers have been defecting from other climate groups in increasing numbers amid GOP-led pressure. This month, Franklin Templeton said it was leaving Climate Action 100+, which was created to press high-polluting companies to curb their emissions. The investment firm two years ago hired Anne Simpson, who was the first chair of CA100+, as its global head of sustainability. (The NZBA is part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which is co-chaired by Mark Carney, who is chair of Bloomberg Inc. and a former Bank of England governor, and Michael R.

Title: ‘I love kicking footballs’ – Andy Quinn follows his own star to pursue NFL goal
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/2024/12/14/i-love-kicking-footballs-andy-quinn-follows-his-own-star-to-pursue-nfl-goal/

For a phenomenon that is only a few years old, the story risks becoming repetitive. An Irish lad who grew up playing a kicking sport realises he’s a naturally better ball-striker than Americans lacking the same GAA, rugby or soccer background. He has a go at kicking a pigskin. The ball flies off the boot. American colleges or sometimes even NFL franchises have their heads turned. For all the growing familiarity with Ireland’s newfound relationship with the gridiron, Andy Quinn’s story still stands out. The Creggs native was an outhalf at Blackrock College. He played at youth level for Connacht. While his Junior Cup year was disrupted by Covid, Quinn still might have pulled on the 10 jersey during a Senior Cup run. He gave it up. Instead, he finished school in England – if school is the right word. Quinn sat his Leaving Cert while attending the NFL Academy in Loughborough. In his own words, it was “Blackrock College but for American football, but then on steroids” – of the metaphorical, not literal kind. The move paid off. Quinn earned a scholarship to kick and punt at Boston College. His flight leaves in January. Next year, Boston College’s schedule includes dates with Michigan State, Cal Berkley, Clemson, Georgia Tech, Notre Dame and Stanford. Recruited as both a kicker and punter, Quinn is more likely to see early game time in the latter role. He may or may not become the next Irishman in the NFL after Dan Whelan, Jude McAtamney and Charlie Smyth, but he will get a degree. In recent years, the National Collegiate Athletics Association started allowing unpaid student athletes to finally take some share of the billions they generate as part of America’s obsession with college sports. Players can now profit off their name, image and likeness (NIL). On top of that, some schools will soon start sharing their revenue with players. One figure involved in college sports suggests that kickers and punters can earn anywhere from $50,000-$300,000 a year. Like plenty of us, Quinn needed something to keep him sane during the pandemic lockdowns. In true Irish outhalf fashion, he became “obsessed” with training his place kicking. Listening to him talk technique, he isn’t lying. “It was like a round of golf for me,” he explains. “I’d kick the balls in, kick them over the bar and then kick them back out. I’d do that for five or six hours, three or four times a week. Through that, my rugby kicking became quite good but I never knew it would transfer into another sport. “Anyone I was following on Instagram was to do with kicking a rugby ball and also gym work. My phone was clogged up with videos of me kicking. After doing it for a while, it was pretty obvious to me that if I missed and it went left, I didn’t have a strong enough follow through. I always found that it was my foot contact and follow through that were the determining factors if the ball went over the bar or not.” Originally from Creggs on the Roscommon-Galway border (Quinn supports Galway, for what it’s worth), he went down the Caelan Doris route of moving from out west to board at Blackrock. Aged 15, Connacht started taking notice. He didn’t always line out at outhalf. Listed at 6ft 4ins, a growth spurt one summer left Quinn close to that height at an early enough stage. Blackrock took one look at him and stuck him in the second row as a lineout jumper. While there’s a bit of muscle on the frame now, he’s no Joe McCarthy. Had Quinn stuck at rugby and progressed through the system, Sam Prendergast wouldn’t have been the only outhalf being asked questions about his slight frame. “It helped a lot because I was skinny so they could throw me up in the lineout, literally fire me up,” says Quinn, laughing. “I was flying for a little bit. I was playing secondrow for Blackrock College, then for my club team Buccaneers I was playing outhalf. I was still kicking.” The summer before his fifth year at school, Quinn found Tadhg Leader, another former rugby player who is driving Ireland’s burgeoning American football involvement. Leader set up a competition, Ireland’s Kicking King. Quinn won it by landing field goals during the half-time break of a college game at the Aviva Stadium. Two days later, he was back at school on the Rock Road. The NFL Academy needed a kicker. They were impressed that Quinn, aged 16 at the time, could land 45-yard field goals in front of a big crowd at Lansdowne Road only shortly after taking up the sport. Or so the story goes. “That’s what the NFL Academy coaches told me, so I’m gonna go with that,” jokes Quinn. “I was there for one year, my whole year in sixth year. I had to study the Leaving Cert on my own. I didn’t go to any classes, I was in Loughborough and I did all my study in my dorm room and I got some help from the academic adviser. I had some grinds, but I was mainly looking at the books and teaching myself the Leaving Cert curriculum. “We had a few hiccups along the way. I couldn’t complete the PE project and the Ag Science project because I was an external candidate. At Easter time, I had to pick up business. I had six weeks to learn the whole course, I hadn’t done it for the Junior Cert. For some reason I decided to do higher level but I got a H4 so I’ll take that.” The non-sporting aspects of Quinn’s story also stand out. When he first answered the phone for this article, he apologised for sounding flustered. Quinn had just rushed back from a morning’s work. The NIL money isn’t on its way yet. He works with a child with an intellectual disability, accompanying him on the bus to school. “I sit in the back with him, make sure he puts on his seat belt. I keep him engaged, make sure he doesn’t open doors.” The job came up primarily because of a familiarity with disability. Quinn’s younger brother has 22q, a deletion of DNA on his 22nd chromosome. Aged 10, Andy learned sign language so the pair could communicate. Since gaining some notoriety for his kicking, Quinn has pushed to raise more awareness of the condition. Another brother – there are four young Quinn lads – was previously diagnosed with benign leukaemia. He underwent chemotherapy treatment during the pandemic. Everyone who leaves on the boat grapples with varying degrees of sadness, guilt and early onset homesickness, but for a family which has gone through some hardship, it must be particularly difficult for the eldest child to go. “My grand uncle, he emigrated to America when his youngest brother was 10,” says Quinn. “I was talking to them recently and they said they never really got to know each other that much. It’s on my mind to keep in contact with my brothers, because they are so young. “I spent seven weeks over in America this summer and when I came back, I didn’t tell my younger brothers I was coming. For the first time ever they were happy to see me.” One last question remains. Quinn was on the Junior Cup panel in 2021. He may well have featured in the Senior Cup, a more familiar path to professional sport than an academy in Loughborough. You don’t need to read Ross O’Carroll-Kelly to know that, for schools like this, rugby is everything. Especially if you play 10. “Why did I leave rugby? The opportunity,” says Quinn. “Making any sort of money in American football or rugby is a bit of a long shot anyway, so I thought I’d rather get to see more parts of the world and do something which I really enjoy, which is kicking. “I love kicking footballs. When I played rugby, it was to get the conversion after the try or to get a 50/22. That’s why I played.” Back home in Creggs, there is a stream outside Quinn’s house which represents the border between two counties. “You can’t really say whether I’m from Roscommon or Galway because you’ll offend some people,” he says, again laughing. Winning a Senior Cup or lining out for Connacht may well have sparked an intercounty battle to claim Quinn as their own. Once he’s launching footballs into the Massachusetts sky, and potentially beyond, those debates will linger for a while yet. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Mainfreight was up 80c to $72.30. Photo / File The New Zealand sharemarket was in a cheerful mood in the run-up to Christmas, with Contact Energy having a strong bounce. The S&P/NZX 50 Index fell at the opening but with the Australian counterpart steaming ahead, the index rose strongly and closed at 12,988.03, up 83.92 points or 0.65%. The index has now had a gain of more than 10% this year with four trading days remaining. Volumes were lighter as investors are thinking more about the summer holidays with 27.68 million shares worth $112.98 million changing hands. But there was heavy trading in Ryman Healthcare, down 10c or 2.27% to $4.30, on trade worth $19.38m with two blocks of shares being crossed. A slowdown in price increases prompted a rebound on Wall Street over the weekend. The Personal Consumption Expenditures index – key inflation data for the Federal Reserve - was up 0.1% in November compared with an increase of 0.3% in October, and below the market expectation of 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.18% to 42,840.26 points; the S&P 500 was up 1.09% to 5930.85; and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.03% to 19,572.6. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, believes the Magnificent Seven technology stocks will continue to dominate the United States market next year. The artificial intelligence mega forces driving investment will push up Nvidia, Alphabet (Google), Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla, which combined make up a third of the S&P 500 market capitalisation. Following the election of US President Donald Trump, there should be less regulation and lower taxes, resulting in higher corporate earnings in a higher growth environment, said BlackRock. But it was cautious about any surge in long-term bond yields and an escalation in trade protectionism. Across the Tasman, the S&P/ASX 200 Index had risen 1.55% to 8192.4 points at 6pm NZ time, no doubt exhilarated by the A$3.4 billion (NZ$3.76b) purchase of Foxtel by the London-based sports streaming platform DAZN. Previous owners News Corp and Telstra will take stakes of 6% and 3% respectively in DAZN, with shareholder loans to Foxtel of A$578m being repaid. Paul Robertshawe, chief investment officer with Octagon Asset Management, said the purchase implied that Sky TV “is pretty cheap and it may prompt talk about someone wanting to buy Sky”. Sky TV, up 8c or 3% to $2.75, has a content-sharing agreement with Foxtel. Robertshaw said the local market had a big finish on Friday and volumes and information flow are now lighter as it heads to the end of the year. Contact, likely to join the MSCI World Index at the expense of Mercury, increased 33c or 3.76% to $9.11. Auckland International Airport gained 17c or 2.05% to $8.47; Spark increased 5.5c or 1.94% to $2.885; Hallenstein Glasson added 10c to a new high of $8.40; and Skellerup was 13c or 2.63% to $5.08. Property stocks Stride rose 5c or 3.97% to $1.31; Argosy was up 2.5c or 2.53% to $1.015; Precinct gained 3c or 2.46% to $1.25; and Goodman Trust added 4c or 2% to $2.04. Mainfreight was up 80c to $72.30; Ebos Group collected 50c to $37.10; Summerset gained 17c to $12.99; Freightways picked up 28c or 2.69% to $10.68; and Scales Corp rose 17c or 4.45% to $3.99. Leading banks had a strong bounce, with ANZ rising $1.59 or 5.3% to $31.60 and Westpac up $1.03 or 2.96% to $35.80. T&G Global rose 5c or 3.33% to $1.55; Allied Farmers increased 4c or 5.33% to 79c; Eroad improved 3c or 3% to $1.03; Green Cross Health was up 3c or 3.75% to 83c; South Port NZ added 10c or 1.9% to $5.36; and Marlin Global gained 3c or 3.3% to 94c. Fisher and Paykel Healthcare was down 18c to $37.77; Chorus declined 18c or 1.99% to $8.85; Gentrack decreased 20c to $12.60; Port of Tauranga shed 19c or 2.86% to $6.45; and Vector was down 9c or 2.28% to $3.86. Delegat Group fell 25c or 4.9% to $4.85; Foley Wines decreased 3c or 5% to 57c; Santana Minerals declined 3c or 5.66% to 50c; and General Capital shed 1.5c or 6% to 23.5c.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Heavy Equipment and Industrial Machinery Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Manitowoc Company, Inc. (NYSE:MTW) stands against the other heavy equipment and industrial machinery stocks. The industrial heavy equipment market includes machinery and tools used in construction, mining, agriculture, and industrial applications. According to 360iResearch, this sector is critically important for infrastructure development, mining operations, and large-scale agricultural productivity. Growing infrastructural developments, rapid urbanization, and the growth of mining activities are fueling the necessity for heavy equipment. In agriculture, improved machinery efficiency remains critical for meeting global food demands. As per 360iResearch, market growth continues to be influenced by technological advancements like automation, loT integration, and sustainability trends focusing on fuel-efficient and electrically powered machinery. Research Nester believes that the autonomous heavy equipment market was worth more than US$11.43 million in 2024 and should surpass US$26.56 million by 2037. The primary growth driver for the rapid expansion is the strong growth projected in the construction industry. The growth in the building and construction industry is aligned with the demand for heavy equipment. Market experts opine that growth in the construction industry is expected to stem from lower interest rates in 2025. The types of heavy equipment that are used in the construction industry include earthmoving equipment, and material construction industry, among others.

Technological advancements are taking place at a rapid pace, with manufacturers adopting cutting-edge tools and processes to beat the competition. Increased automation and robotics, Al integration, green manufacturing, and 3D printing for customization are the key trends likely to drive growth for the industrial machinery industry in 2025. Automation in industrial machinery tends to reduce the chances of human error and supports streamlining production. Robots, together with machine learning, are being employed to inspect, assemble, and even pack goods. Stumble Forward went on to add that Al-powered systems can predict equipment failures, reducing unexpected costly repairs. This predictive maintenance technology should continue to help industries save thousands of dollars in repair costs. In 2025, industrial machinery is expected to be designed in a way that will promote sustainability. Energy-efficient machines, including those running on renewable energy, or producing less waste, will be adopted. Finally, the adoption of 3D printing in industrial machinery, which can help produce parts that are lightweight yet incredibly strong, is expected to grow as manufacturers continue to realize its importance. Stumble Forward also added that the ability to print intricate designs should result in innovation, enabling engineers to test prototypes and adjust accordingly.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Auto and Truck Dealership Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) stands against the other best auto and truck dealership stocks to invest in. On December 20, Cox Automotive reported that November retail sales figures of used vehicles rose by nearly 2% from October, reaching approximately 1.4 million vehicles. The figure indicated a robust demand as it marks a 13% increase compared to November 2023. Scott Vanner, a senior analyst at Cox Automotive, noted that sales are performing stronger than typical seasonal patterns, which usually see a slowdown due to adverse weather and reduced selling days during the holiday season. The current year has defied these trends with double-digit growth year-over-year. In addition, certified pre-owned vehicle sales also saw a month-over-month increase of 2.7%, rising from 203,272 units in October to an estimated 208,708 units in November 2024. However, on a year-over-year basis, CPO sales were down 3.5%, attributed to fewer available off-lease and trade-in vehicles. READ ALSO: 10 Best Entertainment Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and 11 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now. Looking ahead to the current month, another report by Cox Automotive expects sales volume for December to be around 1.47 million vehicles, representing a 7.7% increase from the previous month but flat year-over-year. Moreover, December's seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for new-vehicle sales is projected to be 16.5 million, marking an increase from 15.9 million in December 2023 and matching November's figure. Charlie Chesbrough, Cox Automotive’s senior economist in a December 17 report noted that the end of the U.S. election season has contributed to a boost in sales. Buyers are motivated by concerns about upcoming potential policy changes and EV discounts that may not last, leading to a favorable buying environment as 2024 closes. In terms of quarterly and yearly analysis, the fourth quarter is anticipated to finish with a SAAR of 16.4 million, representing a shift to a higher sales pace since October. The report attributes these movements to better inventory levels and increased consumer confidence topped with lower interest rates. On the other hand, full-year new vehicle sales for 2024 are expected to reach approximately 15.85 million units, reflecting a 2.3% increase from the last year. Lastly, the report forecasts that new vehicle sales will continue to grow in 2025, potentially reaching 16.3 million units, driven by ongoing improvements in consumer confidence and favorable market conditions.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32 AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) is a major automotive retailer in the United States, primarily involved in selling both new and used vehicles. The company operates through three main segments including Domestic, Imports, and Premium Luxury, selling vehicles ranging from American automakers like General Motors to luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW. In addition to selling vehicles, the company also offers automotive repair and maintenance services and arranges financing for vehicle purchases. AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) faced challenges due to a cyberattack on CDK Global, which is a major software provider for the automotive industry. As a result, its revenue of $6.6 billion decreased 4% year-over-year. The gross profit also took a hit and dropped 9% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, however, the gross profit showed a sequential improvement of +2% led by Customer Financial Services (CFS) and After-Sales growth. Despite the headwinds, management was still able to increase its market share in new vehicle sales, achieving a 2% growth in same-store units across all segments. It also strategically divested eight underperforming stores during the quarter, generating over $150 million in proceeds. This decision was part of a strategy to optimize their portfolio and take advantage of favorable market valuations before they declined. Looking ahead, AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) anticipates improved performance in the fourth quarter, particularly in new vehicle sales. The company is also optimistic about moderating interest rates and plans to leverage capital for acquisitions that promise higher returns for shareholders. Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) (down 3.7%) operates around 350 dealer franchises across the US, as well as collision centres and used vehicle stores. When compared to Group 1, it sells more units at a slightly higher price and margin, and derives around 50% more revenue. But its strategy is different, with nationwide branding and centralised operations. Although we prefer the Group 1 model, the economics of Autonation look attractive to us. And by introducing this into the portfolio we could thereby invest more than 5% of assets in this sector without necessitating the sale of other attractive large positions. And so after selling a little Group 1 and buying Autonation we ended the quarter with 4.1% and 1.9% positions respectively.” Overall, AN ranks 5th on our list of best auto and truck dealership stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of AN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why PG&E Corporation (PCG) Is Among the Best Electrical Infrastructure Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Electrical Infrastructure Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stands against the other best electrical infrastructure stocks to buy according to analysts. The United States is witnessing a notable surge in electricity demand, driven by unprecedented electrification, the rapid expansion of AI-driven data centers, and a resurgence in industrial reshoring and manufacturing. As of September 2024, electricity demand rebounded with a 1.8% increase, reversing a 1.7% decline during the same period in 2023, aided by favorable weather conditions. This uptick signals a sustained period of growth, marking a departure from two decades of stagnant demand and potentially reshaping the electricity landscape in profound ways. According to Deloitte, this demand has spurred a corresponding increase in power generation. By September 2024, utility-scale power generation reached approximately 3,287 billion kWh, reflecting a 3% year-over-year growth. Renewable energy, particularly solar, led the charge, with a 30% increase compared to 13% during the same period in 2023. In that same vein, solar energy is expected to be the fastest-growing energy source by year-end, potentially achieving a 34% growth rate. Moreover, the rapid adoption of digitalization and AI has significantly heightened the demand for data centers across the United States. To keep pace with this adoption, McKinsey projects that data center power requirements might triple by 2030, increasing from 3–4% of the nation’s total electricity demand to approximately 11–12%. This will necessitate a substantial rise in electricity production, signaling a dramatic shift in a country where power demand has remained relatively flat since 2007. By 2030, data centers could account for 30–40% of all net new electricity demand, alongside rising needs from domestic manufacturing, electric vehicles, and electrolyzers. Furthermore, in response to escalating climate-driven disasters and an electricity grid increasingly reliant on intermittent renewable energy, the U.S. is rapidly deploying large-scale battery systems to help prevent power outages. From minimal installations just a few years ago, the country has now added over 20 gigawatts of battery capacity to its electric grid, with 5 GW installed in the first seven months of this year alone, according to the EIA. This rapid expansion is equivalent to adding the output capacity of 20 nuclear reactors to the grid in just four years. The EIA forecasts that this capacity could double to 40 GW by 2025 if planned expansions proceed as expected. On the other hand, transformations in policy, market dynamics, and technological advancements are also driving significant shifts in electricity generation, presenting new challenges for the US electric grid. Much of the country's high-voltage transmission infrastructure dates back to the 1960s and 1970s, leaving it ill-equipped to handle current and future grid demands. Policy changes could further shape the landscape. For instance, Bernstein analysts have highlighted potential risks to electrical infrastructure stocks if the incoming Trump administration repeals the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Such a move, reportedly under consideration as part of broader tax reform, would eliminate a key driver of electrical distribution infrastructure investment. EV charging typically occurs at home, and a growing EV installed base has been a significant catalyst for grid investments. Bernstein estimates that repealing the tax credit would lower electricity demand growth from EVs, reducing the compound annual growth rate from 0.6% to 0.4% over the next five years. To illustrate the potential impact, they pointed to Germany’s rollback of EV subsidies in 2023, which led to a 30% drop in EV-related demand year-to-date in 2024. All things considered, leading electrical infrastructure stocks are poised for substantial gains, supported by the approval of over 46,000 infrastructure projects spanning a wide range of industries, and a monumental $1.2 trillion investment allocated by the U.S. administration.

To compile our list of the best electrical infrastructure stocks to buy according to analysts, we analyzed various stock screeners and ETFs, selecting stocks based on their upside potential as of December 16. The stocks are ranked by their average upside potential, from lowest to highest, based on price targets. Additionally, we included the number of hedge funds holding stakes in these stocks, using Insider Monkey’s Q3 hedge fund data. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Average Analyst Upside: 17.86% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), through its subsidiary Pacific Gas and Electric Company, distributes electricity and natural gas to customers across California. Leveraging a mix of energy sources—nuclear, hydroelectric, fossil fuel-fired, fuel cell, and photovoltaic technologies—PG&E ensures reliable power generation for its customers. On December 12, RBC Capital reiterated its Outperform rating on PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) and maintained a $24 price target, citing the utility’s strong wildfire mitigation and capital investment strategies. PG&E’s wildfire prevention efforts have been particularly effective, with no structures destroyed in its High Fire-Threat Districts (HFTDs) this year, despite a rise in wildfires statewide. The company has also benefited from financial safeguards under AB 1054, with PG&E receiving its first two payments under the program. PG&E’s capital expenditure (capex) plan remains ambitious, with the company accelerating $1 billion into its five-year plan during Q3. Financing for these investments was secured through junior subordinated notes, underscoring the company’s sound financial strategy. Additionally, PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) has filed a supplemental request for $3.1 billion in projects for 2025-2026, which is expected to add $2.8 billion to its overall project pipeline. The company’s focus on customer-driven investments aligns with California's legislative initiatives, such as SB 410 and SB 884, and is further supported by a 3.5 GW data center pipeline. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 database, 49 hedge funds held positions in PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), up from 46 funds in the previous quarter. Overall, PCG ranks 4th on our list of best electrical infrastructure stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of PCG, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From the Heart of Liberty Blog. Don Harrision Sign Up To Receive Regular Heart of Liberty Bulletins Here The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat . . . and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. Isaiah 11:6 The book of Isaiah, written between the 8th and 6th centuries BC, prophesies a utopia where all natural enmities disappear and predators and prey become as one and take the same sustenance. It is understandable that the Israelites of the time, oppressed by Assyrians and Babylonians, would long for a peaceable kingdom. Today, however, it is less understandable – in fact downright baffling — that investment managers who pride themselves on their rationality seem to believe that we live in a world in which physics and economics have gone with the wind, and the lions in their portfolios can prosper on a diet of straw. The conceit I am referring to concerns the voracious lions of artificial intelligence (AI) and the utopian dream of decarbonization. The AI revolution needs the red meat of reliable power – in science-fiction-like quantities – while the decarb dreamers’ windmills and solar panels can deliver only unsatisfying amounts of marginally nutritious straw. Many investment managers own shares of AI leaders[1] such as Nvidia while simultaneously professing a commitment to net zero CO2. This is portfolio management animated more by blind faith than by proven, analytical process. Investors would be wise to question whether they wish to invest with organizations which seem almost willfully ignorant of the performance-sapping implications of this conflicted approach. AI Power Needs — AI’s bottomless appetite for power is no secret. Google “AI need for power” and you will find that banks, corporations, NGO’s, think tanks and major publications are all on the case: These examples are just the tip of the AI power-requirement iceberg. Investment Companies Are Aware of AI’s Power Appetite — Investment management organizations that own AI leaders[8] are certainly cognizant of this coming tidal wave of energy demand: Unlike those whom Jesus’ castigated in the Gospel of Matthew[13]forhaving eyes but refusing to see, these firms understand AI’s growing hunger for electricity. Renewable Inconstancy — It is also no secret that the net-zero utopians’ favorite power sources – wind and solar – are unreliable. In fact, an understanding of the capricious nature of the wind and the effect of clouds on sunshine is so ingrained in our experience that generative AI, whose “intelligence” is fueled by millennia of human poetry and prose, can churn out an endless stream of cliches on the subject such as “love as fleeting as the fickle summer wind” and “troubles like a veil of clouds.” Academics, not satisfied with machine-made similes derived from common knowledge, have felt the need to conduct studies to prove that wind and solar “are inherently highly variable due to volatile weather conditions.”[14] And if age-old wisdom and academic elucidation of the obvious leave any doubt about renewable instability, the UK and Germany have been kind enough to erase it by inadvertently conducting nationwide demonstration projects. These two former economic powerhouses currently receive over 40% of their electricity from renewables.[15] In early November of this year, both countries experienced what the Germans call Dunkelflaute (dark doldrums), which arises when high-pressure systems diminish wind and thicken clouds.[16] In the UK, this meant its wind farms were able to meet just 3-4% of the countries’ electricity demand, and in Germany theirs operated at only 7% of capacity.[17] Of course, grid operators had to call on natural gas and coal to step into the breach.[18] Charles Rotter at Watts Up With That? has pointed out that a proposed solution from the UK’s National Energy System Operator to this regular winter issue is “system flexibility”[19] — bureaucratize for public rationing and adjustment of energy usage based on availability. Cooking your dinner early or reading that bedtime novel at 2 pm in anticipation of a calm evening may seem trivial sacrifices to make for the greater good of saving Gaia, but imagine a world in which Dunkelflaute starves a power-hungry AI tasked with the 24/7 running of cybersecurity, healthcare and energy transmission: millions of credit cards compromised by foreign actors, AI-enabled robotic surgeons unable to perform life-saving operations, and the ironic last straw — the meager amount of power being generated by these renewables dies on the vine because the grid is managed by AI. We can’t trust AI with vital, economy-wide duties if it has to rely on gentle breezes and occluded sunshine. Investment Companies Are Aware of Renewable Shortcomings— The research teams at AI-invested portfolio managers are just as aware of renewables’ innate limitations as they are of AI’s appetite for electricity: Inconsistency, variability, intermittency. These investment companies’ analyses of the dependability of wind and solar read like indictments drawn up by Roget’s Thesaurus. Batteries on White Horses — Of course, no investment organizations believe that we can achieve a net zero future that still enables AI with wind and solar alone; as Blackrock has pointed out, these are only a half solution.[24] Continuous dispatchability requires grid-level battery storage. Clearbridge thinks batteries will be an integral part of a renewable infrastructure industry that will achieve compound annual growth rates of 10-30% for the next 30 years.[25] JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Macquarie and Blackrock have all put their money where their mouths are, investing billions in battery storage companies such as Strata Clean Energy, Gridstor, Eku Energy and Waratah.[26] These investment firms are heeding the call of the International Energy Agency (IEA),[27] one of the high priests of net zero. For the IAE, grid-level battery storage will ride to renewables’ rescue like a green savior on Revelations’ white horse,[28] and alchemize the benign but capricious production of turbines and solar panels into ever-dispatchable abundance. Straw Batteries — But how likely is it that battery storage will be renewable’s salvation, and provide the inexpensive, always-on power needed to sustain the AI industry? Mark Mills is a distinguished senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a contributing editor at City Journal, a faculty fellow at Northwestern University’s McCormick school of engineering, director of the National Center for Energy Analytics, a former senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and the author of numerous books and articles on energy and digital technology.[29] I have corresponded with Mark and followed his work for almost 25 years and have found him to be insightful, perspicacious and refreshingly thorough on every subject he turns his mind to. In a rare moment of agreement between Bill Gates and myself, Gates has said that Mark’s book The Bottomless Well “is the only book I’ve ever seen that really explains energy.”[30] In testimony before the U.S. House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, Mark had this to say about grid-level battery storage:[31] Given the almost unfathomable cost and scale of material production required for sufficient grid-level batteries, in all likelihood they are not the magic that will transform wind and solar into the robust energy source AI demands. The Last Straw — This past April, a Wall St. Journal piece explored a seemingly redemptive paradox embedded in the nature of AI: at first glance it looks to explode power usage, but at the same time it holds out the promise that it can increase energy efficiency and thereby reduce consumption.[32] The article focuses on savings in real estate, but the alleged potential is economy-wide. Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser believes efficiency gains over the past 15 years – before the advent of AI – have reduced energy demand by the equivalent of 90 million barrels of oil a day.[33] If smart thermostats, electronic sensors in fuel injectors and other relatively crude enhancements have produced this remarkable accomplishment, imagine what the coming AI revolution can achieve through predictive consumption forecasting, renewable energy integration, intelligent grid management and other currently undreamed of wonders! But does Mr. Nasser’s observation about reduced energy demand mean that the world has reduced its energy consumption over the past 15 years? Not according to Our World in Data, which shows overall energy consumption growing by 20% during this period:[34] These last 15 years continue a consistent post-war phenomena: no matter how much we increase vehicle mpg and no matter how many Thermopane windows we install, humanity unfailingly and mysteriously gobbles ever more energy. Only recessions induce power dieting (gold arrows). So is the Saudi Aramco CEO a liar or an ignoramus, or perhaps nefariously spinning the facts to benefit the oil industry? The answer is probably not – on all 3 counts. Most likely, he is referring to efficiency gains in isolation, and neglecting the further consequences of those efficiencies. More energy saving devices and processes would reduce energy consumption if all things remained equal, but we live in a dynamic world where changing inputs leads to unexpected outputs. Imagine in a previous life that you were a blacksmith who specializes in iron plow shares. You’re a brilliant fellow, and you devise a method that burns less wood to generate the heat needed to forge and shape the iron. You subsequently reduce your prices, which means poorer peasants can now afford your plowshares. This leads to more land under cultivation, which creates a burgeoning population, which ignites an ever-greater consumption of the wood needed to meet this expanding market that you and thousands of other imitative smiths are now servicing. And which – depending on your perspective – makes God’s green earth a little more paradisiacal for you and your fellow man, or eventually transforms it into a Boschian hellhole pocked by the pustules of oil derricks, coal mines and fracking and uranium waste. But no matter which way you look at it, your fuel-efficient advancement in metal-working most surely does not reduce energy consumption. All of which leads us to the real paradox regarding AI and power: Jevon’s Paradox. William Stanley Jevons was a British economist who first described this phenomenon in a paper in 1865. It is now so widely known and so well documented that Google’s generative AI app has a synopsis, but I prefer the human insight of Mark Mills: AI will create fuel-usage efficiencies, but it will in turn undoubtedly lead to increased consumption. The Saudi Aramco exec was probably not trying to hoodwink us. As radio host Paul Harvey would have put it, he just didn’t consider “the rest of the story.” Perversely, one man’s energy diet plan begets mankind’s need for an energy feast. Let Them Eat Straw — In spite of their awareness of both AI power requirements and of the fickle nature of wind and solar, in spite of the well-publicized issues with grid-level battery storage, and in spite of the widespread knowledge of Jevon’s Paradox and its implications for the notion that AI-effectuated efficiencies will reduce energy consumption, many investment management organizations continue to demonstrate a deep commitment to a net-zero future and to its proponent organizations: In the investment management community, Clearbridge’s membership in a climate-change organization that promotes decarbonization through wind and solar is not an anomaly. PRI, Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, Ceres Investor Network and Climate Action 100+ are 5 of the most prominent of these initiatives. Of the 10 largest fund companies, 9 are signatories to at least one of them, and collectively they hold 31 memberships.[42] Blackrock is a member of four of these outfits, and Blackrock International belongs to the fifth.[43] Blackrock’s Chairman Larry Fink, in a Wall St. Journal op-ed,[44] has called for a capital spending boom to build an “AI transcontinental railroad” that will juice U.S. real economic growth to 3% and increase tax revenues, thereby helping to mitigate the national debt crisis. But nowhere in this article does Mr. Fink mention that his company funds outfits who long to starve the railroad’s engines of fuel. Investment managers’ devotion to decarbonization also manifests itself in their proxy voting records. Each year, Pension Politics analyzes the proxy voting record of investment management companies, based on their votes on the “Fiduciary Free 50.”[45] These are 50 of the most extreme ESG-oriented proposals, 27 of which in 2023 were climate related. These proposals not only require companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degree target, but to report on how their lobbying, insuring and investing activities, and their involvement in trade associations and other alliances, promote decarbonization.[46] At first glance, these proposals appear to be the grassroots efforts of a diverse group of shareholders who are agnostic on the means of achieving net zero (“the strategy on how to achieve this target is entirely up to the Board”).[47] But in fact they are the handiwork of a small number of progressive non-profits such as Green America, As You Sow and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, all of whom are crusaders for wind and solar.[48] Green America does not try to hide its absolutist advocacy of these so-called renewables: “it is critical to the future of the planet that society moves away from all carbon-producing sources of energy and invests heavily in renewables such as wind, solar, geothermal, and second-generation biofuels.”[49] The other organizations appear to be making a conscious effort to obscure their belief in the role that wind and solar will need to play in the descent to net zero. They use fuzzy, feel-good language, but there can be little doubt that they believe a “just transition to a green economy,” the “phase in of low-carbon energy resources,”[50] and an “equitable energy future” will require an abundance of wind and solar, as evidenced by the many pictures of solar panels and windmills that adorn their web sites.[51] Of the 820 investment outfits Pension Politics graded this year, 520 received a D or F for their proxy votes on the “Fiduciary Free 50.”[52] A major contributing factor to these firms’ poor grades was their collusion with these obscure, radical climate-change zealots to force corporate America to decarbonize. Supposedly the last French queen, Marie Antoinette, when told that her starving peasants had no bread, advised them to eat cake. Though there is no historical evidence that she said this, today there is ample evidence that many investment management organizations, through their support of decarbonization and its handmaidens, are effectively telling the AI lions in their portfolios to eat straw. A Schizophrenic Vision — All investing involves a vision of the future. That vision may originate from a top-down analysis of the economy in which a portfolio manager buys REITs because money supply growth has recently abated, creating the conditions for a snowballing beneficence: inflation will drop, the Fed will lower rates, REIT interest costs will decline, their earnings will increase and their stock prices will climb. Or it may start with a more humble, bottom-up approach: a second manager buys XYZ company because its new CEO will soon jettison the money-losing companies purchased by his profligate predecessor, and return XYZ to its profitable roots. In either case, each of them has envisioned a future friendly to particular stocks or industries, and positioned their portfolios accordingly. But imagine if the first manager buys REITs because of the scenario outlined above, and then pens an opinion piece in the Wall St. Journal urging the Federal Reserve not to lower rates because that will increase inflation. Or if number two buys XYZ and tries to talk the new CEO into maintaining his predecessor’s legacy. A Freudian would call this schizophrenia, while a Christian might invoke the Gospel of Mark to warn that portfolio management divided against itself cannot stand, but they would both probably agree that this is a bizarre, contrary, unworkable approach to making money. The promotion of renewables by AI-owning investment firms is similarly confused. Either AI thrives in a world powered by the proven, reliable bounty of fossil fuels and nuclear fission, or it starves on wind, solar and wishful thinking. In addition — though the full exploration of this is a topic for another day — a decarbonized economy will suffer from low productivity and anemic growth because of renewables’ inefficiency and lack of energy density. This means that nationwide economic growth — the wind at the backs of all companies – will experience its own Dunkelflaute, enfeebling the returns of every investor and every investment organization, not just those that own AI stocks. AI giants such as Microsoft and Google still publicly cling to the hope that they will be carbon-neutral by 2030, in spite of the recent AI-driven upwelling in their consumption of traditional energy. Analysts who see things in the harsh light of day, however, call this dream “ridiculous.”[53] It is high time that the investment management organizations that own these AI operating companies come to this same clear-eyed understanding, and clarify the conflicted vision that shapes their portfolios. They need to either divest themselves of AI or cease to worship at the altar of net-zero. And it is also high time that investors let them know that they will no longer entrust their capital to those who refuse to see that AI lions cannot live on peekaboo sunshine and the whimsy of the wind.

Type your email… Subscribe Unlike Mr Harrison, policymakers, investors and data center owners (including anyone with any education) are aware of the importance of eliminating CO2 emissions and transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewables and nuclear energy Oh, I see- only stupid people prefer fossil fuels and voted for Trump. I see that attitude all the time, especially here in elitist Wokeachusetts. No nukes here, though- they’ve all been shut down. I said anyone with an education knows about climate change and its solutions. If you know about nuclear, then you know about one important solution. You meant , “any person with an indoctrination”… blah, blah Come on, In what way have humans change global climate change that you can provide solid empirical evidence for? You also need to provide empirical scientific evidence that CO2 has any measurable warming effect. But you will fail again, as you always do. That means you are yapping an ideology you have no evidence for. Religions and cults work that way. There is NO CLIMATE PROBLEM, certainly not from fossil fuels. So no “solution” is required. Nuclear is possible future major energy supply.. Wind and solar are nothing but a parasitic fad. There is absolutely zero need to eliminate CO2 emissions. That is a fallacy which has been brain-washed into gullible twits. CO2 is ALL benefit, no downside. It feeds plant life hence feeds all creatures on the planet. Still waiting for someone to produce some empirical scientific evidence that CO2 causes any measurable warming. Fossil fuels have raised modern civilisations and will continue to be a very major source of energy for a long time to come, they cannot be dispensed with if civilisations want to continue to exist. Wind and solar are just a fake parasitic measure to combat a fake anti-CO2 agenda, and are actually one of the most polluting forms of energy over their short life-cycle. “Still waiting for someone to produce some empirical scientific evidence that CO2 causes any measurable warming.” _______________________________________________________________________ Oh they might do that, but then they have to say why ﻿warming is a problem which it isn’t. See #2 on the list: 1. More rain is not a problem. 2. Warmer weather is not a problem. 3. More arable land is not a problem. 4. Longer growing seasons is not a problem. 5. CO2 greening of the earth is not a problem. 6. There isn’t any Climate Crisis. I have searched. I have asked many people to help find that evidence.. … but still, nada, zip.. nothing !! Since you can’t read, think, or speak rationally, I like your posts because there is nothing of substance I have to bother with! As expected… still, nada, zip.. nothing !! … In what way have humans changed the global climate that you can provide solid empirical evidence for? Produce EVIDENCE !!…… or not 😉 That’s rather rich coming from a moron like you! Please specify which of the geologic epochs have lower temperatures and CO2 levels than the Holocene, and just how you propose to prevent the death of ALL LIFE ON EARTH from CO2 starvation during a glacial expansion sometime in the next 1,000,000 years! Your ability to regurgitate corporate propaganda is only exceeded by your ignorance! And you are contradicted by all scientific research worldwide when you claim ‘climate change isn’t a problem’. Read any of the scientific reports from the NAS, the Royal Society, or NASA here: https://climate.nasa.gov The Royal Society? Nullius in verba. Especially them. Sorry, anyone that posts fraudulent graphs as you just have and rejects mainstream science from the National Science Academies, has no credibility with me. Footnote: ‘Present’ on your graph is 1950 by scientific convention, so your graph omits modern era warming from 1950 onward — which is most of it. If you knew that, you are a fraud. Why should anyone care if you think someone else is credible? Self induce Dunning-Kruger effect. You are a nobody, a scientific non-entity. Oooh get you. What’s your title? The central scrutiniser? The supreme arbiter? anyone that posts the nonsense you post is up for the ridicule you so richly deserve. I caught you for knowingly posting a fraudulent graph. Why would we think you have any credibility? The oceans have ~1,000 X the heat content of the atmosphere, and contain ~60 X the CO2; yet you still believe that a small increase in atmospheric CO2 away from the death threshold for all plant life is of major concern!? Hunh!? You really should avoid the word ‘fraudulent;’ it’s very likely to stick! it’s a 50% increase in atm co2 since 1750. Atm co2 is now the highest in 15 million years And that CO2 has saved the planet from plant starvation. It is a totally and absolutely beneficial increase in CO2 from desperately low level. There is absolutely zero down-side from increasing CO2 to even double or triple what it is today. If you think there is then prove it. First step…. 1… provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Or stumble and faceplant on your own BS. I have reviewed science journals from the 19th century. Over a dozen scientists measured atmospheric CO2 as part of medical studies. Funny how the atmospheric CO2 in 1820 is comparable to today. Funny too is how the CO2 concentration in the 1850 to 1880 timeframe was the lowest in the 19th century. Graph is a well know established graph, from well established sources. It is not fraudulent is any way whatsoever. ! YOU ARE AN IGNORANT LIAR. You have 100% negative credibility. ! I caught you for knowingly posting a fraudulent graph. You sound like the all-knowing Karnack of Johnny Carson fame. Sorry to tell you, that was a parody of what you are doing. Show another graph that isn’t fraudulent according to you. There should be plenty of them as you say “mainstream science from the National Science Academies” tells all. I didn’t post any fraudulent graphs. Cite the time stamp. You didn’t post any graphs, And most of what is in your links is provable FAKE by their own data. That graph comes from a peer reviewed science report. Planet is still only a tiny bump above the coldest period in 10,000 years. Be every thankful of that. And there is no evidence human CO2 caused that highly beneficial warming. You will prove that, by producing no evidence… Oh look, Beetroot agrees with me. There is no evidence that CO2 causes warming. In the NH the current temperature is probably about on par with 1930s’ Modern warming is nothing but a tiny dot at the end of the chart, level with the left hand end. WB – you obviously do not have a traditional earth science background. The following image may help you get the “modern warming” in perspective. The only questionable figures on this image are the 2050 and 2100 temperature estimates on the right, and even 2050 is not a problem for this planet as it has happened during the Eemian, which is like yesterday in earth history. I have a very traditional science education from a top northeastern US University, and I am very familiar with this graph you’ve posted. It shows a projection that by the end of this century, global temperatures could be higher than they were during the Eemian, 120,000 years ago. What the graph does not show is that the rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia. Nor does it do anything to communicate the effects of such a rapid rise in global temperatures on humans or on our health, environment, migration patterns, droughts, storm disasters and infrastructure to name but a few of the areas affected. You might benefit from a scientific view of the risks that climate change presents to humanity, here: https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/effects/ The projections shown by the red dots are totally BOGUS and not based on anything but pure conjecture. I replied to your JUNK PROPAGANDA below. !! Showed it was a total load of bollocks backed by absolutely nothing that could be considered remotely scientific. Now.. Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Or FAIL yet again. Your credibility is now at negative105% You should ask for a refund for your science education. You don’t seem to have learnt anything at all in those years. ! You are still an ill-informed or nil-informed scientific non-entity. ! There has NOT been a rapid rise in temperature, current level is barely a degree or so above the coldest period in 10,000 years. ! rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia Bullshit. “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature Your evidence link is nothing but propaganda pap, It contains absolutely zero evidence of anything You climate.gov link is no better. 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Or you could just keep posting links to nebulous zero-science propaganda sites, and lower your credibility to -200% Your first statement about rate of warming is totally unsupportable BS. !! There is no way past data is defined enough to show that. In fact, before manic data adjustments the period from 1900-1922 was about the same rate as from 1970 onwards And as YOU have shown many times, there is no empirical evidence at all that humans have caused any of the small amount of highly beneficial warming. You are one of the most MAL-INFORMED fools I have ever come across. !! Not only that, we know from the UAH data that the current warming is NOT because of human CO2,. It is from extra solar energy reaching the tropical oceans, expressing as El Nino spike/steps at semi-regular intervals. There is absolutely no evidence of any human causation. If you think there is, Use UAH data to show us where it is. Think for yourself, not petty regurgitations… if you can find a pair of operable brain cells. Why should I believe your climastrology sites? So you are a Denier. There is NO SCIENCE on those pages. Just nonsense projections from unvalidated computer games. Nothing to “DENY” because they are just fantasy. Warren, two things. Don’t engage.. so he can avoid posting any evidence… as always. ?? So he can post climate nonsense and get away with it ?? —– “I firmly believe CO2 is a GHG and warms the earth” Ahhh.. another anti-science AGW-cultist… you are not a skeptic. Perhaps you would like to try… and fail. 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Oh look, “the hoff”, a silly AGW “believer” runs away presents zero empirical evidence WHY DOES THAT ALWAYS HAPPEN !! “No matter what facts you put in front of him” Beeton has not put forward any actual “facts”. Haven’t you been watching. Neither have you. ! I’m quite prepared to discuss actual scientific evidence. Beeton hasn’t produced any. You know the questions. ! thanks. Four things from me: 1) I did not know that wuwt had a “position” on co2. It’s hard to find any consistent position on anything among skeptics. 2) I rarely engage with Bnice for the reason you state 3) The research behind climate sensitivity estimates is extensive. I’ve seen analysis that shows Even with the lowest values found in the literature, climate change is a severe economic, health and safety risk to humanity, and only a full transition of the global economy to zero carbon emissions by 2050 can avoid very serious effects. 4) I use the word Denier with those who, like Bnice, refuse to accept facts or the conclusions of peer reviewed science. Unfortunately, exceptions like yourself are a rarity on wuwt. Warren, Skeptics are not a homogenous group, but we call ourselves skeptics for the specific reason that that our skepticism revolves around issues like the benefits of mitigation versus adaptation and the severity of alarm that is appropriate. Bnice is an outlier, a vocal minority if you will, but “Denier” remains an odious term which belongs in no civil discourse. Anthony Watts started this blog a long time ago, and his position is that CO2 is a GHG. That was oft stated in the early days of this forum, it has unfortunately not repeated recently. In the early days there were extensive articles with in depth scientific analysis by well known skeptics that showed conclusively that the GHE is real and that CO2 is a GHG. These articles tend to be few and far between these last few years, so we are left with more political articles than the early days which were hardcore science. Even just a basic understanding of Stephen-Boltzmann Law shows that if the GHE is not real and there are no GHG’s, the earth would be snowball earth except perhaps for a stripe around the equator. You are correct that the research behind climate sensitivity is extensive. In decades of research though, the range in sensitivity estimates hasn’t changed much, though more recent papers tend to the lower side, support for the upper range is diminishing rapidly. Estimates for direct effects (3.7w/m2 per doubling) have not changed at all, but the sum total with feedbacks continues to be in dispute, ranging from as low as 1.7 Deg per doubling to 3.0 with the lower end having far more support recently. That, however, isn’t what skeptics are most focused on. The endangerment findings that you find so troubling are predicated on output from models, which have been consistently wrong. They’ve run too hot for decades, all except one. They continue to produce a tropospheric hotspot which has for decades been the “fingerprint” of catastrophe, except it exists ONLY in models, not in real world observations. Second, having paid close attention to the IPCC reports since AR3, there is a disturbing difference between the science itself in the main report and the Summary for Policy Makers, with the latter political documents often unrelated to the actual science. We’ve even seen one lead author demand his name be taken off the SPM for its unjustified alarm. But as the IPCC reports have evolved, each one has been more political than the previous. Consider for example the 1.5 degree “limit”. Where did this number come from? What science underlies it? The answer is none. It was arrived at by “expert opinion” from a group of scientists who are clearly biased toward alarm. I cannot summarize for you the entirety of the skeptic side in a single post, its a very broad topic. But on the issue of alarm, I shall leave you with this: We’ve gone from 280ppm of CO2 to 430, not far off one doubling. During that time, on a global basis, the IPCC has found no discernable trend in hurricanes, floods, droughts or wildfires. The four horsemen of the apocalypse as Forbes put it. What conclusion can we draw from this? If we put the models aside and just focus on data, the lack of a trend over decades doesn’t mean 100% for certain that there is no cause for alarm. But it does raise an important question which I can tell you from 20 years of debating this topic, tends to draw insults and jeers from the alarmists rather than any sober discussion of the facts. The question is, if the earth’s climate is so sensitive, so prone to unleashing climate fury upon the planet, why is there no sign in the data, collected over decades, of the deleterious effects? How can he climate be hyper-sensitive to changes in CO2 while also showing no changes to increases in CO2? Further, as CO2’s effects are logarithmic (hence the practice of quoting sensitivity in Deg C per doubling) each additional ppm of CO2 has less effect than the one before it. So the best conclusion that we can draw based on the data is that catastrophic changes in weather are not only insensitive to CO2 increase, they get less sensitive to each additional ppm. I wrote this article for WUWT about 9 years ago. Its has since been moved to different servers a couple of times so the formatting is screwed up. The links are also broken for the most part as the IPCC has moved their stuff around a lot too. Yes it is AR5 and the most recent report is AR6, I did say it was a 9 year old article. But the conclusions are still clear and easily read. The reason that I share it with you here is that as of AR5, it was VERY CLEAR from the IPCC’s main report (in other words the actual science, not the SPM) that there is no cause for alarm. Climate Change comes in dead last in nearly every category in terms of what the major effects on the human condition are likely to be in the future. https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/01/01/we-have-bigger-problems-than-climate-change-so-sayeth-ipcc-ar5/ In fact, Richard Tol, lead author on multiple iterations of the IPCC reports shows up in comments on this article. One of his comments pertains to his reason for withdrawing from the SPM of his own chapter. No need for you to take me at my word. You can read it for yourself. There is also no empirical evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2 in any IPCC creation. It is all just conjecture and supposition. Would you care to provide that empirical evidence. Or just ignore the fact that you can’t, and go on “believing” like a good little AGW-cultist A whole lot of regurg. but still no empirical scientific evidence. A big FAIL !! Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Other than the most basic theory of climate science –the GHE– I find most of your implied call for no action or minimal action unsupported in the scientific literature. Eg: 1) The latest IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) estimates equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely between 2.5°C and 4.0°C and very likely between 2.0°C and 5.0°C. The best estimate for ECS remains at 3°C. In order to safeguard the atmosphere and climate, responsible risk management requires insuring against the more severe of possible outcomes, not the mean. That implies mitigation policy based on an ECS between 3 and 4, possibly 5. Using an ECS less than 3C would be irresponsible risk management, and gambling with earth’s life support system. 2) Some models have run ‘hot’, but of course the IPCC is fully aware of this, and considers the ensemble of models with and without the hot models included. At the end of the day, for AR6 the IPCC has decided not to increase the upper end of IPCC ECS estimates in AR5 — which after all are not based on models alone, but also on paleoclimate data, as well as current warming trends. 3) It is untrue to claim, as you do, that none of the impacts of climate change have shown up. Clearly they have, and they are so identified and documented by the IPCC as effects based on current data, not on modeling. 4) Also, it is flawed logic to claim, as you do that because some impacts of climate change are not yet showing statistical significance, that they should be dismissed from a threat assessment. Modeling is based on real data and the physical behavior of earths climate system, and many of the models do indeed accurately reproduce the current warming trend. Disregarding future impacts based on those models would be irresponsible. 5) In your last paragraph you say, “How can the climate be hyper-sensitive to changes in CO2 while also showing no changes to increases in CO2?” AR6 is replete with examples that make that an absurd claim. As I said earlier, each iteration of the IPCC reports had become more political than the previous. I spend little time these days on IPCC reports. If I delve into something I delve into the papers upon which the reports are supposedly based. I find little alarming in them. The IPCC is a UN construct, and like many UN constructs, corrupt to the core. Their purpose is to grow their organization, their funding, and their power. If they were to proclaim that there is no cause for alarm, they would instantly be out of jobs. An executive position at the UN pays on the order of $700K per year. The incentive for alarm is obvious. Hence my focus on the actual papers than their conclusions. Sensitivity in the range of 5.5 Deg C per doubling is pure garbage. If it was that high would would see it leaping out of the data. But we don’t, we can barely tease the warming signal out of natural variability. As for the impacts, I did not say none have shown up. Its getting warmer. It doesn’t matter which temperature series you want to look at, its getting warmer. UAH, RSS, HadCrut, etc it is warmer now that it was 100 years ago. No doubt about it. That doesn’t change the fact that there are no discernable trends in the exact things we should be most worried about. Tree lines moving north is real, and not at all alarming. More arable land, not alarming. Island atolls aren’t being swamped by sea level rise, they are getting larger. Agricultural output has sky rocketed, outpacing population increases without using more land. For every heat related excess death we are seeing 10+ lives saved from excess cold. If you look at nothing but negative effects, you have reason for alarm. If you look at ALL the effects, it turns out that there are a lot of positives. In fact, the heights of civilization all coincide with the Medieval, Roman and Minoan warming periods. In fact history books record them as climate optimums. You might be able to convince me that we’re as warm now as the Medieval warming period, but the Roman and Minoan warming periods were absolutely warmer than it is now. As for irresponsible risk management, allow me to point out two things: I’m going to have a little fun with bnice blow, you might want to follow along just to be amused. A little fun with your headless chook routine showing absolutely zero empirical evidence. RUN AWAY again.. post a load of irrelevant regurg… Hilarious. ! Making a compete joke of yourself ??? What a load of low-end kamal-speak. Absolute GIBBERISH !! Pertaining to absolutely nothing but the stupid opinions of a manic AGW -cultist. Andreas not Antonius. I should review more before hitting the post button. First, I want to thank you for your professionalism and polite dialogue That’s a rarity on WUWT, and some, like BNICE, are so deep into their silos of rage and fact denial that they are often, as you say, ‘hoist on their own petard’. Now to your most recent reply to me: 1) I am a bit disappointed in your first paragraph — instead of dealing with the science, you attack motives of the IPCC, which is tasked with summarizing the work of the thousands of scientists and hundreds of scientific institutions around the world that have conducted and published the original research. If the IPCC is as corrupt as you say, you should be able to show where its conclusions deviate from the published peer reviewed science it’s based on. Many Deniers and skeptics I encounter attack motives or claim corruption and make no effort (or no competent effort) to debunk the research they criticize. That tells me they can’t justify their position and are driven by emotion, not reasoning. 2) You call an ECS of 5 (which is characterized by the IPCC as ‘likely’, not ‘very likely’, ie, the tail of the probability distribution) as pure garbage. But you don’t demonstrate why it’s pure garbage. Unsupported assertions don’t make the case. 3) Re: impacts — see my earlier posting on this point — you cannot justify leaving out the modeled threats. I would add that your claim civilization is enhanced by the warming trend also cannot be justified. First, it’s not only the high level of future temperatures that will harm us — it is the high RATE of warming that is a major concern. E.g., most modern population centers are along seacoasts. The potential for a sea level rise of 25 feet or more in 150 years carries with it catastrophic consequences for those cities. And dont tell me you can calculate the rise to be less — because you cannot rigorously calculate future ice loss — one can only estimate tail risks. And we mitigate against tail risk, not for the mean of probability. 4) You say mitigation strategies are a waste of money. That is the biggest mistake in all of your postings. Solar wind and nuclear are all viable technologies, and the last two are being aggressively deployed across the world. And if you believe solar and wind are not viable, you should tell that to the world’s utilities who are using renewables for over 80% of new generating capacity as they expand their grid systems. And your point that energy required to manufacture these products will emit vast amounts of CO2 is just plain silly — those energy sources can ultimately be renewable as well — or be nuclear power, also zero emission technology. 5) Finally, I find your argument about risk to be flawed. Risk = probability times consequence. You insure your home when the risk of total destruction is well less than 5%. Yet we are dealing with humanity’s life support system — and a probability of harm that is estimated at 95% by the IPCC. So you cannot tell me we should use an ECS much less than the mean of 3C for designing mitigation policy. 6) Finally, if someone like yourself wants to put forth a credible case climate change is not a high risk for humanity, and/or that mitigation should not be attempted, they should submit their ideas in the form of scientific papers to a respected scientific journal. The fact that there are tens of thousands of peer reviewed papers that form the basis of the IPCC’s work products, but NOT ONE (to my knowledge) that makes the case ECS is as low as you say, or that an ECS less than 3 should be used for policy, convinces me that the Skeptics and Deniers have it wrong, and the body of scientific and economic literature has it right. I despise you AGW hoaxers for trying to deprive me of methane, gasoline and diesel, and for forcing me to pay your stupid battery cars. Stuff your corrupt journal papers where there is no sunshine. Your children and grandchildren will thank those concerned citizens who worked to preserve the world for them to enjoy, and they will forget those who closed their eyes to the unanimous, and overwhelming scientific consensus, that climate change was caused by the burning of fossil fuels and represented a serious threat to humanity. Consensus is agreement of opinions. If you continue to use the word Denier to describe me or anyone, even the moronic outbursts of Thats-Not-A-Fact-Only-My-Facts-Are-Facts-Bnice, I will not respond to you, and neither should anyone else. It was coined by Naomi Oreskes in her book Merchants of Doubt for the specific purpose of associating skeptics with Holocaust deniers. It is an odious term and even Reuters has foregone its usage. I’m not going to deal with your entire rant, and this post will be my last on this thread. As I pointed out in reply to the not nice troll, I have in the past taken IPCC reports apart piece by piece. I wrote a series of articles on the leaked AR5 preprint and exposed multiple instances of fraudulent claims (as did others). By the time the formal AR5 came out, those claims had disappeared. Writing an in depth analysis like that takes hundreds of hours of research. I did it for AR5, I’m not going to put in that kind of time to satisfy your demands for proof of problems with AR6. I am trying to point you in the right direction. I started asking questions of AR4 and that’s where I had my epiphany. The wording is all exaggeration, lies by omission, misuse of statistics, and worse. But I can tell you from experience that you can only get there yourself. No one has that epiphany by being backed into a corner with facts. It just turns into an insult war at the end, I’m not interested. I do suggest you put some of your own time into wind and solar and their actual impacts to the grid. Google spent a $1 billion trying to build a cost effective solar power plant and at the end their own engineers said publicly that it could not be done. Try and find that with a google search, they buried it three days after it came out. Wind and solar are being built out all over the world based on the will of politicians forcing it down the throats of the grid operators. Then when it doesn’t work, they do what politicians do, they paper it over. In Ontario they went crazy on wind, subsidized it like mad to make sure lots got built, and the result was electricity prices so high that there was a rate payers revolt. Did the politicians admit their error? No. They subsidized the rate payers to bring their bills down to something reasonable, pacifying them with their own tax dollars. This same dynamic is being played out all over the world. The recent wind and sun drought in Germany drove the prices on interconnected grids so high that several countries are planning to disconnect so it doesn’t happen to them again. Where does that leave Germany in their next wind and sun drought? It leaves them with grid failure. People die during grid failures. But that’s not the worst part. The worst part is the amount of CO2 that goes into making these things. Steel for windmills and purified silicon for solar panels comes from coal fired blast furnaces. Like I said, you need to start asking the tough questions yourself, digging into the details yourself. That’s the only way you get to an epiphany. My last post on this thread, I’ve put too much time into it already. Again, just waffling irrelevant gibberish… and mal-information. …. with no empirical evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Why is that? The models are a load of unphysical garbage filled with errors and unproven suppositions. They are little more than computer games. IPCC can make all the estimates of ESC they want, but they are all based on models that don’t remotely represent the atmosphere. There is no evidence ESC is anything but zero. It is massively irresponsible to waste billions of dollars based on erroneous garbage models while destroying electricity grids and the environment. AR6 is a political document voted on by representatives of some 129 countries. If the summary report disagrees with the science reports, it is mandated the science reports change. I’ve worked with scientists and laymen who worked on the IPCC. What you say is false. The Green House Effect is not a theory. It is a hypothesis. AR6 clearly documents that the impacts are low to zero except a mild warming. Models are approximations. Models do not indeed accurately represent that which they model. Models have numerous assumptions, many of which are not qualified through experimentation. Models do not include everything and are on a, now, 25 km grid, which does not represent the planet adequately. Hindcasting is curve fitting, nothing more. They tweak the “control knobs” until they get a decent fit. This hindcasting neither increases nor decreases uncertainties and errors in the outputs. The outputs are nothing more than hypothetical approximations. Models can predict, but such predictions are no better than guessing. Now, take your comment 5 and list all of the hypersensitivities to CO2 included in AR6. You still haven’t present one bit of peer-reviewed science to back up anything you have said. You cannot even say what I “deny” that you can present actual empirical science to back You have zero credibility, because you are also totally clueless what journal peer-review even means or does. Here is some peer-reviewed science do you DENY the result? 8 Taiwanese Engineers Determine The Climate Sensitivity To A 300 ppm CO2 Increase Is ‘Negligibly Small’ found tripling atmospheric CO2 from 100 ppm to 400 ppm produces a “negligibly small” 0.3°C warming effect. This temperature change is only associated with the increase from 100 ppm to 350 ppm and includes no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. Seems YOU ARE A DENIER under your own description. Hi Bnice200, thanks for posting that. So, after insisting that there is NO empirical evidence to show that CO2 has ANY warming effect, you’ve now posted evidence that falsifies your own assertion. Hoisted on your own petard as they say. If we are to believe the 8 Taiwanese engineers you cite, take them completely at their word, assume their calculations are 100% accurate, then CO2 in fact DOES have a warming effect. Per your cite, going from 100ppm to 400ppm has a warming effect of 0.3 Deg C. Which means according to YOUR cite, all the rubbish you have cluttered up the threads with about there being no empirical evidence to show that CO2 has any warming effect at all are rubbish. Crap. Bull sh*t. You’ve just admitted that there IS an effect. Its not zero. They will not be the first to suggest a very low sensitivity, nor will they be the last. The point is that it is not zero as you claim. They start out though by “tripling” CO2 concentration from 100 to 400 ppm. They appear to have a math problem, that is quadrupling, not tripling. Then they make the astounding claim that there’s no additional warming from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. Well if there is measurable warming from 100 to 350, then NO warming from 350 to 400 is physically impossible. So what game did they play to arrive at that conclusion? Well, they limited the calculations to 5 years. So they got a number so small that they rounded it off to zero. The real world doesn’t end in 5 years. But bottom line is they showed that CO2 in fact does have an effect, and all your blathering is wrong. Want some more empirical evidence? Here is a real experiment. A 10 cm long tube with IR transparent windows at each end is filled with an artificial atmosphere with 2.6 % water vapour and 357 ppm of CO2. They shine a known IR source in one end, and measure exactly what comes out the other end. Then they double the CO2 concentration and do it again. Their conclusion? 0.054w/m2. Very small, but most definitely NOT zero, read it for yourself: http://www.john-daly.com/artifact.htm Now let me explain why that conclusion is WAY too low. To get an actual result that is accurate using this methodology, you’d have to build an apparatus the height of the troposphere. Not practical, but the point being that you’d need thousands of these 10 cm tubes end to end and the total effect would be cumulative. Secondly, there is no ocean in this experiment, or a whole lot of other things that exist in the real world. In the real world increased temps promote more evaporation into an atmosphere that can hold more water, which is also a GHG. Feedbacks are real. Thanks for playing along, your apology is accepted. David H. is partially right when he points to a warming effect due to CO2. It was shown in the referenced paper which is likely from the same cause as the 0.24 C per doubling reference by Wilpost in another paper. https://www.windtaskforce.org/profiles/blogs/german-researcher-doubling-of-atmospheric-co2-causes-only-0-24-c The cause is the widening of the 15 µm absorption window for CO2. This effect was also mentioned in the work by Wijngaarden and Happer. The problem is this is only part of the story. There is also an induced cooling effect by CO2 which appears to be of about the same strength. I’ve mentioned this in the past. It is caused by the increase in IR radiation at the surface leading to additional evaporation and enhanced convection (first mention by Dr. William Gray). As a result, Bnice turns out to be correct. There is no warming from increases in CO2 even going back to 100 ppm. (we could see some warming at less than 100) The additional evaporation results in an increase in water vapour, which is a GHG. Net positive feedback. If you want to pick nits, CO2 has an absorption band in the downwelling solar radiance. At surface this completely get swamped by water vapour, but at high altitude and high latitude it is cold, very little water vapour. So in theory CO2 in fact has a cooling effect too. Fun fact, there are winds that blow high in the atmosphere over Antarctica that are warmer than the surface below. So the net effect of CO2 there is to intercept downwelling photons from the warm winds and then xfer the energy either by collision or emission. So the “greenhouse effect” is actually reversed in Antarctica. Keep that in mind when you see some warming event in Antarctica being blamed on CO2. “Net positive feedback.” Again, a load of baseless supposition. Never proven. And if there is no CO2 signal , there is no feedback. So…. Still waiting for you to present some empirical scientific evidence of CO2 warming the atmosphere. All you have so far is empty waffle.. The additional evaporation results in an increase in water vapour, which is a GHG. Net positive feedback. Sorry, this is simply not true. You are missing the effects of saturation and convection. The increase in water vapor only occurs low in the atmosphere where all the energy available to H2O is already being absorbed, aka saturation. Can’t cause any warming there. The increase has the added effect of increasing buoyancy. This ends up driving convective currents higher into the colder troposphere which increases condensation. As a result you have less residual water vapor exactly where saturation is no longer in effect. This occurs primarily in the Tropics and then is carried by the Hadley circulation to the higher latitudes. The reduced water vapor ends up allowing more energy to radiate to space thus a cooling effect. The extra energy that was captured low in the atmosphere due to the widening of the absorption window is basically what is sent high in the troposphere as latent heat of the extra evaporation. This is the energy that now has an easier time getting to space. This is one of the non-obvious effects that have fooled most scientists, so don’t feel bad. There are more. You have a fundamental misconception. Or perhaps several. Heat transfer beyond earths system cannot occur by conduction or convection — only by radiative heat transfer. And the ghe is never saturated. That mistake was first made by Angstrom in the 19th century, but corrected by Arrhenius and all other researchers since then. Warren, such massive ignorance in one short comment. It’s no wonder you have zero credibility. Go read my more detailed description to David and learn. Detailed or not, the only heat transfer mechanism that can move energy out of earth’s system is radiative. Convection and conduction only cause heat exchange WITHIN earth’s system, and cannot cause global warming or cooling the only heat transfer mechanism that can move energy out of earth’s system is radiative Which is exactly what I said in my more detail description. However, the process which drove the increase in radiative energy loss started with increased evaporation. Once again it becomes obvious that you have almost no basic understanding of science. a) The body of scientific literature , as reflected in the IPCC summary, concludes an ECS mean of 3C. We await your publication of a contrary analysis in a peer reviewed scientific journal. “as the 0.24 C per doubling reference by Wilpost in another paper.” Which for a small increase in CO2 in the last 100 or so years would lead to a totally immeasurable amount, totally swamped by natural variability. There is no cooling effect from co2. Evaporation does not transfer heat to outer space so cannot affect earths heat content. Poor Hoff.. the rabid AGW-cultist. ! Doesn’t understand the words “ no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm.” Then an experiment that cuts out convection, conduction and air movement so it no longer even remotely resembles the atmosphere. How much more stupid can you get !! And a call to the fallacy of WV feedback A complete FAIL !! It was not an experiment. It was a model. Its in the first effing paragraph of the description, FFS. You know what? Eff off. I’m putting you back on ignore. Calling ME a rabid AGW cultist is as ignorant and insult as one can get. I’ve authored well over a dozen articles for WUWT challenging the entire CAGW premise. I’ve dissected IPCC reports, I wrote damning articles calling out the hypocrisy in the leaked AR5 pre print which then disappeared from the final version. I’ve written for other skeptic forums, I have in fact risked my career by publicly refuting the CAGW thesis as I write under my own name. Do you have the guts to write under your own name? I am betting you do not. You’re just a troll whose only argument is to say anything that s shown to you is invalid. You clutter up threads with the same blather over and over. You are convincing no one except perhaps yourself. I actually feel rather sorry for you. Set/Bnice=Ignore The fact that you think an enclosed tube in any way represents the atmosphere, really does indicate the low level of your scientific understanding. Apparently you missed the entire part of the post where I explained exactly that? Do the words you disagree with just disappear while you are reading them? Or do you read them and then delete them from your brain? Ask me if I care about your stupid labels, shillboi. “So you are a Denier.” So you are a troll. I’m also a denier. Now you just have to figure out what I deny. Good luck! That is hate speach. What’s not accurate about this? “I use the word Denier with those who, like Bnice, refuse to accept facts or the conclusions of peer reviewed science” Which is a totally meaningless description when you are totally incapable of producing any peer-reviewed science. If you say I “deny” something you must be able to produce precise empirically based science to prove the thing you say I deny. So far you have failed absolutely and completely You have also shown that you are totally clueless what “peer-review” actually is. !! You are just a mouth, with no brain driving it. Denier is hate speech. Poor baby — buck up; when you finish 6th grade science, you’ll be able to understand your betters. More insults. Such a mature way to discuss science. Denier is hate speech. That is not a peer reviewed published science paper. One of the issues that I have noticed with “traditional science education” is a lack of teaching of “traditional earth science”. In my day, there was a School of Applied Geology. That faculty no longer exists, and geology is a bit player in the school of Environmental Science. This lack of traditional earth science teaching and understanding leads to statements such as: What the graph does not show is that the rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia. Are you certain that is the case? NASA only goes back to 1880. The only other long term record is that for Central England which goes back to the 1600’s, but the data integrity is often questioned. The next alternative are temperature estimates from ice cores, with data points +/- a thousand years. Having another look at the CET data, it seems that a similar warming rate may have happened during the 1700’s. “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature What do you find in the links that you disagree with? If so, why? Links aren’t working.. Both links work for me. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. There is no data provided on any of your links to support this statement. You don’t look very deeply. In the first section , read this statement, and footnote 1 referencing AR6: ” The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 “ go back to the link and read footnote 1. You love your propaganda pap, don’t you beetroot. Quite pathetic that you think it is actual science, though !!. Not surprised that you can’t tell the difference between a bald-faced LIE, and actual science though. Let’s watch your squirm away in avoidance.. yet again… 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Pre data adjustment…. graph didn’t attach…. And according to GISP data there have been several periods in the Holocene where warming was just as steep over a much large increase than current. Note, according to Mann the bottom of the current warming starts in 1850, so the end of the graph would be around the 1930s, very similar temperatures to now. My issue is with the claim that current (global) warming rates (ie 1960 to present) of about 0.24 DegC/decade is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. There is no forensic method available to estimate such rates for a ~60 year period prior to about 1880. It rings my sciency alarm bells. BTW, I’m with you on nuclear! There is plenty of scientific literature explaining how proxy data,with error bars, allow for this determination. The NASA footnote cites AR6 Except you didn’t produce it. We can assume you have never read it while thinking. Just swallowed the nonsense hook line and sinker. You don’t look very deeply. In the first section , read this statement, and footnote 1 referencing AR6: You do realize that AR6 conclusions are based solely upon correlations and not causation don’t you? Again, you say you are trained in science, yet you use correlation as your proof? That is not scientific! I don’t believe you have the qualifications or competence to claim you’ve found fundamental errors in the body of peer reviewed science. You are obviously totally lacking in any qualifications or scientific education. What you “believe” is totally irrelevant and has well below zero credibility. There is not data provided anywhere. it is all just mindless propaganda. This is what beetroot builds his case on.. NON-science nonsense. I have replied to this propaganda nonsense further down. That you seem to think it contains anything remotely scientific is a very sad indictment of the your education in science. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. From your NASA link : Takeaways While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. … … The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.

[ Reference 1 ] … … References References 1. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, WGI, Technical Summary 1. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, WGI, Technical Summary OK, so it goes from a headline precise “in the past 10,000 years” to a more vague “over many recent millennia” in the main text, and just provides a reference to the (112 page PDF file) AR6 WG-I assessment report’s “Technical Summary” chapter. . In the “Introduction” to the TS there is a “Selected Updates and/or New Results since AR5” sub-section, in which we find (on page 41, bold in the original, underlining added by me) : Paleoclimate evidence: The AR5 assessed that many of the changes observed since the 1950s are unprecedented over decades to millennia. Updated paleoclimate evidence strengthens this assessment; over the past several decades, key indicators of the climate system are increasingly at levels unseen in centuries to millennia and are changing at rates unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years. (Box TS.2, Section TS.2) The IPCC AR6 WG-I TS document referenced by the NASA webpage says “the last 2000 years”, not 10,000. Attached at the end of this post is a screenshot of panel a of Cross-Section Box TS.1, Figure 1, which can be found on page 61. URL to IPCC original : https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/figures/technical-summary/ts-ccbox-1-figure-1/ You will note that it repeats the “in a rate unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years” number, neither “10,000” nor “many (recent) millennia”. You will also note that the “Resolution:” for data before 1000AD is in “Centuries” … which makes it completely useless when comparing paleoclimate datasets to the warming rate “Over the last 50 years“. . Your NASA “supporting evidence” link does not actually support your parroting of its “in the past 10,000 years” bald assertion. Datasets with resolutions of “centuries” cannot be used to calculate “rates of warming” for periods of decades (/ “50 years”). Please try again. I Said “millennia”. 2000 is two millennia. This is lame even for you, shillboi. Mark had the receipts and this is all you can manage. Mark has no idea what data NASA has. Until he discusses with NASA, or reads the original journal papers from which the conclusion was drawn, he hasn’t debunked anything. I trust NASA, not armchair deniers. … or reads the original journal papers from which the conclusion was drawn … My bad, it was “obvious” to me on looking through the “supporting evidence” list that only the “AR6 WG-I TS” reference could potentially be relevant, so I only showed how that one did not include a “in the past 10,000 years” qualifier.

Conclusion There is absolutely nothing whatsoever in the list of “References” supplied by NASA to support their headline “in the past 10,000 years” bald assertion. Prove me wrong. Provide a citation to the specific paragraph(s) in any of the “References” on that webpage that includes the character string “the past 10,000 years” (or “ten millennia” ?). Prove me wrong. Provide a citation to the specific paragraph(s) in any of the “References” on that webpage that includes the character string “the past 10,000 years” (or “ten millennia” ?). You’ll find that is why Beeton, nyolci, and other trolls never, ever show the EVIDENCE they refer to. Only that the evidence exists in papers from the experts. I’ve caught the them in inaccurate quotes by checking the papers they happen to refer to. What a joke. Good work! You could be right. You could be wrong if you’ve missed something. I don’t know. But I do know this, posted by NASA, is from the IPCC recent assessment: “Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age: I also believe this statement, from NASA, is undeniable: “The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia. It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun’s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.” So, then no peer review published science papers? Just IPCC. Roger that. You will also note that the “Resolution:” for data before 1000AD is in “Centuries” … which makes it completely useless when comparing paleoclimate datasets to the warming rate “Over the last 50 years“. Thanks for your forensic work Mark. It is a sad day when NASA allows unverified statements on their websites. ﻿ Nice write up Mark. One of the first things that triggered my BS meter was reading AR4 and coming across a value and wondering where it came from. The reference would be to a previous AR which would then reference a paper which would then reference another paper which would inevitably be behind a paywall. Accept their number or spend a fortune finding out where it came from. Why the obvious effort to shroud the source of a value used across multiple AR’s? I discovered that other people were asking the same questions and getting the run around. The second was the steadfast refusal to share data and methods. You’ll just try and find something wrong with it complained Hanson. Well isn’t that the whole point of science? Trying to find errors? The fate of humanity lies in the balance and these clowns are afraid we’ll find errors? If we did find errors, would that not be a cause for celebration, the world not ending after all? Or if we didn’t find errors it would prove them right, isn’t that what they want, for us to believe them? I got banned from multiple “science” sites for asking those questions. NASA global data back to 1850 is a manically distorted fabrication of homogenised urban heat effect surface data,. It is totally meaningless as a measure of global temperature change Central England is regional –not the world. “such a rapid rise in global temperatures on humans or on our health, environment, migration patterns, droughts, storm disasters and infrastructure to name but a few of the areas affected. “ NONE of which actually exist in real data, except the highly beneficial temperature rise since the LIA. Warmth enhances health. 10X more people die from cold as from heat, life expectancy has increased massively due to warming and the products and use of fossil fuels. Environment.. the whole planet is much greener.. is that a bad thing. Only thing destroying the environment is wind and solar factories. Migration patterns are never set in stone. No trend in droughts.. Cold causes more droughts than warmth does. No trend (maybe slightly downwards) in storms or cyclones/hurricanes except the silly naming thereof. No increase in disasters, except where people build on flood plains etc. Infrastructure .. nope… you have nothing. So.. just another load of fake mantra pap from you. ! Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. How many years does each dot on the graph cover? How do you determine the rate of change when a single point covers a century or a millennia. If you had a proper science education, you would know how to interpret time series graphs. Apparently you missed that day at school! That is not a peer reviewed published science paper. Beetroot doesn’t seem to have any science background whatsoever !! And he has to resort to spamming to prop up his lies. That chart comes from a peer reviewed science report. Oh dear…the beetroot falls for on-line propaganda pap, yet again !! And there it is. As always the warmists ultimately rely on the “argument from authority” fallacious position rather than providing evidence that supports their claims. They rather believe that there are experts who can be relied on to tell them what the facts are because that’s what they are told by – you know -really smart people. For Mr. Beeton’s information, many of us have read these reports and papers, looked closely at the methods and data and researched other information and data and found them to be unconvincing, biased and sometimes fraudulent. You cannot claim to be well educated on a subject unless you’ve thoroughly researched and considered all sides. I’ve only ever seen what I believe to be truly objective research on the climate change issue from what are called skeptics. “many of us have read these reports and papers, looked closely at the methods and data and researched other information and data and found them to be unconvincing, biased and sometimes fraudulent.” So, since 99.9% of all peer reviewed research, every one of the 270 scientific institutions in the world, all University textbooks on Atmospheric Physics, and nearly every single researching climate scientist in the world contradict Deniers — who have no consistent theory to explain the warming of the planet — I consider your position to be untenable in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Another way of looking at this is to consider the hubris — and scientific incompetence–of someone who believes he’s found fundamental errors in the work of nearly every climate scientist on the planet. since 99.9% of all peer reviewed research Liar. You have a problematic relationship with facts, it seems: https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/10/more-999-studies-agree-humans-caused-climate-change Agree…. so what… because they get funding NOT ONE OF THEM provides scientific evidence that it does. If you think one does, then point to the exact one. That means you will have to read them all to find it exists… .. instead of posting links you are totally clueless about.. Modelled crap does not count. Noted, yet again you RUN AWAY. so funny to watch your headless chicken routine. 🙂 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. “problematic relationship with facts” And you have ZERO or negative relationship with facts. !! You run and hide from them. ! Noted that YET AGAIN you are totally incapable of supporting the very basis of your cult-religion Hilarious headless chicken routines to avoid the fact. You have NEVER read a book on Atmospheric Physics, you do not have a capability to understand it. The scientific incompetence is totally YOURS. Prove me correct , yet again.. !! 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Your credibility is now at negative 220% Try again.. see if you can present something with any credibility.. or FAIL ! 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. So just an appeal to “more and bigger” authorities? Perhaps you are unaware that all those scientific institutions represent mostly academic researchers highly dependent on massive government grants for their livelihood and those grants only go to those who support the approved narrative. Are you, by chance, one of them? You don’t even seem to know how bogus the 99% [97%] consensus argument is. You need to read more widely. He’s just regurgitating the talking points he’s been handed. “in the face of overwhelming evidence” You haven’t produced any actual scientific evidence. !! 8 Taiwanese Engineers Determine The Climate Sensitivity To A 300 ppm CO2 Increase Is ‘Negligibly Small’ tripling atmospheric CO2 from 100 ppm to 400 ppm produces a “negligibly small” 0.3°C warming effect. This temperature change is only associated with the increase from 100 ppm to 350 ppm and includes no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. You can DENY or ignore.. We know who the real “deniers” are. Another way of looking at this is to consider the hubris — and scientific incompetence–of someone who believes he’s found fundamental errors in the work of nearly every climate scientist on the planet. There is part of your problem. You have obviously not done a deep dive into your science education. Have you never been taught something by a professor and found it in error. Yet it has been propagated to many students through booksand papers the professor has written. How many text books still contain the Micheal Mann debunked hockey stick? As a student if you are taught this and never research it depth, you’ll never know it is based on suspect statistics. How many textbooks can you find that show empirical data substantiating the effective warming potential of CO2 as a cold body compared to the surface? How many textbooks deal with the subject using calculus to integrate the variations in day, month, annual orbital equations? How many just use averages and time series correlation? How many have a functional relationship between CO2 and surface temperature rather than just graphical time series? Climate science has not progressed into science yet. That is what makes me skeptical. Like it or not climate science is still at the alchemy stage of development still trumpeting that “We have found the way to make CO2 the control knob”! Youve now convincingly demonstrated you have neither the qualifications nor competence to claim you’ve found fundamental errors in the peer reviewed scientific literature. You know absolutely NOTHING about peer-review, do you. ! Totally ignorant as to what it even means. You are LYING about having ever done any science. You have neither the temperament, nor the competence or qualifications to judge. 100 scientists can agree with me, but it only take 1 to prove I am wrong. Who said that, again? You mean like everything on the internet is true because it says so on the internet? Even if a ‘green’ future is necessary there are two fallacies in place. (1) Lack of due process (2) You can’t throw a switch, which, of course, you might learn with due process. No fallacies required. First, all climate policy are and must be carried out constitutionally by legislation or by constitutional executive orders. Second, no policymakers advocate ‘throwing a switch’. Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway. But fallacies are all you have.! There is no transition underway in any country that isn’t destroying it economy World fossil fuel use remains around 80% of world energy use, wind and solar are a tiny slice, barely visible on the graph below. There is absolutely zero need to move away from fossil fuels to unreliable, erratic, intermittent parasitic low-integrity energies like wind and solar. Yes there is a transition, well underway in the world, including the US, EU, Japan, and China. EVs are in production, and more in development, 80% of new power generation capacity being installed is solar wind or nuclear, and funding and incentives from legislation is already helping to build out infrastructure. In addition, 42 countries are considering, or already have in place, a carbon tax. Also, this year the EU has implemented a new border carbon adjustment mechanism that will incentivize trade with countries that have a carbon tax. Lots happening, so you need to pay attention if you want to have credibility in your comments. Data says otherwise. Fossil fuel growth continues to outstrip wind and solar That 80% is really less than 20% when considering capacity factors.. sorry if you are too dumb to realise that. The largest countries in the world continue to massively increase their fossil fuel energy use. Countries CANNOT survive or progress without fossil fuels.. period. ! You rely totally on them every day of your pitiful existence. Drive a battery car yet, beetman? If no, you’re a hypocrite. If yes, you’re a sucker. so that makes you….uneducated Noted , yet again, the total lack of anything remotely related to scientific evidence. You ran away from answering, just like all the other AGW shills. I wonder if he parks and charges his pretend EV in an attached garage. He is dumb enough to do that. ! BOOM! Goes the Chinese EV. Have you come to grips with the fact that indeed global temperatures are rising at the fastest rate in millennia? “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature Spamming is all you got in the tank, shillboi. Totally destroyed above. They are just regurgitated propaganda fakery with zero scientific content. I meant “below” Exactly — and he can’t even regurgitate the 97% propaganda correctly. You have a problematic relationship with facts, it seems: https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/10/more-999-studies-agree-humans-caused-climate-changeG The climatology literature is corrupt, why do you believe what is in there? You say, “The climatology literature is corrupt, why do you believe what is in there?” I say, “Your statement is pure Science Denial” Yes, fool. the climate peer-review nonsense is TOTALLY CORRUPT. Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Cornell? That source is sufficient proof to ignore it. 2nd link.. is impure propaganda nonsense U.S. Sea Level Likely to Rise 1 to 6.6 Feet by 2100 Currently around 2-3mm/year, the 6.6ft value is pure fantasy. Climate Changes Will Continue Through This Century and Beyond Based on fake unvalidated models.. ie scientific BS. Hurricanes Will Become Stronger and More Intense No evidence of that happening. Mantra BS. More Droughts and Heat Waves No evidence of that happening.. mantra BS.

FAIL. ! The planet has been a lot warmer than now for most of the last 10,000 years. Anything else is based on unvalidated computer games. ! There is no evidence the El Nino of 2023 has any human causation. If you think there is, then present actual real evidence not propaganda pap. 1st link.. Seriously…. Mannian tree rings. How moronically stupid can you get !!! Please see my response timestamped “December 23, 2024 4:28 am” to one of your other copies of this post in this comments section. Nope. But given that we have recently (past couple hundred years or so) emerged from one of the coldest eras in modern history, I am grateful for every 0.1 C improvement. Besides, that 10000 year bogus claim was debunked in a prior post. It is not a fact. It is a speculative claim with minimal supporting data and note that the sources are all government websites that are obliged to tow the line of Presidential policy. If you bothered to read Biden’s 5 year climate report and compare it to AR6, you would recognize that glossy piece of propaganda for what it is. So you are endorsing either the US 5 Year Climate Report, or AR6, or both? No. I am pointing out that what was in the 5 years report did not match anything in AR6. Totally energy use 2023. Solar 2.5%, wind 3.5% fossil fuels 81.5 % Data makes you look like a brain-washed idiot. !. ! There is no “transition”.. period —– Coal Use Hits Record High in 2024 Thanks to India and China Get over it, beetroot. ! Each and every scheme a scam. https://www.youtube.com/@Bernie-is-Artemis Marxist. …. and a completely indoctrinated gormless twit. ! …the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway. This is pure fantasy. Don’t see any sign of either a common global goal or a transition. Look at the track record of China and India on coal use and emissions. Look at the various COPs and at progress (or lack of it) on the Paris agreements. The plain fact is, no-one outside of the English speaking countries and Germany has taken global warming seriously, and the countries that have tried to reduce their emissions from electricity generation are right now seeing themselves approaching the cliff of intermittency. And not liking it, getting very alarmed, and getting ready for U-turns. As will happen in February in the US. The other countries are just growing their economies as fast as possible, and letting emissions and coal use go where they may. “Don’t see any sign of either a common global goal or a transition. Look at the track record of China and India on coal use and emissions”. China’s goal is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. and they are well on their way,,ahead of most countries including the US. Coal Use Hits Record High in 2024 Thanks to India and China. wind and solar in China are barely visible in the energy chart They now have a working pebble bed nuclear, those will expand rapidly, and wind and solar will be left to rot. ! Not one nation has a chance of meeting their FAKE goals. Wind and solar make up a very small part of China’s energy usage, they have had hydro for a long time. EV’s in China make sense, crowded huge cities… anything is better than those old 2 cycle motor bikes., and the COAL fired power they will run is well out of the cities. Places like USA and America EVs are basically just a low-level second car or virtue-seeking of very little actual use. Plans, stated to fool twits like you and your mates.. works every time… … yet their use of coal grows year one year. The others are just gimmicks to fool the western world into sticking with the idiotic net-zero plan to destroy their manufacturing bases. It will fail in the USA now Trump is in, because he will aim fossil fuel self-dependency in a very short time 😆 “dropping by more than 80% by 2060.” By then, all their current coal fired power stations will be still running at high efficiency. Current wind and solar will have ceased to function and be in scrap heaps or left to rot. Why always portray new renewable energy sources with capacity rather than actual production of energy? World wide renewable energy production is about 20% of stated capacity. Combined renewable wind and solar with 100 Giga-watts of capacity over time have average output of about 20 Giga-watts of energy. Because it is the only way they can keep the hoax alive. shillboi — praising his marxist masters and earning his keep. There are only 195 nations of which 193 are part of the UN. If China is so great, why not move there? There is such thing as “constitutional executive orders.” https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46738 “Executive orders are written instruments through which a President can issue directives to shape policy. Although the U.S. Constitution does not address executive orders and no statute grants the President the general power to issue them, authority to issue such orders is accepted as an inherent aspect of presidential power, though their legal effect depends on various considerations.” Yes, presidential executive orders are constitutional when they are supported by the Constitution or authorized by Congress: Executive orders are a way for the president to set policy without waiting for Congress to pass legislation. They have the force of law unless they are voided or revoked by Congress, the president, or the judicial branch. Quite a spin. There are no “Constitutional Executive Orders” and your response matches mine that prove it. Article II of the constitution makes no mention of executive orders. What you describe is an interpretation. “take care that the Laws be faithfully executed” does not define executive orders. The second point is also not a definition of executive order. It is another interpretation. https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-2/ So Warren, why are you using FF every day? And I bet you have no solar panels on the roof. If you are going to talk the talk then you better walk the walk. Do not be a hypocrite. So Jim, do you need to read this in my post? “ Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway” I’m doing my share — including lobbying my Congressional representative and Senators to pass climate legislation. What are you doing, Jim? “I’m doing my share” Yep, you continue to use fossil fuels every second of every day. Trump is in now.. All this anti-CO2 nonsense will disappear. Drill baby, drill ! 🙂 ““ Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway”” 1… NOT underway, fossil fuels % is holding steady and is still BY FAR the main energy supply 2… Politically and idiotology based wishful thinking and propaganda. The Anti-CO2 nonsense will be dead and buried by 2050. Harold the Organic Chemist Says ATTN: Warren RE: CO2 Does Not Cause Warming Of Air. To refresh your memory, shown below in the graphic are plots of temperatures from the weather station at Furnace Creek in Death Valley from 1922 to 2001. In 1922, the concentration of CO2 was 303 ppmv (0.6 g of CO2/ cu. m. of air), and, by 2001 it had increased to 371 ppmv (0.7 g/cu. m. of air), but there was no corresponding increase in the air temperature. The reason for no temperature increase is quite simple: There is too little CO2 in the air. At the MLO in Hawaii, the current concentration of CO2 in dry air is 422 ppmv. One cubic meter of this air has 0.8 g of CO2 and a mass of 1.29 kg at STP. This small amount of CO2 can heat up such a large mass of air by a very small amount if at all. I remined you that the heavy industries and heavy transportation systems will always use enormous amounts of fossil fuels. It is now winter in the Northern Hemisphere and huge amounts of fossil fuels will be used for space heating. NB: The graphic was obtained from the late Joh Daly’s website: “Still Waiting For Greenhouse” available at: http://www.John-Daly.com. Totally energy use 2023. Solar 2.5%, wind 3.5% fossil fuels 81.5 % There is no “transition”. COAL consumption continues to grow GAS consumption continues to grow OIL consumption continues to grow “What historians will definitely wonder about in future centuries is how deeply flawed logic, obscured by shrewd and unrelenting propaganda, actually enabled a coalition of powerful special interests to convince nearly everyone in the world that CO2 from human industry was a dangerous, planet-destroying toxin. It will be remembered as the greatest mass delusion in the history of the world – that CO2, the life of plants, was considered for a time to be a deadly poison.” Richard Lindzen, Emeritus Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Climate “Science” | Dr. Richard Lindzen | Jordan B Peterson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVSrTZDopM If you are so busy lobbying, how do you manage to find the time to post so many times? If you are so busy lobbying, how do you manage to read all of those thousands of peer reviewed science papers? And, why do you not answer J Boles questions? Beetroot relies absolutely and completely on the many things that use fossil fuels. He could never exist without them. Even beetroots need CO2 to grow.. Don’t be too hard on the poor baby, bnice! He’s so delusional that he actually believes that a trace gas has more control over our climate than oceanic cycles and currents, or the Sun! Think how embarrassing it is going to be for him when the adults in his life finally have to explain reality to him! Some are made to be fools! No, Mr. Beeton, you are wrong. There is absolutely no need to bankrupt economies in fear of global warming. A warmer Earth would be an entirely beneficial thing. Historically, the Earth has been warmer than today for 99% of the last 240,000,000 years. We are currently in a Great Ice Age. The coldest point in geologic history was a mere 20,000 years ago, a blip in geologic time. Feigned ignorance of these facts is deliberate abuse of science. No preceding period or epoch with a warmer climate was detrimental to life. On the contrary, life was abundant in past warmth, more abundant, widespread, bio-diverse, and productive than today. All human endeavors also benefit from warmth, including agriculture. The warmest climes are the best for farming, ranching, forestry, and horticulture. That’s a known fact. And CO2 increases yields of all the above. Production of food, clothing, and shelter increase with increasing warmth. The basic needs for human survival correlate. AI, on the other hand, is not needed at all, provides no survival necessity, is a toy, a useless indulgence, and is in fact a hazard to human survival and the well-being of all life. Nope. The transition to cheaper cleaner energy is all good. But if not done, the harmful costs and effects of global warming will continue to worsen. Governments are moving ahead, including in the US. You may not like it, but the energy transition is underway “…, the harmful costs and effects of global warming will continue to worsen….” where are your “costs” and “bad effects” Put up or SHUT UP ! Read and be educated: https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/effects/ “Scientists predict ” you can’t show any of your imaginary effects are happening . But just Beet on . Still only find nebulous propaganda pap.. that is just sad. Nothing on that page has a single bit of scientific credibility whatsoever. U.S. Sea Level Likely to Rise 1 to 6.6 Feet by 2100 Currently around 2-3mm/year, the 6.6ft value is pure fantasy. Climate Changes Will Continue Through This Century and Beyond Based on fake unvalidated models.. ie scientific BS. btw, the climate has ALWAYS changed over time, so I’m assuming they mean the fallacy of human-based CO2 warming. Hurricanes Will Become Stronger and More Intense No evidence of that happening. Mantra BS. More Droughts and Heat Waves No evidence of that happening. Mantra BS. Longer Wildfire Season Wildfires in the USA consumed far larger areas in the 1930s Yet another piece of fakery based on unvalidated models. Changes in Precipitation Patterns Have happened throughout history, no evidence human causes them except local land use. Frost-Free Season (and Growing Season) will Lengthen GREAT NEWS for farmers and food supply, but still based on unvalidated models. Global Temperatures Will Continue to Rise Again, based on unvalidated models based on unproven erroneous assumptions. Arctic Is Very Likely to Become Ice-Free More model based BS, Arctic has been stable for last 15 years after recovering from an extreme peak in 1979. Is still far above the extent for most of the last 10,000 years All just propaganda pap for the low-IQ ignorant AGW-cultist. And you still put it forward as “evidence” !!! Really You have well below zero credibility !! Lets see if you can provide some precise evidence rather than this sort of nonsense and mantra pap. Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. That is not a peer reviewed paper and a lot of what is posted contradicts ARg. Totally energy use 2023. Solar 2.5%, wind 3.5% fossil fuels 81.5 % There is no “transition”. COAL consumption continues to grow GAS consumption continues to grow OIL consumption continues to grow. You are DELUDED and brain-hosed, until all that is left in your skull is a sickly green ooze. President Donald Trump will put an end to this energy transition nonsense by ending the billion dollars of subsidies for wind an solar. Legislation is required to change US energy policy. At the moment, the Republican margin in the House is razor thin, and they are so fractured, they can’t get anything done. in two years, the other party will likely be back in power in the House and the energy transition will continue . You think Trump can’t find away around the green mess that stops progress. Great to see you so against democracy….. you must be a marxist or a moron. ! And you are even more deluded than I thought. ! Only transition in the USA has been from coal to GAS. DRILL BABY DRILL. Trump flipped 4 Senate seats at the last election. He could easily flip a few more in two years time. Probably had 3 more if the marxo-democrats didn’t count “ballots” for week on end. A number of Democrats in Congress have defected from the pack. It will not take but a few more getting back to sensible legislation to make your speculation prove false. “Governments are moving ahead, including in the US.” Drill Baby DRILL !! cheaper cleaner energy Liar. “The wind and sun are free!” — Nitpick Nick Stokes Over their short life time from mining to disposal, wind and solar are one of the most polluting forms of electricity there is. The amount of mining and highly toxic chemicals used in their production is horrendous. They then decimate whole environments, farmland and avian critters in their installation and use. Then at end of their short life have to be disposed of in dump sites, leave huge lumps of concrete in the ground And they are not clean! Oh dear still falling for that furphy. So MAL-EDUCATED and gullible. SOLAR DOES NOT WORK AT NIGHT Are you so dumb that you don’t realise that? It is almost totally absent at peak electricity usage. All it is is a parasitic supply available only when the sun shines. Everywhere that wind and solar infect the grid.. …. electricity prices SKYROCKET. ! And you STILL haven’t answered the question… 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. OK, shillboi, see if you can answer this: What material is vital for the production of steel, glass, silicon, etc. from raw ores? And the IEA is a much bigger liar than you. N.B. shillboi ran away from answering. The answer is coal and petroleum. Energy is vital for their production. Did you sleep through the science class that explained the different forms of energy? Are you claiming it is possible to manufacture steel with wind turbines? Fool. As usual, Karlomonte seems to be the fool: “Yes, steel can be made with electricity: You quote the International Energy Agency? Try finding a credible source. You are deep into your Denial Silo — denial of peer reviewed science, now denial of reliable sources, and embrace of junk science. Another moronic comment from the beetroot. Your insults further erode what minimal credibility you once had. Read that. First it is IEA, which is a propaganda arm of the UN. Second, their analysis is terribly flawed. Third, LCOE has many unqualified assumptions, one of which is how long an energy producing system functions at 100% and excludes MTBF. https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Solar-Is-Cheapest-Energy-Source-Says-IEA.html It is also BY FAR the most polluting of all electricity supply options. It’s truly one of the most filthy industrial processes ever invented. The mining, acid leaching, high tonnage coal use for heat treatment and smelting with associated fumes and silicosis disease from dusts and much more makes solar manufacturing one of the filthiest processes ever. It costs 3x more to recycle than landfill, so recycling is nearly non-existent. The toxic heavy metals leach out over time. The first step in cleaning silica to produce metallurgical grade silicon is to rinse it with a mixture of one part acid to one part water This process is called acid leaching and is used to remove impurities such as iron, aluminium, and calcium from the silica. The purified silica is then heated with carbon in the form of coal or charcoal in an electrode arc furnace at a temperature of 1500-2000°C to produce metallurgical grade silicon that is 98% pure.. Some of the solvents used are hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid possibly in combination with each other as a solvent for purification of MG-Si. You are POLLUTION WORSHIPPER….. disgusting !! You are absolutely correct, silicon wafer production is not an easy task. Bullshit, from a bullshitter. So now you are quoting a source that quotes IEA. Peer reviewed? Not. In fact, you did not even read it. LOL. I read it. It is contrary to your stubborn position. Some key points in that oilprice article: “Substantial cost related to renewables that gets overlooked on a regular basis is the need for storage capacity to offset the intermittency problem.” “But what the LCOE formula does not account for is the fact that wind and solar do not generate electricity around the clock. That’s one major cost that is getting overlooked.” “Another substantial cost related to renewables that gets overlooked on a regular basis is the need for storage capacity to offset the intermittency problem.” “First, there is no such storage capacity available that could solve the problem in its entirety, and this already means solar is not as cheap as suggested by its LCOE. Second, available storage technology is rather expensive, piling on more additional costs, also overlooked by the LCOE formula.” BOTTOM LINE: “The reason that the IEA has reached that conclusion is a simple one: cost assumptions. It is based on cost assumptions for solar power generation costs versus fossil fuel costs by the International Energy Agency, an enthusiastic cheerleader for a complete energy transition to a wind, solar, and hydrogen dominated grid, who has concluded that solar is the cheapest form of energy available.” “The transition to cheaper cleaner energy is all good“ Which is why electricity prices SKYROCKET everywhere the infection of wind and solar gets too big. 😉 New AI in the USA will mean a HUGE increase in GAS, and nuclear… … and coal is also likely to make a big resurgence. Wind and solar are totally useless for this purpose. It is neither cheaper nor is it cleaner. So Beeton is gaslighting? Who could have ever guessed? That is a categorically false statement. You are ignoring reality. Its is totally TRUE. You are just too dumb to realise you are doing it. Cite with a link the peer reviewed science paper that refutes my statement. I double dog dare you! Cheaper? Cleaner? Not when one includes the lifecycle costs and the total cost of ownership, which includes disposal of use, non-recyclable materials. From the electronic bible… The iron shall lie down with the lamp Climate change is not a problem, they have a crisis of faith Running an industrial society on wind and solar will require science fiction level storage, something with the performance of Robert Heinlein’s Shipstones. A major plot element in “Friday” was that the trade secret was so valuable the various factions of the Shipstone Trust run that fictional society. A note to various investment companies:it is fiction. Thanks for the Heinlein reference. I was not aware of that when I mentioned that AI would require dependable energy “in science-fiction-like quantities.” “These two former economic powerhouses currently receive over 40% of their electricity from renewables.” Really? I kinda doubt it- other than some rare moments. I don’t know- somebody here can nail it down. It is actually about correct. Go to https://ourworldindata.org/energy Scroll down to the selection boxes about half way down, and click “Electricity Mix” Find the graph which has a tab saying “edit countries and regions”, deselect ‘World’ and select the country you want to look at. You should get a chart where you can read of the values for each type of electricity supply, and be able to do some quick calculation. Bear in mind though… both the UK and Germany are teetering on the edge of collapse energy-wise and are destroying all their manufacturing base because of very high electricity prices. They are on their way to third world status. Anglo-Saxons are practically there … Practically, but.., ‘Strained’ Keir Starmer badly needs holiday, his friends say as they reveal PM is suffering from the ‘relentless strain’ of the job https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14217547/Strained-Keir-Starmer-badly-needs-holiday.html Snowflake PM For the UK, number is actually 43% https://www.cladcodecking.co.uk/blog/post/renewable-energy-percentage-uk and for Germany 52% https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/renewables-cover-more-half-germanys-electricity-demand-first-time-year#:~:text=Clean%20Energy%20Wire,-, according to these two sources. Even if these numbers are too high, the wind and solar contribution is large enough to have put both countries in jeopardy from Dunkelflaute in November and again in the past 10 days, after I wrote the piece. There is a very simple solution to our energy conundrum, we know big tech, AI and related industries need outrageous amounts of power. If we want a reliable and plentiful source of energy we put them last in line for the power. In other words if there is a danger of a brown out or black out they are the first to have to cut back. The health and wellbeing of the citizen comes before anything else. If we demanded this new fossil fuel and nuclear generators would start popping up everywhere and the big tech/AI guys would be standing in line to help finance them. As for the government and outfits like Blackrock they can go to hell. We don’t much care what they think. Also, maybe, those with the larger demand should pay more per unit because they’re putting a strain on the system. Yes, they should pay more. In Virginia, the legislature is considering changing the cost allocation formula to put more of the burden on data centers instead of spreading the costs across all rate payers. Is that the Virginia that plans to import lots of coal, gas and nuclear powered electricity from out of state ?? Virginia is basically surrounded by Republican states. I hope they say.. “If you want the data centre, the you provide the electricity for it.” That will force Virginia to build new COAL, GAS or NUCLEAR power stations. That would be fun to watch 🙂 Or, require the data centers to build their own power plant. If the data centers pay more for energy, then data center users pay more. Those users then pass their higher costs on and on and on. Either way, the common folk foot the bill. This is econ 101. Joseph, I don’t want them treated different in any way so long as they see to it that new fossil fuel and nuclear generators are built. I would hope that since they are so dependent on reliable and available energy that they would build plenty for all of us. Germany and UK are moving steadily toward economic oblivion. BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen are all facing losses with massive slump in profitability. It is not possible to combine 2,500kg of exotic materials in a way that makes any motor vehicle suitable for the masses. They are creating engineering monstrosities unfit for purpose. A motor vehicle weighing 2,500kg capable of carry 4 people and luggage – say 500kg payload. The Ford Model T weighed 750kg and could transport 750kg if needed. It was a useful vehicle. . Great for woke virtue-seeking though !! “AMD’s new series scales from eight cores up to the $14,813 192-core / 384-thread EPYC 9965, a 500W behemoth that leverages TSMC’s 3nm node for the ultimate in compute density with dense Zen 5c cores.” A building full of these for a super-computer will require several nuclear generators Quick…. build the solar farm to drive it. 😉 Conventional data centers consume about 300-400 watts per sq ft. AI will increase that number 3x or 4x, or more. And that will require solid reliable electricity supply Are you ADVOCATING GAS or Nuclear ? Even a nil-educated monkey like you must know that wind and solar can never provide. He is the co-founder of the Prince William Virginia Chapter of Citizens Climate Lobby and teaches the science of energy and climate change to continuing education students in Northern Virginia. Is this you ? That’s a collection of uneducated brain-washed students in the making !! No hope for their future , thanks to this low level indoctrination. Really sad. The IEA estimates that data centres total electricity consumption could reach the equivalent of the electricity consumption of Japan by 2026. IEA ‘Electricity 2024 Analysis and forecast to 2026’ (Jan 2024) Ok. Cite with a link the peer reviewed science report that backs up your claim. And it is also high time that investors let them know that they will no longer entrust their capital to those who refuse to see that AI lions cannot live on peekaboo sunshine and the whimsy of the wind. Or, investors should recognize that an AI stock market bubble is growing and will eventually burst. I want to put my money into self-driving cars! Then sell them to gullible Democrats and AGW-cultists. 🙂 What could possibly go wrong !! 😉 The future of AI investments was outside the scope of my piece. See this Goldman Sachs report, in particular the comments by Acemoglu and Covello https://www.goldmansachs.com/images/migrated/insights/pages/gs-research/gen-ai–too-much-spend%2C-too-little-benefit-/TOM_AI%202.0_ForRedaction.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at?ref=wheresyoured.at Half of what most people think about AI is true and the other half not. The true part is that it is artificial. As for renewable, green, net zero, climate protecting, sustainable, energy systems, the only true part is that they are tenuously connected somehow to the idea of energy.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Edge Computing Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP) stands against other best edge computing stocks to invest in according to analysts. Tech stocks have definitely grabbed the spotlight in the tech world, especially with the rise of generative AI. But there’s more to the sector that could be worth investors’ attention. Edge computing, for example, is another area within tech that’s primed for significant growth. Also known as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) or Multi-Access Edge Computing, edge computing aims to bring computing power closer to where data is generated instead of relying solely on centralized cloud systems. Sometimes called the “Third Act of the Internet” by the Linux Foundation, edge computing changes the game by moving data storage and processing closer to local network points. This shift is a major step in how we handle and interact with information. A new forecast from the IDC, global spending on edge computing is projected to hit $228 billion in 2024, reflecting a 14% increase from 2023. This figure covers combined spending by enterprises and service providers on hardware, software, professional services, and provisioned services for edge solutions. The forecast predicts continued strong growth through 2028, with spending expected to approach $378 billion, driven by a robust double-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This growth is driven by the increasing demand for localized network infrastructure and computing power, fueled by the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT)—a network of connected devices. As more data is generated at the endpoints, the traditional network structure faces more strain. The rollout of 5G, which offers higher bandwidth and the ability to support more connected devices, is boosting IoT and driving the need for edge computing. At the same time, AI-optimized processors are providing the computing power necessary to expand the use of edge systems. The automotive industry is a great example of how edge computing and AI are driving rapid advancements. As cars increasingly adopt self-driving features, these technologies have become crucial for making real-time decisions and responses. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global edge computing market, valued at $10.11 billion in 2023, is expected to grow from $13.66 billion in 2024 to a staggering $181.96 billion by 2032, reflecting a CAGR of 38.2%. This rapid expansion is driven by the increasing adoption of edge devices, such as mobile point-of-sale kiosks and smart cameras, as well as computational infrastructure enabling real-time data analysis at the source. Similarly, PwC had predicted that the global market for edge data centers will nearly triple, rising from $4 billion in 2017 to $13.5 billion in 2024. This growth is fueled by the ability of localized data centers to reduce latency, manage intermittent connections, and deliver storage and computational power closer to end-users. To create our list of the top edge computing stocks to invest in according to analysts, we reviewed various stock screeners and ETFs, selecting companies based on their upside potential as of December 17. The stocks are ranked by their average upside potential, from lowest to highest, according to price targets. We also included data on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in these stocks, based on Insider Monkey’s Q3 hedge fund data. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An engineer typing on a computer, developing the latest cybersecurity application. Average Analyst Upside: 10.83% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32 Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP) specializes in developing, designing, and marketing enterprise software, offering services such as threat prevention, web security, security management, and software-defined protection. The company has also enhanced its Harmony SASE offering by integrating its proprietary SD-WAN and IoT security capabilities, streamlining the management of secure access service edge solutions. In Q3 2024, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP) introduced its AI-powered Quantum Firewall R82 and reported a 7% year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching $635 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share rose 9% to $2.25, while subscription revenue grew by 12%. Additionally, the company’s $186 million acquisition of Cyberint is expected to bolster its security operations capabilities. Following these results, Barclays revised its outlook on Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP), lowering its price target from $210 to $200 but maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock. Barclays predicts high single-digit growth for Q4 2024, reflecting the inclusion of delayed deals, while setting expectations for approximately 5% growth in FY 2025, noting tougher year-over-year comparisons for Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP). Ariel Global Fund stated the following regarding Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Israeli based provider of products for information technology security, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP) also advanced following solid quarterly earnings results. Double-digit billings growth was particularly strong across geographies. Consumers appear to be adopting more pillars of Check Point’s platform and engaging in larger strategic commitments with Infinity and Quantum Force. The company also announced the appointment of new CEO Nadav Zafrir, whose reputation is well established in the cyber community. Meanwhile, Check Point continues to be an astute steward of capital, pursuing organic growth and utilizing surplus cash to return capital to shareholders. We continue to favor the company’s exposure to the fast-growing cloud security market and its industry leading profitability.” Overall, CHKP ranks 9th on our list of best edge computing stocks to invest in according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CHKP, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CHKP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. On December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss his playbook for 2025. Following two years of significant gains, his playbook suggests an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market next year. Lee anticipates that the S&P 500 will rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025, before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This reflects an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, which is consistent with historical averages for stock market returns. In terms of Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimates Lee projects EPS for the S&P 500 at $260 in 2025 while estimating $300 for 2026. This is slightly below the consensus estimates from Wall Street, which average around $268 for 2025. READ ALSO: 11 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Right Now and 11 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now. Explaining his investment thesis, Lee pointed towards several themes that could drive the market in 2025. He predicts a "tale of two halves," where the first half of the year will see stronger market performance due to factors like Federal Reserve policies and business-friendly initiatives under President Trump. Conversely, he expects a pullback in the second half, reflecting historical trends after strong consecutive years. He sees potential in small-cap stocks, which have underperformed relative to large-cap stocks historically. Lee also talked about the mega caps that are leading. He mentioned that investors reach for these companies when there is even slight risk in the market. Secondly, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. With the December cut in effect, the market is bullish for tech, thereby further solidifying the investment case for megacaps. Despite his generally positive outlook, Lee acknowledges several risks that could impact market performance.

What started as an online book-selling venture in the 1990s is now a major e-commerce, streaming, and cloud technology giant. Over the past 5 years, the company has grown its top and bottom line by 18% and 34%, respectively. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, it generated $158.9 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) generates significant revenue, around 60% from its North American segment, which comprises mainly its e-commerce operations. However, its AWS segment takes the lead in terms of profitability. During the recent quarter, the AWS segment contributed $10.4 billion to the company’s total operating income of $17.4 billion. Management has been making significant strides in its cloud services through strategic initiatives aimed at improving customer experience. It recently launched the Oracle Database@AWS service, which allows customers to migrate their Oracle workloads to AWS infrastructure with minimal changes to their databases or applications. In addition, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also entered into a collaboration with Databricks, a leader in data analytics and AI. This partnership focuses on accelerating the development of custom AI models using Databricks Mosaic AI on AWS.

(NASDAQ:AMZN): Amazon’s Q2 2024 results missed consensus revenue expectations slightly while beating EPS expectations nicely. Revenue grew 10.0%, including continued reacceleration in AWS (Amazon Web Services) which grew 19%; however, North American and International ecommerce revenue growth both showed slight deceleration in their growth rates from prior quarters. Advertising revenues grew 20%, which decelerated a bit from prior quarters as well. Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. On December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss his playbook for 2025. Following two years of significant gains, his playbook suggests an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market next year. Lee anticipates that the S&P 500 will rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025, before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This reflects an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, which is consistent with historical averages for stock market returns. In terms of Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimates Lee projects EPS for the S&P 500 at $260 in 2025 while estimating $300 for 2026. This is slightly below the consensus estimates from Wall Street, which average around $268 for 2025. READ ALSO: 11 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Right Now and 11 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now. Explaining his investment thesis, Lee pointed towards several themes that could drive the market in 2025. He predicts a "tale of two halves," where the first half of the year will see stronger market performance due to factors like Federal Reserve policies and business-friendly initiatives under President Trump. Conversely, he expects a pullback in the second half, reflecting historical trends after strong consecutive years. He sees potential in small-cap stocks, which have underperformed relative to large-cap stocks historically. Lee also talked about the mega caps that are leading. He mentioned that investors reach for these companies when there is even slight risk in the market. Secondly, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. With the December cut in effect, the market is bullish for tech, thereby further solidifying the investment case for megacaps. Despite his generally positive outlook, Lee acknowledges several risks that could impact market performance. For instance, he thinks the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Moreover, the implementation of tariffs could adversely affect economic conditions and corporate profits. Lee pointed out that historical patterns suggest that after two years of substantial gains, markets often experience declines in the latter half of the third year.

Number of Hedge Funds: 279 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a leading technology company that ranks 2nd on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. It is known for a wide range of devices, software, and services. Some of the core offerings by the company include productivity software including Microsoft Office and Azure, the Windows operating system, and Gaming devices such as Xbox consoles. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is leading the AI transformation through its intelligent cloud, Azure, and its advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tool, Copilot. During the fiscal first quarter results of 2025, the company generated $65.6 billion in revenue, up 16% year-over-year. The growth was on the back of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $38.9 billion in revenue, up 22%. The segment was driven by Azure which led the server products and cloud services revenue to increase 23%. Management noted that Azure Arc now has over 39,000 customers across every industry, up more than 80% year-over-year. In addition to its cloud business, the AI business is taking significant leaps forward. Management during the call highlighted that its AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter, making it the fastest business to reach the milestone in Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) history. On November 17, the company announced that it is collaborating with Accenture and Avanade to help businesses transform their operations using advanced technologies like generative AI and Microsoft’s Copilot tools. The partnership is expected to further enhance its product offerings, increasing customer engagement and driving financial growth for the company. RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT): MSFT was a top detractor in the third quarter following a fiscal fourth quarter earnings report that featured inline operating metrics but mixed guidance. Positively, the company reported strong revenue (+15%) and earnings growth (+10%), powered by Azure (+30%), and operating margins of 43%. Guidance however calls for lower than expected fiscal first quarter Azure revenue as infrastructure constraints limit growth, and higher capital expenditures throughout the company’s fiscal 2025 to alleviate these constraints. The company expects growth to reaccelerate in the back half of fiscal 2025 as more AI capacity comes online. Overall, MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Artificial intelligence is a major cornerstone of its cloud technology. In October, the company introduced Agentforce, a groundbreaking platform designed to create and manage autonomous AI agents.

We exited our position in Salesforce to fund better opportunities in Shopify and MSCI.

Title: $73 Million Exodus: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Suffers Record-Breaking Outflow

Time Published: 2024-12-22T15:30:30Z

A major player in the cryptocurrency market found itself on an unusual side of history after experiencing its largest outflows in months. The leading asset manager BlackRock ended the inflow streak of its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund after recording a $72.7 million worth of outflow on December 20. Data showed that BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) witnessed the largest outflow since it was launched in January this year. According to Farside Investors, the global asset manager’s Bitcoin ETF posted an outflow of 72.7 million in December, the highest on record for IBIT. They added that this came a day after IBIT registered zero flows, making investors anxious about the exchange-traded fund. IBIT is not alone as fellow ETF issuer Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also hit an all-time high outflow of $208.5 million on December 19, a day before IBIT hit the same ordeal. Analysts said that the following day, December 20, FBTC recorded another outflow of about $71.9 million, making the EFT suffer a two-day outflow streak. IBIT and FBTC are among the top performing exchange-traded funds in the United States. The ETF issuers were ranked 1 and 2 among the top 25 ETFs in terms of assets after one month in the market. Market observers said that the US Spot Bicoin ETF market’s record-high two consecutive day outflow was fueled by the all-time high outflows experienced by BlackRock and Fidelity. Data showed that the ETF market lost $671.9 million on December 19 and another $277 million in outflows the next day, December 20. The massive outflows experienced by the two of the biggest ETF issuers in the US sparked concerns from crypto investors on what could be the outlook for the ETFs in the upcoming months. However, analysts believed that the ordeal faced by BlackRock and Fidelity should not surprise traders since both international asset management firms have largely accounted for the large inflows. Some investors are concerned that recent development in ETFs might become a turning point that could lead to substantive decrease in the institutional investors’ appetite for Bitcoin exposure. Market observers argued that outflows might not linger, adding that after Bitcoin plummeted to $92,710 earlier, the alpha crypto has been bouncing back and moving up again. Trading analysts said that Bitcoin’s market volume dipped to $59.50 billion, a 52% decline in its total volume, contradicting the bullish run enjoyed by the crypto after Donald Trump won the US election last month. During the crypto bull run, Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $108,000 per coin in November. In the same month, the US spot Bitcoin ETF also benefited from the crypto bull market after hitting a record-high of $6.2 billion in net inflows. As of press time, Bitcoin is traded at $95,359 per coin, down by 1.3% in the last 24 hours, with a total market capitalization of $1.9 trillion.

Title: Retire On $460,000 In 2025 With This Simple 7-Fund Portfolio
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/12/22/retire-on-460k-in-2025-with-this-simple-7-fund-portfolio/
Time Published: 2024-12-22T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Happy senior couple relaxing on deck chairs at beach The suits on Wall Street will say that $460K isn’t enough to retire on. Well, that “modest” nest egg will earn $64,860 in dividends alone when invested in this simple 7-CEF portfolio. CEFs are the code name for closed-end funds. They are a lesser-known cousin to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. CEFs tend to have modest assets under management. Which is their superpower. Fewer assets mean greater yields! Consider the 7-CEF portfolio we are about to discuss versus the standard high-yield stock benchmark ETF: CEF High Yields There is no comparison! But before we buy blindly, let’s do our homework and make sure these CEFs are not paper payout tigers. After all, a double-digit yield isn’t much good if it is soon chopped to single digits. Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA, 10.2% distribution rate) is as much of a straight shooter as we could want. This equity CEF, launched in 1987, provides a 60/40 blend of value/growth through roughly 145 stock picks selected by five teams of managers—three value-oriented and two growth-oriented. The top of the portfolio will look S&P 500-esque; names such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) get top billing, ensuring we’re still getting exposure to tech megatrends like artificial intelligence. But other firms—such as Fresenius Medical Care (FMS), S&P Global (SPGI), and Capital One (COF)—enjoy much more weight than they do in the index. Despite a value lean, USA is surprisingly competitive. Importantly, USA isn’t leaning on leverage or options to generate that 10%-plus yield—that’s a combination of income, capital gains, and occasionally, return of capital. USA’s distribution policy is to pay out four quarterly installments of 2.5% of the fund’s net asset value, so payouts will float around a little bit. This does mean that from a pure price-performance perspective, Liberty All-Star doesn’t look nearly as good—but distributions cover that gap. A small 1.5% discount to NAV doesn’t seem like much compared to other closed-end funds, but that’s common for USA. In fact, its five-year average discount is a mere 0.5%. I won’t spend much time on Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR, 11.4% distribution rate), which I highlighted in a recent review of double-digit bond ideas, but its massive monthly yield warrants a mention here. Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund is a well-diversified portfolio of 430 corporate floating-rate bonds that leans heavily into junk (90% of assets are invested in below-investment-grade debt). Unlike USA, it puts the pedal to the debt metal, using a high 38% leverage to boost its picks—and that has worked in its favor with a wild 25% return over the past year. Just beware: This Nuveen CEF’s discount has all but evaporated. Western Asset Diversified Income (WDI, 12.1% distribution rate), a Franklin Templeton CEF, holds a wide array of debt investments. Commercial junk is the anchor of this fund, at about 40% of the portfolio, but WDI also provides exposure to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), bank loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), investment-grade credit, emerging-market sovereigns, asset-backed securities (ABSs) and more. And this CEF also boasts access to private debt “not typically available through traditional mutual funds.” Credit quality is low, and leverage is high, resulting in a spectacular 12%-plus annual rate on its monthly distribution—and an interesting history for this relatively young fund (inception June 2021). There’s not much history here, valuation-wise, but its current 4% discount is slimmer than its three-year average (9%). Also note that WDI is a term trust that will liquidate on or about June 24, 2033. Another term-limited CEF with a wild yield is the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ, 13.4% distribution rate). This fund buys predominantly mid- and small-cap companies that are, well, “innovative” and that management believes have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Holdings include the likes of Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but also private investments (which it folds under cryptic names like “Project Picasso”). Obviously, these innovative companies aren’t paying out dividends. Instead, BIGZ generates income by selling covered calls within the portfolio. Distributions have historically been entirely return of capital. And these big distributions are effectively mandated—BIGZ has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. BIGZ is also subject to a discount management program. If this CEF trades at a discount greater than 7.5% during any of four three-month measurement periods, the fund will offer a repurchase of 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a valuation of 98% of NAV. This program will run through March 31, 2025, and could be extended by the fund’s board. From publicly available info, it looks like BIGZ could hit that mark for the Oct. 1-Dec. 31 measurement period, and it currently trades at a nearly 11% discount to NAV. Just remember: “Discount” does not mean “value.” BIGZ’s strategy has been a disaster so far. While the fund is at least on an upswing now, it’s still undershooting a basic tech index. We can get our dividends from around the globe, too. And few international funds offer a yield as scintillating as The India Fund (IFN, 13.7% distribution rate). No options, and no leverage here. IFN is a straightforward Abrdn equity fund with a singular focus on the world’s second-largest country. It’s a tight portfolio, with just 45 components. Financials, such as ICICI Bank (IBN) and HDFC Bank (HDB), have long been prominent and currently make up a quarter of the portfolio. They’re followed by roughly 10% allocations in industrials and information technology. Again, distributions here are rarely made of dividend income—here, they’re almost always capital gains. But investors should have no complaints. One last note on IFN: It’s trading at a roughly 11% discount to NAV. While this is in line with its historical norms, it’s a welcome departure from the past couple of years, which saw IFN trade at slimmer discounts and even premiums at times. Abrdn Income Credit Strategies Fund (ACP, 15.7% distribution rate) is a global corporate junk fund. Roughly 30% of assets are invested in U.S. high-yield, with the remaining 70% scattered across the U.K., Luxembourg, Germany and more. Maturities are in line with comparable index funds—85% in 0-5 years, and most of the rest in 5-10 years. Credit quality is junkier, though, with 60% of assets in B-rated bonds and 23% in CCC-rated debt. (It shows, too—the monthly dole has dropped twice since 2020.) Leverage is moderate at close to 15%, but this is still an aggressive fund that rides like a roller coaster. That leads to mixed productivity, but ACP can be useful over shorter time periods. Currently, this CEF might be nearing one of those useful inflection points, as its discount to NAV has widened to about 9%—well above its five-year average discount of just 1%. Investors seeking out a more complete portfolio will find that in the BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust (BCAT, 22.1% distribution rate), another term trust that will dissolve on or about Sept. 27, 2032. They’ll also find one of the highest yields on Wall Street—a fat 20%-plus distribution that has already improved twice since the fund launched in 2020. BCAT is an allocation fund that provides a roughly 55/45 split of stocks and bonds. It uses little leverage (5%), but it does sell covered calls—generating a boatload of income, though the end result is that the lion’s share of distributions end up being return of capital. This CEF struggled mightily in its first two-plus years of trading, but it has fared much better during the second post-COVID bull market. The turnaround is a welcome one for shareholders, though most might be second-guessing just how much stability this balanced portfolio can really provide. BCAT belongs to the same discount management plan as BIGZ, and has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 20% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. How long BCAT will continue to enjoy these support programs is unknown. And would-be investors get to wonder what’s next from this Jekyll-and-Hyde fund, whose meteoric run has also narrowed the discount from nearly 20% in 2023 to just 6% today.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Small Cap EV Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) stands against the other small-cap EV stocks. The global electric vehicle (EV) market continues to expand, driven by the need for sustainable transportation and advancements in technology. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nearly 14 million electric cars were sold worldwide in 2023, marking a 35% increase from the previous year, with 95% of these sales occurring in China, Europe, and the United States. This surge brought the total number of electric vehicles on the road to 40 million. Electric cars represented about 18% of all car sales in 2023, up from 14% in 2022 and just 2% in 2018. The growth is primarily driven by battery electric vehicles, which made up 70% of the electric car stock in 2023. The electric vehicle market is expected to expand rapidly as consumer demand for cleaner transportation grows. Electric car sales are expected to rise to about 17 million in 2024, which would be an increase of over 20% compared to 2023. Electric vehicles could make up more than 20% of all car sales in 2024. This forecast is supported by current trends, government policies, and the usual seasonal patterns seen in EV sales. China remains the largest market for electric vehicles, accounting for nearly 60% of new electric car registrations in 2023. Europe follows with approximately 25%, and the United States accounts for around 10%. READ ALSO: 12 Best RV and Camping Stocks To Buy Now and 8 Undervalued Insurance Stocks To Invest In. There is significant potential for growth in emerging markets, where EV adoption is taking off. We could soon see a shift from early adopters to mass-market consumers. The introduction of new models and innovations, such as improved battery technologies and charging solutions, will play a crucial role in this transition. Additionally, government policies and incentives continue to support the transition to electric mobility, further fueling demand. To compete with China in the EV market, the US is focusing on localizing its EV supply chain and increasing production capacity. Reuters reported on October 22 that US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm announced that the Department of Energy is quickly working to finalize $1.7 billion in grants aimed at converting automotive plants for electric vehicle production. This funding will help automakers change their existing facilities to make electric vehicles and their components. With continued advancements, investments, and increasing acceptance among consumers, the future looks promising for the electric vehicles market. To compile our list of the 11 best small-cap EV stocks to invest in, we reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best small-cap EV stocks. Please note that we defined small-cap stocks as those with a market capitalization between $500 million and $10 billion. From an initial pool of more than 20 small-cap EV stocks that met our criteria, we focused on the top 11 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 11 best small-cap EV stocks to invest in are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Ethereum whales buy the dip as most metrics signal end of correction. Ethereum’s ([ETH] whale activity contrasted with its price, showing significant buying during the downturn. Over three days, whales acquired 340,000 ETH, valued over $1 billion, suggesting strategic bulk purchases during price dips. This pattern against a backdrop of general crypto declines, sparked speculation about potential market rebound. Source: Ali/X The activity aligned with historical patterns where substantial buys often precede market recoveries. This hinted that ETH might soon experience a price increase if this trend holds true. Ethereum weekly chart indicated a potential completion of its correction. The price successively retested the Tenkan and Kijun lines of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator, suggesting a stabilization. Further signs of support were evident as ETH interacted with the Kumo Cloud’s Senkou Span A, seen as a preliminary resistance turned support. Source: Titan of Crypto/X Additionally, the lagging span retraced to its Tenkan line, reinforcing the resilience of current price levels. Despite these bullish signals, there remained caution with a possible retest of the Kumo Cloud’s Senkou Span B. If Ethereum’s price approaches this line, it would likely signify a critical test of market sentiment and strength. Again, the Long Term Trend Directions (LTTD) score the year could end at a strong bullish level of 0.82, suggesting a positive long-term outlook. Despite a brief dip in mid-year, the LTTD returned to bullish territory. Ethereum started a consistent climb, coinciding with the LTTD score maintaining above 0.5, indicating sustained buyer interest. Source: X The sharp decline in the LTTD score in July corresponded with a price drop, showing a short-term bearish phase. However, the quick recovery in LTTD by October and a corresponding price rise suggested the correction phase ended, and ETH was resuming its long-term upward trend. However, Ethereum ETFs experienced notable outflows, with BlackRock’s ETHA seeing the largest ever, around $103.7 million, during a week marked by market declines. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs also witnessed their most significant outflow since inception, totaling around $671.9 million. This reversal ended two consecutive weeks of inflows for both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Source: SpotOnChain Notably, despite the outflows, BlackRock accumulated substantial positions, adding 13.7K BTC valued at $1.45 billion and 33.9K ETH worth $143.7 million. These movements indicated significant shifts in ETF dynamics, reflecting broader market sentiments and potentially setting the stage for future trends in cryptocurrency investments.

Title: Social Impact Leadership: How To Walk The Talk In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pklein/2024/12/22/social-impact-leadership-how-to-walk-the-talk-in-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-22T13:35:06Z

LinkedIn Head of Social Impact Meg Garlinghouse (L) with LinkedIn Business Leadership Program ... [+] Associate Eva Scarano (R) on January 22, 2018 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Kelly Sullivan/Getty Images for LinkedIn) Employees, consumers, and investors will soon start demanding proof of social impact. Performative efforts from businesses will no longer be tolerated and walking the talk will become non-negotiable. The social and environmental implications of this year’s political reversal of power have already started to take effect. “In January 2023 three out of four leaders would have said their companies were supportive of DEI,” said Daryl Brewster of CEO Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose (CECP) “A year later, it was one out of four, and three out of four were saying, my number one job is explaining what this is all about, and how it relates to the business.” The election campaign of former President Donald Trump was a de facto referendum against DEI and ESG. During the campaign, corporations including Walmart, Boeing, Ford, and Lowe’s, announced plans to scrap or step back from DEI-related initiatives. BlackRock, the world’s largest investment firm, significantly reduced its support for shareholder proposals addressing environmental and social issues. Project 2025 calls for an end to American climate leadership on the international stage. Businesses have faced relentless scrutiny over their inability to translate social and environmental commitments into tangible outcomes. Research during 2024 revealed the gap between corporate intentions and social impact. According to the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer, 63% of respondents believe businesses are failing to deliver on their social impact promises. Over seven in ten employees surveyed believe that there is a gap between what their company says about social responsibility and how their company behaves, according to Accelerating a Just Transition, a new report from Globescan and Ashoka. Despite what many people predict will be a pullback on progressive social change, some corporate and civil society leaders believe this is the beginning of a new era for business and social impact. One that is characterized by companies taking meaningful action to improve the lives of employees and citizens. “What's coming is an opportunity for us to innovate in the CSR, ESG and DEI space because this is the first time we've really been pressure tested, challenged in our thinking about something that affects so many people,” said Muneer Panjwani, CEO of Engage for Good. To get an informed perspective on what the future will look like for business and social impact, I turned to Brewster, Panjwani, Ryan Gellert, CEO of Patagonia, and Dave Stever, CEO of Ben & Jerry’s. The collective perspective of these leaders contributed to 10 priorities that can help more companies walk the talk and become social impact leaders. “When a company becomes legally accountable to its stakeholders—workers, communities, customers, suppliers and the environment—’walking the talk’ becomes a default. Our work on the B Corp Impact Assessment helped us identify our strengths and blind spots and ensured thoroughness when looking at how we operate as a business,” said Gellert. Walking the talk also means bringing social impact into every aspect of businesses including employee engagement, supply chains, how products are developed and the materials that are being used. Panjwani believes companies need to be smarter about integrating social impact into their business and gave the example of Macy's Mission Every One approach as an example of a company that involves every leader and employee in social impact. In today’s highly polarized context, employees and consumers have taken opposing sides with respect to how specific populations have been prioritized over others. “We’re entering a moment where people are being questioned on their social impact work,” said Panjwani. He recommends continuing the work but reframing it with accuracy and honesty that includes all people. “One of the ways people feel excluded is when they feel like their identity and lived experience doesn't matter,” said Panjwani. “We need to address areas that are priorities for all political sides such as taking care of your workers, having a safe place to work, and being paid a fair wage,” said Brewster. There are 14 million employees across CECP’s member companies. According to Brewser, listening is one of the hardest things for them to do and also an opportunity to walk the talk. “You have that workforce at your fingertips, listen to them, you have employee resource groups, you have these tools at your disposal, listen to your customers, just get a better sense of what the need is,” said Brewster. He believes that now is the time for leaders to engage and support their employees because they “may not find people on the other side of this, or if they do, they're going to be even more expensive.” Businesses need guidance on how to talk about what they’re doing in real world human terms that can unite people. “What words can be used across your business and with your customers, so they understand what you're doing, and how you're authentically showing up,” said Brewster. “Talk about clean air, talk about reducing your insurance costs, talk about real things that people can understand and have the same thing happen around diversity.” Panjwani observes that there's a communications problem and companies are unsure of the story they should be telling. “DEI work has been framed in a very specific way and I think it's time that we evolved that. To create a broader framing that allows practices to stay as they are, without being called DEI, but focused on their core purpose which is equity-deserving communities.” Partnering with nonprofit organizations can help advance social impact.“A simple way of ensuring your donations are going to vetted organizations is joining a group like 1% for the Planet. Individuals can also visit Patagonia Action Works, our tool to connect people with environmental organizations acting on the most pressing issues facing the world today,” said Gellert. “Whenever corporations work with a non-profit partner their brand reputation benefits because they get access to the organization's knowledge, network and the communities that they serve,” said Panjwani. Gellert believes there are three paths to consider. “First, businesses can work to add solar and wind energy into your power mix. Secondly, you can also take a deeper look into your company’s finances using tools like the Carbon Bankroll to ensure your financial institutions aren’t funding extractive industries and cash flowing the climate crisis. Lastly, put your support behind local, state and federal public policy that advances renewable energy.” Gellert also believes that we are facing an era of deregulation that’s likely to sacrifice the planet’s long-term welfare for short-term profit. “We have the choice as business leaders to act on the planet’s behalf and keep to our environmental commitments whether the government mandates it or not,” said Gellert. “As businesses, we have a voice both in our action and through lobbying to show solidarity in our support for the planet.” It’s also important to move away from anecdotal stories and use data to prove that the business has improved. “For example, if your company is focused on fair hiring practices and equity for employees the benefits are easily quantified,” said Panjwani. “Diverse representation in companies leads to more innovation, more creativity, and improved retention.” Companies can use frameworks from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) that offer standardized metrics for evaluating performance. AI is also creating new opportunities for companies to track progress in real-time and share insights with stakeholders. Disclosure is important, and has become a requirement in many industries and jurisdictions, but it doesn't necessarily result in social impact. “In fact, it may get in the way If it takes staff away from actually implementing the programs,” said Brewster. “Some companies will just pay the fine if it’s less expensive than doing the work. Or move people who are actually doing the work to just reporting on what they’re doing.” Walking the talk means prioritizing doing over disclosing. I believe one of the most authentic ways to walk the talk is by involving stakeholders, including people with lived experience, in determining what issues to focus on and how to take action. Co-creating innovative solutions with customers, employees, and community partners ensures that initiatives are relevant and impactful. For example, IKEA’s "Better Living" initiatives involve collaborating with local communities to promote sustainable living practices while driving product innovation. Dave Stever, CEO of Ben & Jerry’s shared his plans for how the company will be walking the talk in 2025. They embody the priorities outlined above. “To remain vigilant to our values at Ben & Jerry's, we must embed them into every fiber of our operations and supply chain—standing unapologetically for equity, climate justice, and human rights. In the current political climate, there is increased pressure for businesses to temper their voices, but it is precisely in these moments that our voices matter most. Staying true to our principles means fostering transparency, amplifying marginalized voices, and aligning our business practices and 3-part mission with the change we want to see. At the heart of this commitment is courage—courage to take risks, to challenge systemic inequities, and to innovate not just for growth but for good.” I’ve spent 25 years urging major corporations to have meaningful social impact and the results of this work are not nearly good enough. Despite a clear business case for social impact, very few corporations have gone beyond trying to get noticed for doing the bare minimum. This won’t fly anymore. CSR, DEI, and ESG became obsolete in 2024 and there is a new imperative for businesses: to prioritize social impact over greenwashing and social washing and to demonstrate authentic action by walking the talk. “As business leaders, we need to recognize that the climate crisis shouldn’t be minimized into a marketing opportunity,” said Gellert. “So how do we ‘walk the talk’ in business when it comes to societal issues and environmental responsibility? Commit and take a step forward.” “As we navigate 2025, a year charged with political and social currents, companies must commit to being more than profit-driven entities; we must be stewards of progress,” said Stever.

Title: How Bitcoin Became Boring

As a result, bitcoin loses its outsider vibe to gain institutional blessing. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Until now, the phrase crypto winter meant that cryptocurrency traders were facing hard times: a period of tumbling and depressed prices that had to be weathered until the good times returned. Today, though, the cryptocurrency industry is enjoying an end-of-year season more akin to “brat summer”: This month, crypto prices hit previously unheard-of highs, with bitcoin trading above $100,000. In this new Era of Good Feelings—to borrow a phrase from early-19th-century American history—skeptics have become believers, and a digital-economic instrument that was designed to circumvent, if not replace, the traditional financial system is becoming more and more integrated into it. The catalyst for this boom, of course, was last month’s election of Donald Trump. Bitcoin’s price fell this week, but it’s still up almost 40 percent since November 5, and other major cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum and ripple, have seen similar spikes. It’s not hard to see why. Trump nominated Cantor Fitzgerald CEO and crypto enthusiast Howard Lutnick to be his secretary of commerce. He named Paul Atkins, also a crypto advocate, as the next head of the Securities Exchange Commission, replacing Gary Gensler, who became crypto’s bête noire for bringing lawsuits against the biggest crypto exchanges and numerous other players in the industry. And Trump recently repeated his campaign promise to set up a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, which would require the Treasury Department to purchase billions of dollars’ worth of the cryptocurrency and hold it as a “permanent national asset.” On top of the regulatory environment growing markedly more crypto-friendly, other bullish signs have emerged as well. Last week, the investment giant BlackRock, which back in January was one of 10 companies to issue exchange-traded funds tied to bitcoin, released a report suggesting that investors “with suitable governance and risk tolerance” (meaning tolerance for little governance and lots of risk) should consider having as much as 2 percent of their assets in bitcoin. And MicroStrategy, a software company whose business nowadays consists almost entirely of issuing stock and convertible debt in order to buy bitcoin, was just added to the Nasdaq-100 after its stock rose more than 600 percent in the first 10 months of the year. All of the good news has bitcoin owners—also known as HODLers, a moniker derived from a common online typo of hold that was then also said to stand for “hold on for dear life”—feeling buoyant: On X, predictions of bitcoin hitting $1 million by the end of 2025 are easy to find. I first wrote about bitcoin in 2011, when one Bitcoin cost about $14, and even then, I thought it was a bubble. Had I just taken a flyer and bought $1,000 of it, I’d be a multimillionaire today. So for longtime bitcoin skeptics like me, a measure of chagrin at having been so wrong about crypto’s evolution is difficult to avoid. At the same time, what’s been fascinating about the popular embrace of bitcoin is that the reasons to be skeptical of it never disappeared: It’s still an enormously volatile asset; its price is still mostly dependent on sentiment rather than underlying fundamental value; it’s still ill-suited to be a widely used digital currency. What’s changed is that the investment world has decided none of those things really matter. As is true of gold, bitcoin is valuable because people have collectively decided it’s valuable. In effect, HODLers have succeeded in conjuring a respectable asset out of thin air. James Surowiecki: The Trump-whim economy is here Respectability doesn’t mean stability. The history of crypto over the past decade is one of big spikes driven by positive sentiment, rapidly followed by crashes. Bitcoin’s value has fallen by 49 percent or more on at least half a dozen occasions, and there’s no reason to believe that it’s now reached a permanently high plateau. (Indeed, just this past week, after hitting an all-time high of about $108,000, bitcoin’s price fell almost 15 percent in days, and MicroStrategy saw its stock fall more than 40 percent over the past month.) Yet even if determining a fair price for Bitcoin remains a near-impossible task (which is why I’ll never buy it), treating its value as simply the product of a hysterical bubble mentality—which was once a common critique—feels outdated. In keeping with its buccaneering, unregulated origins, the crypto industry is still rife with sketchy so-called memecoins and shitcoins, not to mention promoters promising 1,000 percent returns in a matter of days. But bitcoin itself has become practically blue-chip. The reasons bitcoin has become so highly valued are not the reasons that advocates originally argued would make it valuable. Bitcoin was designed to be a currency that people could use for trustless transactions—transactions that could be carried out without need for a financial intermediary such as a bank. But transactions in which bitcoin is used to buy or sell goods and services make up only a tiny fraction of the currency’s total trading volume, most of which is made up of people buying or selling bitcoin itself. Bitcoin’s real use, it turns out, is not as a medium of exchange, but as a secure, portable, accessible store of value, something that can be quite valuable, particularly in countries where inflation or confiscatory government policy is a problem. Similarly, bitcoin was designed to facilitate decentralized person-to-person transactions, but most bitcoin trading, at least in the West, now takes place on centralized exchanges. Again, in its liberatory promise, bitcoin was supposed to not just be independent of traditional financial institutions and government, but also enable alternatives to them. Yet the big engine of the price boom of the past two years has been bitcoin’s integration into the conventional investment industry (through such vehicles as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs), increased purchases by institutional investors and corporations, and now the prospect of legitimization by the government itself. That may include government buying of bitcoin—though exactly why Uncle Sam would want to own such a volatile asset is a question no one has yet answered persuasively. This integration has a couple of striking consequences. The first is that, for all of its benefits, it also adds a whole new set of risks to an already risky asset—if, say, Trump does not follow through on his promise to set up a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, bitcoin’s price will likely take a tumble. The other, more substantive, consequence is that the revolutionary promise of bitcoin has largely vanished—no one really thinks it will replace, or even meaningfully weaken, fiat currencies such as the dollar, nor is it going to threaten the financial primacy of Wall Street. Cryptocurrencies will always have a special appeal for people who are skeptical of the system and convinced that economic disaster is on the horizon. But what the past six weeks have shown is that most bitcoin HODLers don’t want to bring down the system. They want bitcoin to become a part of it.

Title: Insider Today: Blackstone's holiday cheer

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. You've likely heard the term "supercommuter," but you might have wondered… why? Someone who does it from Washington, DC, to NYC admits she's not sure the job is worth the commute. Still, she's not regretting doing it. On the agenda today: But first: Blackstone's feeling festive. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. Blackstone released its annual holiday video for the seventh consecutive year, which might elicit the reaction: Why is a firm managing $1 trillion worried about holiday videos? The videos — full of self-deprecating jokes and Blackstone-backed product placement (of course) — have become a bit of an annual tradition on Wall Street. Last year's notched 8 million views across platforms, a spokesman told BI. We've got a full rundown and ranking of all seven videos here. Some people are laughing at Blackstone as opposed to with Blackstone, but that's kind of the point. In an industry full of super serious people doing super serious business for super serious clients, Blackstone's willing to make itself the butt of the joke. Ok, yes, there is a business case for the videos. Jay Gillespie, the head of Blackstone's video team and one of the brains behind the holiday extravaganza, spoke to BI's Alex Nicoll about the evolution of his role at the firm. Blackstone's not alone in its outside-the-box approach to marketing on the Street. More firms are getting a bit — to borrow a phrase from my British colleagues — cheeky in pitching themselves to the general public. Take BlackRock, which a few years ago took to social media to make clear it's not Blackstone. (The firms have a long history together and have sometimes lean into the confusion between the two. BlackRock CEO and cofounder Larry Fink made a cameo in Blackstone's holiday video this year: "Can you believe people confuse US for THEM?") Wall Street's marketing frenzy isn't foolproof. For an industry that prides itself on what kind of business you are bringing to a firm, marketing's impact isn't as direct as landing a massive deal or hitting the perfect trade. Wealthy musicians received millions of dollars from the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant, a pandemic relief program intended for struggling independent venues and arts groups. However, stars like Lil Wayne and Chris Brown used the program as a piggy bank to keep the party going, exclusive reporting from BI shows. Thousands of pages of accounting documents reveal how artists directed millions in taxpayer funds toward their own bank accounts, luxury purchases, and entertainment expenses — often outweighing what they spent on touring crew members. How musicians spent the grant money. Luisa Isabel Álvarez de Toledo, a Spanish duchess, devoted much of her life to cataloging the Archive of Medina-Sidonia, a priceless collection that had been in her family for generations. Comprising of 6 million documents, the archive details the secrets of the kings, dukes, and explorers of medieval Spain. After Luisa Isabel died, she left her three children just 743,000 euros. However, the bulk of her estate — and control of the archives — went to the woman she'd married on her deathbed. What ensued after was a bitter legal battle that would shatter the family, captivate Spain, and throw the fate of the archives into doubt. Inside the palace showdown. There is perhaps no real-estate metric more loved — and loathed — than Zillow's automated home valuation tool. The Zestimate draws casual clickers to the site, whether it's to lurk on previous residences, friends' or colleagues' homes, or the value of your neighbor's property against yours. The problem is that the Zestimate is often misguided, and Americans' obsession with it can create crushing reality checks when homes actually hit the market. But that's not a problem for Zillow. Earlier this month, Citigroup welcomed 34 managing directors, marking its biggest class in years. Behind the scenes, however, the bank's promotion process can be political and pit employees against each other, four current and former managing directors told BI. The bank rates its employees on a forced curve, assessing them from best to worst. These rankings influence whether an employee might receive a promotion or lose their bonus. Managing directors break down how it works. This week's quote: "What we're having to speak of already sounds like we're lying — it already sounds like a movie because it's so horrible." — Adria English worked as a dancer at Sean "Diddy" Combs' famous white parties and filed a lawsuit in July accusing him of sex trafficking. Combs has vehemently denied all accusations of sexual assault and sex trafficking.

Title: Is PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) the Best Cookies and Crackers Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Cookies and Crackers Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other cookies and crackers stocks. The global cookie and cracker market was valued at $100.2 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to $122.45 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 3.7% during the forecast period between 2024 and 2030. Region-wise, North America dominates the market with the United States and Canada as its top markets. With significant markets in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, Europe follows. Simultaneously, Asia Pacific is depicting rapid growth with significant market expansion in countries such as China and India. According to Mondelēz International's annual State of Snacking Report 2023, consumers continue to snack strong as 6 in 10 global consumers surveyed for the last 5 years have been consistently of the opinion that they tend to eat many small meals throughout their days instead of few large ones while young people look forward to the snacks in their day, more as compared to the meals. Younger consumers tend to snack once or more a day. Across all ages, the majority have ritualized snack time as they consume a snack at a special moment or time of the day. Consistent snack spending is evident from the fact that two-thirds of consumers have not made significant changes to their spending on snacks although they are more conscious of price. Recently, consumers have cut back spending on non-essential items which has negatively impacted sales for Starbucks and McDonald’s. However, the threat doesn't seem major to the snacking industry as snacking giants still see snacking as a large, attractive, and durable category that continues to grow in importance with consumers. A piece of important news surfacing in the market just before the year's end, as reported by CNBC, is that the Oreo maker has made a preliminary takeover approach for Hershey according to those familiar with the matter. The company had previously made a takeover bid for Hershey in 2016 which Hershey’s board unanimously rejected. The acquisition, if it takes place, is going to result in one of the biggest confectionery companies globally. While the combined business could be a huge deal, the question about it competing against the recent Mars’ acquisition of Kellanova which is expected to materialize in the coming year, is circulating all around. This acquisition is a great deal in the global snacking market as well since it ranks among the top 10 global food and beverage mergers and acquisitions since 1995, as revealed by Dealogic. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 10 best cookies and crackers stocks to buy, we went through stock screeners, relevant ETFs, and media reports to make a list of relevant stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best cookies and crackers stocks to buy have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q3. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a glass of a refreshing carbonated beverage illustrating the company's different beverages. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58 PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a renowned global food and beverage company. The firm offers a complementary portfolio of brands, including Lays, Cheetos, Doritos, Pepsi-Cola, Gatorade, Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream. The firm offers cookies and crackers through its various brands including Grandma's as well as Gamesa, the leading cookie and cracker Hispanic brand in the US grocery channel. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) leverages its global scale and reach to spark joy and create more smiles. The firm’s product portfolio includes a wide range of enjoyable foods and beverages, including many iconic brands that generate over $1 billion each in estimated annual retail sales. PepsiCo’s products are enjoyed by consumers over one billion times a day in more than 200 countries and territories across the globe. The global beverage and convenience food market presents the firm with a promising opportunity to further grow. Despite tough conditions including business disruptions due to rising geopolitical tensions in certain international markets and subdued category performance trends in North America, the firm closed a resilient third quarter of 2024. The quarter was marked with 1.3% organic revenue growth, 110 basis points expansion in core gross margin, and 75 basis points expansion in core operating margin versus the previous year. While consumers remain choiceful and value-conscious due to inflationary pressures, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) continues to accelerate its existing productivity programs by expanding automation at its plants, warehouses, and distribution centers, advancing digitalization across its organization, maximizing labor efficiencies, and minimizing areas of waste. While a strong pipeline of productivity initiatives is in place, the firm expects inflationary pressures to moderate versus the preceding year. Although the firm has been through multiple challenges since 2019, the long-term resilience of its categories and businesses is evident from the fact its net revenue has grown to more than $90 billion and it remains on track to deliver more than 45 percent core USD earnings per share growth in 2024 versus 2019. Overall PEP ranks 2nd on our list of the best cookies and crackers stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Dominating Wall Street Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks that are dominating Wall Street. The Generative AI market, a crucial branch of artificial intelligence, is revolutionizing entire industries today. According to ResearchAndMarkets.com, the Gen-AI market was valued at USD 20.21 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 440 billion by 2032. This signifies an impressive CAGR of 41.31% over the forecast period from 2024 to 2032. READ NOW: 10 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street According to the report, the North American region leads the Generative AI market with a 34% share in 2023. Its robust technology ecosystem, skilled workforce, and increasing demand for AI-powered content are responsible for the leading market share. The European region has also been experiencing growth, driven by government funding, startup innovation, and region-specific applications. Back in 2022, the generative AI market was dominated by established players only. These established players accounted for 88% of the market share, whereas start-ups grasped only 12%. This is now changing, with more players entering the market with each passing year. Highlighting advancements in artificial intelligence, Sam Altman, CEO of AI Company OpenAI states how the next innovations in AI are going to be more disruptive than people can imagine. Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York City, he stated that the industry may begin to see examples of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to the hypothetical intelligence of a machine similar to that of a human, as soon as 2025. “I think it’s possible… in 2025 we will have systems that we look at… and people will say, ‘Wow, that changes what I expected” Altman noted that at first, the introduction of AGI, and the level of intelligence beyond it, is going to have minimal effect. However, it will later “be more intense than people think”. In its latest advancements in AI, OpenAI has now begun testing new reasoning AI models, o3 and o3 mini. This demonstrates a sign of growing competition with rivals such as Google to create smarter models proficient at solving complex problems. According to Altman, OpenAI plans to launch the o3 mini by the end of January, and the full o3 after that. The enhanced models aim to outperform existing ones, driving new investments and user growth. The new o3 and o3 mini models are currently undergoing internal safety testing, and are anticipated to be more powerful than the o1 models. OpenAI has ignited a competitive AI arms race, pushing tech companies worldwide to accelerate the development of cutting-edge AI technologies.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leader in AI-driven endpoint and cloud workload protection. On December 19, Jefferies raised the firm’s price target on CrowdStrike to $450 from $415 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares. According to the firm, software stocks are going to have a “slower start out of the gate” in 2025. This is because investors will be recalibrating and adjusting to changes under the new administration. For most of these stocks, benefits from artificial intelligence will likely start to materialize in late 2025. Furthermore, the firm also states that cybersecurity “should prove more resilient” in the first half of 2025 based on strong fundamentals. However, it will fall behind the wider recovery of AI-driven software markets. Overall CRWD ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks dominating Wall Street today. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) is a technology company that provides high-performance computing (HPC) systems, software, and data storage solutions. On December 19, Deutsche Bank analyst Matt Niknam upgraded HP Enterprise (HPE) to “Buy” from Hold with an unchanged price target of $25. The buy rating is justified given the company’s attractive valuation and potential gains from the proposed Juniper acquisition slated to close in early 2025. The $5 billion Juniper deal is expected to expand HPE's higher-margin networking business and result in significant cost synergies. “We view the proposed Juniper acquisition positively, given the newfound scale the deal brings HPE in higher-margin networking, alongside sizable cost synergies”. The analyst also told investors in a research note that HPE’s standalone operations are also improving. This is driven by stronger artificial intelligence and server sales, along with growth in the hybrid cloud and its existing networking segment. Overall HPE ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks dominating Wall Street today. While we acknowledge the potential of HPE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Its robust technology ecosystem, skilled workforce, and increasing demand for AI-powered content are responsible for the leading market share. The European region has also been experiencing growth, driven by government funding, startup innovation, and region-specific applications. Back in 2022, the generative AI market was dominated by established players only. These established players accounted for 88% of the market share, whereas start-ups grasped only 12%. This is now changing, with more players entering the market with each passing year. Highlighting advancements in artificial intelligence, Sam Altman, CEO of AI Company OpenAI states how the next innovations in AI are going to be more disruptive than people can imagine. Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York City, he stated that the industry may begin to see examples of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to the hypothetical intelligence of a machine similar to that of a human, as soon as 2025. “I think it’s possible… in 2025 we will have systems that we look at… and people will say, ‘Wow, that changes what I expected” Altman noted that at first, the introduction of AGI, and the level of intelligence beyond it, is going to have minimal effect. However, it will later “be more intense than people think”. In its latest advancements in AI, OpenAI has now begun testing new reasoning AI models, o3 and o3 mini. This demonstrates a sign of growing competition with rivals such as Google to create smarter models proficient at solving complex problems. According to Altman, OpenAI plans to launch the o3 mini by the end of January, and the full o3 after that. The enhanced models aim to outperform existing ones, driving new investments and user growth. The new o3 and o3 mini models are currently undergoing internal safety testing, and are anticipated to be more powerful than the o1 models. OpenAI has ignited a competitive AI arms race, pushing tech companies worldwide to accelerate the development of cutting-edge AI technologies.

In turn, the surge in fourth-quarter revenue is fueled by strong sales in the company’s mission-critical drone services, ballistic products, and artificial intelligence (AI) unit. “I am extremely proud of our growth and of the impact our organization made in 2024 as we continue to build long-term customer relationships in the US and with our allies. Our revolutionary and patented software ecosystem has been battle tested in Ukraine where our AI located over 16,000 mines and explosive items for our users since the deployment of the platform.
