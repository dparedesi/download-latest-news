Data from multiple blockchain trackers shows that Coinbase has drastically cut its XRP holdings, a move that has taken many crypto investors by surprise. Analysts say such a huge reduction points to large outflows from institutional investors, but others have gone further by alleging manipulation. However, pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan has poured cold water on these claims. US-based exchange Coinbase recently reduced its stash from more than 780 million XRP to just under 200 million in a matter of weeks. This translates to a 69% reduction in the exchange’s holdings since the second quarter of 2025, including a 57% plunge over the last month alone. The scale of the drawdown has also shifted Coinbase’s ranking among exchange holders of XRP, sliding it from the fifth largest to barely in the top 10. An account on the social media platform X, known as Stern Drew, suggested that Coinbase’s sell-offs go with a deliberate strategy to suppress XRP’s price. In a detailed thread, the commentator claimed that nearly 40% of the outflows were routed through OTC desks tied to New York institutions and that the timing of the sales coincided with XRP price dips in August. According to the thread, more than 70% of the volume was unloaded during low-liquidity trading hours, while fragmented routing across wallets masked the scale of the sales. The thread even suggested that some of the XRP ended up with BlackRock-linked custodial wallets, a move that further points to theories about institutional involvement. Bill Morgan was quick to reject the idea that Coinbase is actively manipulating XRP’s price. In his view, the theory overlooks the fact that XRP has exhibited the same behavior throughout its history, including during the long stretch when Coinbase delisted the asset and had no apparent influence on its market activity. Coinbase suspended XRP trading in January 2021, but it wasn’t until July 2023 that the cryptocurrency started trading again on the US-based exchange. “One heck of a theory about Coinbase being against XRP,” he said, before noting that the token’s movements today are consistent with its established trends. The suggestion of manipulation by Coinbase fails to hold up, as XRP’s price action appears more reflective of broader crypto market movement than any deliberate suppression by the exchange. XRP has been trading within a well-defined range between $2.8 and $2.9 in the past seven days. Although it lost the $3 support level as August came to a close, XRP has managed to hold above $2.8 since then, and this level has so far cushioned it from deeper losses. On the upside, the $3.10 level is the critical resistance to watch. A decisive break above that barrier could shift momentum back in favor of the bulls. Until then, XRP’s price is likely to continue consolidating between $3.10 and $2.8. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.82.

Title: 6 Small Cap Dividends With Super-Sized Yields Of Up To 19%
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/09/07/6-small-cap-dividends-with-super-sized-yields-of-up-to-19/

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Small companies are sneaky AI-friendly plays because they are implementing these tools faster than their larger competitors. Expect to see these smaller firms become more efficient in the quarters ahead. Sales will continue to increase while headcounts will remain relatively flat as robots take up the slack—a boon to future profits. Ironically, small caps are currently the cheapest sector on the board: So, we turn our attention to a six pack of small but mighty dividend payers. Let’s start with a lender that yields “only” 15.7% per year and work our way up from there. We discussed BlackRock TCP Capital (TCPC, 15.7% yield) recently as part of our “unloved stocks” focus. This business development company (BDC) invests in more than 150 companies across 20 industries, with a penchant for first-lien debt. It really began underperforming with gusto in 2023; it’s currently restructuring deals amid portfolio credit issues, so things don’t look much better now. But TCPC’s woes have opened up a wide 18% discount to its net asset value (NAV)—that and a 14% regular yield (with an additional 1.7% from specials) might tempt some distressed-asset buyers. That said, the vast majority of BDCs trade for less than their NAV right now, and most of them sit in the small-cap space, so perhaps there’s more fertile ground elsewhere. For instance, New Mountain Finance (NMFC, 12.1% yield) offers a double-digit yield and a double-digit discount to NAV (14%). NMFC deals in U.S. upper-middle-market businesses backed by private equity sponsors. First-lien debt is its most common deal type, at 65% of the portfolio currently, but it has positions in second lien and subordinated debt, preferred stock, common stock and net lease deals. Its portfolio is 124 companies wide right now, and it uses a “defensive growth” strategy, with a focus on investing in strong businesses in acyclical sectors. New Mountain bounced off the COVID bear-market bottom much like other BDCs. But when the industry caught a second wind in 2024, NMFC was largely left behind. Shares are down about 3% even after accounting for its massive yield, which helps to explain its wide discount to NAV. The problem is that NAV is declining too, including a big quarter-over-quarter dip of nearly 2% between the first and second quarters. NMFC suffered from markdowns on healthcare, consumer products, and ed-tech firm Edmentum. On the bright side, non-accruals (loans that are delinquent for a prolonged period, usually 90 days) were stable, and its credit quality remains in decent shape. Moreover, the company has fee waivers and a dividend protection program to keep the high payout in place. But for that discount to NAV to be a bona fide deal, we’ll need to see better business performance. Kayne Anderson BDC (KBDC, 12.6% yield) is another BDC operating in the middle-market with a penchant for private equity-backed, first-lien loans. KBDC targets companies with between $10 million and $75 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and its 114 portfolio companies are largely concentrated in defensive, stable industries. This is an extremely fresh-faced BDC: It began operations in 2021 and went public in 2024. And while it has hardly come roaring out of the gate—its lifetime total return is 1 percentage point removed from the VanEck BDC Income ETF (BIZD)—there are signs of a decent business here. Are there weaknesses? Yes. One small loan was added to the non-accrual list during Q2, bringing non-accruals to 2.2% of the total portfolio on a cost basis (up from 1.9% in Q1). And NAV declined by just less than 1%. But the company’s investments have been picking up in Q3, including a strategic $80 million investment into lower-middle-market credit manager SG Credit at an 11% cash fixed yield. It’s running a $100 million buyback program through May 2026. And part of the aforementioned NAV decline was a 10-cent special dividend—its third in as many quarters. (KBDC yields 10% based on its 40-cent-per-share regular quarterly dividend; specials bring that up to 12.6%.) Mach Natural Resources LP (MNR, 16.0% distribution) is in another big-income niche: master limited partnerships (MLPs). While they can be a pain come tax time because of their additional K-1 form, double-digit distributions can make them worth our time. MNR is a young MLP that formed in November 2017 and went public in late 2023. Its primary operations are in the Anadarko Basin, and it has additional assets in the Green River basin. More recently, it has expanded its reach to the San Juan and Permian basins. While many of its peers are oil-heavy, it has a higher natural-gas mix that in the most recent quarter represented just over half its production. It’s also an efficient operator and has a good track record of buying assets at low valuations. MLP valuations get far into the weeds, but a common-enough one is EV (enterprise value)/EBITDAX (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration expense). On that front, MNR trades at roughly 3.5 times this year’s EBITDAX estimates, which is a little more than half of the average among comparable MLPs. Just understand that while the distribution is sky-high, it’s also all over the place. That’s because MNR pays out variable distributions, which are based on cash available after its 50% reinvestment rate. MFA Financial (MFA, 14.4% yield) invests in residential mortgage loans, residential mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), and other real estate assets. It also originates and services business purpose loans (BPLs) through its Lima One Capital subsidiary. MFA has massively outperformed the mREIT industry throughout its publicly traded life, though shareholders are best advised to wear their seatbelts—it speed-runs peaks and valleys alike. Lima One, which MFA acquired in 2021, is heading in the right direction; Q2 origination, servicing and other fees were up 13% QoQ, and the subsidiary added 15 loan officers during the quarter. Delinquency trends aren’t nearly so clean-cut: In Q2, they declined on the residential whole loan portfolio and single-family rental loans, but increased in the single-family BPL portfolio. Distributable earnings (DE, a non-GAAP measure of profitability that MFA favors) are expected to drop significantly this year before rebounding in 2026. Until then, the dividend is expected to outpace DE—that’s hardly a comfortable position. On the flip side? The market doesn’t appear to be pricing in a cut, and in fact, MFA actually raised its dividend by about 3% earlier this year—its first hike since a 20% cut in 2022. But MFA is value-priced, at about 7 times 2026 earnings estimates and 73% of book. We can get a downright jaw-dropping dividend from Armour Residential REIT (ARR, 19.0% yield), which primarily invests in fixed-rate “agency” residential MBSs, which are those issued or guaranteed by government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. The value picture is a bit different from MFA, but it’s still cheap—ARR trades at about 90% of book, but also at just more than 4 times 2026 core EPS estimates. The question is: How deep must the discount be to ignore Armour’s past? Consider this: In December 2024, I wrote that “any prospective investors will have to overcome a significant mental hurdle: namely, Armour’s horrific dividend track record.” Armour has cut its payout seven times since 2015, and that reflects serious underperformance compared to the mREIT industry. It has continued to underperform since then, but it really detached from the mREIT group in August following a second-quarter miss on distributable EPS and net interest income. Book value per share dropped by 9%. If there’s any solace, it’s that the nearly 20% dividend remains well-covered. But even with that mammoth dividend, ARR has been historically incapable of delivering consistent positive total returns. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Take the nuclear option: Let Mamdani win the mayoral race so NYC can start over from scratch
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/09/06/business/let-zohran-mamdani-win-the-mayoral-race-so-nyc-can-start-over-from-scratch/

As alarm bells ring over the New York City mayoral race, an odd sentiment is starting to gain traction across the business community: Just give up. Just sit tight and let the ill-equipped Maoist Zohran Mamdani win in November. Let him unleash his creepy, dogmatic socialist policies on the masses to teach them valuable lessons — both economic and cultural — about wokeness and progressivism, and more broadly its stranglehold on the Democratic Party. I’m starting to agree. Let the city sink into the abyss. Let Mamdani’s policies force out business and prod more upper- and middle-class residents to flee. Let the city declare bankruptcy — which will happen if Mamdani gets his way. We can then start from scratch. Detroit did it and the last time I was there, its downtown was pristine. Plus, we’re headed there anyway, right? Why not expedite the process and teach people who think leftism works that it doesn’t — particularly when you chase out all the non-leftists who pay the bills. To be clear, New York City isn’t Detroit. Sure, there’s diversification, businesses moving operations to Texas and Florida, but for all the work-from-home doom-and-gloom talk about New York City real estate, Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan is still headquartered in Midtown. Goldman Sachs remains on the West Side. BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, is in Hudson Yards. NYU Langone is here, built through the grit of legendary financier Ken Langone, with world prestige and a quality of care to match. (I can personally attest to the latter.) The best restaurants are here: Try getting a table at ­Elio’s, Sistina or Rao’s. It’s still a cultural mecca, the home of Broadway, The Met and some great museums. For all our issues, New York City with a GDP of around $1.3 trillion has an economy bigger than many countries. We are also saddled, of course, with an insane political class. Zohran Mamdani might be honest in his Marxism, maybe boyishly naive in explaining the benefits of government-run grocery stores that have failed everywhere they were tried. (See most recently Kansas City.) But in this state, he is no outlier. He is emblematic of one-party rule, a fellow traveler in New York’s leftist Democratic Party that has brainwashed voters into believing we need massive regulation that impedes business formation. Ditto for rent control that creates housing shortages, lax policing (do you really feel safe on the streets of Manhattan, particularly at night?), high taxes (the reason so many people are leaving) and a fracking ban that continues to deprive economically depressed upstate regions. Dems have ditched New York’s melting pot in favor of woke and hostile tribalism. The largest concentration of Jews outside Israel, right here in New York City, must now accept daily harassment over leftists’ warped interpretation of history. And we must embrace ­unions, like the clown car that runs the school system. Consider: Sleepy Joe Biden’s immigration policies opened the floodgates for millions of migrants to come to this country.

Never miss a story. Many settled here in New York City, were housed in fancy hotels, and yet since 2020 NYC has witnessed a net out-migration of around 400,000 people. Put another way, a city’s worth of taxpayers left and was replaced by the world’s poor who are tapping into the city’s generous welfare state. Operationally, Andrew Cuomo could be a good mayor. He knows how to run things on both the state and national level. Yet consider his ill-fated last years as governor: He was forced to cave to the left on every issue, banned fracking, raised taxes and couldn’t tame the size of government. Could Eric Adams stand up to those clowns if he were to win — and not drop out as people now believe he will? He hasn’t so far. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, the crime-fighting activist founder of the Guardian Angels, is tough as nails and, when you sit with him, very coherent on policy. Yet if through a stroke of divine intervention he were to be elected, he would be outnumbered 1,000 to 1. He needs the state Legislature to create reform on taxes and other issues, and that’s where the mini-Mamdanis reside. There and the New York City Council, which is a mini-politburo. That’s why I am now leaning ­toward the nuclear option. Let Mamdani win — and prove to New Yorkers and Americans once and for all that there’s a reason communism failed in the Soviet Union, and that the apparatchiks in China have embraced the free market to survive.

What was once met with skepticism and doubt is now universally accepted at the highest level. Despite the resistance, eventually everyone understands Bitcoin. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. It may take a minute to get to grips with magic internet money, but once you see the scarcity, durability, and predictability, it somehow all falls into place. From Jamie Dimon to Donald Trump, eventually everyone understands Bitcoin. Anthony Pompliano summed it up best, against an image of some high-profile personalities, including Donald Trump, Jamie Dimon, and Jerome Powell, who have changed their tune on the number-one coin. He said: “Eventually everyone understands bitcoin.” In the beginning, the idea of a decentralized digital currency was met with skepticism, derision, and sometimes outright hostility. Yet, as the years have passed, some of the world’s most influential voices from Wall Street to Washington have changed their tunes, making Bitcoin’s journey from a fringe obsession to a mainstream asset nothing short of historic. Take Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase. In 2017, he called Bitcoin a “fraud,” threatened to fire employees who traded it, and warned of government crackdowns. Fast-forward to the present, JPMorgan offers Bitcoin exposure to clients and Dimon regularly attends crypto panels. He’s critical of specifics, but his institution is deeply entrenched in blockchain finance. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink went from calling Bitcoin “an index of money laundering” to overseeing the world’s largest asset manager issuing a Bitcoin ETF and publicly referring to it as “digital gold.” Fink’s pivot stunned markets and signaled a shift in how legacy finance regards the new digital economy. Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, was also skeptical about crypto for years. Yet under his watch, the Fed now closely monitors Bitcoin, citing its relevance to global markets and even a “competitor to gold.” Donald Trump once dismissed Bitcoin as being highly volatile and based on thin air. But by 2024, Trump was reportedly courting crypto donors and acknowledging Bitcoin’s increasing significance, reflecting the asset’s growing political clout.

Before 2020, Saylor publicly doubted Bitcoin’s longevity, calling its days “numbered” as far back as 2013. Now, his company MicroStrategy holds more BTC than any other publicly traded firm (over 636,000 coins) and Saylor has personally become its most famous evangelist. And Mark Cuban spent years calling Bitcoin no different from bananas and raising doubts about its utility. Today, he’s an active participant in the crypto and NFT ecosystems, holding Bitcoin and advising blockchain companies. In other words? Eventually, everyone understands Bitcoin. If the world’s biggest names can change their minds, so can entire governments. According to the Visual Capitalist, the United States is now the largest holder of Bitcoin, with China following closely. These holdings are often the result of law enforcement seizures or strategic mining, but the fact remains: global governments hold thousands (sometimes hundreds of thousands) of bitcoins, quietly shifting from outright bans to accumulation and research. Bitcoin’s path to mainstream acceptance has been paved with resistance and then recognition. Whether driven by economic imperatives, technological curiosity, or simply the fear of missing out, figures like Jamie Dimon and Donald Trump have finally come to the same realization: Bitcoin is here, and it is inevitable; even governments now hold Bitcoin as part of their strategic reserves. What was once met with skepticism and doubt is now universally accepted at the highest level, proving Pompliano right that, despite the resistance, eventually everyone understands Bitcoin.

Title: The Banks and the Unbanked: Blockchain’s Biggest Beneficiaries Sit at Both Ends of the Financial Spectrum

Capital markets are in flux. As evolving monetary policy casts a spotlight on a fragmented global economy, the stability of infrastructure for borderless transactions with digital assets stands out as a superior alternative to the traditional system. Blockchain is a viable solution to many of today’s financial challenges. Uniquely, its clearest beneficiaries are two distinctly different groups: financial institutions and the 1.4 billion people who are unbanked. The former gains next-generation speed and scalability while the latter benefits from newfound accessibility and equity. Our charge as builders of this industry, if we want to actualize blockchain’s full potential, is to account for the needs of both. While the financially marginalized have long sought solutions in bleeding-edge tech, the legacy world is just beginning to get the appeal. "We have to be thinking about how we leverage [blockchain] in our environment," said Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson recently, discussing how costs in asset management are up 80% in the last decade, while revenues are down 15%. Franklin Templeton's breakthrough illustrates this institutional awakening. Their first-ever tokenized money market fund reduces transaction costs from $1 to less than a penny – for an institution managing $1.7 trillion, the efficiency gains are transformative. But this institutional adoption does more than cut costs; it validates the infrastructure that can serve both boardrooms and the billions still excluded from traditional finance. The same blockchain rails enabling Franklin Templeton's efficiency gains can deliver $50 remittances from Dubai to the Philippines in seconds rather than several business days. The technology removes friction, whether you're settling $100 million in tokenized assets or sending $100 to family abroad. Major institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity and JPMorgan are proving blockchain's institutional viability at unprecedented scale. Aid organizations, such as the United Nations Refugee Agency, are simultaneously demonstrating its humanitarian potential, distributing assistance directly to those in need without traditional intermediaries. These parallel developments reflect blockchain's unique capacity to serve both efficiency and equity. The institutional momentum creates crucial infrastructure benefits for everyone. When major financial players invest in blockchain networks, they strengthen the rails that underbanked populations can also access. When regulatory frameworks emerge to support institutional adoption, they create legal clarity that benefits all users. Consider the numbers that drive both institutional interest and human need. Global transaction banking generates nearly $1.4 trillion in annual revenue, yet operational inefficiencies cost an estimated 8-10% of that revenue. For institutions, blockchain technology offers clear solutions to these challenges. For the unbanked, the stakes are different but equally compelling. Remittances – which exceeded $900 billion globally in 2024 – carry average fees of 6.62% worldwide, with some corridors reaching 10% or more. Working families lose billions annually to these costs. When a domestic worker sends $500 home, losing $50 to fees represents not inefficiency but genuine hardship. The convergence becomes clear: the same technology solving institutional inefficiencies can address human exclusion from the financial system. Blockchain networks processing transactions for fractions of a penny with 3-5 second settlement times serve both institutional treasuries and individual remittances equally well. Real-world stress tests prove blockchain's dual utility. In Argentina, where inflation reached 236.7% by late 2024, both institutions and individuals are embracing digital assets out of necessity. Data shows 61.8% of Argentina's crypto transactions now involve stablecoins — not as speculation, but as economic survival tools preserving purchasing power against peso devaluation. This crisis-driven adoption reveals blockchain's fundamental value proposition: removing dependence on fragile intermediaries and national monetary systems. Whether you're a fund manager hedging institutional exposure or a family protecting savings, the infrastructure provides the same essential service: stable, borderless value transfer. The infrastructure exists. Modern blockchain networks have processed tens of billions of operations, serving millions of accounts worldwide. The technology handles institutional scale while remaining accessible to individual users. But actualizing blockchain's full potential requires intentional design for both audiences. This means building interfaces sophisticated enough for institutional treasury management yet simple enough for first-time users. It means creating compliance frameworks that satisfy regulatory requirements while preserving accessibility for underserved populations. Success requires partnerships spanning both worlds – working with established financial institutions to build robust infrastructure while partnering with mobile money operators, community organizations, and fintech companies serving underbanked populations. The goal isn't choosing between efficiency and equity, but achieving both simultaneously. Blockchain's unique promise lies precisely in its ability to serve these seemingly different constituencies with the same fundamental infrastructure. The networks enabling pension funds to tokenize assets can help farmers access credit. The rails facilitating institutional settlement can deliver humanitarian aid directly to refugees. As builders, our responsibility extends beyond technological capability to purposeful implementation. We must ensure that institutional adoption strengthens rather than supplants financial inclusion efforts. We must design systems that leverage institutional resources to extend access rather than create new barriers. The infrastructure for borderless, frictionless value transfer is ready. The regulatory frameworks are evolving. The institutional adoption is accelerating. Our success will be measured not just by efficiency gains in existing systems, but by how many people we bring into economic participation for the first time. The choice we make today determines whether blockchain becomes another tool serving the already-served or the bridge finally connecting everyone to the global economy. Both institutions and the unbanked are counting on us to get this right.

Title: Larry Fink Ascends to WEF Throne: BlackRock’s Puppet Master Takes Command of the Globalist Enslavement Machine

Editor Empire Whatfinger In a chilling development that exposes the deepening tentacles of the globalist elite, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has elevated BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to the position of interim co-chairman of its board, alongside André Hoffmann of Roche. This move, announced on August 15, 2025, comes hot on the heels of an internal investigation that conveniently cleared WEF founder Klaus Schwab of any “material wrongdoing” despite swirling allegations of financial and ethical misconduct. Fink, the architect of BlackRock’s $11 trillion empire that dominates everything from housing markets to corporate boardrooms, now sits at the helm of an organization long accused of plotting humanity’s subjugation under the guise of “sustainable development” and the infamous “Great Reset.” For years, patriots and truth-seekers have warned about the WEF’s sinister agenda: a technocratic dystopia where the masses own nothing, eat bugs, and live as digital serfs in smart cities monitored by AI overlords. Reminder – Larry Fink admits the quiet part out loud: “You have to force behaviors.” BlackRock’s CEO—WEF darling & architect of the ESG regime—spells out the real agenda: Social engineering by corporate coercion. No “incremental change.” No organic diversity. Just top-down mandates, dictating who gets hired, promoted, or funded based on race, gender, & ideological compliance. This isn’t “stakeholder capitalism.” It’s elite-driven control. And if you resist? You’ll “be impacted.” The organization’s ties to depopulation schemes—echoing the eerie Georgia Guidestones’ call for reducing the world’s population to a mere 500 million—have fueled conspiracies that the elite view billions of us as expendable “useless eaters.” Now, with Fink in charge, these fears are no longer fringe theories but a glaring reality. As one X user aptly put it, “The evil of the WEF that wants all of mankind enslaved, and reduced to 500 million people world-wide, guess who is now their leader? BlackRock’s Larry Fink.” Klaus Schwab’s reign at the WEF has been a masterclass in elite manipulation. Founded in 1971, the Davos cabal has masqueraded as a “platform for public-private cooperation” while pushing policies that erode national sovereignty and empower unelected bureaucrats. Schwab’s “stakeholder capitalism”—a euphemism for corporate fascism—has been championed by figures like Fink, who led the U.S. Business Roundtable in 2019 to redefine corporate purpose around this very ideology. But beneath the polished speeches lies a darker truth: allegations of harassment, financial impropriety, and a toxic culture that led to Schwab’s ousting. The WEF’s board, stacked with globalist heavyweights like Al Gore, Christine Lagarde, and now Fink himself, held an emergency meeting to whitewash these claims, declaring only “minor irregularities.” Even Schwab’s wife Hilde was implicated, yet the elite protect their own, ensuring the agenda marches on uninterrupted. Fink’s ascension is no accident; it’s the culmination of BlackRock’s insidious influence. As CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, Fink controls stakes in virtually every major corporation, wielding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria as a weapon to enforce woke policies and climate hysteria. Critics have blasted ESG as a “social credit system for corporations,” forcing companies to prioritize globalist goals over American interests. BlackRock’s push into housing markets, buying up single-family homes en masse, aligns perfectly with the WEF’s “you’ll own nothing and be happy” mantra—renting from corporate overlords while the elite hoard wealth. And let’s not forget Fink’s cozy ties to governments: during the COVID-19 scam, BlackRock advised central banks on bailouts, facilitating the greatest wealth transfer in history from Main Street to Wall Street. The depopulation angle is where the conspiracy turns truly diabolical. Fink has openly mused about “substituting humans for machines” in countries with declining populations, a chilling endorsement of automation that renders billions obsolete.This dovetails with WEF-linked narratives on “decarbonization requiring depopulation,” where climate zealots like Bill Gates and the elite push for fewer people to “save the planet.” The Great Reset, unveiled in 2020, isn’t about recovery—it’s a blueprint for control, leveraging pandemics, climate scares, and economic chaos to impose digital IDs, CBDCs, and universal basic income as chains on the masses. Fink’s BlackRock has funneled billions into “green” initiatives, profiting from the destruction of fossil fuels while ordinary folks face skyrocketing energy costs. Conspiratorial voices have long connected the dots: BlackRock’s infiltration of governments, from advising Zelenskyy on Ukraine’s reconstruction to schmoozing with leftist leaders like UK’s Keir Starmer and Australia’s Anthony Albanese. Starmer, a WEF acolyte, has slashed winter fuel payments for millions while releasing prisoners early—policies that reek of Agenda 2030’s disdain for the working class. In Canada, WEF darling Mark Carney eyes the premiership, promising more climate tyranny and CBDCs. These puppets serve Fink’s vision: a world where BlackRock owns the assets, the WEF sets the rules, and humanity is culled to sustainable levels. Patriots are sounding the alarm. One X post warns, “They are bringing out the big guns…. They don’t think the patriots will try to bring the WEF down with the head of world investments as their leader.” Another declares the WEF a “terrorist organization,” echoing calls to classify it as such. Fink’s critics point to his “forced behavior” tactics, using finance to alter government policies without democratic accountability. Even in the face of backlash—states like Florida ditching BlackRock over ESG extremism—Fink doubles down, complaining that criticism has become “personal and ugly.” The WEF’s “Young Global Leaders” program has churned out compliant tyrants like Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron, all marching to the tune of Fink’s orchestra. With Fink now co-chairing, expect accelerated pushes for bio-engineering humans to be allergic to meat, mandatory vaccines, and surveillance states—all in the name of “climate action.” As one truth-seeker notes, “Billionaire Larry Fink is an extinctionist, an eugenicist and a misanthrope like Bill Gates… They share a desire to reduce the world population from around 8 Billion down to 500 million.” This isn’t just about economics; it’s spiritual warfare against freedom-loving people. The elite’s blueprint—exposed in leaks and admissions—aims to enslave us through debt, dependency, and division. But resistance is growing. From Trump supporters to everyday Americans, the call is clear: dismantle the WEF, audit BlackRock, and reclaim sovereignty. As Fink and his cronies plot in Davos shadows, patriots must unite to expose and defeat this cabal before it’s too late. The fight for humanity’s soul is on—will you own nothing, or own the truth?

Title: Musk holds hostage history’s biggest meme stock delusion
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/06/elon-musk-1-trillion-compensation-pay-package-tesla-shareholders-governance/
Time Published: 2025-09-06T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. Elon Musk has once again captured media attention. This time, however, it isn’t a rogue X rant or embittered comments about President Trump’s abuse of executive authority. Instead, a proposed $1 trillion pay package crafted by Tesla’s board and Musk has grabbed headlines. The proposed scheme is ludicrous not only in terms of the highly aspirational 12 milestones that would unlock the benefits, but also in terms of good governance practice. Even needing to support 14 children with four different mothers, how much capital does Musk need? The argument that Musk needs additional incentive to lead Tesla to new heights runs entirely counter to the fact that he owns nearly 20% of the company’s outstanding shares and will already be well rewarded from any upside in the company’s performance. If Tesla were to achieve an $8.5 trillion market cap, as outlined by one of the pay package milestones, Musk would be worth over $1.6 trillion, based on that current ownership stake. Musk is the richest person in the world (or second if you believe that number one is Vladimir Putin), and nearly twice as wealthy as the individuals ranked third and fourth, Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg, respectively. Estimated to be worth over $437 billion, none of Musk’s lifestyle, resources, or influence will meaningfully change from any material increase in wealth. After threatening to walk away from Tesla earlier this year, Musk received a $30 billion pay package after a federal judge denied him a $50 billion package. It is shameful for Musk to now be holding shareholders hostage to suit his need for power. Renowned founders such as Bernie Marcus of Home Depot, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Michael Dell of Dell Technologies, Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone, Sam Walton of Walmart, and Larry Fink of BlackRock never fabricated shakedown strategies like this to regain more control of their companies after they went public. Moreover, should Musk act on his threat and leave Tesla, he would be the biggest loser as the largest shareholder of the biggest meme stock in financial market history. Tesla has a P/E ratio of over 200x, compared to the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia, at nearly 50x, so a 50% drop in the existing Tesla market cap of $1.1 trillion would result in a $110 billion loss in paper wealth, a quarter of Musk’s estimated worth. The performance milestones in the proposed pay package are both illusional and delusional. According to the proposal, Tesla is required to deliver 20 million vehicles, a significant increase from the 1.8 million delivered in 2024. The company must also distribute one million robots. They have not even developed a fully functional humanoid robot. Additional benchmarks require one million robotaxis to be placed into commercial operation, versus 30 on the roads today, and 10 million subscribers for its Full Self Driving service, compared to approximately 1 million in 2024. Most jarring are the mandates for the company to more than double the $4 trillion market cap of Nvidia and to notch $400 billion of adjusted EBITDA, versus $16.65 billion in 2024. Despite the absurdity of the performance package, the federal government does not need to intervene, as it has been so inclined to do lately. If stockholders do not like the proposed pay package, then they will vote against the proposal or sell their stock holdings. Of course, shareholders, not the government, should be asking important questions—of which there are many—about the necessity for such a rich payout and high ownership stake. One of those burning questions: If Musk preferred maintaining so much control, then why did he take Tesla public? The centrality of the chief executive to the success of the company is far more symbolic in the eyes of tech bros than it is substantive in the eyes of the average customer. In fact, as of late, he has been the most detrimental factor to the Tesla sales pipeline, which is on track to fall for the second year in a row. Sales in Europe have notably fallen by 40% year-over-year, ceding its dominant market position to Chinese EV automaker BYD for the first time. The Chinese market has been just as challenging for Tesla, which has experienced repeated sales declines over several months this year and has yielded more than half its market share to competitors since 2021. Many Tesla enthusiasts would be surprised to know that Musk did not create Tesla, but he squeezed out its first CEO, co-founder Martin Eberhard, along with Tesla’s other co-founder Marc Tarpenning. They were the ones who named the company for the brilliant, penniless inventor of alternating currents, wireless remote controls, and X-rays in 2003. The plunging sales of Telsa have been directly linked to a global consumer backlash after Musk’s endorsement of the German AFD party — considered a Nazi apologist group — and a U.S. consumer backlash against his DOGE initiative, a tornado of cruel, dangerous, self-interested destruction of vital federal agencies, in partisan service to President Trump. While Musk may be the greatest inventor of our time, his magic wand is overhyped. Most of his private companies, such as Neuralink, The Boring Company, X/Twitter, and SolarCity, have been a bust or seen lackluster performance. Solar City was a failure that got jammed down the throats of unrelated Tesla shareholders. It would take a lot of nerve to celebrate the delayed success of Neuralink. X/Twitter’s value collapsed after Musk took control. At least there is truth in advertising for the Boring Company. It lives up to its name by failing to connect the scores of cities with high speed tunnels that were promised years ago. SpaceX has seen success primarily due to a stable flow of government contracts and subsidies, and the steady operating hand of President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell. xAI has potential but its Grok chatbot raised many concerns when it began spewing pro-Nazi/Hitler and antisemitic pronouncements soon after Musk tampered with the large language model’s algorithm. The board is suffering from what political scientists and psychologists call “groupthink,” psychiatrists label folie à deux, social workers call “codependence,” and normal people recognize as an infatuation with a charismatic, cultish powerful figure. We have seen this happen before at Viacom with Sumner Redstone and CBS with Bill Paley. We’ve seen it with Ken Olsen at Digital Equipment Corporation, once the world’s second-largest tech company but no longer in business. And we saw it with Juan Trippe at Pan American World Airways, the now-defunct pioneer of transoceanic travel that was once America’s flagship carrier. The original nationwide coffee house pioneer, William Black, ran the Chock full O’Nuts chain that he founded into his mid-80s when he was flat on his back in the hospital while his full-time physician and lifelong friend served as the president. Those boards followed such charismatic CEOs, who lived on the edge, until they ran right off the cliff.

Title: Ether ETFs see $788M in outflows: what’s going on?

US-based spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw four straight days of net outflows during the shortened trading week following Labor Day, reversing some of the momentum that had built up in August. The funds shed a total of $787.6 million between Tuesday and Friday, with the sharpest move on Friday when $446.8 million exited the products, according to data from Farside. Over the same period, Bitcoin ETFs saw $250.3 million in net inflows. The weekly reversal comes after a strong August for Ether ETFs, which attracted $3.87 billion in inflows. Bitcoin ETFs, in contrast, recorded $751 million in outflows during the month. Despite the recent weakness, several market participants remain bullish on Ether’s outlook. On Wednesday, BitMine chairman Tom Lee reiterated his forecast that ETH could eventually reach $60,000. Speaking on the Medici Presents: Level Up podcast, he said Wall Street’s growing interest in the token could become a “1971 moment” for the asset, a reference to the US ending the gold standard and ushering in a new financial era. BitMine is the largest Ether treasury company, holding about $8.04 billion worth of ETH, according to data from StrategicETHReserve. Collectively, Ether treasury companies now control 2.97% of the token’s circulating supply, valued at $15.49 billion at the time of publication. Supporting that outlook, blockchain analytics firm Santiment noted that large Ether holders have steadily increased their positions. Wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH — worth between $4.31 million and $430.63 million — have grown their balances by 14% since April, when ETH touched yearly lows. “In exactly 5 months, they have added 14.0% more coins,” Santiment said in a post on X. The firm suggested that the accumulation trend could provide underlying support for the asset even as ETF flows fluctuate. Ether traded at $4,313 on Saturday, while Bitcoin stood at $110,238. The diverging ETF flows highlight shifting sentiment between the two largest cryptocurrencies as traders weigh the impact of macroeconomic conditions, regulatory clarity, and institutional adoption. While short-term flows have turned negative, Ether’s strong August performance and continued interest from institutional players suggest that investors remain divided on whether the latest moves mark a pause or the start of a broader rotation back into Bitcoin.

Please let us know Topic:Company News Elon Musk has been offered one of the largest CEO payment packages in history. (Reuters: Hamad I Mohammed) Tesla's board has proposed a $US1 trillion ($1.52 trillion) compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk in what would be the largest corporate pay package in history. The move underscores the hold Mr Musk has over the car maker as it attempts to transform into an AI and robotics powerhouse. Here's what we know about the package. Elon Musk will need to increase Tesla's value eightfold. (ABC News: Daniel Mercer) The proposed plan would grant Mr Musk up to 12 per cent of Tesla's stock, worth about $US1.03 trillion if the company hits its target market value of $US8.6 trillion. The plan requires boosting Tesla's valuation nearly eightfold, or about $US7.5 trillion, over the next decade. To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1 per cent of the company, Mr Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $US2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world's first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $US8.6 trillion, double that of the world's most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia. Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. To increase Tesla's value the company will need to sell 20 million vehicles. (AP Photo: Julio Cortez) Mr Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo. Mr Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount. If fully earned, the award would materially increase Mr Musk's voting power from his roughly 13 per cent stake, intensifying debate over governance and succession. Tesla emphasised that Mr Musk would receive no salary or cash bonus, with all compensation linked to performance. The package is designed to keep Mr Musk from leaving and is squarely focused on transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence and robotics powerhouse, the board said in a securities filing. It said Mr Musk is the only person on the planet who can unlock Tesla's full potential. Mr Musk has been criticised as being distracted from Tesla. Elon Musk's willingness to challenge Donald Trump has raised concerns at Tesla. His foray into party politics and his willingness to challenge President Donald Trump had heightened concerns among Tesla investors and analysts about potential distractions and had previously fuelled talk about looking for a new chief. In July, Mr Musk announced plans to launch a third political party, the "America Party", following a public clash with Trump over a tax cut and government spending bill. Tesla's board has urged shareholders to vote against a proposal calling for a political neutrality policy, which would have expanded board oversight of Mr Musk's political activities. Yes, and Mr Musk is likely to get it at the company's annual meeting in November. That is because it was crafted with an eye on keeping Mr Musk in place, addressing concerns about the company's technical outlook and giving big company owners just enough reason to back the massive amount, investors and executive pay analysts said. The pay plan is by far the largest ever for any CEO. And while it is likely to face legal challenges, compensation experts see it winning shareholder approval. "Time and time again, Tesla's shareholders have approved these grants over the years," Equilar research director Courtney Yu said. None of Tesla's three largest outside investors, Vanguard Group, BlackRock or State Street, immediately said how they would vote. Among them, Vanguard and BlackRock supported Mr Musk's $56 billion pay package last year, disclosures show, while State Street funds voted against it. Tesla and top funds can still expect pressure over the pay, however, with several union figures and public-sector treasurers voicing concern. Union figures and public-sector treasurers have voiced concerns about the proposed payment. (AP: Jose Luis Magana) "We urge shareholders to reject Musk's money grab, take away the Tesla board's rubber stamp, and restore basic corporate governance standards," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, in a statement. Kristin Hull, founder and chief investment officer of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, called the package irresponsible. "This is investor money that could go into R&D or acquisitions, places that would really benefit Tesla in the long term," she said, adding that she is considering a challenge with other shareholders. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called Mr Musk a visionary but said the pay plan was excessive and could set a bad precedent in corporate governance. He questioned whether Mr Musk was worth that much. "He also presides over a company that has lost its edge, is being overtaken by rivals, and whose brand has been tarnished by Musk's actions outside of Tesla," he said. Last year, Tesla reincorporated in Texas after a judge in its former corporate home, Delaware, ruled a $US56 billion compensation for the CEO was "unfathomable" and unfair to shareholders. Mr Musk urged companies to ditch Delaware and his board worked on a new pay package. A judge has ruled that Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $86.6 billion compensation package even though shareholders of the electric vehicle company had voted to reinstate it earlier this year. Last year, the company's shareholders voted to "ratify" Mr Musk's 2018 pay package in an attempt to essentially undo the court ruling and restore Mr Musk's pay package. Mr Musk will be able to vote about 411 million shares at this year's shareholder meeting, nearly outweighing the 529 million shares that voted against ratification. In the end, the ratification vote did not matter because the Delaware judge ruled it did not override her prior decision. That ruling and her ruling striking Mr Musk's $US56 billion compensation are on appeal. In 2018, the company barred Mr Musk from voting his shares to make it harder for investors to sue under Delaware law. Now Tesla does not need to do that because it has much better protection from legal challenges thanks to laws in Texas.

Title: Virgin Media presenter Katja Mia: ‘I get scared, I worry about the people I care about. These are weird times’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/09/06/katja-mia-i-grew-up-in-ireland-through-struggle-its-made-me-hyper-ambitious/
Time Published: 2025-09-06T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
When Dublin TV presenter, influencer and model Katja Mia was doing the Leaving Cert more than a decade ago, she plastered the study area in the Blanchardstown family home with motivational quotes from the likes of Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela. “I was not blessed academically, I was one of those people who had to work really hard to get just above average,” she says. “I had all these quotes posted up everywhere, I’d write down the number of points I wanted to get so I could see them.” She was manifesting before manifesting became a thing? “I suppose I was,” she laughs. “But I also studied for hours and hours. Nothing came easily.” While it’s been an often-derided TikTok trend for a few years now, manifesting – the idea that our thoughts and actions can positively influence what we accomplish – has actually been a thing for a while. There’s a Sanskrit text called Rigveda from 3,500 years ago containing hymns that suggest that by focusing on our hopes and dreams we can influence personal destiny. At any rate, the presenter is something of a poster girl for the trend. From a family of Burundian immigrants a combination of ambition, determination, hard work, luck and – scoff if you like – manifesting eventually landed her her dream job presenting the Six O’Clock Show on Virgin Media. We’re talking in the boardroom of the television station before she goes to studio to record the hour-long live show. She’s wearing black athleisure wear and there’s a large - “lab grown” she qualifies - diamond engagement ring sparkling on her finger. In a couple of weeks, she’ll go to Burundi, in east Africa, for the first time in 15 years to take part in a traditional “dot” engagement ceremony in front of 300 family and friends. It will be a chance for her fiancé and boyfriend of eight years, Daragh Curran, an influencer called The Guinness Guru who specialises in tasting pints of the black stuff all over the world, to meet her extended family. Having grown up in Dublin she’s looking forward to immersing herself in the culture of her parent’s homeland, royal Burundian drummers and traditional costumes included. “I’m embracing all of it,” she smiles. Her mother Carinie is all over the arrangements. The wedding next year will be an Irish one. “We’ll do our own thing for that,” she says. The goal, as she grew up, was financial security, which explains the motivational quotes and commitment to her studies. She was born in Germany, in 1996, after her parents sought refuge there from the civil war in Burundi, a protracted conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups, which killed an estimated 300,000 people from 1993 to 2005. Her uncle had been murdered in a grenade and knife attack in the former Belgian colony and “there was a threat to my dad’s family in particular so he had to flee the country”. [ Festive and funny tales with Thalia Heffernan, Katja Mia, Killian Sundermann and moreOpens in new window ] The family spent a couple of years in a village near Frankfurt but when they went to get their visa renewed it was denied. The family’s difficulties in Germany were compounded by the racism they were subjected to by neo-Nazis. Unable to return to Burundi, the family came to Ireland as undocumented immigrants. She was only 17 months old when they moved to Dublin, first settling in Blackrock. The Department of Justice initially refused their application for asylum on the grounds that they had made their original application in Germany. Threatened with deportation she says her father Joseph was given assistance in his campaign for his family to stay in Ireland by “some excellent people” including former Irish Times journalist Andy Pollak. “My dad saw him talking on a news programme one day and looked up his number in the phone book,” she says. Later, I find an Irish Times news report from 1998 about the family’s experience in Germany and the racist abuse they suffered there. “It was torture,” her mother Carinie told Irish Times reporter Paul Cullen back then. “We had already left one form of atrocious situation, [in Burundi] and now we were in another. We were just looking for somewhere calm, where our children can grow up and be integrated in society.” Eventually, they were given leave to remain in Ireland and got their Irish passports. They instilled positive affirmations in us about being black from a really young age Her parents’ experience as immigrants has had a significant influence on the presenter. “I was always aware of their struggle. They were educated but English is not their first language so they had to start from the bottom and I witnessed that.” Joseph and Carinie, who also speak French, encouraged their four children to speak English at home instead of Kirundi, the official language of Burundi, so that they would have a better chance of integrating. Her mother worked in a supermarket and her father, now a taxi driver, had two jobs at one point. “I would see him come home from one shift and put on his uniform for a second job. I think when I saw that it really instilled a work ethic and made me put my head down. They came here for me to have a better life. They didn’t want me to struggle. When you see people struggle it makes you want to go after security and financial stability”. The family moved from Blackrock to Usher’s Quay in the city centre and then to Lucan where she attended primary and secondary school even after the family eventually settled in Blanchardstown. “Growing up I always felt Irish, I sang Irish songs, did Irish dancing, on Brigid’s Day we celebrated Nano Nagle. When you are migrating to a new country, integrating is everything, especially for kids.” Every Monday afternoon from the age of six she’d go to a stage school in Lucan where she thrived - dancing and singing in shows. It wasn’t until the move to Blanchardstown that the family became victims of racist attacks. “We were the first black family on our council estate. There were a lot of teenagers coming to our house, throwing eggs at our windows, breaking my mum’s car door on a weekly basis. It was a kind of torment, to be honest.” “I remember vividly one day being egged by a group of boys, and I was only 11 or 12, I had my uniform on and I was just drenched in eggs ... you have to reassure yourself that people are ignorant, they’re doing it out of fear and you should not waste your energy trying to defend yourself because you’ve nothing to defend. “And I think it stood to me, because even now, working in media, it’s inevitable that you’re going to get comments, people that don’t like you for whatever reason, whether it’s the dress you’re wearing your make-up or whatever.” This resilience was modelled by her parents who changed the narrative when it came to their four children. “They instilled positive affirmations in us about being black from a really young age. They’d tell me: ‘You have amazing skin, you are a descendant of the Tutsi tribe, you are beautiful, be proud’.” When it came to choosing her career path, despite her love of performing, her need for security led her to pursue finance. The motivational quotes paid off. She got enough points for a finance and economics degree from Maynooth University and went into banking as a depository analyst working in funds. In the pandemic, she began a remote job in Bank of America but she wasn’t happy. “I was lost,” she says of her time in the corporate world. “I had no passion. I didn’t know what I was doing. I even started praying about it.” By now manifesting was everywhere. “I read the books, I listened to podcasts and I started posting on Instagram almost as a tool to throw s**t at the wall and see what stuck”. She began curating her feed “in a fun, aesthetic way” building an audience. When a friend needed a presenter for a music show in Swords, she nervously accepted. “It was a nine or 10-hour day but it felt like about 10 minutes because I was having the time of my life. I just thought, how can I make this a job?” There are people on TikTok saying, ‘Ireland is for the Irish’. People get angry at me, telling me: ‘You’re not Irish’ She had grown up admiring presenters like Kathryn Thomas and Martin King “who I ended up working with”. She’d watch E! News all the time. “I was obsessed with television culture, but I had no idea how to get into it ... then a friend sent me a link to a competition for online presenters and I ended up winning it.” The competition, to be a brand ambassador for Love Island presenter Maya Jama’s skincare range Mij Masks, was open to people across the UK and Ireland. It was the break she was hoping for and led to Virgin Media getting in touch. She began there as a contributor, moving to hosting on Weekend AM with Martin King. At one stage, when Ireland AM presenter Muireann O’Connell was on holiday, she got a call to replace her for three shows. “That was just wild to me. My whole family was jumping on the bed. It’s a three-hour live show. I’ll never forget that moment.” Eventually, she was named as the new permanent host with Brian Dowling of the station’s Six O’Clock Show. That was in November 2023, less than two years after landing her first presenting job. “Ideally, in a dream world, I would have done a degree in media and journalism, naturally I still feel impostor syndrome, but I learn from people, I learn by making mistakes. It worked out the way it worked out and I have so much backing in Virgin Media, I’ve been really supported.” [ We cannot police the streets if online material is not regulatedOpens in new window ] In the meantime she had been spotted by a modelling scout on Instagram, which she calls “the modern day CV for creatives”, and was a “curvy” model for a few years. Last year, when she was one of the celebrities competing in Dancing With the Stars, she received abusive messages about her size. “I got comments about whether my dance partner could lift me, people saying: ‘She’s a disgrace’.” Did the abuse affect Katja? “Absolutely, it did,” she says. “I would find myself on rehearsal days looking at playback, focusing on how big my thighs looked instead of my dance form. I have to say, once I shared the horrible comments there was so much support”. She has spoken of dealing with endometriosis and says her weight has always fluctuated. Of the abuse she says: “I have the tools to deal with it, I just needed to reinforce those positive affirmations. And my family were amazing. They just thought it was cool that I was dancing on TV.” Inevitably, given her backstory, we talk for a while about the rise of anti-immigration sentiment and the “Ireland is full” protests around the country. She is thoughtfulon the subject. “It’s conflicting,” she says. “I am a young person living in Ireland, I know it’s tough.” “I have a friend coming home from Australia with her boyfriend and they are finding it so hard to find somewhere to live. I understand that people are in a difficult position and when things get hard people look for people to blame. And the easiest targets are the newbies, the immigrants, the people who don’t sound like you or look like you.” [ Manifesting is the perfect religion for our times. But does it work?Opens in new window ] She says she hates “it’s come to that” because she immediately thinks of her parents. “They still have accents, when they talk they don’t sound Irish even though they’ve been here for so long. They are easy targets. I am someone with black skin. I know that just walking around without someone hearing my Dublin accent, I will be judged. “Something could happen to me. So I hate that black and brown people, any people of colour in Ireland, are in danger and have to worry about abusive and racist rhetoric and also physical violence.” The “conflict” she feels on the issue is about the challenges many people in this country face. “I’ve lived in Ireland my whole life. I pay taxes in this country, but I know when the time comes around when I get married and I want to look for a house, it’s going to be incredibly difficult, even though I work hard and I know other people are working hard too.” “People just want a better life for themselves. But at the same time, it’s not the fault of immigrants who are just trying to blend and integrate into a country,” she says. “It’s the fault of a Government that needs to do better. The pressure should lie with the Government to create resources for people who are struggling with the socio-economic situation, who can’t get houses. They need to be the ones to create a solution.” I feel like it’s very taboo to say, but I am someone who really wants to create a comfortable life for myself and stability for my family I ask how she feels being asked about this subject. Does it get wearying? “Every time I talk about it, and I’ve talked about it a lot, it always comes with a certain amount of hate. So I’ve become more apprehensive. There are people on TikTok saying, ‘Ireland is for the Irish’. People get angry at me, telling me: ‘You’re not Irish’. They say: ‘You’re a diversity hire’. They say all these crazy things so I’ve drawn back on it a bit”. But does she feel it’s important to speak out? “Yes, especially now seeing the attacks on Indian people, it’s heartbreaking. I grew up with Indian friends in my class and Pakistani friends. They’ve been here for years. And the new people should be welcomed too because at the end of the day we’re citizens of the world. The Irish history of migration in Australia, in Canada and in America is well known and there is never any issue with that. It’s clearly a skin colour issue and that’s what makes me upset.” In 2020, attending a protest against the murder of George Floyd by police in America, she told an Irish Times reporter that watching the footage of Mr Floyd’s death made her think of her father and brother. “My dad has such a gentle soul and to think that someone would look at him and perceive him as violent from the colour of his skin is absolutely outrageous. We’re protesting here for George Floyd but also for every black person who has gone through discrimination.” Now, she says: “My dad is a taxi driver, I get afraid for him when he is out at night because these people seem to have this new-found confidence to be blatantly racist and they think it’s okay to hurt people like that. So I get upset and I get scared, I worry about the people I care about. These are weird times.” On a more positive note, she’s happy to see things moving, however slowly, in terms of increased representation and participation of people of colour in Irish society. “I feel like it is slowly changing in a natural, unforced way. What you are seeing is the second generation of immigrants growing up and choosing careers like presenting or being make-up artists, there are more of us in the creative industries. “I think traditionally there was a lot of pressure to be, like, a doctor or a lawyer. But we also need to have visual representation in creative spaces too. And I think slowly we’re getting that.” In many ways, she is still the industrious Leaving Cert student, pushing herself forward to the next thing. She’s still manifesting, still dreaming. “I’ve had to back myself and be like: this is what you asked for, what you dreamt of, so work hard, open your ears, learn”. She’ll turn 30 next year. There’s a wedding to plan. What are her latest goals? “I feel like it’s very taboo to say, but I am someone who really wants to create a comfortable life for myself and stability for my family. It’s always at the back of my mind, it goes beyond myself. I have dreams of buying a home for my family one day, and of having the life that I always dreamed of in Ireland, especially growing up through struggle,” she says. “It’s made me hyper-ambitious and focused on having security in life. I have a job that really drives me, a job I’m very lucky to say I love.I’ve met amazing people and the dream is just to continue doing something like this. If I can have longevity in this industry, then I’ll be very happy.” Katja Mia presents The Six O’Clock Show with Brian Dowling every weekday on Virgin Media © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: We Are Becoming A Nation Of...: HDFC AMC's Navneet Munot On India's 'Multi-Pronged Growth Model'
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/we-are-becoming-a-nation-of-hdfc-amcs-navneet-munot-on-indias-multi-pronged-growth-model

The rapid pace of economic reforms by the government, including tax cuts, GST (Goods and Services Tax) reductions and liquidity measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has created a wave of optimism about India’s growth trajectory, according to Navneet Munot, Managing Director and CEO of HDFC Asset Management Company (AMC). He lauded the government's economic strategy, describing it as a combination of "policy prudence, agile execution and effective communication" that sets India apart on the global stage. “India has been a nation of savers for generations. What we are doing now is becoming a nation of investors. If you are astute, you would take a long-term view of India. It is going to be a multi-pronged growth model rather than a very narrow set of growth models most of the other countries have seen,” he said during a conversation with NDTV Profit on Friday. He said that India has become 'Atmanirbhar' (self-reliant) in its capital markets, while acknowledging the importance of the inflow of foreign funds. “I won't say that we don't need foreign savings. I think our investment needs are humongous. We need more foreign flows for sure. And at some stage, it's likely to come both in the form of FDI as well as in the form of FPI.” He contrasted India's approach with that of major economies like the United States, highlighting a fundamental difference in philosophy. “On one side, you are seeing increasing tariffs and putting more burden on the consumers... On the other side, what India is doing is, I want to give more benefit to the larger section of the society," he said. He described this as the 'Bahujan Hitai, Bahujan Sukhai' (for the welfare and happiness of the masses) philosophy, starkly different from policies that favour tax cuts for the wealthy while imposing tariffs that ultimately hurt consumers. Munot cited recent measures like personal income tax relief, GST rate cuts and RBI’s liquidity injections as steps to stimulate consumption and credit growth. “It is not only about cutting rates and paying less taxes. It's also about like Chanakya said that the government should take taxes the way a butterfly gently takes nectar,” the top executive said. Munot was bullish on India’s potential to produce global-scale asset managers akin to Blackstone or BlackRock. “Several of those businesses are managing hundreds of billions in alternatives and trillions in public markets. Over a period of time, as this economy grows from $4 trillion to $40 trillion in our lifetime, you will see asset managers in India talking about that size,” he said. Highlighting India’s importance for the world, he said, “This is where 18% of humanity is. This is where the youngest population in the world is. We will be the biggest supplier of labour force to the world for the next several decades. So, you have to ensure that you take full advantage of that demographic dividend.” Shares of HDFC Asset Management Company closed 0.44% higher at Rs 5,594 apiece on the NSE, while the benchmark Nifty50 ended 0.03% up at 24,741.

Title: Jio BlackRock CEO: Data-driven approach with fund manager insights sets us apart

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Jio BlackRock Asset Management Company is all set to launch its first actively managed fund, a flexicap fund, on 23 September. The AMC is an equal joint venture between Jio Financial Services and global investment giant BlackRock. What sets it apart from other funds? According to Sid Swaminathan, CEO of Jio BlackRock AMC, it has a data-driven approach using BlackRock’s Aladdin software with insights from human fund managers. The fund house also has the benefit of Jio's large distribution ecosystem, which allows it to focus on direct-only plans for now. In this interview, Swaminathan talks about the fund's plans, AI-driven products and more. Edited excerpts:Can you walk us through the overall plan that you have for unfolding Jio BlackRock AMC? With BlackRock bringing its tech platform, Aladdin, to India, asset managers can do everything in a very scalable, operationally safe manner. We also have our partner Jio, which allows us to access customers at scale in the digital ecosystem. Our platform in BlackRock, systematic active equity (SAE), is a quantitative data-driven AI machine learning approach to equity investing. A computer does all the data crunching for you, and then you have the fund managers who can overlay some specific insights on it. You can then input all of this into Aladdin. Next, run a portfolio-level optimisation using the risk model and an India-specific risk model built for the joint venture to generate a portfolio recommendation. If you aim to outperform a flexicap fund using these insights by X percent annually, with Y amount of risk relative to that benchmark, here is a suggested portfolio. What about your products and their rollout? We have launched three institutional-focused cash funds to start with. We are very happy with the kind of start that we got, and also the retail participation…about 67,000 investors in the first three NFOs since July. We have also looked at the index funds. So again, in a way, bread and butter for BlackRock. The third set of funds in phase one will be more leaning towards the active side, with flexicap as the first one. Some fund houses are more tilted towards growth, and some towards value. Is there an overarching philosophy for you? The overarching philosophy is that it's a data-driven approach. It allows us to use and leverage the data in many ways. For example, for this flexicap fund that we are going to launch, the fund managers will typically look to generate the alpha purely through stock selection. Now the same data can be used to build another fund, which will come later. But instead of just having views on stocks, I may have views on factors. So I could have a growth tilted, or a value tilted fund, or I could do factor rotation…so we have all the insights to do that. Or rather than factors, we can have sectors. So, as a fund house, our philosophy is to be data-driven and then deliver that in differentiated ways to our end customers. Do you have an upper and lower limit to the number of stocks you would have in the fund? Not necessarily. You would expect around 125 to 150 stocks, which is, again, a lot more than you would see in a typical flexicap where it’s probably 30 to 40. But you're never going to see 500 stocks because, again, that's an index fund. You've chosen to take the direct route for distribution. What was the thinking behind this, and how will it pan out? People are becoming increasingly comfortable managing their finances digitally on their phones. Our partnership with Jio, which has access to that ecosystem, gives us a clear understanding that this is the direction we want to pursue. We aim to see how direct digital approaches work. We have the capacity to manufacture at scale, and if we can reach customers and offer them value digitally, that would be excellent. We can always consider growing, expanding, and exploring other options in the future. The ₹24 tax filing product enables users to file their returns digitally. Would it accelerate your growth? A lot of new products are coming online from JioFinance. Yes, like new functionality on the Jio Finance app will help accelerate our growth. Our presence will also accelerate Jio Finance’s growth, because people will get excited by things like the NFO periods going online. We currently have 50 to 55 million unique permanent account numbers (PAN) in the mutual fund space. How large do you think the market can grow? Fifty-five million is a very big number, but in the context of India, it's still very small, right? We have just crossed 20% of AUM (assets under management) as a percentage of GDP. By comparison, the UK is at 80% and the US is at 150%. There can be some short-term blips that we have seen even in the last few weeks, but the overall macro is very sound. Demographics are very positive. Tell us a little about your team Our chief investment officer (CIO), Rishi Kohli, has been involved in the systematic quant investing space in India for many decades. In addition, two dedicated fund managers who previously worked at BlackRock have joined the team. There are also two dealers and a couple of researchers for the equity team. On the fixed income side, we have three fund managers, two dealers, and a couple of researchers. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

(Photo: Reuters/Gonzalo Fuentes) WILMINGTON, Delaware: Elon Musk's blow-out US$1 trillion pay package from Tesla proves everything is bigger in Texas, especially under its new management-friendly law. Last year, Tesla reincorporated in the Lone Star State after a judge in its former corporate home, Delaware, ruled a US$56 billion compensation for the CEO was "unfathomable" and unfair to shareholders. Musk urged companies to ditch Delaware and his board worked on a new pay package. Freed from the constraints of Delaware's widely used corporate law, Tesla has super-sized the next pay deal for Musk, already the world's richest person. Despite increasing his pay nearly 20-fold, there is a better chance this package will be approved and a lesser risk it will be struck down in the courts, thanks to Texas's corporate law. In addition, it would be harder for shareholders to challenge the independence of the two board members who developed the pay package.

By Ross Kerber, Dawn Kopecki, Simon Jessop and Arsheeya Bajwa NEW YORK -Tesla's $1 trillion, 10-year pay package to retain CEO Elon Musk is likely to be approved by shareholders at the company's annual meeting in November even though the amount is staggering. That is because it was crafted with an eye on keeping Musk in place, addressing concerns about the company's technical outlook and giving big company owners just enough reason to back the massive amount, investors and executive pay analysts said. Earlier on Friday, the automaker's board approved what it called "A Super Ambitious Incentive Package for a Pioneering, Ambitious and Unique CEO" that sets out lofty earnings and valuation targets – awarding Musk millions of shares over the next decade if he hits them. It immediately gives Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock worth more than $31 billion as of intraday trading on Friday that vests over the next two years, as well as more control over the company. His total 2025 compensation package is worth north of $113 billion, executive compensation research firm Equilar has estimated. “The pay package, which makes a big bet on the future of robots, may see shareholder support," said Taufiq Rahim, a SpaceX investor and principal at 2040 Advisory. "But it raises larger social questions about the outsized gains going to relatively few capital holders, which is likely not sustainable and will face public pressures.” The package is designed to keep Musk from leaving and is squarely focused on transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence and robotics powerhouse, the board said in a securities filing. It said Musk is the only person on the planet who can unlock Tesla's full potential. The compensation committee started negotiating Musk's pay package in February, it said, meeting with lawyers 37 times and directly with Musk 10 times over seven months. Certain items were non-negotiable for the idiosyncratic CEO: he wanted 25% of the company, to control Tesla's future direction and to be fully compensated for a 2018 pay package that was hung up in litigation. THREATS TO LEAVE Musk threatened to leave more than once, and the board worried the company's AI talent would follow him out the door, it said in the filing. The $31 billion in restricted shares, which he cannot sell for at least five years, is partial payback for a $56 billion 2018 pay plan that a Delaware court voided last year. If Musk wins in court within a certain time frame, he will not receive the one-time payment "so there can be no 'double dip,'" the board said. "Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue his other interests and leave Tesla if he did not receive such assurance," the board said. SHAREHOLDER PROVAL The pay plan is by far the largest ever for any CEO, Equilar said. And while it is likely to face legal challenges, compensation experts see it winning shareholder approval. "Time and time again, Tesla's shareholders have approved these grants over the years," Equilar Research Director Courtney Yu told Reuters. "While it may seem outlandish now, shareholders will get tremendous value out of it if Elon Musk is successful." None of Tesla's three largest outside investors, Vanguard Group, BlackRock or State Street, immediately said on Friday how they would vote. Among them, Vanguard and BlackRock supported Musk's $56 billion pay package last year, disclosures show, while State Street funds voted against it. Tesla and top funds can still expect pressure over the pay, however, with a number of union figures and public-sector treasurers voicing concern. "We urge shareholders to reject Musk’s money grab, take away the Tesla board’s rubber stamp, and restore basic corporate governance standards," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, in a statement. Musk, who currently controls close to 13% of the company, would own 25% if the plan is approved, so long as he hits his performance targets and sticks around for at least seven more years. Payable over 12 tranches after hitting certain milestones, the ultimate prize could make Tesla the most valuable company in the world with an aspirational market capitalization of $8.5 trillion, making it worth more than Microsoft , Meta Platforms and Alphabet combined, today, the board noted. Kristin Hull, founder and chief investment officer of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, called the package irresponsible. “This is investor money that could go into R&D or acquisitions, places that would really benefit Tesla in the long term," she said, adding that she is considering a challenge with other shareholders. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called Musk a visionary but said the pay plan was excessive and could set a bad precedent in corporate governance. He questioned whether Musk was worth that much. “He also presides over a company that has lost its edge, is being overtaken by rivals, and whose brand has been tarnished by Musk’s actions outside of Tesla," he said. 'PICK A NUMBER' Tesla’s shares closed up 3.6% at $350.84 on Friday. They are down 13% for 2025, although they have recovered from their lows. Investors worry about its deteriorating electric vehicle business and rising foreign competition. “One minute Tesla’s board is wondering if Elon Musk is a liability to the company given his outspoken views and political distractions, the next they’re effectively saying ‘pick a number, any number’ to lock him in for as long as possible," Coatsworth said. "Surely Musk should be fighting for his job, not Tesla’s board fighting to keep him?" This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Title: Stocks wobble as Wall Street wrangles with whether the job market is too weak

U.S. stocks wobbled lower on Friday as Wall Street questioned whether the U.S. job market has slowed by just enough to get the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to help the economy, or by so much that a downturn may be on the way. After rising to an early gain, the S&P 500 erased it and fell 0.3% below the all-time high it set the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 220 points, or 0.5%, after swinging between an early gain of nearly 150 points and a loss of 400. The Nasdaq composite edged down by less than 0.1%. The action was more decisive in the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled after a report from the Labor Department said U.S. employers hired fewer workers in August than economists expected. The government also said that earlier estimates for June and July overstated hiring by 21,000 jobs. The disappointing numbers follow last month’s discouraging jobs update, along with other lackluster reports in intervening weeks, and traders are now betting on a 100% probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting on Sept. 17, according to data from CME Group. Investors love such cuts because they can give a kickstart to the economy, but the Fed has held off on them because they can also give inflation more fuel. So far this year, the Fed has been more worried about the potential of inflation worsening because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs than about the job market. But Friday’s job numbers could push the Fed to consider cutting rates in two weeks by a steeper amount than usual, said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “This week has been a story of a slowing labor market, and today’s data was the exclamation point,” according to Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Strong hiring for health care jobs had been helping to support the overall market, “but with it now showing some tangible signs of decline, the foundation underneath the labor market seems to be cracking,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. While the data on the job market is disappointing, it’s still not so weak that it’s screaming a recession is here, and the U.S. economy is continuing to grow. A big question for investors is whether the job market can remain in a balance where it’s not so strong that it prevents cuts to interest rates but also not so weak that the economy falls off. Uncertainty about that helped lead to Friday’s swings in the stock market. Wall Street needs things to go as hoped because it already sent stock prices to records amid expectations for a Goldilocks scenario where interest rates ease, and the economy keeps chugging along. On Wall Street, Friday’s heaviest weight was Nvidia, the chip company that’s become the face of the artificial-intelligence boom. It’s been contending with criticism that its stock price charged too high, too fast and became too expensive following Wall Street’s rush into AI, and it fell 2.7%. Lululemon dropped 18.6% after the yoga and athletic gear maker’s revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ expectations. CEO Calvin McDonald pointed to disappointing results from its U.S. operation, while Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said Lululemon is facing “industrywide challenges, including higher tariff rates.” Still, more stocks rose on Wall Street than fell. Leading the way was Broadcom, which climbed 9.4% after reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Hock Tan said customers are continuing to invest strongly in AI chips. Tesla rose 3.6% after proposing a payout package that could reach $1 trillion for its CEO, Elon Musk, if the electric vehicle company meets a series of extremely aggressive targets over the next 10 years. Smith & Wesson Brands jumped 6.5% after the gun maker delivered better results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Mark Smith said it saw good demand for new products in what’s traditionally a slow season for sales of firearms. All told, the S&P 500 fell 20.58 points to 6,481.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 220.43 to 45,400.86, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 7.31 to 21,700.39.. In stock markets abroad, indexes in Europe lost early gains to turn lower with Wall Street. That followed strength across much of Asia. The Nikkei 225 rallied 1% in Tokyo after data showed accelerating growth in earnings for Japanese workers. Chinese markets rebounded following three days of decline, with indexes rising more than 1% in both Hong Kong and Shanghai. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.09% from 4.17% late Thursday and from 4.28% on Tuesday. That’s a notable move for the bond market and could mean lower interest rates are coming for mortgages and other loans.

Title: After 100 Years, Trillion-Dollar Fund Manager Wellington Wants You to Know Its Name

The staid, nearly century-old firm that mostly serves vanilla equity and bond strategies to buttoned-up institutions like pensions and endowments is moving aggressively into private markets and hedge funds and building its brand with retail investors. September 5, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Wellington Management Co. is a rarity in the investment world: a fund manager with more than $1 trillion of assets and almost zero brand recognition. Not for long. The staid, nearly century-old firm that mostly serves vanilla equity and bond strategies to buttoned-up institutions like pensions and endowments is now moving aggressively into private markets and hedge funds. Wellington is spending big to hire from bulge-bracket banks and alternative investment firms, adding dozens of private markets professionals to build a unit of about 40 people. It’s also hustling to build a brand with retail investors, many of whom have never heard of the $1.3 trillion firm. It’s a big change for a money manager that for decades didn’t care about what the world thought, as long as its big institutional clients were happy. Among its recent hires, Wellington recruited a head of private investments capital formation from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., poached a team from Pacific Investment Management Co. to expand in private credit and hired Christina Kopec Rooney from Goldman’s asset management arm to head its nascent push into the US wealth market. It even partnered with private equity giant Blackstone Inc. and Vanguard Group to launch hybrid funds for retail investors. Related:Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank Launch Alternative Investment Program for UHNW Investors In perhaps its most radical shift, Wellington – housed across 19 floors in Boston’s Atlantic Wharf – has done the previously unthinkable: It hired a public relations team. “It’s unfamiliar,” said Steve Klar, Wellington’s president. It’s a sign of the times. Tectonic shifts in asset management are pushing the firm, and others like it, out of their comfort zone. Traditional asset managers under pressure from outflows and fee compression in their mutual funds are striving to break into the more lucrative private markets to boost their margins and assets before their competitors gain all the spoils. Rivals such as Franklin Resources Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc., and even the likes of industry giants BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp., are diving in headfirst, buying alternative investment firms or partnering with private equity shops to launch funds. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it will purchase as much as $1 billion of T. Rowe Price shares as the two team up to sell private-market products. Wellington’s Chief Executive Officer Jean Hynes said in an interview at the firm’s headquarters that despite relying mostly on stickier institutional money, she knows the firm isn’t immune to the intense pressures reshaping the asset management industry. Client migration to cheap passive funds has pushed the industry’s average fee down to just 0.3% from about 1% two decades ago, according to Morningstar Inc. (Vanguard — Wellington’s largest client, accounting for about a third of the firm’s assets — charges an average fee of 0.07%.) Related:Goldman to Buy $1 Billion of T. Rowe Stock as Firms Team Up Wellington argues it’s especially well positioned among its peers to go big on private markets. The firm’s executives say its private partnership structure – with no shareholders to answer to – gives the firm control, allowing it to play the long game and retain its tight-knit culture. Michael Carmen, a partner at Wellington who’s behind the expansion, says that an ambitious 10-year plan kicked off in 2023 to grow the private markets unit that now manages only $9.7 billion. He’s even interviewing candidates to start a secondaries business to acquire illiquid positions from other investors, one of the hottest areas in alternative investing. Its new emphasis on higher-fee alternatives is already shifting internal power dynamics at a time when different teams inside the firm are fighting for resources. Some who work in the more traditional, lower-fee parts of the business say that as private markets become more prominent at the firm, the rewards are going disproportionately to employees who work in that business, according to people familiar with their thinking. Related:No Gold in Morningstar’s First Batch of Semiliquid Ratings Klar, one of three people who determines partner compensation, said this is not the case. If the privates business does well, then all the partners at Wellington benefit, he said. While most of Wellington’s assets are in privately held accounts, for which information isn’t available, data for its public funds offer a glimpse into the industry’s struggles. About 160 funds with combined assets of a half-trillion dollars managed or sub-advised by the firm recorded outflows of more than $130 billion between 2022 and the end of June 2025, according to Morningstar. Wellington’s growing hedge fund franchise, set up in the mid-1990s, now manages about $20 billion in long-short strategies. While that’s a tiny slice of the firm’s overall assets, it accounts for an outsize share of the firm’s profits. To attract and retain the talent needed to generate the above-market returns many alternative investment clients expect, the firm has also had to utilize other routes to a big payday besides its classic and lengthy path to becoming a partner. Alternative investment portfolio staffers are compensated in line with market standards, Klar said. For those deemed to have a big impact on the firm’s financial performance, there’s always the position of managing director — a role that allows staff to share in some of the profits without having been named partner. Wellington’s push into wealth is also forcing the firm to rethink another closely guarded aspect of its culture: its secrecy. For decades, the asset manager was so content with having a name known only among pensions and endowments that it made a point of not having a public profile. But Wellington often took its privacy to extremes. A former employee recalls that it was so hard to find information about the firm when he joined 20 years ago that he wasn’t sure it was a legitimate company until he had his first interview. People at bank wealth channels — which play a vital role in selling Wellington’s products to individuals — have said that everyday investors don’t know the firm and, for the funds to sell, the brand needs to be bigger. And so, Wellington has reluctantly begun hiring its first public relations people in recent years. It’s learning, slowly but surely, how to put itself out there. This isn’t the first time Wellington has had to reinvent itself. The firm, founded in 1928, faced an existential crisis 50 years ago after a disastrous run in equities nearly left it for dead. Its roughly two dozen partners at the time mortgaged their houses and used the money to delist the firm from the stock market. It later fired Jack Bogle, in 1974, after disagreements with Wellington partners over investment strategy and personnel matters. Bogle went on to found Vanguard, and Wellington agreed to run active strategies for his new outfit. Vanguard eventually became a household name synonymous with the 401(k) market, while Wellington built its brand with institutional clients and shunned the spotlight. In the ensuing years Wellington became less Boston-centric, opened offices and launched funds in Europe and Asia and abandoned a fixation on US equities to start investing in international stocks and, more recently, in bonds. (Today, about 40% of its assets are in fixed income.) As it looks to its next century, the firm is stretching further beyond the status quo. As part of its partnership with Blackstone and Vanguard, Wellington now oversees around 100 people globally working on the project. Terry Burgess, one of the firm’s top three decision makers, is in charge of the effort. Klar said that beyond courting retail investors, the firm’s alts expansion — and attracting talent for that business — is another reason Wellington wants its name out there. As it peddles its brand, Wellington now records podcasts, produces videos with weekly market updates, and churns out regular press releases. It’s a far cry for a firm that, until recently, never even had a publicist on the payroll.

Joseph Chalom, co-CEO of SharpLink, told Decrypt that the treasury company is currently staking almost the entirety of its holdings through its custodians, Anchorage and Coinbase. However, as the company matures, it will look to diversify the staking vehicles it utilizes as it seeks out higher-yield opportunities. “When you hold billions of dollars of ETH and you're looking at a portfolio of staking, there is going to be an ability to deploy that through staking opportunities on Linea,” Chalom told Decrypt. “And that is really, really important, not only to Consensys, but to the Linea Consortium. And if there are opportunities that SharpLink can avail itself of to get better yield, higher risk-adjusted yield through the Linea network, we will do that.” "SharpLink has been staking our ETH after purchasing through a combination of native staking and liquid staking tokens," he added. "As we expand our potential staking opportunities, we will be actively considering Linea-based staking opportunities." The co-CEO stressed the importance of driving real-world activity to “Ethereum-aligned” projects, Linea being one of those. He explained that by driving high-quality activity towards these kinds of projects, it should, in turn, also drive up the price of Ethereum—which is ultimately in the interest of SharpLink as one of the largest holders of ETH. “When I say we're here to support Ethereum, we're here to support Ethereum and the L2s that derive from it,” he added. “So not only allocating tokens for Linea bootstrapping [as part of the Linea Consortium], but also [exploring] potential opportunities in staking and liquidity provision, given how much ETH we as a treasury want.” Back in July, SharpLink joined the Linea Consortium—a group of companies that will steward 75% of the LINEA token distribution. Chalom said the Consortium is “mission-aligned” to make Linea a “highly successful” layer-2 network, adding that the token launch will “bootstrap” the network with more than 80% of the supply being used to support on-chain projects. Consensys, the creator of Linea, is led by CEO Joe Lubin, who is also a co-founder of Ethereum and the chairman of SharpLink's board of directors. As such, it's only natural that Linea aims to support the Ethereum base layer through mechanics such as native yield on bridged ETH and ETH burns—a response to the narrative that layer-2 networks take value away from Ethereum’s mainnet. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) That said, exactly how much Ethereum the firm bridges over to Linea and in what capacity it will be used to generate yield has yet to be confirmed. Five weeks ago, Ethereum celebrated 10 years of zero downtime. Next week, LINEA becomes the most significant token to enter the ecosystem since ETH itself. The eligibility checker is now live ahead of the September 10 TGE. Check yours at https://t.co/GDV3kRe0Kf pic.twitter.com/emB8WlqCNF — Linea.eth (@LineaBuild) September 3, 2025 "We are, at this point, trying to figure out what is the optimal portfolio of staking, beyond just vanilla, native staking through custodians,” Chalom explained. “We're also investors and staking liquidity providers to Liquid Collective, which is a liquid staking token. There are ways to drive more of the delegation to participants on the Linea network, even through native staking as well as liquid staking." “It’s early days. I’m not really comfortable sharing exactly what the plans are, because we’re trying to figure out the entire portfolio of staking,” he added. “Remember: The number-one thing an ETH treasury is supposed to do is preserve its capital. The second is to have that capital appreciate, and the third is to go along the risk spectrum and drive yield.” At the time of writing, SharpLink’s entire treasury of $3.6 billion worth of Ethereum—or approximately 0.69% of the total supply—is being staked with its custodians. However, the firm is on the precipice of diversifying where and how it is using its Ethereum. “We're at a pivotal moment in terms of opportunities to stake, and we want to do it in a way that really, really is diversified,” Chalom explained. “So I think what you'll find is we're going to walk before we run, but our goal is to drive the highest yields on a risk-adjusted basis for our investors.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

VANCOUVER, BC, Sept. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Equity Insider News Commentary – BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF inflows recently surged to $289.8 million (on Sept. 4)[1], marking another record day for institutional adoption despite August's $751 million ETF outflows that preceded this dramatic reversal[2]. Meanwhile, U.S. Bank resumed Bitcoin custody services on September 3[3], reflecting growing institutional demand as major financial institutions pivot toward digital asset infrastructure. This momentum positions publicly traded cryptocurrency companies to capture significant value as corporate America accelerates its digital asset adoption strategies, with leaders including CEA Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: BNC), Hyperion DeFi, Inc. (NASDAQ: HYPD), MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA), Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ: BITF), and Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN). Institutional analysts project Bitcoin could reach $130,000 by year-end[4] as regulatory frameworks solidify following MicroStrategy's latest $449 million acquisition of 4,048 BTC[5]. The convergence of pension fund allocations and corporate treasury strategies has created supply constraints that favor early-positioned companies capable of capturing both direct cryptocurrency exposure and the infrastructure demand supporting this institutional wave[6]. CEA Industries (NASDAQ: BNC) has bolstered its executive leadership by naming Dr. Russell Read, Ph.D., CFA, to its board as a non-executive director, marking another milestone in the company's evolution into a premier digital asset treasury platform. Dr. Read's appointment brings substantial institutional credibility, drawing from his extensive background overseeing capital deployment at CalPERS, Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, and Gulf Investment Corporation, where he managed hundreds of billions in assets across global markets. The timing of this leadership addition aligns with CEA Industries' accelerated BNB accumulation program, which has reached 388,888 BNB tokens valued at roughly $330 million. The company maintains an aggressive target of controlling 1% of BNB's total circulating supply by early 2026. "Since the announcement of their BNB Treasury, CEA Industries has swiftly established itself as a global leader in digital asset treasury management," said Dr. Read. "I look forward to working with David [Namdar, CEO of CEA Industries (BNC)] and the Board to further strengthen governance, expand institutional engagement, and position CEA Industries for long-term success." BNC's strategic focus centers on BNB's fundamental role as the backbone of the world's most utilized blockchain network for daily transactions and decentralized finance operations[7]. Rather than diversifying across multiple digital assets, the Colorado-based company committed entirely to BNB's ecosystem growth potential, believing this concentrated approach maximizes exposure to network effects while participating directly in on-chain yield generation opportunities. This conviction strategy emerged from a landmark private placement of $500 million that transformed the company from its previous business model into a dedicated BNB treasury vehicle. The capital raise attracted more than 140 institutional and crypto-native participants, including Pantera Capital, Arche Capital, ExodusPoint Capital Management, and Blockchain.com, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. serving as exclusive placement agent and lead financial advisor. BNB's appeal stems from its unique combination of utility and deflationary mechanics. The token facilitates millions of transactions daily while generating staking rewards and benefiting from quarterly supply reductions through automatic burning mechanisms. Unlike purely speculative digital assets, BNB demonstrates consistent economic utility across trading platforms, payment systems, and decentralized application ecosystems. CEA Industries' management team combines deep crypto expertise with traditional finance experience. CEO David Namdar previously co-founded Galaxy Digital and helped establish institutional crypto trading infrastructure. The newly appointed Dr. Read adds sovereign wealth fund management experience spanning multiple decades and geographic regions. Hans Thomas of 10X Capital directs treasury operations, bringing public company and capital markets expertise to the BNB accumulation strategy. The company addresses a significant market gap for U.S. investors who lack direct access to BNB through conventional brokerage platforms. BNC provides regulated market exposure to BNB's performance without requiring cryptocurrency wallets, exchange registrations, or technical blockchain knowledge. Investors can access BNB's ecosystem growth through standard equity ownership in a NASDAQ-listed company. Current market conditions appear favorable for BNC's strategy, with BNB recently approaching $900 price levels[8] while the broader BNB Chain ecosystem maintains approximately $120 billion[9] in total market capitalization. If warrant exercises reach their maximum potential of $750 million in additional capital, CEA Industries could accumulate BNB holdings exceeding $1.25 billion in total value. BNC represents a calculated bet on blockchain infrastructure adoption within traditional financial systems. For investors seeking regulated exposure to cryptocurrency markets without direct digital asset ownership, CEA Industries offers institutional-grade access to one of the most actively used blockchain networks in global finance.

(NASDAQ: HYPD) successfully established a cryptocurrency treasury reserve focused on the HYPE token and has accumulated more than 1.5 million HYPE to date, making it the first publicly listed U.S. company to implement DeFi strategies on Hyperliquid blockchain. The company closed a $50 million private placement financing and appointed cryptocurrency executive Hyunsu Jung as Chief Investment Officer and Board member. Hyperion DeFi has also announced a co-branded validator with Kinetiq, enabling the company to earn yield on its HYPE holdings while contributing to blockchain stability and security. "Through a disciplined asset management strategy, our holdings strengthen the balance sheet and help fund operations, which we believe will enhance long-term shareholder value," said Michael Rowe, CEO of Hyperion DeFi. "We don't just hold bitcoin, we put it to work." The company expects to deploy additional revenue-generating products while continuing development of its proprietary Optejet User Filled Device, with FDA registration anticipated for September 2025. MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA) produced 703 bitcoin in July 2025 and increased its bitcoin holdings to 50,639 BTC, solidifying its position as the second-largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin globally. The company won 207 blocks in July and increased its energized hashrate by 3% to 58.9 EH/s while maintaining operational efficiency despite higher than expected curtailment at Ohio sites. "Unlike passive treasury companies, we treat our bitcoin as a productive, risk-managed asset. Through a disciplined asset management strategy, our holdings strengthen the balance sheet and help fund operations, which we believe will enhance long-term shareholder value. We don't just hold bitcoin, we put it to work," said Fred Thiel, MARA's chairman and CEO. MARA holds over $5 billion in liquid assets as of June 30, 2025, with nearly $1 billion raised since then to fund domestic growth and international expansion. The company is preparing to energize its Texas wind farm data center in the second half of 2025 while pursuing strategic international opportunities. Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ: BITF) reported revenue of $78 million for Q2 2025, up 87% year-over-year, while maintaining a gross mining margin of 45% and earning 718 BTC at an average direct cost of $48,200 per bitcoin. The company has total liquidity of approximately $230 million comprised of $85 million in cash and $145 million in unencumbered Bitcoin, holding 1,402 BTC as of August 11, 2025. Bitfarms commenced a corporate share buyback program and has already repurchased 4.9 million shares or 10% of shares available under the program at an average price of $1.24 per share. "With minimal 2025 capex remaining and strong liquidity comprised of a growing Bitcoin treasury, approximately $85 million in cash, a debt financing in place with Macquarie, and consistent cash flows from our mining operations, we are well-positioned to execute on our HPC/AI infrastructure, share buyback, and U.S. pivot strategies," said Jeff Lucas, CFO of Bitfarms. The company has submitted its Master Site Plan for HPC/AI development at its Panther Creek campus to Macquarie Group under the previously announced $300 million debt facility while partnering with T5 Data Centers to advance development initiatives. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN) completed its acquisition of Deribit, the world's leading crypto options exchange, making Coinbase the most comprehensive global crypto derivatives platform with roughly $60 billion of current platform open interest. Deribit generated over $30 million in July transaction revenue following a record month with over $185 billion in trading volume and over $1 trillion traded in the past year. The acquisition brings together spot, futures, perpetuals, and options trading capabilities on a single platform while positioning Coinbase to capitalize on surging institutional flows in the crypto options market. "This acquisition brings us closer to offering the full spectrum of trading products — spot, futures, perpetuals, and options — all in one seamless platform. In addition to product breadth, it enables us to scale globally with broader participation and deeper liquidity," said Coinbase in their announcement. "Together, we're building the future of crypto derivatives markets: faster, more sophisticated, and more accessible than ever before." Coinbase expects Deribit to be Adjusted EBITDA accretive immediately after close, with the combined platform positioned to lead the next wave of innovation as the crypto options market continues heating up with institutional participation.

Title: Jumbo-rate-cut chatter is rising after a dismal jobs report
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/jumbo-interest-rate-cut-odds-august-jobs-report-labor-market-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-05T14:44:05Z
Full Content:
The job market tripped up big time last month. In a way, that's exactly what the market was looking for. Investors are taking weak August jobs data as a green light to fully expect the Fed to cut interest rates at its next policy meeting — a major bullish catalyst for stocks that the market has been anticipating all year. The priced-in probability that the Fed will cut rates at its September FOMC meeting surged to 100% Friday morning, shortly after jobs growth was found to badly miss expectations in August. The odds of a jumbo-sized 50 basis-point rate cut also jumped to around a 12% chance the Fed could make the decision to announce the equivalent of two rates. It's a relatively rare occurrence, although the Fed did announce a jumbo cut in September 2024 as well. "The labor market is soft, even though the economy is in pretty good shape, meaning the Fed's got to cut," Rick Rieder, the CIO of global fixed income at BlackRock, where he oversees $2.4 trillion, told Bloomberg after the report. "I think the Fed could cut 50 basis points. I think they should." David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Business Insider that while a jumbo rate cut is in play, he still needs to see more data. "Whether they cut 50 or not, depends upon the strength of the inflation number that we get next week," he said. The jobs report is another example of how bad news is turning into good news for the market as investors eye soon-to-come monetary policy easing. Jobs growth over the last four months has been lackluster and fueled concerns about a potential recession, but the prospect of rate cuts being just around corner is too good for investors to pass up, explaining why stocks remain around all-time highs. The economy added just 22,000 jobs over the month of August, falling significantly short of the 75,000 job gains that were expected for the month. Several sectors in the labor market also showed net job losses. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, ticked higher to 4.3% from 4.2%, the highest jobless rate recorded since 2021. "With the weak job growth, the Fed is cleared to cut rates in September. The question is whether we get 25bp or 50bp," Scott Helfstein, the head of investment strategy at Global X, wrote in a note on Friday. "Job growth is clearly signaling a slowdown in the economy," Kevin O'Neil, a senior research analyst at Brandywine Global, wrote in a note. "The weakness in the labor market is too significant for the Fed to ignore," he added. The jobs report didn't contain all bad news. Wage growth remained steady and grew at a 3.7% clip year-over-year, offering one glimmer of optimism, Helfstein added. "Though there may be fewer new jobs, wages growing faster than inflation means the consumer is likely to keep spending, and that remains an important driver in this part of the economic cycle. That may be the silver lining here," he said. Jump to

Title: Crypto pours into TradFi faster than Wall Street can keep up, says Franklin Templeton’s crypto lead

About us Copy link The race to attract crypto investors is heating up. While some traditional financial institutions had already begun experimenting with blockchain products, regulatory shifts in the US in 2025 have sharply accelerated crypto’s push into mainstream finance. Roger Bayston, Franklin Templeton’s head of digital assets, told DL News that the speed at which crypto firms are entering securities-related businesses is significantly faster than that of financial institutions adopting blockchain technology. “There’s the ‘have-wallet’ ecosystem, and the ‘want-wallet’ ecosystem,” Bayston said, characterising these two groups. “The ‘have-wallet’ ecosystem is likely to journey into the securities-related businesses faster than the ‘want wallet’ ecosystems. In the past few weeks, Bayston’s “have-wallet” players have indeed stormed traditional finance en masse. On Wednesday, Ondo Finance, a tokenisation platform, announced that it would enable users to trade tokens representing over 100 stocks and exchange-traded funds on Ethereum. ‘The “have-wallet” ecosystem, which was tremendously influential in the election.’ Earlier this year, heavyweight crypto exchanges, including Kraken and Coinbase, announced plans to offer users stock trading as well. This influx is largely due to the drastic changes in the US under President Donald J. Trump. In July, he signed into law landmark legislation that makes the issuance of stablecoins legal for banks and non-banks. Trump-appointed commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission have either paused or halted several high-profile lawsuits against numerous crypto companies, too. “The ‘have-wallet’ ecosystem, which was tremendously influential in the election, and got them regulations melted away, and many new ideas moving forward,” Bayston said. Traditional financial institutions, by contrast, have gradually inched onto the blockchain over the past few years. Franklin Templeton was one of the first, after it launched its BENJI fund on Ethereum in 2021. Other prominent brands, such as BlackRock, the $12 trillion asset manager, launched a similar money market fund in November 2024. These days, the tokenisation market, a niche representing the total of various financial instruments that exist on the blockchain, is now worth more than $28 billion, according to RWA.xyz. Bayston believes these two disparate worlds will soon merge into a single market, portfolio by portfolio — so long as a business can cater to the full range of investor interests. “It’s going to be a 24/7 environment where you can highly customise your portfolio, and the more customisation that can be delivered, the stickier the assets are for that platform,” he said. Naturally, Bayston and Franklin Templeton expect to be well placed for this transition. “Navigating that kind of in-between space as all of these things move forward is something we find to be a very promising thing to be doing.” Liam Kelly is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

Title: Tokenization Is 'Mutual Fund 3.0,' Bank of America Says

Full Content:
Bank of America (BAC) sees tokenization, the creation of a virtual investment vehicle on the blockchain linked to a tangible asset, as the next phase in the evolution of investment products, describing it as “mutual fund 3.0,” the Wall Street bank said in a Friday report. Just as mutual funds first emerged in 1924 and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reshaped investing in the 2000s, blockchain technology could underpin a new generation of financial vehicles, analysts led by Craig Siegenthaler wrote. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is advancing quickly. The bank noted that firms like Securitize are working with managers including BlackRock (BLK), Apollo, KKR and Hamilton Lane to issue tokenized funds. Asset manager WisdomTree (WT) built its own tokenization engine, giving it the ability to offer more than a dozen tokenized funds. According to data provider RWA.xyz the value of real-word assets represented on-chain exceeds $28 billion, largely in private credit and Treasuries. Still, regulation remains a headwind. The GENIUS and Clarity Acts address stablecoins, but leave many questions about tokenized funds unresolved. Still, the bank argues, the advantages of tokenization will drive adoption over time despite limited access for U.S. investors today. The case for tokenized equities is weaker because U.S. brokers already offer commission-free stock and exchange-traded fund (ETF) trading after Robinhood’s (HOOD) disruption in 2019, the analysts wrote. That shift pushed firms toward monetizing client cash and order flow, making tokenized versions of these assets less compelling, the bank's analysts said. But tokenized money market funds, powered by smart contracts, could upend those cash sweep economics and open new revenue models. Distribution is still the bottleneck. Platforms offering tokenized funds remain rare, though online brokers like Robinhood, Public and eToro (ETOR) are well positioned given their crypto businesses and younger, self-custody-oriented client bases. Coinbase (COIN) may also emerge as a partner as it expands beyond pure crypto, the report added. Bank of America expects tokenized money market funds to lead adoption thanks to their attractive yields relative to stablecoins, which cannot pay interest under the Genius Act, with private credit and high yield likely to follow.

President Éamon de Valera with John F Kennedy during the US president's Irish visit in June 1963. The campaign to elect the president of Ireland is not fully up and running. While we wait, I like to look back at presidents and visitors to Áras an Uachtaráin such as General Montgomery of World War II fame, who was keen to meet President Éamon de Valera as he greatly admired him. De Valera was elected to two terms as president – in 1959 and in 1966, at the age of 83. He was involved in Irish history’s big moments – from the 1916 Rising, the War of Independence and the Civil War. He was Taoiseach during World War II and attended the funerals of President John F Kennedy in 1963 as well as those of civilians shot dead on Bloody Sunday in 1972. As well as Montgomery, other visitors to the Áras included Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Princess Grace of Monaco. Nearly a quarter of a million people lined his funeral route in September 1975. Erskine Childers was elected in 1973, but died of a heart attack in 1974. A minister in various Fianna Fáil governments, his father took part in the War of Independence and was executed in the Civil War. Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh was a judge at the European Court of Justice. He believed that the office of president was publicly disrespected in 1976 by the coalition government when he had legal concerns about a security bill it wanted him to sign into law. He referred it to the Supreme Court to check its constitutionality before signing it into law. He resigned as a protest on the lack of respect for the presidency. Mary Robinson was our first female president to be elected, in 1990, and is still in public life. She visited Egypt’s border with Gaza last month to hear of problems in getting food aid into war-torn Gaza. President Michael D Higgins also speaks strongly on human rights. He has criticised the EU for not responding adequately to the Gaza crisis. He may be remembered as our foremost humanitarian president. Mary Sullivan, College Road, Cork Having read Oliver Callan’s article on the presidency (‘Gentleman Jim will treat his rivals fairly in most bloodless presidential race ever’, Irish Independent, September 4), I wish to say that although I am an ardent GAA fan, I know little of the character of Mr Gavin, even if he did oversee the greatest ever Dublin team. Mr Callan could be right, but I do not believe there is any such thing in politic as a bloodless battle. He is confident that Mr Gavin only has to turn up, and that it will be akin to Dublin playing Carlow, in terms of results. If it was that simple, politics would not be the art of the possible. The dutiful Fianna Fáil backbenchers lined up on the plinth of Leinster House on Wednesday like altar boys. But it’s not over yet. Mr Callan is overlooking the fact the nature of the campaign is brutal for all: any ­possible flaw is hunted for and pounced upon. This contest could turn into a clash more like the epic Meath v Dublin sagas of old. Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo The presidential campaign reminds me of the The Traitors Ireland TV show. Allow me to explain. Catherine Connolly was first out of the traps with great enthusiasm. She is like David. From Wednesday’s Irish Independent, he was “breakdancing in the sitting room, jumping over the back of the sofas”. Sadly for him, he was given the bum’s rush early on. Jim Gavin says little. He is like Paudie, who is playing a similar game. So far he has attracted little negative attention and is predicted to go far. Heather Humphreys is like Eamon, the garda who is not a garda. He is too cool for school, but already he is attracting suspicion. He burned brightly at the start, but his flame is now dimming. Billy Kelleher, with an impressive political CV, is like Niall the Gaeilgeoir teacher who saved the day because of his “líofacht sa Ghaeilge”, only to be dispatched for exactly the same reasons. Who will ultimately be crowned president of Ireland and scoop the top prize of €250,000? You decide in a public vote on October 24. Tommy Roddy, Ballybane, Co Galway Israel is conducting genocide in Gaza before the eyes of the world. The UN has formally declared that there is a famine in the area. The response from the US and its president, who once claimed that he could end this shameful tragedy overnight, is nothing more than grandstanding and play-acting. The murderous situation in Gaza could be ended by the US and Western democracies working together to this end. They should do so before Gaza becomes another indelible stain on the conscience of humanity. J Anthony Gaughan, Blackrock, Co Dublin Thank you Raymond Deane for your comment (Irish Independent, Letters, September 4). I did vote for Brexit, and believe Britain has “shared values” with Europe, especially Ireland. For the record, I do not support the UK selling arms to Israel so viciously used against innocent Palestinian people by the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who stands indicted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. Hopefully, in the near future, an independent Palestine can take its rightful place on the world stage alongside a reunited Ireland. Dominic Shelmerdine, London The ongoing strike by school secretaries and caretakers exposes a serious injustice in our education system. These vital workers are still denied basic entitlements – pensions, fair sick leave and bereavement leave. It’s unacceptable. Schools depend on these people every day. Secretaries manage medical needs, maintain records and act as first responders in emergencies. Caretakers handle fire safety, hygiene and building security. Without them, schools cannot operate safely, or at all. To deny these workers fair conditions is not only unfair: it puts children’s health and safety at risk. As a retired teacher, I know schools are held together by the work of these professionals. I urge fellow educators to support them on the picket lines and demand the Government resolve this dispute with justice and respect.

Title: From fish and chips to baba ganoush: Corinna Hardgrave’s favourite takeaways around Ireland

It’s hard to believe I’ve been writing this takeaway column for more than three years – the extra kilos prove it. This is my final article on takeaways, and instead of a top 10 – I’ve too many favourites – here are the places that stood out. Eunice Power opened AndChips on the Quays in Dungarvan, Co Waterford, in 2019, serving only wild Irish fish, a model for how fish and chips should be done. Also excellent is Fish on MacCurtain Street, Cork, where the fritto misto and cod and chips are the things to order. The Little Saltee in Kilmore Quay, Co Wexford is top notch. For seafood, there’s Julia’s Lobster Truck in Ennistymon, Co Clare, with scampi po’ boy, and lobster and chips; and in Letterfrack, Co Galway, Snappy Snappy is the spot for crab rolls. Grá Pizza in the North Kildare Sports Club in Maynooth does great pies such as The Flann O’Brien with Ballymakenny potatoes and cheese. In Dublin, Doom Slice’s Detroit-style is finished with a cheesy frico crust; Mani on Drury Street is famous for its carbonara slice; and Bambino on Stephen Street Lower serves classic New York-style slices. In Galway, the Dough Bros use The Wooded Pig’s pepperoni on the Pepp Guardi-Jala – a classic. Chiya on Dawson Street in Dublin 2 serves Berlin-style kebabs grilled on vertical rotisserie spits. Passion4Food on Clanbrassil Street Lower has the same sight: chicken and lamb doner kebabs on the vertical grill. At D’Grill on Aungier Street, Dublin 2, the mantos (steamed dumplings) are filled with lightly spiced minced beef and onions. Yalla in Dundrum goes beyond shawarma with standout baba ganoush and kibbeh bil laban. Umi Falafel now has branches in Dublin, Cork and Belfast offering notably good value for their falafel wraps. Dash Burger on Kevin Street Lower in Dublin 8 does first-rate smash burgers, while The Burger Cartel in Herbert Park, Dublin 4 (and other markets) does grilled burgers. Mad Egg on Charlotte Way, Dublin 2, fries free-range chicken to order. In Walkinstown and Tallaght, Ian Ussher makes a good Korean fried chicken at Cluck. In Letterkenny, Co Donegal, The Dirty Souls do Texas-style brisket. At Sumi’s Kitchen at Ryan’s pub in Beggar’s Bush, Dublin 4, the tawa pulao – spiced rice with vegetables – is a hit. Al Khair at the mosque on the South Circular Road turns out really good lamb nihari. Tadka House in Rathmines, Dublin 6 and Blanchardstown kicks up the heat with its Jaipuri laal maas, lamb in a sauce of Mathania chillies. You’ll find seekh kebab kathi roll at Joginder Singh’s Spice Village in Terenure, Dublin 6W, and Rialto, Dublin 8; Spice Cottage in Sallynoggin delivers rich north Indian dishes like lamb kohlapuri; and The Little Yeti in Loughlinstown does Nepalese steamed dumplings. Hyderabadi Kitchen on Camden Street, Dublin 2, specialises in dosas, and in Cork, Spice Genie pops up at Midleton Market, Co Cork, with masala dosa. The Pie Guys pop up at The Black Market in Dornan’s Yard and Cork’s English Market. Pies, such as Beef and Beamish, come with buttery mash. Argentinian chef Victor Franca grills on a custom-built parilla at Nua Asador in Cork’s Marina Market. For Dublin’s work crowd, Tiller and Grain – run by Ottolenghi alum Clair Dowling – is the place for salads, as are Jack and Theo Kirwan’s Sprout branches, using produce from their Kildare farm. For sandwiches, there’s Green Bench on Montague Street, Dublin 2 (try the hoisin pork or veggie hot pot), Little Geno’s on St Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2 (classic Reuben), and Carved in Grand Canal Dock and Ballsbridge, Dublin 4 (porchetta with fennel). On Parnell Street, Dublin 1, Pho Kim’s rice paper spring rolls make a fresh, aromatic lunch. For rotisserie free-range chicken, head to Poulet Bonne Femme in Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock and Avoca. And in Kenmare, Co Kerry, Bean & Batch delivers top-class sandwiches, sausage rolls and apple tart. Some takeaways are “heavy hitters” – spin-offs from big-name restaurants. At Kevin Hui’s China Sichuan to Go in Sandyford, Dublin 18, the star is aromatic duck with cucumber, spring onion, plum sauce and pancakes. At Sunil Ghai’s Street in Dublin 14, the Punjabi black dal – lentils slow-cooked for 36 hours – is legendary, while Asheesh Dewan’s Jaipur in Dalkey serves the best takeaway biryani. At Una in Ranelagh, Dublin 6, queues form for sourdough from John Wyer of Forest Avenue; alongside focaccia, quiche and pastries. Some cuisines were entirely new, like Australian chef Mark Senn’s Mushroom Butcher in Portobello, Dublin 8. He runs a weekend truck with his partner, growing mushrooms next door and changing the menu every two weeks, with highlights including mushroom acarajé. Mama Shee, once at Merrion Square market in Dublin 2, now runs a Nigerian/west African canteen in Tallaght – the goat curry is essential; and Georgian Delight in the Moore Street Arcade, Dublin 1, introduced me to acharuli khachapuri, bread filled with molten cheese and a soft egg yolk. Three years, too many kilogrammes and countless plastic containers later, what stays with me is the proof that independent operators can be as inventive and committed to quality produce as any top dining room. It has been a joy eating through it – now the only thing left is to put down the delivery bag and get on the treadmill. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC
