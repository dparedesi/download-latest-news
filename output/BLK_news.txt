Title: Stock market today: Asian shares gain after China says more help is needed for its slowing economy

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are rising Monday to add to their all-time highs. The S&P 500 was up 0.8% in afternoon trading and building on its record set on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average came back from an early loss to rise 212 points and add 0.5% to its own record, as of 2:25 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was up 0.9%. The gains followed relatively quiet trading in Europe, while the U.S. bond market remained closed for the day because of a holiday. The strongest action in global markets came from China, where the finance minister gave a highly anticipated update on Saturday about plans for the world’s second-largest economy. Lan Fo’an said the government is looking at additional ways to boost the economy, but he stopped short of unveiling a major new stimulus plan that investors were hoping for. The lack of detail sent markets spinning. Stocks in Shanghai jumped 2.1%, but the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell 0.7%. Crude oil prices, meanwhile, sank roughly 2% on worries about demand from China’s slowing economy. Hopes for big stimulus in China have sent Chinese stocks sharply higher recently after they languished for years. But investors are skeptical about how much it can remake and restore the economy. “While clearly welcome, the efforts may be insufficient to spur a new reflationary cycle,” according to Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Besides oil, prices also fell for copper and other commodities that a healthy Chinese economy would gobble up. That helped drive down prices for miners, such as Freeport-McMoRan, which fell 2.8% for one of the larger losses in the S&P 500. Boeing lost 1.4% in its first trading since the aerospace giant warned that it expects to report that it burned through $1.3 billion in cash during the latest quarter and lost $9.97 per share. Boeing also said it was laying off 10% of its workforce as it tries to deal with a strike that is crippling production of the company’s best-selling airline planes. On the winning side of Wall Street was SoFi Technologies. It rose 10.3% after announcing a $2 billion loan platform agreement with investment firm Fortress Investment Group, where SoFi will refer pre-qualified borrowers. Longboard Pharmaceuticals soared 51.2% after H. Lundbeck, a Danish company, said it would buy the biopharmaceutical company in an all-cash deal valuing it at $2.6 billion. This upcoming week will have few top-tier economic reports outside Thursday’s update on sales at U.S. retailers to help guide trading. That will likely leave more emphasis on corporate earnings reports, which will pick up the pace this week after big banks began the reporting season last week. Bank of America, Johnson and Johnson and UnitedHealth Group will all report their latest results on Tuesday. Later in the week will come United Airlines, Netflix, American Express and Procter & Gamble. Analysts are looking for S&P 500 companies to deliver overall growth of 4.1% in earnings per share for the latest quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet. If they're correct, it would be a fifth straight quarter of growth. Solid, continued growth in profits for companies would help tamp down criticism that's built up about how expensive the broad stock market looks, after share prices ran higher faster than earnings. Stocks have broadly rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. Recent reports showing the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected have also raised optimism that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing where it gets inflation down to 2% without causing a recession that many had thought would be necessary. ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.

Title: US stock futures muted with Q3 earnings, Fed cues in focus

Investing.com -- US stocks traded higher on Monday as investors awaited more third-quarter earnings and potential comments from several Federal Reserve officials on monetary policy. At 11:04 ET (15:04 GMT), the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up by 62 points, or 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 index rose 31 points or 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 116 points or 0.6%. The third-quarter earnings season is set to pick up in earnest this week, with more results from the country's banking giants as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are set to report on Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) on Wednesday. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), chipmaking bellwether ASML (AS:ASML) and streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are due to report during the week. Investors will be largely focused on whether corporate earnings were able to persevere despite pressure from high interest rates and sticky inflation. Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 2.6%, with managers at the aircraft manufacturer likely to find out later Monday more details about plans to slash around 17,000 positions, around 10% of its global headcount. It will also delay the first deliveries of its 777X plane by a year and book $5 billion in losses in the third quarter. B. Riley Financial (NASDAQ:RILY) stock soared 22% after the Wall Street Journal reported the Investment bank has agreed to sell its appraisal and valuations unit, Great American, to asset-management firm Oaktree Capital for about $400 million. This week also sees addresses from a number of Fed officials, which are likely to provide more cues on the central bank’s plans to cut interest rates further. Governor Christopher Waller, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari are expected to speak later on Monday, and there is strong interest in what they might say about the central bank's rate outlook. Markets will get another update on the health of the U.S. consumer on Thursday, in the form of the latest retail sales data. Investors will also study the latest news about additional stimulus in China, the second largest economy in the world. China’s finance ministry said in a weekend briefing that it will implement fiscal stimulus measures, including more debt issuance and support for provincial governments. But the government did not provide key details on the timing and scale of the plans. Oil prices fell sharply Monday, retreating after OPEC cut its demand growth forecasts, while Chinese inflation data raised doubts about the health of the country's economy. By 09:35 ET, the Brent contract dropped 1.6% to $77.77 per barrel, while US crude futures (WTI) traded 1.6% lower at $74.33 a barrel. Figures released over the weekend showed consumer price growth in China unexpectedly eased in September, while producer prices marked nearly two years of contraction -- data which bodes poorly for demand in the world’s biggest oil importer. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2024, marking the producer group's third consecutive downward revision. OPEC, in a monthly report released earlier Monday, said world oil demand will rise by 1.93 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, down from growth of 2.03 million bpd it expected last month. For next year, OPEC cut its 2025 global demand growth estimate to 1.64 million bpd from 1.74 million bpd. China accounted for the bulk of the 2024 downgrade, as OPEC trimmed its Chinese growth forecast to 580,000 bpd from 650,000 bpd. (Ambar Warrick and Peter Nurse contributed to this article.)

Billions worth of investments in emerging growth sectors including AI and life sciences, and infrastructure are set to be unveiled by businesses and ministers at the government’s inaugural International Investment Summit today (Monday 14th October). World leading CEO’s and investors from across the globe will meet with ministers, First Ministers, and local leaders at the Guildhall – a historic landmark which has served as the ceremonial heart of the City of London for centuries. Securing investment is central to the government’s mission to deliver economic growth which will create jobs, improve living standards, and make communities and families across the country better off. The government has already secured tens of billions worth of investments within 100 days of being in office. The International Investment Summit will provide an opportunity to build on this progress and showcase the UK’s economic strengths. The event will demonstrate that through serious, stable governance, the UK can establish enduring partnerships with businesses to boost investment and give investors the confidence they need to choose Britain. In a sign of intent to deliver on its central promise, this government has immediately made a series of major interventions to restore economic stability and create the right conditions for growth and investment. Business leaders this week hailed the UK’s “clear policy direction” as they announced over £24 billion worth of investment in clean energy projects. The government’s policy platform – including bolstering the Office for Investment, a robust Industrial Strategy, major planning reforms to unlock infrastructure and housing, and founding a National Wealth Fund to catalyse private money – will attract investment, kickstart growth, and unlock Britain’s potential. In his keynote speech opening the summit, the Prime Minister will outline how the government will build on this work, with a vow to “do everything in my power to galvanise growth including getting rid of regulation that needlessly holds back investment.” He is expected to say not enough has been done to make sure the UK is keeping pace with emerging industries. He will pledge to “upgrade the regulatory regime to make it fit for the modern age, making Britain fit to harness all opportunities.” In his keynote speech, the Prime Minister will make his ‘pitch for Britain’. On the value of stability, the Prime Minister is expected to say: “It’s not just that stability leads to growth – though we all recognise that. It’s also that growth leads to stability. Growth leads to a country that is better equipped to come together and get its future back. That’s why it’s always been so critical to my project. “We have a golden opportunity to use our mandate, to end chop and change, policy churn and sticking plasters that make it so hard for investors to assess the value of any proposition. “We have the determination, the focus on clear long-term ends, a mission-led mindset that thinks in years, not the days or hours of the news grid, needed to unlock that potential. Do not doubt that. “We are focusing on investment because the mission of growth, in this country especially, demands it. Private sector investment is the way we rebuild our country and pay our way in the world. This is a great moment to back Britain. This is great moment to back England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.” On regulation, he is expected to say: “We’ve got to look at regulation where it is needlessly holding back the investment, to take our country forward. “Where it is stopping us building the homes, the data centres, warehouses, grid connectors, roads, trainlines, you name it then mark my words – we will get rid of it. “We will rip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment and we will make sure that every regulator in this country take growth as seriously as this room does.” The government will ask the CMA to prioritise growth, investment, and innovation through their work as a priority and it will also be reviewing the focus of other major regulators. The regulatory review is just one part of the government’s work ensuring Britain is at the front of the queue for emerging opportunities. It builds on the recent creation of the Regulatory Innovation Office, which will curb red tape for cutting-edge emerging technologies, speed up approvals, and allow them to be rolled out to the public safely and quickly. These changes come at the same time as the government delivers on a key manifesto promise to establish a modern Industrial Strategy. Long called for by business, the strategy hardwires long-term stability for investors and plays to the UK’s strengths by focusing on eight growth-driving sectors. The summit will involve sessions with ministers and business leaders to discuss how together we can ensure the UK capitalises on emerging growth sectors including health tech and AI, clean energy and creative industries, for the good of working people. Confirmed speakers including Ruth Porat President & Chief Investment Officer of Alphabet, David A. Ricks Chair and CEO of Eli Lilly, Alex Kendall CEO of Wayve and Pushmeet Kohli Vice President of Research at Google DeepMind. The Prime Minister will take part in an “in conversation” event with former CEO and chairman of Google Eric Schmidt, moderated by CEO of GSK Dame Emma Walmsley to discuss how the UK can seize the opportunities of AI to drive growth and productivity, and it’s potential to improve public services such as health and education. The Chancellor will close the summit and take part in a panel event discussing investment opportunities in the UK with Group Chief Executive of USS Carol Young, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock Larry Fink and CEO of Brookfield Asset Management Bruce Flatt. Attendees will then be invited to an exclusive reception at St Paul’s Cathedral attended by His Majesty The King. Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson OBE said: “It’s never been a better time to invest in Britain. This summit is a hugely significant moment to showcase the UK’s economic strengths on the world stage and I’m delighted to be part of the government’s important work to drive growth and investment across the UK.” Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: “I’m delighted to be attending the International Investment Summit. With a new government, we are reclaiming Britain’s reputation as a magnet for global investment - bringing with it new technology, new ways of thinking and, crucially, new jobs across our country, meaning higher living standards. “London and the UK are open for business, trade and investment. I will continue working with the Government to forge new partnerships, reset relationships and seize the opportunity to secure long-term investment so that we can build a better London for everyone and deliver the change Britain needs.” Alex Kendall, Co-Founder and CEO of Wayve, said: “I’m delighted to join the inaugural International Investment Summit. The UK has a strong opportunity to lead in Embodied AI, especially in automated vehicles. “We appreciate the Government’s proactive collaboration with industry on intelligent legislation like the AV Act 2024. Their sector-specific approach to AI regulation is the right way to encourage both investment and innovation. “As we advance our Embodied AI technology into safe, reliable, production-ready software for global automakers, we look forward to continuing to work with the Government to harmonise global regulations and scale UK innovation internationally.” Ruth Porat Chief Investment Officer at Alphabet Inc said: “Google is proud of our long history of meaningful investments in local talent, infrastructure and digital skilling in the UK which help everyone participate in the benefits of the digital economy. With the UK’s rich academic heritage, particularly in the sciences, it is well-positioned to capture the many opportunities that AI can deliver. “The Investment Summit is an important moment to reflect on the progress to date, and how to best position the UK as a global leader in AI, with the economic and societal benefits this transformative technology can deliver today, and in the years ahead.” The following links open in a new tab Don’t include personal or financial information like your National Insurance number or credit card details.

Title: Cardano Isn’t Failing: Hoskinson Credits Voltaire for Addressing Long-Standing Issues

Cardano (ADA) introduced decentralized governance through the Chang hard fork upgrade that went live last month. While this upgrade made Cardano more decentralized, Charles Hoskinson believes it has also spurred negative sentiment around the project. In an X post, Hoskinson noted that allowing the Cardano community to contribute and voice their concerns about the project opened up “pent-up grievances” on a wide range of issues. “There have been years of pent-up grievances, unexplored road map items, unfunded growth strategies, and needed partnerships that haven’t been addressed due to Cardano’s governance not scaling to meet the needs of the ecosystem,” Hoskinson stated. The outspoken Cardano founder also noted that the Voltaire upgrade would introduce a new roadmap for the project. This roadmap will ensure that issues not previously addressed will be brought into focus to improve the network’s scalability. One of these issues is the Cardano sidechain solution known as Midnight. This solution will help boost the project’s liquidity. Furthermore, the blockchain is also boosting stablecoin support to boost usage. Hoskinson also stated that Cardano differed from the rest of the cryptocurrency industry by being more transparent. He mentioned that, unlike other projects, Cardano did not deal in “backroom deals and dirty tricks.” “It’s why we are loathed by a lot of others… Short-term thinking, market manipulation, and companies seeking a handout have no role or place here,” he stated. Hoskinson also bashed projects fighting for recognition on Wall Street through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He stated that ADA was one of the few cryptocurrencies that still wanted to be “real and not the patron of BlackRock and Wall Street.” Hoskinson’s statement has drawn reactions from the broader cryptocurrency community. X user @cardano_whale stated that the negative sentiment around ADA revolved around price action and engagement farming. However, not all community members believe that Cardano is doing well in terms of governance. One user noted that Cardano developers were supposed to improve scalability before introducing the Voltaire upgrade. Wasn’t IOG supposed to finishing scaling BEFORE Voltaire? So that part of the roadmap was supposed to be YOUR responsibility.Or am I wrong? Another user also stated that Cardano was suffering from a lack of volumes and declining usage, which pointed towards the failure of the founding entities. Furthermore, the few governance wallets limited the project’s level of decentralization. Cardano traded at $0.3468 at press time after an around 1.49% drop in 24 hours.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

Goldman Sachs recently lowered the price target on the stock to $500 from $515 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The investment firm slightly lowered free cash flow expectations after Microsoft's fiscal 2026 and 2027 artificial intelligence capex estimates. However, as Azure capacity comes online and AI revenue continues to scale, Microsoft should execute well against Goldman's expectations for 14% revenue growth, the advisory told investors in a research note. The investment firm said Microsoft’s earnings growth is still 300 basis points faster than the S&P 500, which justifies the stock's valuation. Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In an investor note, the advisory said it surveyed about 13,500 teens as a part of the firm's Taking Stock with Teens Fall 2024 survey, and based on the responses, it continued to believe the stock was fairly valued at current levels, as the data did not suggest a 2024 super cycle. However, Piper noted upgrade expectations were up from the 20% level in its Spring 2024 survey. In addition, only about 30% of teens were upgrading any of their Apple hardware in the next six months due to Apple Intelligence, which to the firm felt low given the enthusiasm. Piper acknowledged that the average iPhone among teens was about 3 generations behind the iPhone 16, meaning these older models could just be due for an upgrade.

Title: ‘Digitizing The Dollar’—BlackRock CEO Reveals His Radical Plan For AI-Powered Crypto That’s Predicted To Blow Up The Price Of Bitcoin And Ethereum

Apply now! The bitcoin price has fallen back from a 2024 all-time high of over $70,000 per bitcoin, reached on a tidal wave of interest in BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)—with the $11 trillion asset manager chief executive Larry Fink issuing a "crazy" Federal Reserve warning last week. Now, as MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor reveals his $100 trillion "end game," Fink has outlined his plan for bitcoin, ethereum and crypto—predicting "digitizing the dollar" is going to be "under discussion." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has predicted bitcoin will spark a digital revolution on Wall ... [+] Street, pushing the bitcoin price sharply higher... "We believe bitcoin is asset class in itself, it is an alternative to other commodities like gold," Fink, who last year led the charge on Wall Street to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to U.S. markets, said during BlackRock's third quarter earnings call, predicting bitcoin, ethereum and crypto will "overlay" with artificial intelligence. "And so I think the application of this form of investment will be expanded. Two, the role of ethereum as a blockchain can grow dramatically. So if we can create more acceptability, more transparency, more analytics related to these assets, then it will be expanded." Bitcoin and ethereum, via the new crypto ETFs that offer exposure to crypto without having to deal with exchanges or risk self-custody, have helped BlackRock’s assets under management to top $11 trillion for the first time over the third quarter. BlackRock's IBIT has seen net inflows of $21.7 billion since January, far outpacing Fidelity's second-largest spot bitcoin ETF with $10 billion of inflows, according to SoSoValue data. "When major players like BlackRock and Fidelity launch bitcoin ETFs, and begin selling that idea to their institutional and individual investors, I think it's very positive," Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, said in a interview with investment platform Saxo—putting his bitcoin price target at $170,000. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street this year was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock last year—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged this year, helped by BlackRock, setting a new all-time high over ... [+] $70,000 per bitcoin. "I truly believe we will see a broadening of the market of these digital assets," Fink said, pointing to BlackRock's experience with the mortgage market that grew along with data and analytics—"And then we’ll see how does each and every country looks at their own digital currency. That’s a very different asset than a bitcoin in itself. But I do believe what we’re going to witness as we build out better analytics." Fink called attempts in India and Brazil to digitize their currencies as a "big success." "How do we see in [the U.S.] the role of digitizing the dollar? And what role does that play," Fink asked. "That’s a very different question related to, let’s say, bitcoin and other items like that. But all of that is going to be under discussion." The debate around a digital dollar, also known as a central bank digital currency (CBDC), was electrified in 2019 when Facebook (now Meta) announced it was planning to launch a bitcoin-inspired digital currency before it was shut down by regulators. The possibility of a digital dollar, often compared to the digital yuan that's already widely used in China and used to monitor people's every day transactions, has sparked privacy concerns as well as questions over how it would impact the commercial, deposit-based financial system. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said the Fed won't create a digital dollar without the express authorization from Congress. One Community. Many Voices.

Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, will hold a private session on Monday to scrutinise the government’s industrial strategy green paper, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Monday 14 October 2024 01:50, UK The government will on Monday welcome more than £50bn of investment in the British economy as Sir Keir Starmer tries to reset his administration after a first hundred days marked by scandal and infighting. Sky News has learnt that the International Investment Summit in the City of London will comprise more than £50bn of deal announcements - or roughly twice the £28bn unveiled at the previous comparable gathering held under the former Conservative administration. The total figure to be announced on Monday was still being finalised this weekend amid continuing negotiations with companies. Politics latest: Minister doesn't rule out raising employer NI Sources said, however, that the final amount would "certainly" be in excess of £50bn. The summit will be attended by executives from globally important companies such as Alphabet, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and Deepmind. In recent days, a row emerged involving DP World, which had been planning to announce a £1bn investment in the London Gateway port. The company threatened to cancel its attendance at the conference and review the investment in the wake of comments by the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, labelling its P&O Ferries subsidiary "a rogue operator". After Downing Street officials intervened, the dispute appeared to have been resolved this weekend, with the investment proceeding. Sky News can also reveal that the summit will include a behind-closed-doors session chaired by the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and a number of chief executives. Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News The group will, according to insiders, jointly scrutinise a green paper on industrial strategy that will also be published on Monday. One invitee said they had been "asked to mark the government's homework". A source close to Mr Reynolds said: "When the business secretary said this government would work in partnership with business, he meant it. "We respect the expertise of business leaders and want their voice at the heart of policymaking. "That's why we're getting them around the table before the strategy is published, so it works for the industries it's designed to benefit." On Friday, Sky News revealed that Sir Keir would use his speech at the investment summit to say that his administration will scrutinise watchdogs across a range of industries to ensure that they are not acting as barriers to growth.

The event is being seen as a test of Labour's economic agenda in the eyes of investors which wield influence over the destination of trillions of pounds of investment funding. His speech will come, however, against the backdrop of a financial crisis at Thames Water, Britain's biggest water utility, which is backed by sovereign wealth funds and pension funds from countries including Abu Dhabi, Canada and China. Reports in recent weeks have suggested that global investors have become so alarmed by Ofwat's approach to the Thames Water crisis that they are reluctant to commit further sums to British infrastructure projects. On Thursday, the government appointed Poppy Gustafsson, the former boss of cybersecurity company Darktrace, as investment minister, ensuring that the government avoided the ignominy of staging Monday's summit without a minister for investment being in place. 👉 Tap here to follow Politics at Jack and Sam's wherever you get your podcasts 👈 Clare Barclay, who leads Microsoft's operations in the UK, has been appointed to chair a new Industrial Strategy Council.

The company's assets under custody and/or administration surpassed $50 trillion for the first time, marking a significant milestone. The acquisition of Archer is expected to enhance BNY's asset servicing capabilities and expand its wealth management offerings. Additionally, the introduction of Alts Bridge aims to provide wealth advisers with improved access to alternative investments. Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, BNY Mellon maintained a positive outlook, projecting flat core expenses for 2024 and aiming to return over 100% of earnings to shareholders. The company's transition to a platform operating model is anticipated to drive growth and efficiency, with full implementation expected within 18 months. BNY Mellon also highlighted its commitment to AI investment, establishing a dedicated hub with several hundred employees. This strategic focus on AI is expected to enhance revenue opportunities and improve employee efficiency. The earnings call reflected BNY Mellon's strong performance across various financial metrics and its continued focus on strategic initiatives to drive growth and innovation in the face of market challenges. BNY Mellon's strong third-quarter performance is further supported by data from InvestingPro. The company's market capitalization stands at $54.48 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the financial services sector. One of the most notable InvestingPro Tips is that BNY Mellon has raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years, demonstrating a consistent commitment to shareholder returns. This aligns with the company's stated goal of returning over 100% of earnings to shareholders, as mentioned in the earnings call. The company's P/E ratio (adjusted) of 13.98 for the last twelve months suggests that the stock may be undervalued relative to its earnings potential. This is further supported by another InvestingPro Tip indicating that BNY Mellon is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to its near-term earnings growth. BNY Mellon's strong financial performance is also reflected in its impressive price total returns.

Marius Merz: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'm joined by Robin Vince, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com. I'll also note that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 11, 2024, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin. Robin Vince: Thanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll start with a few remarks on the quarter, and then Dermot will take you through the financials in greater detail. In short, BNY reported strong third quarter results, reflecting growth across our three business segments and consistent execution on our strategic priorities. Stepping back, on the macro side for a moment. At the beginning of the year, markets had priced in significant monetary policy easing in anticipation of economic slowdowns. Despite numerous shifts in the macroeconomic outlook since then, we've now seen the start of the easing cycle in several markets around the world, including a 50-basis-point reduction in policy rates in the U.S. as the Federal Reserve recalibrates its policy stance to balance employment, inflation and growth. Following increased market volatility and a sell-off in equities in early August, markets recovered, and both equity and fixed income values ended the quarter higher. A little more micro, but relevant for markets. Around the most recent quarter-end, the market saw simultaneous flows into the Fed's reverse repo facility alongside the first meaningful usage of the standing repo facility, both of which we administer. At the same time, sponsored cleared repo volumes increased on the back of higher repo rates, possibly signaling a transition from abundant to ample reserves in the system, with potential implication for the pace of QT going forward. More broadly, while markets have been constructive, there are clearly risks and uncertainties ahead. And so, we constantly prepare and position for the many tail risks that exist from geopolitical tensions and conflicts to fiscal deficits and the impact of impending regulations and elections. Now, referring to Page 2 of the Financial Highlights presentation. As I said earlier, BNY delivered a strong financial performance in the third quarter, with strong EPS growth on the back of broad-based revenue growth and positive operating leverage. Reported earnings per share of $1.50 were up 22% year-over-year. And excluding notable items, earnings per share of $1.52 were up 20%. Total revenue of $4.6 billion increased by 5% year-over-year, and reported expenses of $3.1 billion were flat. Excluding the impact of notable items, expenses were up 1% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in our people and technology, while we also generate greater efficiencies from running our company in new and better ways. Pre-tax margin and return on tangible common equity improved year-over-year to 33% and 23%, respectively. For the first time in our history, we reported over $50 trillion of assets under custody and/or administration at the end of the quarter. Now, custody is not something we are, but it is something important that we do. This number one market position improves our unique vantage point as a global financial services company, and it provides opportunity to drive value across our portfolio of adjacent businesses to deliver more of BNY to our clients. We increasingly see that the true power of BNY's client franchise exists in the combination of capabilities across our leading Security Services, Market and Wealth Services, and Investments and Wealth businesses. We have the ability to enhance this and to deliver more to our clients by bringing new innovative solutions to the market from across the seams of these businesses. As an example, we recently announced the planned acquisition of Archer, a leading technology-enabled service provider of managed account solutions to the asset and wealth management Industry. Archer provides comprehensive technology and operational solutions that allow asset and wealth managers to access one of the fastest-growing investment vehicles in the industry, managed accounts, at scale, expanding distribution, streamlining operations, launching new investment products and delivering personalized outcomes for their clients. The integration of Archer should produce a positive impact across several of our lines of business. In addition to augmenting our asset servicing capabilities for managed accounts, Archer will provide our investments business as well as our Wove wealth advisor platform in Pershing with expanded distribution of model portfolios and access to Archer's multi-custodial network. Buy it once, use it many, if you will. The transaction is expected to close before the end of the year, and we look forward to welcoming the Archer team to BNY. Another one of the fastest-growing areas in financial services, alternatives, also presents a promising opportunity for us to deliver new client solutions across One BNY. We already have relationships with hundreds of alternatives managers as well as roughly $3 trillion of wealth assets on our platforms. We believe there is more for us to do to mine the opportunity and build the technology to reach across our franchise and unlock the fast-growing alternatives market for wealth intermediaries, advisers and the investors they serve. Last month, we introduced Alts Bridge, a comprehensive data, software and services solution built for wealth advisers. Alts Bridge aims to make investing in alternatives easier for advisers through a streamlined end-to-end experience and direct integration into advisers' existing desktops, starting with our Pershing NetX360+ and Wove platforms. As we continue to deliver new innovative products, we are also addressing the significant opportunity from enhancing our commercial model, making it easier for clients to navigate BNY. In order to accomplish this, we are promoting an enterprise approach to client coverage, and we are operationalizing our new commercial model. For example, over the summer and for the first time in recent memory, we brought together several hundred of BNY's client-facing commercial leaders from around the world as well as members of our executive committee for a two-day event we called Commercial Lift Off. This program enabled our top client coverage people and their business partners to take a One BNY view to account planning, creating a shared vision for serving each of our clients holistically across the entire relationship, generating new ideas to meet the clients' objectives and developing action-oriented plans to deliver on those goals. During the quarter, we also made progress toward running our company better, including the ongoing transition to a platform's operating model, enhancing the connectivity across our teams and empowering our people to drive change across the company. In September, we went live with the next step on our multiyear plan to unite related capabilities around BNY and elevate our execution by doing things in one place and doing them well. We now have about 13,000 or about one-quarter of our people working in our new operating model. As we've said before, powering our One BNY culture in order to be more for our clients and run our company better requires not just words, but action. I want to thank our people around the world for their hard work and for collectively pulling together as a team to create the change for our clients, for our shareholders and for one another. To wrap up, the combination of our talented team, our portfolio of leading businesses working together and the strength of our balance sheet gives us a great foundation to deliver more to our clients and drive sustainable long-term shareholder value. While our results in the third quarter demonstrate continued execution against our strategic priorities as well as progress toward our medium-term financial targets, our team remains focused on the work ahead. With that, over to you, Dermot. Dermot McDonogh: Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 3 of the presentation, I'll begin with our consolidated financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $4.6 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 5%. This includes 5% growth in investment services fees, reflecting higher market values and net new business across our Security Services and Market and Wealth Services segments. Investment management and performance fees from our Investment and Wealth Management segment were up 2%, driven by higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees. Firm-wide AUC/A of $52.1 trillion were up 14% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, net new business and client inflows. Assets under management of $2.1 trillion were up 18% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar. Foreign exchange revenue increased by 14%, driven by higher volumes. Investment and other revenue was $196 million in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in fixed income and equity trading. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects a strategic equity investment loss recorded in the third quarter of last year and improved results from our seed capital investments. Net interest income increased by 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting improved investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Expenses of $3.1 billion were flat year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items. This reflects higher investment and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Provision for credit losses was $23 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting reserve bills related to commercial real estate exposure. As Robin mentioned earlier, we reported earnings per share of $1.50, up 22% year-over-year. And excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.52, up 20% year-over-year. Pre-tax margin was 33%, and return on tangible common equity was 23%. Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter was 6%. Tier 1 capital increased by 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings and improvement in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returned to our shareholders through common stock repurchases and through dividends. Average assets increased by 1%. Our CEQ1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.9%. CEQ1 capital increased by 5% and risk-weighted assets increased by 1%. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders over the course of the third quarter. Year-to-date, we returned 103% of our earnings through dividends and buybacks. Moving to liquidity. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 116%, a 1 percentage point increase sequentially due to a favorable change in our deposit composition. And the consolidated net stable funding ratio was 132%, unchanged sequentially. Next, net interest income and the underlying balance sheet trends on Page 5. Net interest income of over $1 billion was up 3% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was helped by higher sponsored cleared repo activity [indiscernible] market volatility and increased client demand. Average deposit balances remained flat sequentially. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by 2% in the quarter and interest-bearing deposits were flat. Average interest-earning assets were [up 4%] (ph) quarter-over-quarter. Our investment securities portfolio balances as well as loan balances increased by 1%, and cash and reverse repo balances remained flat. Our broader liquidity ecosystem reached an all-time high at the end of the quarter of over $1.5 trillion worth of client cash across deposits, money market funds, securities lending, sponsor cleared repo and other short-term investment alternatives. Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 6. Security Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 4% year-over-year. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 5%, primarily reflecting higher market values. For the third quarter in a row, the impact of repricing was de minimis. ETF AUC/A of $2.7 trillion was up more than 70% year-on-year, and the number of funds serviced was up 20% year-on-year. Inflows into ETFs on our platform remained strong this quarter with growth across all asset classes. As the ETF industry continues to grow, we are dedicated to scaling our best-in-class ETF service offering. For example, we have successfully onboarded several new liquidity providers to our electronic order execution platform to advance digital adoption. In Issuer Services, investment services fees were up 1%. Net new business and higher client activity in Corporate Trust partially offset by lower deposit receipt fees, reflecting corporate actions in the prior year. Against the backdrop of increased issuance activity, we continue to see strength in Corporate Trust, capitalizing on our investments in people and technology to enhance client service and scalability. In this segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 28% year-over-year, reflecting growth from newly onboarded clients as well as a higher level of client activity. Net interest income for the segment was up 2% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $1.6 billion were down 3% year-over-year, reflecting efficiency savings and lower severance expenses, partially offset by higher investments and employee merit increases. Pre-tax income was $642 million, a 38% increase year-over-year, and pre-tax margin was 29%. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 7. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 7% year-over-year. In Pershing, investment services fees were down 1%, reflecting the impact of lost business in the prior year, partially offset by higher market values. Net new assets were negative $22 billion for the quarter, reflecting the ongoing deconversion of lost business in the prior year, which is now largely behind us. Excluding the deconversion, we saw approximately 4% annualized net new asset growth in the third quarter. Wove continues to see strong client demand. We signed up 14 additional clients in the third quarter and we remain on track for the $30 million to $40 million of revenue in 2024 as we guided in January. Wove is helping us attract new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. For example, Pershing provides custody and clearing solutions for Sanctuary, a large and fast-growing wealth manager servicing the high net worth and ultra-high net worth segments. Sanctuary will also leverage Wove portfolio solutions, trading and rebalancing and reporting for teams that custody with Pershing as well as those that use another custodian. In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees increased by 16%, primarily reflecting higher collateral management fees and higher clearance volumes. Against the backdrop of a growing market and active trading, U.S. securities clearance and settlement volumes have remained strong. As you may remember, we created our global clearing platform earlier this year through the realignment of Pershing Institutional Solutions. We're pleased to see the pipeline of this platform continue to build for our full suite of institutional clearing, settlement, execution and financing solutions in over 100 markets around the world. In Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 11%, primarily reflecting net new business. The business continues to execute well against the growth agenda we presented in January. And we are seeing our investments in modernizing and digitizing our payments platform pay off in the form of growth in our strategic target markets. Net interest income for the segment overall was up 3% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $834 million were up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher investments and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was up 8% year-over-year at $704 million, representing a 46% pre-tax margin. Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 8. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $849 million, up 2% year-over-year. In our Investment Management business, revenue was up 1%, reflecting higher market values and improved [seed capital] (ph) results, partially offset by lower performance fees and the mix of AUM flows. And in Wealth Management, revenue increased by 6%, reflecting higher market values and net interest income, partially offset by changes in product mix. Segment expenses of $672 million were flat year-over-year as efficiency savings offset employee merit increases and higher investments. Pre-tax income was $176 million, up 7% year-over-year, and pre-tax margin was 21%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2.1 trillion increased by 18% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar. In the third quarter, we saw strength in our short-term strategies with $24 billion of net inflows into cash, reflecting our leading position and strong investment performance in our Dreyfus money market funds. Long-term active strategies saw $8 billion of net outflows, spread across multi asset, LDI and active equity, partially offset by net inflows into fixed income. And we saw $16 billion of net outflows from index strategies. Wealth Management client assets of $333 billion increased by 14% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 9 shows the results of the other segment. Before I wrap up, a couple of comments on the outlook for the year. Starting with net interest income. Remember, we began the year setting up for positive operating leverage despite an expectation for full year net interest income to be down 10% in 2024. While we're currently forecasting for fourth quarter net interest income to be slightly below what we saw in our strong third quarter results, the resilience of our net interest income over the first nine months of the year has positioned us to outperform our outlook for the full year net interest income growth rate from January by approximately 5 percentage points. Regarding expenses, we continue to work hard to keep core expenses, excluding notable items, for the full year 2024 roughly flat. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2024 to be at the lower end of the 23% to 24% range we estimated in January. And lastly, as we said at the beginning of the year, we expect to return 100% or more of 2024 earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And we remain on track having returned 103% of earnings year-to-date. In conclusion, our results this past quarter reflect broad-based growth across our three business segments and continued progress on our strategic priorities. We're pleased with the company's performance year-to-date and we're proud of our people who continue to execute well toward our medium-term financial targets, while we all remain focused on the work and the tremendous opportunity ahead of us. With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A? Operator: Yes. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You flagged some of the ETF wins that you had in the servicing side. So, curious about that. Number one, how much of that was the BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) business that you've won? And has the revenue from that win, that big win fully turned on? And did those dynamics have something -- or like is the fee rate lower? Because fees in asset servicing were up about 5%, but AUC, 16%, and I know sometimes the ETF fee rates are a little lower, so curious to flush that out a bit. Thank you. Dermot McDonogh: So, thanks for the question. I don't really want to get into the specifics on one client or transaction, but just to take a step back on ETFs generally, it is a growing market. You may have watched Larry from BlackRock on CNBC this morning. It is a secular trend. It is a very big and growing market, and we are a key player on that. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have $2.7 trillion on the platform, that's up 70% year-on-year, and the number of funds serviced is up 20%. That's on the back of strong leadership and a real investment in technology, so we can be best in class. So, without going into specifics, we're there to take advantage of the secular trend and we'll continue to innovate and solve for our clients' needs. Brennan Hawken: Okay. Thanks for that. Maybe if I could word it a little differently, the strong ETF growth that you have seen this quarter, is the revenue fully reflected this quarter or is some of those wins still have some revenue ramp to come? Dermot McDonogh: I would say it's the latter. It's, generally speaking, strong pipeline. We're always adding new clients to the platform and they -- because of the size of what's been on boarded, they tend to do it in a phased approach. So, some revenue is on the platform, some revenue to come. Brennan Hawken: Excellent. Thanks for that, Dermot. Thank you also for the update on NII, encouraging to see things working better. Could you speak to the deposit beta that you experienced with the first rate cut? And given that we're seeing rates coming down now, is it reasonable to think that deposits could begin to grow from here? Dermot McDonogh: So, the betas, I think, we've said on previous calls, we view it as symmetrical. So, for us, the first rate cut was 100% passed on. So, we feel pretty good about that. I think in terms of where we are in the Fed easing cycle, I think it's probably a little bit too early to see how that's going to feed into the deposit balance story. I think, overall, we've kind of -- we've held in there. We had a strong Q3 for a variety of different reasons. So, I would say, I expect where we are to moderate a little bit on balances in Q4 and we'll see what happens next with the next Fed meeting, but no significant change for us as we kind of sit here right here today. Brennan Hawken: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo: Hey, how are you doing? Robin Vince: Hey, Mike. How are you? Mike Mayo: Good. Look, I'm just -- that's a big number, the $50 trillion of AUC, nice round number. You did beat -- it's factual that you beat expectations for the quarter and the year so far, as you've highlighted. I'm just trying to figure out how much of this is lucky versus being smart. And I imagine it's a bit of both, but the lucky part is record stock market volatility, trading, some other factors in the market that have gone your way. And I don't feel like we have enough information on your client growth, the underlying client growth, the most repeatable part of the company. So, could you give some color on whether it's growth in clients or maybe it's revenues per client or maybe it's products per client or all those adjacent businesses that you talk about, how you're managing the company better versus simply a better environment to operate it? Robin Vince: Sure, Mike. It's Robin. I understand the question and it's obviously a very legit question. We broke through the $50 trillion. By the way, we ended at $52 trillion. So, the good news is we didn't stop at the round number. Look, I'd say that it isn't just fashionable, it's actually old-fashioned traditional just the way that we want to do it in terms of being able to have this deliberate growth and this focus. And so, we've tried to provide as much visibility as we reasonably can into the inputs of what it is that's ultimately driving this progress, because we understand we have benefited from a terrific backdrop in terms of markets. And of course, that's part of our business to be able to be well-positioned to take advantage of those backdrops. We've got parts of our business which respond to asset values, we've got parts of our business that respond to the number of accounts, we've got parts of our business that respond to software sales, transaction volumes, and having that multi-faceted set of business response functions, if you want to call it, that is actually a deliberate strategy so that we can participate in the growth of markets. And so, if you believe that overall debt issued in the world, equity valuations in the world, financial market activities are going to grow, we're trying to hitch our wagon to all of those growth trends. We think that's good. Having said that, to the heart of your question, this is the work that we've really done in the early days since this management team took over, which was to understand the components that we had and to really start to understand how they could work together, to how they could hum together in order to be able to unlock more potential. And so, we rallied the firm around three strategic pillars, this thing of being more for our clients. And that's just not just words, it's being about maturing this One BNY philosophy that we've talked before about. It's about having a different type of dialogue. It's about the movement over time to solutions as opposed to just products. It's like the examples that I gave and Dermot gave in our prepared remarks where clients are coming to us because we can do more than one thing for them. And it's not just that we're selling more things to them, it's that they actually want to take advantage of bundles of things, which actually provide a better solution to their business. And then, our second pillar of running the company better, that's been about sales rhythms and sales targets and bringing our people together and having them understand what it is that we're trying to do. And then, wrapping the whole thing is this culture of wanting to have a winning culture, wanting to push forward, wanting to make BNY of the future more than BNY Mellon was of the past. And those things are all quite deliberate, and we start -- and we believe that we're starting to see the results of that, although it's still early in our results. But Dermot can give you a couple of additional things on this which I think also would be helpful. Dermot McDonogh: So Mike, the way I -- from just thinking about it from a numbers perspective, right, we're up 5% year-on-year in fee growth, and constructive markets, and so, we've been able to take advantage of constructive markets. But a couple of important points that I would draw out is that in all three of our business segments, we've seen solid underlying growth. And in Robin's prepared remarks, he talked about the fact that we're evolving into a platform company. And when we have platforms that we're investing in at scale, so when you have high volume and you have constructive markets, we have the platforms in situ that can take advantage of that. Asset Servicing, we're winning and onboarding new business. We came into the year with a backlog. We onboarded the business throughout the year, and we're beginning to go into the Q4 with a bigger backlog than we came into the beginning of the year. So, Asset Servicing, I feel very proud of. Corporate Trust, Depository Receipts, Corporate Trust, specifically, a good margin business, but something that has been devoid of investment over a number of years and we've put money to work there in terms of leadership and scaling our technology, and that's going to be a business -- an important business for us in the future. And Treasury and Services and Clearance and Collateral Management have really kind of shown was when you have a scale platform with high volumes, strong markets, lots of issuance, lots of payments, you take advantage of that. And then, on just the client specific thing, albeit it's a small base and we can -- we've highlighted a couple of transactions this year where client -- we're able to have a much more sophisticated conversation with clients and clients are now buying from us across more than one line of business, in some cases, four lines of business. That was something that we just could not do a couple of years ago. And Robin's point about bringing the One BNY to bear on clients is really beginning to pay dividends. Mike Mayo: All right. Well, that was very comprehensive. Just last follow-up, are you implying, and by the way, on all the metrics, again, the client growth numbers, and thanks for peeling back the layers of the onion there, but always like even more layers, never enough for us, but in terms of growth in clients and more specifics going down the line. But the expense is clearly, Dermot, the flat expenses, that's very clear, that part of it. Are you implying even lower expenses in the fourth quarter based on your new guide today? Dermot McDonogh: So, look, the thing I would like to convey to you and to our shareholders is that we worked really hard over the last couple of years to build credibility that we are good stewards of our expense base, and we guided flat at the beginning of the year. And broadly speaking, there's been some pressure, I would say, on expenses that, for the most part, are revenue related. And so, if revenues are higher, there's some aspects that you just have to pay more expenses. So, while I've guided roughly flat for the full year, there may be a little bit of pressure over the course of that because of higher revenues. And also, as Robin said in his remarks, we've announced the acquisition of Archer and there'll be some integration costs associated with that. But I feel very good the fact that now we have 53,000 people who understand the importance of financial discipline and that goes to pillar number two of being a really well-run company. Mike Mayo: All right. Thank you. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just on -- just sticking with the revenue dynamic, talking about the -- obviously, the commercial lift off and the enterprise approach, the early traction that you're getting, I think, you referenced some clients now doing multiple services. Can you talk a little bit more about how you think that might impact the revenue growth trajectory? And then, also, just if you can just reconfirm the general revenue delta to equity markets? I think it was like 10% equity market moves can have an impact of about 1% revenue. So, I just wanted to sort of break apart those two dynamics, just really kind of showing that you're actually generating this revenue growth aside from markets. Dermot McDonogh: So, if I take the last question first, hopefully, that was your two questions in one go, so, a 5% gradual change in equity markets is roughly $60 million in fees annually, and a 5% gradual change in fixed income markets is roughly 40% -- or $40 million in fees annually. So that's a little bit on the sensitivity analysis. And so, on just the commercial lift off that Robin talked about in his remarks, it really is -- Cathinka Wahlstrom, who's with us now for over a year, spent the first year really on a listening tour and organizing roughly our 1,200 to 1,500 leading client coverage people around the world in terms of what we want our ambition to be, what are the products that we have and how can we educate our total force to be able to [indiscernible] there with clients delivering the whole of the firm. I think -- and also, if you kind of just talk about Archer for a second, I think a couple of years ago, if we were to do that acquisition, one part of the firm would have bought it for its business. And I think, Robin's point in his remarks are really, really important where you buy it once, you use it multiple times, and it's an acquisition that's done for the enterprise that will serve multiple lines of business. And that's how you should think about how our client coverage model is going to work in a strategic way going forward. We're going to deliver holistic solutions for our clients. Clients have a better understanding of the diversified nature of our business franchise, and they're just buying more from us. And it's just going to show up in revenue, and we feel very good about where we are today in terms of planning for the budget season for Q4 and the opportunities that are going to come our way in 2025. Brian Bedell: Great. That's helpful. I'll get back in the queue for another question actually. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein: Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, maybe just wrapping some of the comments you made around fee in a bigger picture question, when you guys think about a number of different growth areas you outlined some of the specifics, and obviously, the approach to cross-selling has taken a whole different turn here. So, when you use them out and you look at the business holistically, how do you think about the organic fee growth that the enterprise can generate over time? Dermot McDonogh: So, you're trying -- so we don't guide on fees, haven't done, don't intend to do it here, but what I would say is, and I gave this answer as an earlier question, we are seeing underlying growth across all three of our business segments. Our underlying organic growth this year, we feel quite happy about, and we feel it reflects a really good nine months of the year. And there's no reason to expect that, that momentum won't continue. And I do feel the way we've set up for the back half of this year and into next year, it's a kind of flywheel of innovation, and we have a lot of growth initiatives. And we've come together and we have a group of people who are working on what we call integrated solutions. And so, we have a number of interesting things in the pipeline. Robin talked about Alts Bridge in his remarks, talked about Archer in his remarks. There are things that we're doing within specific lines of business coming together. We talked about Pershing being realigned into Clearance and Collateral Management, and that's driving growth as well. So, the decisions that we've taken over the last couple of years in terms of realigning certain activities into different parts of the firm are showing up in our revenues this year, and we will continue to do that into next year. Robin Vince: And Alex, I'd just add, Dermot really alluded to this in what he just said, but right from the beginning, we've had two approaches. One is to think about this endeavor of fully realizing BNY's potential as a multiyear endeavor, and we recognize that there are going to be different ways in which that will come together in different years. And North Star, as you know, for us, is operating leverage, and that came about in a slightly different way in 2023 than it did in '24, and it could be different again in '25 as we really get into that conversation ultimately when we talk to you in January. But we've simultaneously invested in things that we knew would be important for the shorter term and for the medium term and for the longer term. And so, both Dermot and I have talked about this platform's operating model. That's a great example. There have been some benefits that come early on in that process. We brought like things together across the company. There have been benefits on the revenue side, there have been benefits on the expense side from doing it. But then, the value of having done it creates medium-term momentum because now we're able to be more dynamic for clients. We're able to solve problems more quickly for clients. And so, there's a payoff there. And then, over the longer term, it actually makes it easier to be able to assemble these new solutions that Dermot was just talking about. And again, there's a revenue story there, but there's also an expense story. And that's how we're thinking about it. Notwithstanding, we haven't given you a specific growth target number. Make no mistake, we're invested in creating that growth. Alex Blostein: Yeah. No, fair enough. I appreciate all of that. Smaller kind of tactical question for you guys. So, the repo activity continues to be quite elevated. You mentioned that in your prepared remarks as well. Is it possible to help size how much repo contributed sort of across the enterprise? It hits you in a couple of different ways. Obviously, there's the NII benefit and there's some fee benefits. So, as you think about the more normalized level of repo activity versus what you saw in the quarter, how big of a contributor was that in kind of totality? And as you look forward, given changes in monetary policy expectations, but also some of the client behavior that you mentioned earlier, how sustainable do you ultimately think this more elevated pace of activity in this market? Dermot McDonogh: So, on the repo question, so at cleared repo, for sure, we saw elevated activity, particularly going into the back end of the quarter and in the early part of this quarter. And that, in large part, contributed to the outperformance for the Q3 NII. That has now moderated somewhat. And so, in my prepared remarks, and in terms of the guidance, that's why I kind of feel like roughly for NII, we're about $1 billion for the fourth quarter. In terms of cleared repo, overall, as a kind of contributor to the NII over the course of the year, it's roughly about 5% of the number. As it relates to elevated activity in terms of volume and activity, I think from what we see on our platforms, we kind of see that continuing to be the case in the medium term. There's no reason for the slowdown. It's been a very strong year, very, very active client engagement, product innovation. And particularly on the international side, we said at the beginning of the year in our kind of strategic call in January that international was going to be a key area of ​​focus on the platform, and that's been the case, and that's shown up in the results. So, I think, overall, and I said in my prepared remarks as well, in terms of the liquidity ecosystem in total hit a high for us at $1.5 trillion. That's up from $1.2 trillion a couple of years ago, and that's in the backdrop of liquidity coming out of the system. So, we've grown quite substantially. And that, again, is coming back to connecting the dots across the firm, getting teams collaborating more, being more digital, providing innovative solutions to clients, and that is really powering the growth. Robin Vince: If I could just relate that back to a question that Mike had asked earlier on because I think these things are relevant, you got to remember that the strategy of us having roughly the right ores in roughly the right waters to be able to participate in things that are happening in the world, that's very important. So, if I just supplement what Dermot said, with the additional observation that we're the world's largest security lender that generates repo activity. We're the world's largest collateral manager, so we get to capture fees associated with people doing repo. We, obviously, play this role in the US Treasury market, which participates in the growth of US Treasury repo. We have all of these different touch points. And so, there are different ways in which we can collect across software, in some cases, services that we administer in others, and participation in different, both global markets and also product types, which align in indirect ways to that. So that's an important part of how we look at the overall system and understand how our products and services can help clients navigate those, and we can participate in the benefit of that growth. Alex Blostein: Yeah, that's a helpful framework to discuss it this way, yeah. Thank you, guys, both. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy: Hi, Dermot. Hi, Robin. Robin, can you give us some thoughts with -- obviously, you talked a little bit about the acquisition you accomplished in this quarter. What your outlook is for -- you, obviously, have very strong capital levels, your stock has moved very nicely this year and you get a better currency. What the outlook is for just other types of acquisitions if there are some that could be complementary to what you're currently doing? Robin Vince: Sure, Gerard. First of all, just make a quick comment about Archer. We're looking forward to closing that transaction in the fourth quarter and welcoming the team in. And this relates a little bit to a couple of other things that we've already talked about on the call. One is participation in markets and the other one earlier on, on ETFs. If you just think about the way that we view the world construct, once upon a time, they were mutual funds. More recently in the past decade or so, it's really been the explosion of ETFs. And there's simultaneous thing going on, which is the growth of separately managed accounts. And so, in the same way that Dermot described how we've participated in sort of outsized participation of the ETF migration, Archer is a transaction that prepositions us to be able to participate hopefully in an outsized way associated with the transition to separately managed accounts. So, it relates to that strategic question of growth and participating in different markets that we talked about. Now, stepping back to the other part of your question, really, the heart of it on M&A, look, our primary focus is what we have and how we can improve on it. And Dermot and I both talk a lot about the fact that we've looked very carefully at our businesses and we love our businesses. We think we have a great set of businesses. We think they are great ones to be in, and we think that they have a lot of adjacency to each other. And we think that the spread of those things can provide a lot more services to our clients in more joined up way of solutions than maybe we have before. So, it isn't that we do M&A from a position in any way of needing to do things, it's we're able to be very opportunistic, and we obviously like that a lot. But notwithstanding that we're pleased with what we have, we don't want to be complacent. So, we keep our eyes open, and we look at things, and Archer came about as a result of a strategic business review that we did internally, looking at long-term trends, looking at how we might adapt to those trends. And then, we went out and we looked very specifically for a capability that would do that, with the key emphasis being on the word capability, digestible bolt-on things that accelerate what we're trying to do or derisk delivery of what we're trying to do. And if we can buy a piece of technology that can be more efficient or less distracting than building it ourselves with a great team, great technology, ideally like this one, an installed book of business is also helpful, then we feel very good about it, as long as it aligns with those priorities, it's a good cultural fit, it has a good attractive return. So that's our M&A thought process. And then, if that fits into the overall waterfall, which we've talked about before, which is, if we have excess capital, we're going to, of course, be prudent. And so, we like excess capital. That's not a bad thing in an uncertain world. And so that's a very important consideration. Then, we look at whether or not we could invest it. Good news, as you know, we're a pretty capital-light model, we're very capital generative, so we don't need a ton of capital to reinvest in our business to keep growing it. Then, we look at whether or not we need something -- for some type of additional need, like the Archer example and then we distribute the rest. And this has, obviously, been a good year to see all of that on display. We've been prudent. We've run at elevated capital levels, and, as Dermot indicated, we intend to return 100% plus of net earnings to shareholders, and we've been able to make an acquisition. And so, this is a pretty good model year for how we think about the world. Gerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you for the answer. And then, just as a quick follow-up, Dermot. You gave us that sensitivity analysis about a gradual 5% change in the equity markets and fixed income and the impact it would have on revenue, was that for up markets, meaning if the gradual increase was 5% up, does that also reflect a down market, if markets were down 5%, that's the kind of impact we would expect to see? Dermot McDonogh: That's correct, Gerard, that's correct. Gerard Cassidy: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning. Robin Vince: Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala: I have a follow-up with some of your responses. I think, I guess, depending how -- maybe starting with just capital allocation, so heard your response to Gerard's question around M&A and such. But just talk to us how you think about means when we think about the valuation of the stock on price to earnings, price to tangible book, at the same time, this year has been pretty good market backdrop wise, and as an investor shareholder, you care about ROE resilience of these firms. So, one maybe, Robin or Dermot, talk to us about your comfort around ROE resiliency? If the market backdrop is unfavorable, what's the flex in the system? And given where things stand today, like how do you think about the stock valuation versus the commitment to return 100% plus in buybacks and dividends? Thank you. Robin Vince: I'll take the second bit first, and then Dermot will reflect on the first part of your question. So, the good news is that we can also pay attention to the way that you all think about the stock and your views of our stock. And we appreciate the fact that many of you have expressed confidence in our forward direction. We believe in ourselves as well. And so, what we do, of course, consider price as one of the many inputs into our capital return framework. We don't view current prices as being problematic in terms of continuing our stock buybacks. Dermot McDonogh: Ebrahim, when I took on the role a couple of years ago, I guess, I got a lot of questions about, is this just going to be more of the same or what's different? And now we're several quarters into the new team, and Robin has really kind of bolstered that team and through the strategic pillars, communication, the principles, the medium-term financial targets has really started to evolve the culture of BNY. And so, it is our commitment to deliver to our shareholders' positive operating leverage through the cycle. And so, if you just take a step back and look at this quarter's financials, 5% revenue growth, flat expense growth, 33% pre-tax margin, upper end of Tier 1 leverage, 6%, 23% return on tangible common equity, and a 22% EPS growth, and what I would say is a solid beast. So, I don't really think about the valuation of the firm on any given day. We just care about delivering for our clients and our shareholders. And if we do that in a first-class way, the valuation will take care of itself. Robin Vince: And you asked about the returns and our sort of comfort with them, look, we've given medium-term targets, as Dermot just said, that's sort of greater than or equal to 23% for ROTCE. And so, we, obviously, appreciate touching that, but doing it consistently over time is how we really view achieving targets. And in terms of the resiliency, remember the very nature of our business is actually got this diversification. We talked about the equity markets and the fixed income markets. I talked about the fact that it is software, its services, platforms and market valuations and transaction volumes. These are all things that we participate in. Capital markets activities has been important to us in 2024. The fact that we participate through our Corporate Trust business through our debt capital markets business, those are things that are participating in the growth of capital markets generally. We participate in scale of markets, and things like the treasury market is a good example. And so, this diversification of our mix helps us to be resilient in terms of the vagaries of any one particular market or cycle. Now, of course, things will move around, and that's why Dermot mentioned the point about our commitment to positive operating leverage in almost all reasonable scenarios that we can imagine because we recognize that NII, which is part of our mix, but so too are the fees and then our ability to control expenses. We could make expenses less than they are now. We've chosen to manage them at the level that they are because we believe that investing in that business for future growth is exactly what we should be doing right now given the environment, but it wouldn't always have to be so. Ebrahim Poonawala: Appreciate that. And if I can sneak one quick follow-up, Dermot, I think you mentioned fourth quarter NII slightly lower than 3Q. We've seen a few rate cuts in Europe, in the US now in September. Is it fair to assume that absent a dramatic change in rates, this $1 billion in quarterly NII is kind of where we are bouncing around at the bottom? And then, if deposit growth picks up, QT stops, that it should go off that base? Or am I missing something? Dermot McDonogh: So, if you look back at our last five quarters, we've kind of toggled between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Q3 was a stronger quarter for us for a number of reasons, principally volatility in the market at the beginning of August and clients held more cash. And then, towards the back end of the quarter, once there was a clear view on where the Fed was going to go at rates, clients started to put money into money market funds, which ended up with us. And so, we kind of benefited from those two principal things. And so, our deposit balances have kind of leveled off here. We expect maybe NIBs grind down a little bit from here. And so, as I kind of said maybe 10 minutes ago, $1 billion for Q4 is the best guidance I can give you today. And for '25, I don't see NII being a kind of a headwind for us. And we've taken extensive action over the last several weeks in terms of repositioning our CIO book to insulate '25. Ebrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. Thank you so much. Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck: Hi. Good afternoon. Robin Vince: Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck: Okay. Two quick questions. One is on the buyback question, and I know you said, look, you're very accretive on earnings accretion. You don't need a lot of capital for the business model, of course, as we know, and you're above your target CET1 of 11% and Tier 1 leverage target 5.5% to 6%, you're at the high end of that range. And so, when we think about the 100%-plus, how should we think about the plus part of the 100%-plus? Because it feels like totally 100% makes sense, but there's room to bring these to optimize the capital structure more. So, I'm kind of thinking about -- I'm wondering what kind of timeframe are we talking about to optimize your capital structure, do you feel? Dermot McDonogh: So, thanks for the question, Betsy. Last year, we returned a little north of 120%. This year, in January, we guided a 100% or more. Given the uncertainty in the markets, geopolitical, the U.S. Presidential elections, a wide range of uncertainty with Fed. In January, we thought the year was going to be very different to where it's ended up. And I think, on previous calls, we said we wanted for now stick towards the upper end of our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is the 6% range. And so, when you take that and the Archer transaction, we kind of think we're still on track to do the 100% or more through three quarters, we're at 103%. So, I wouldn't expect that to materially change from here. Betsy Graseck: Okay. Got it. And then, the other question is you mentioned one-third of BNY is now on the platform model. And are you taking 100% of the firm there? And just wondering about implications for the runway for efficiency improvements as you execute on that? Thanks. Dermot McDonogh: So, a quarter of the firm, roughly 13,000 employees are on the platform now. It happened in two waves, March and September, with another wave going live in Q1 of next year. And so, I wouldn't necessarily think about platform operating model as a mechanism just for efficiency. It really is -- it's going to drive top-line growth and it's going to run the company better and it's going to help us have a different culture in terms of more joined-up thinking. So, it really is the mechanism by which we deliver the three strategic pillars. And so, the answer to the question about 100% is, yes. And from probably -- from here, it's probably another 18 months before the firm is fully up there. But by the end of Q1 of next year, we expect about half of the firm will be live on the model. And the feedback so far from our team around the world is extraordinarily positive. So, it's really worked well for us as a firm. Robin Vince: And Betsy, you remember the tail of benefit extends way past the 18-month point because sometimes it's not until folks are in the model and operating in that new approach that they're really able to examine some of the core questions that, that platform is confronted with in terms of how to optimize. So, we expect the benefit that Dermot was describing to be a multiyear endeavor past that 18-month point. Betsy Graseck: Got it. All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr: Hello. Just one wrap up for me. Dermot, I love you pointed out the 5% revenue growth, flattish expenses lead to 20% earnings growth. That is the power of the BK model. If you look just -- I know it's just one quarter, but if you look at the sequential numbers, the story changed a little bit with everything about flat and earnings down a little bit. I'm just -- all I'm asking is, does that inform us in any way of how we're looking at as we roll into '25? A lot of your business metrics and balance and client wins are up. So, my gut is, it's no, but I just want to see from that perspective, how you feel about that? Dermot McDonogh: So, I think your gut is correct. It is no, Glenn. And it's all just about timing and when we onboard clients and put people on the platform and when the revenue starts to get recognized. So, it's just in terms of the backlog across all our businesses, strong pipeline continues to grow. And, yeah, so your intuition is correct. Glenn Schorr: All right. Awesome. Thank you. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. Rajiv Bhatia: Yeah. Just a quick one for me. I guess, on the depository receipts business, and I appreciate it's a small business, but the number of sponsored programs continues to decline. Is that something we should continue to expect to decline? And is it competitive takeaways or something else that's driving that? Thanks. Dermot McDonogh: So, I wouldn't really read too much into that. That's -- we've talked about that for several years about the sponsored program going away and not being around. It's still here. Deposit receipts is a small business in the totality of it, but it is a very, very important business for us because it gives us another opportunity to connect with clients, and it has got a very good margin to it. And we have like very significant market share in that business. So, it's something that we continue to invest in. We think it's very important for our franchise, and we don't see a secular decline in that business from where we see it today. Robin Vince: We also off-boarded some of the smaller clients in that particular business. So, the headline of total number is a little bit misleading actually when -- if you were able to dig under the hood and see some of the clients that made up that decline, you'd see that they disproportionately skewed to the small. Rajiv Bhatia: Got it. Thank you. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Jim Mitchell: My questions have all been asked and answered. Thanks. Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just one more on the margins. You mostly at your 33% target in most areas. So, as you generate more sales from moving to the platform model, and as we move into, say, next year or beyond, I guess, what's the view on spending some of that and investing in the business versus actually generating -- potentially generating margins well above 33%? Dermot McDonogh: So, my response to that one, Jim, would be, we want to demonstrate to you that we can prove that we can deliver 33% margins through the cycle. We gave guidance for the first time in January, and then we just managed to get there pretty quickly. But we want to stay there and show that we can deliver that over a period of time. We're heading into a very -- what's going to be quite an interesting budget season for us because we've done a lot of great things this year. I know the various teams around the firm want to do great things next year. And to offset that balance, we want to be able to deliver positive operating leverage. And so, the next eight weeks and how we set up the firm for next year would inform how we communicate with you in January. But we set out those targets because we believe we could hit them. The positive is we got there earlier than we thought. And now we want to show that we can improve and maintain those margins that we've guided to previously. Robin Vince: Brian, the best clue I could give you in terms of how we think about that, it's sort of a little bit more detail is if you actually look at us on a segment-by-segment basis, you can see us prosecuting the operating leverage journey differently in our three segments. And we told you a year or so ago that, that's what we were going to do. And so, maybe to allay your concerns in terms of growth and investment, if you look at Market and Wealth Services, we aren't trying to grow the margin there. We're very happy with the margin. We just wanted to grow the total size of the business, which is exactly what we've been doing. There are -- the other segments where we said we actually do want to grow the margin towards our medium-term targets for those segments, there, we are really growing the margin. And so, you can see exactly your question at work in our segments. Brian Bedell: Yeah. That's great color. Thank you very much. Operator: And for our final question, we'll return to the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo: Hi. With all this talk of the transitioning of the employees, I guess, half the employees to the new platform over the next one to two years, how much do you see AI playing a role? And can you give any metrics? I mean, keeping expenses flat, I don't know how much you're still investing in AI. When Emily presented at the Boston Bank Conference last November, it seemed like BNY was all in for AI. It was one of those bullish cases made yet you've heard out in the broader world, sometimes you have hit, sometimes you have misses. So, where -- how does AI relate to the whole platform strategy? And how committed are you to AI? And do you have any numbers that you can give us, some concrete metrics? Thanks. Robin Vince: Sure. So, just to reiterate, we've got a quarter of our people in the platform's operating model. And as Dermot said, it's sort of an 18-month trajectory from here. That's really, Mike, the way I think about platform's operating model is this concept of, if you take it that we are, in fact, more and more a platforms company in terms of these large at-scale capabilities often software and services that we deliver generally in market-leading positions, number one, in a variety of different markets. We've talked about things -- the businesses before, I won't repeat them. Then, it follows to us from that it makes sense for us to operate ourselves in a platform's operating model, which is the way that many other platform companies in the world operates themselves. And so that is a strategy around how we organize ourselves in pursuing -- being pursuant to our broader strategy. Now, AI as a -- which is, of course, part of that, we have an AI hub. We have a couple of hundred people in that AI hub. And we are absolutely investing in AI and do believe in the power of AI to be able to help our business in terms of both revenue opportunities over time for clients and also ways to make our people more effective and efficient. And we haven't made a lot of noise about it, but don't misunderstand that for a lack of interest or investment because we haven't slowed down. In fact, we've increased our AI investment. And of course, notwithstanding all of that, you can see that from running the company well on an expense line, we're not allowing that enthusiasm to distract us from the important task of expense management. And this is where -- I don't mean to be pithy, but it's very, very important learning for us is that we, as a company, can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can invest in things that matter and we can manage the company well. We make choices and AI is a choice of something we're leaning into, and we think that's important for the future. Mike Mayo: Thank you. Robin Vince: Thank you. Operator: And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Robin for any additional or closing remarks. Robin Vince: Thank you, operator. And thanks, everyone, for your time today. We appreciate your interest in BNY. Please reach out to Marius and the IR team if you have any follow-up questions. Be well. Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at 2 o'clock pm Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day.

Title: NN Group N.V. (AMS:NN) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 54% of the company
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nn-group-n-v-ams-074535473.html
Time Published: 2024-10-13T07:45:35Z
Full Content:
Significantly high institutional ownership implies NN Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 44% of the company Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock To get a sense of who is truly in control of NN Group N.V. (AMS:NN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 54% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NN Group, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for NN Group Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NN Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NN Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. NN Group is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 6.6%. Norges Bank Investment Management is the second largest shareholder owning 5.2% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our information suggests that NN Group N.V. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own €3.2m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. With a 46% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NN Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for NN Group you should be aware of. But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Title: China Puts Investor Patience to Test as Key Meeting Underwhelms

(Bloomberg) — China’s highly anticipated Finance Ministry briefing on Saturday lacked the firepower that equity investors had hoped for, indicating that the volatility that’s gripped the market following a world-beating rally will likely extend. Most Read from Bloomberg Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record While Finance Minister Lan Fo’an promised more support for the struggling property sector and hinted at greater government borrowing to shore up the economy, the briefing didn’t produce a headline dollar figure for fresh fiscal stimulus that the markets had sought. A lack of new incentives to boost consumption, which has been a weak link in the economy, is another reason why traders may feel disappointed. The ministry “tried its best,” but there is a large gap between what was announced and what the market was expecting, said Shen Meng, a director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co. “So the overall sentiment for investors is negative.” Patience has been wearing thin among investors, who have clamored for Beijing to announce big-bang fiscal measures to help sustain the rally sparked by the stimulus blitz that authorities unleashed in late September. The CSI 300 (000300.SS) Index, a benchmark of onshore equities, capped its biggest weekly loss since late July on Friday, with volatility rising ahead of the MOF briefing. The Australian and New Zealand dollars, proxies for China sentiment among developed market currencies, both slipped 0.2% in early trading Monday. A further unwinding of the rally risks fueling concern that equities are heading for yet another false dawn, which may bring more selling pressure. The market has been caught in a start-stop cycle of gains and losses a few times before as Beijing’s piecemeal approach to stimulus produced only brief rebounds. Local governments will be allowed to issue special bonds to buy unsold homes and turn them into subsidized housing, Lan and his deputies said on Saturday, while refraining from putting a price tag on any additional stimulus. Lan also hinted at room for issuing more sovereign bonds and greater government spending, steps that could be announced later this month or early November. Prior to the weekend, investors and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected China to deploy as much as 2 trillion yuan ($283 billion) in fresh fiscal stimulus on Saturday, including potential subsidies, consumption vouchers and financial support for families with children. “The room for further fiscal stimulus is still on the table,” said Britney Lam, head of long-short equities for Magellan Investments Holdings Ltd. In the meantime, “markets will likely see further profit taking,” she said. Inflation data released on Sunday is likely to add to investor concerns. It showed that China’s consumer prices rose less than forecast in September, while factory-gate charges fell for a 24th straight month, underscoring the need for further policy support to help the economy break out of deflation. The CSI 300 Index slid 3.3% last week, but it’s still up 21% from its close on Sept. 23, the day before China’s central bank announced a broad package of measures that included an interest-rate cut and liquidity support for the equity market. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng China Enterprises (^HSCE) Index lost 6.6% last week after surging more than 30% in the previous three weeks. While the epic rebound in Chinese shares has spurred the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. to upgrade the market, it has also drawn skepticism from others such as Invesco Ltd. and Morgan Stanley who say stocks have already run too far too fast. “I’m still a little bit disappointed,” said Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia Ltd. While the finance minister announced some specific measures, the ‘timing and amount’ were still missing. Investors will soon turn attention to the next major policy briefing in the coming weeks — from the Communist Party-controlled parliament that oversees the budget — for details of more stimulus. At its October meeting last year, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress approved additional sovereign debt and raised the budget-deficit ratio. China’s sovereign bonds were little changed on the measures announced on Saturday. By noon on the day, the 10-year yield had erased an earlier drop of as much as two basis points, according to traders, who asked not to be identified as they are not allowed to comment publicly on the rates market. A strengthened fiscal push would likely weigh on China’s bonds by encouraging traders to move funds into riskier investments with potentially better returns. An increased supply of debt may also sap liquidity in the financial system, making it harder for the market to absorb the entire amount. The yield curve will probably move lower, given debt issuance this year may come below market consensus, said Zhaopeng Xing, a senior strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. Going forward, “we expect 1 trillion yuan of ultra-long treasury and 1 trillion yuan of local bonds to be announced,” he added. —With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi, Zhu Lin, Wenjin Lv, Shuiyu Jing, April Ma, Matthew Burgess, Michael G.

Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations.

Title: Cardano Whales Move $6 Billion In One Day, Fuel For ADA Price To Reach $0.5?

Time Published: 2024-10-12T20:30:36Z

In an interesting move, Cardano (ADA) has rebounded by almost 4% in the past 24 hours, in what seems to be an uptick in activity among large ADA holders. The price of ADA started the week on a bearish note and spent the majority of the week trending downwards. Particularly, the ADA price fell by about 9.5% to bottom out at $0.33260. However, the crypto has rebounded and has increased by about 6% from this low. This price rebound was accompanied by a large transaction volume, especially from large holders, also known as whales. According to data from IntoTheBlock (ITB), this transaction volume amounted to 17.33 billion ADA, worth about $6 billion. The Large Transaction Volume metric from IntoTheBlock tracks details on transactions with a value of $100,000 or greater. Interestingly, this metric puts the worth of whale transactions at $24.18 billion in the past seven days, a notable increase from last week’s readings. A huge part of these transactions were recorded in the past three days, with $6 billion movements coming on October 11 and $5.8 billion on October 10. The uptick in whale activity appears to be closely linked to ongoing developments within the Cardano ecosystem. According to a recent report from InputOutput, Cardano has remained a major hub for blockchain developers, especially following the recent node upgrades to v.9.2.0 and the subsequent v.9.2.1. InputOutput’s data reveals that by the end of September, there were 1,376 active projects being built on Cardano, underscoring its popularity among blockchain innovators. Additionally, during September, the number of minted native tokens grew by 80,000, while the total number of transactions on the network surged by 1.34 million. ADA’s price action has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, and sentiment among investors has been more negative than usual, especially on social media. Cardano’s creator, Charles Hoskinson, addressed this sentiment on social media platform X. Hoskinson clarified that the negative outlook doesn’t reflect any failure on Cardano’s part, emphasizing that the project continues to grow. He also took the opportunity to criticize other crypto ecosystems, remarking that Cardano remains one of the few cryptocurrencies still committed to being a true decentralized currency, unlike those aligning with corporate giants like BlackRock and Wall Street. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: $1.83 Billion Makes Its Way To Exchanges, Is A Bloodbath Coming? Despite the pessimism, the ADA price has managed to hold a key support level at $0.33, which offers some relief to bullish investors. Additionally, on-chain metrics such as net network growth and positive momentum in the futures market suggest a more optimistic outlook. The recent uptick in whale activity could signal the beginning of a more sustained rise for the ADA price. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.354. The first target is a significant break above $0.40 before a return to $0.50.

Title: Mark Harmon Explains Why His Son Isn't Returning To Play Young Gibbs On NCIS: Origins
URL: https://screenrant.com/ncis-origins-why-sean-harmon-not-returning-young-gibbs-explained-mark-harmon/
Time Published: 2024-10-12T20:01:53Z

Your changes have been saved Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address. You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics. NCIS: Origins executive producer and narrator Mark Harmon explains why his son, Sean, isn't returning as Young Gibbs. Set to premiere on CBS in just a matter of days, NCIS: Origins is the first prequel in the history of the NCIS franchise. It follows Leroy Jethro Gibbs in the early 1990s. Although Sean Harmon is involved behind the scenes in the new show, he won't be appearing on camera. Instead, Bridge of Spies actor Austin Stowell steps into the lead role. Speaking with Variety, ahead of the premiere of NCIS: Origins on Monday, October 14, at 10 PM ET on CBS, Harmon clarified why Sean won't be reprising his role as Young Gibbs in the prequel. Even though Harmon played Gibbs in the main series, and has been credited with coming up with the pitch for NCIS: Origins, the older Harmon clarified that his son is focused on different things and enjoys executive producing. Read the quote below: He’s an actor, writer, producer, a surfer, he does a lot of things. You have to come to decisions about what you want to do in life, or what you think’s important. I just think he made a choice and had to make a decision in some ways. He likes executive producing. The new NCIS prequel puts the spotlight on Gibbs as he's just beginning his career as a Special Agent at NCIS' Camp Pendleton office. He intends to build up a gritty team, with the support of another legacy character, Mike Franks, who has been played in the main show by Muse Watson. It's a different version of Gibbs than the one the franchise viewers will recognize, at least in terms of the NCIS: Origins cast Gibbs is surrounded by. Though there are a few familiar faces, there are several more new ones, and each will develop a unique bond with the new version of Gibbs. In one of his few major acting roles, Sean Harmon appeared in seven episodes of NCIS, appearing in seasons 6, 7, 9, and 18. By bringing in Stowell, the high-profile prequel will honor NCIS continuity. But it will also signal to viewers that this is a somewhat distinct version of Gibbs that won't simply retread the ground that's been covered in flashbacks. It invites viewers in, with one argument being that audiences wouldn't necessarily have to follow the main NCIS to enjoy the prequel. NCIS: Origins recently cast its new Jethro Gibbs, and this casting is all the more exciting considering the actor’s previous action show success. In any case, even though Sean Harmon is not the lead actor, he's very much part of the show's creative team. Mark and Sean share executive producer credits alongside David J. North and Gina Lucita Monreal. The latter duo will also co-write the premiere episode and serve as showrunners, joined by those heavily involved in the main NCIS. So, while there may be a different Gibbs at the center of the story, the same writing force and vision are present. The leading cast member in the NCIS prequel is Stowell, who was recently seen in the Starz drama Three Women. But he isn't the only legacy character to board the new spinoff, considering the inclusion of Special Agent Mike Franks. In the main series, Franks functioned as a close friend and confidant to Gibbs. Portrayed by Watson, Franks appeared in 20 episodes of NCIS from 2006 to 2017. But outside of Franks, who is played in NCIS: Origins by Being Human actor Kyle Schmid, the ensemble is introducing some faces for the very first time. Mariel Molino, recently seen in the thriller series The Watchful Eye, portrays Special Agent Lala Dominguez. She is the show's female lead, with some suggestions that she could be a potential love interest for Gibbs down the line. Tyla Abercrumbie, known for playing Nina Williams on the Showtime series The Chi, has the role of Field Operation Support Officer Mary Jo Sullivan. She's described as a character who is in charge, though that might be a self-appointed role. The Blacklist's Diany Rodriguez has the role of Special Agent Vera Strickland, who appeared in one episode of the main NCIS series. Casting for the role of Vera Strickland in NCIS: Origins just created a timeline inconsistency for the NCIS franchise seven years in the making. Other actors in the core NCIS: Origins cast include Daniel Bellomy as Special Agent Granville Dawson, Caleb Martin Foote, as Special Agent Benjamin Randolf, and Robert Taylor as Jackson Gibbs, Leroy's father. They each serve different purposes in the story, with Randolf described as a golden boy. There's also Patrick Fischler as NCIS Special Agent in Charge Cliff Walker and Julian Black Antelope as Chief Medical Examiner Kai Blackrock. NCIS: Origins: Cast & Characters Actor Who They're Playing Austin Stowell Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs Mariel Molino Special Agent Lala Dominguez Kyle Schmid Special Agent Mike Franks Tyla Abercrumbie Field Operation Support Officer Mary Jo Sullivan Diany Rodriguez Special Agent Vera Strickland Daniel Bellomy Special Agent Granville "Granny" Dawson Caleb Martin Foote Special Agent Benjamin “Randy” Randolf Robert Taylor Jackson Gibbs Patrick Fischler NCIS Special Agent in Charge Cliff Walker Julian Black Antelope Chief Medical Examiner Kai Blackrock Lori Petty Dr. Lenora Friedman Bobby Moynihan Woodrow “Woody” Browne Mark Harmon Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (as narrator) Two additions that were announced late to the prequel were Lori Petty and SNL alum Bobby Moynihan. They play a pathologist and the Director of the NIS Forensic Lab, respectively. It all adds up to a somewhat different take on Gibbs' past, which makes the change from Sean Harmon to Stowell more understandable. Even though the reasons are only implied by Harmon, it takes a lot to be the lead of a high-profile series. That's both in terms of the work itself and hours filming, but also things like promotional tours and being the face of the brand. All of this might have contributed to CBS and Sean Harmon wanting to go in a different direction. But it also allows NCIS: Origins a better chance of standing on its own terms. Source: Variety Your comment has not been saved A young Gibbs embarks on his journey as a Naval Investigative Service agent in the early 1990s. Set against the backdrop of Camp Pendleton, the series explores Gibbs' formative years, the cases that shaped him, and the mentors who guided his path, including Mike Franks.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.

Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations.

This rising demand for AI technologies has led to a 56% organic growth in datacom sales during the second quarter. The company is planning to increase capital investments in the coming months to meet the expanding order volume from AI-driven clients. Adam Norwitt, CEO of the firm, highlighted the surge in bookings between March and June during the company's Q2 earnings call. Norwitt noted that AI-powered IT datacom clients significantly drove the demand, with traditional datacom orders seeing a modest increase as well.

Title: Troubled retailers face a Halloween crunch with consumers spending less
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/troubled-retailers-face-halloween-crunch-190000616.html
Time Published: 2024-10-12T19:00:00Z

(Bloomberg) -- A predicted slide in Halloween consumption is the latest blow for heavily-indebted retailers battling mounting overheads and the trend of consumers trading down to cheaper products. Most Read from Bloomberg Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record US spending for the holiday will drop by 5% to $11.6 billion this year, according to the National Retail Federation. Sales of greeting cards and costumes are likely to see the greatest decline, a hit to merchants reliant on seasonal splurges in what’s already been a tough year for the industry. Households on the lower end of the income scale are broadly struggling as unemployment has edged higher this year and underlying inflation has remained persistently high. Retailer Michaels Cos. said on a recent earnings call that households earning less than $100,000 are retrenching, resulting in lower basket sizes. “2024 has been a perfect storm for retailers of all stripes,” said Erica Weisgerber, a partner at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. “Inflation, high operational costs, and reduced consumer spending have been especially challenging for brick-and-mortar retailers, and online retailers have struggled with steep competition from e-commerce giants like Amazon.” Many of the troubled firms, including Michaels and At Home Group Inc., are owned by private equity managers after buyouts during the pandemic proved ill-timed when interest rates rose and inflation crimped household budgets. Home, clothing and hobby retailers dominate the list of distressed retailers because the size of their debt means they lack the liquidity to compete with better capitalized competitors, according to Moody’s Ratings. Still, Michaels and At Home are hopeful that they can win a larger slice of the holiday spending. Hellman & Friedman LLC’s At Home saw a strong start to Halloween spending after flat second-quarter net sales of about $443 million, chief financial officer Jerry Murray said on a September earnings call. Apollo Global Management Inc.’s Michaels also saw a revenue pop tied to Halloween as customers began to buy inventory earlier this year, according to people on last month’s earnings call. That’s a fillip for the firm whose earnings declined by about 20% to $50 million in the second quarter from a year earlier, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Apollo and Hellman & Friedman declined to comment. The pullback is creating challenges for the wider industry and has contributed to several high-profile bankruptcies this year, including Joann Inc., Big Lots Inc. and Conn’s Inc. It also makes it harder to turn around firms simply by slashing costs. “Retailers are finding that their low-hanging efficiency efforts do not go far enough,” said Holly Etlin, a partner in AlixPartners’ turnaround practice. With capital markets shunning troubled firms, more retailers turned to bankruptcy rather than distressed exchanges over the past year as the companies require deeper restructuring that is best done in court, Moody’s Ratings said in a report last month. It’s part of a wider trend that saw quarterly filings for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection rise to the highest level since 2012 in the three months through June. Private equity’s widespread failure to hedge against rising borrowing costs also means it’s less able to come to the rescue of troubled firms, which could have knock-on effects for the economy and jobs. “The private equity players that often have backstopped retailers have been in a new deal lull as multiples collapsed and rates for leveraged deals skyrocketed,” said James Gellert, executive chair at risk analytics provider RapidRatings International Inc. Listen here to the Credit Edge podcast on Schroders’ bullish outlook on CRE private debt Week in Review China’s onshore high-yield debt market this week suffered its worst day of trading in years as investors pulled money out of bonds and poured it into stocks in response to government stimulus. Meanwhile, domestic developer Country Garden Holdings Co. missed a self-imposed target date for getting key creditor support for terms of its restructuring plan. Inflows to private credit funds helped BlackRock Inc. pull in a record $221 billion of total client cash last quarter, bringing the world’s largest money manager to an all-time high of $11.5 trillion of assets. A potential bidding war for HPS Investment Partners is set to swell the fortunes of its three founders as rival groups vie for a piece of the red-hot private credit market. A group of private credit firms including 26North Partners are closing in on a deal to lend to Vista Equity Partners-backed Alegeus Technologies, after the software firm tried to refinance existing debt with a new leveraged loan. Banks led by UBS Group AG sold $1 billion of leveraged loans to help finance Vista Equity Partners’ buyout of software company Jaggaer, the market’s latest acquisition deal to include a second-lien component. In Europe, Blackstone Inc. is investing in a C$1.125 billion ($822 million) second-lien tranche that is helping finance AutoScout24’s purchase of Canadian online car marketplace Trader. K2 Insurance Services sold a bigger-than-planned leveraged loan as the firm cuts borrowing costs on buyout-related financing by three percentage points. Verizon Communications Inc. lined up $10 billion of short-term bank funding to help finance its purchase of Frontier Communications Parent Inc. If cut to junk status, Boeing Co. will be the biggest US corporate borrower to ever be stripped of its investment-grade ratings and join junk bond indexes, flooding the high-yield market with a record volume of new debt to absorb. A market for aircraft bonds that all but shut down after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is showing signs of life again. Japan’s Norinchukin Bank got a vote of confidence from bond investors on Wednesday, when spreads on the firm’s first dollar issuance since it revealed massive losses tightened significantly in secondary trading. Gritstone Bio Inc., a vaccine developer that once touted its ability to make a next-generation Covid-19 shot, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware. Avante Health Solutions filed for bankruptcy in order to sell its business to an affiliate of private equity firm Staple Street Capital. On the Move John Abate, partner and co-head of trading at Silver Point Capital, is set to retire by the end of the year after more than 15 years at the hedge fund. Wells Fargo & Co. is hiring Celine Catherin from Deutsche Bank AG as a managing director and co-head of its leveraged syndicate. Joshua Baumgarten, co-managing partner and head of credit at TPG Angelo Gordon, is leaving the firm after its purchase last year by TPG Inc. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has hired Mike Shanahan from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as a managing director in its technology leveraged finance team. Corinthia Global Management has recruited three more people from Barings after poaching a 22-strong team from the US asset manager earlier this year. The trio are Louis Godest, Christel Huguet and Jan Lübke. JPMorgan Chase & Co. veteran Doug Kravitz joined M3 Partners as a managing director focused on advising company creditors in restructuring scenarios.

As companies implement AI systems and edge computing technologies to process large volumes of data in real time, SBA’s extensive network of towers and infrastructure becomes essential in facilitating the low-latency communication that these systems require. SBA's towers are also critical for enabling 5G networks, which are important for AI applications in sectors like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and IoT devices. Barclays recently raised the price target on the stock to $256 from $236 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares. Overall SBAC ranks 29th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of SBAC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.

Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations.

Title: BlackRock Is Selling Bitcoin To Buy Ethereum, Will This Bullishness Trigger Another Altcoin Season?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-buy-ethereum/
Time Published: 2024-10-12T17:30:34Z
Full Content:
New reports have revealed that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and American multinational investment company, is now selling Bitcoin (BTC) to buy Ethereum (ETH). Many market watchers propose that this unexpected investment change could trigger a bullish rally for Ethereum, potentially catalyzing another altcoin season. Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics tool has uncovered a shocking new transaction executed by asset manager, BlackRock. In its official X (formerly Twitter) account, Lookonchain disclosed that BlackRock has recently sold off 182 BTC, valued at $11.34 million. Around the same period, the blockchain analytics tool recorded BlackRock purchasing 7,574 ETH tokens, worth approximately $18.52 million. This surprising development indicates a potential shift in BlackRock’s investment strategy, hinting at the investment giant’s newfound favor in Ethereum. As the world’s largest Bitcoin fund, BlackRock’s decision to dump Bitcoin for Ethereum comes as a shock to many crypto community members, with discussions flooding the space about the real reason behind the asset manager’s investment decision. According to some market watchers, BlackRock’s move is a reflection of its clients’ digital asset preferences, as the asset manager could be selling Bitcoin and buying Ethereum based on client requests. Other crypto community members are seeing BlackRock’s investment move as a sign that the price of Ethereum could be gearing up for a substantial rally. As the number one altcoin in the market with the largest market capitalization, a massive price rally for Ethereum could potentially trigger the long-awaited altcoin season. Historically, a price increase in Ethereum paves the way for other altcoins in the market to see similarly bullish gains. With the market already expecting a significant altcoin season in this bull cycle, BlackRock’s unexpected investment move is fueling speculation in the market about a potential Ethereum price surge that could outperform Bitcoin. As of writing, BlackRock‘s holding reveals a strong preference for Bitcoin in terms of value. Data from Lookonchain reveals that BlackRock holds approximately 369,640 BTC, valued at an impressive $23.02 billion. In comparison, the investment giant Ethereum’s holdings amount to 414,168 ETH, with a value of around $1.01 billion, highlighting a stark difference in the allocation between the two leading cryptocurrencies. Numerous analysts in the crypto market are expressing optimism about the highly anticipated altcoin season. A popular Bitcoin and crypto analyst identified as ‘Moustache’ on X has disclosed that the altcoins season index has been forming a particularly bullish pattern for the past 3.5 years, suggesting that altcoins could be on the verge of a significant price increase. He disclosed that this technical analysis pattern is known as the “Inverse Head and Shoulder,” which often indicates a potential shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. The analyst is optimistic that the present market downturn will soon be replaced by strong growth in the altcoin market, anticipating an extended period of price gains.

Title: The New Gods Among Us...

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/12/2024 8:50:58 AM PDT by Starman417 In ancient Egypt pharaohs were considered gods. They believed that when a pharaoh died, he would continue to lead them from the beyond, which partially explains why they had such ornate tombs. At roughly the same time, Japanese emperors were similarly thought to be gods, a practice that continued until 1945, when, after the war the emperor was required to explain to his people that he, in fact, was not a god. In the Roman Empire, while emperors were not considered gods while living, most were deified upon death. While living however they were thought to have authority that had been divinely endowed. Later, through much of European history, monarchs were often thought to be divinely inspired. There existed a concept called the Divine Right of Kings which suggested that kings were anointed by God and ruled by his grace. As such, they did not have to answer to anyone on this earthly plain, whether the Pope, parliament, nobles or anyone else. Of course ruling via God’s grace didn’t always protect kings from earthly dangers – in the form of assassinations or wars between two simultaneously divinely inspired enemies or your run of the mill usurper – but it was a great gig, if you could keep it. As regal and majestic as all of this sounds, in reality, divine rule was nothing more than a tool to help establish legitimacy and maintain power for the ruling elites. Who could be a more powerful ally in demonstrating that an individual or a group should have power than God? Using armies and weapons to keep subjects from questioning authority or revolting could be expensive. It was cheaper to do so through or with the assistance of religious beliefs. If one could convince a man that his king was acting in the stead of God, the threshold of abuse he would accept before revolting would be much higher than if the king were just a man. While the United States has never had a king – divine or otherwise as George Washington quashed that when offered the crown and turned it down – our Declaration of Independence, the document that established our nation, looks to God for inspiration. That doesn’t mean we aren’t ruled by gods, however. I’ve always wondered why some of America’s richest people, particularly tech and finance types lean to the left. How could someone who has benefited so extraordinarily from the American system support ideas that are so anathema to its very existence? The things they support generally include bigger government, higher taxes, limitations on freedoms of speech and the right to bear arms among others. The first is bigger government. Many corporations see increasing regulations as a means to limit competition. By supporting minimum wage hikes or increased reporting regulations or mandates, large companies – many of whom are controlled or owned by billionaires – can and do use the government to impose costs that cripple small competitors while they themselves have the resources to easily comply. Coincidentally, concurrently, the elites, particularly those in tech and on Wall Street, have little connection to the real world most Americans inhabit. From farms to restaurants to retail stores to truck drivers, the elites, in their remote offices and relatively low regulatory environments aren’t much impacted when OSHA or the DOT or EPA issue new regulations that handicap small business owners. While Wall Street may be heavily regulated as it relates to advertising and fiduciary responsibilities, the actual buying and selling is relatively unregulated when compared to the red tape blue collar industries face. When it comes to higher taxes, this is usually a red herring for America’s barons. Many of America’s wealthiest leftists call for higher income taxes, one most of them don’t actually pay. Most billionaires don’t pay themselves much of a taxable salary and they earn most of their incomes from stock sales or dividends, which are typically taxed at a lower rate. Regardless, even if capital gains taxes were increased, they find opaque tax avoidance schemes that often reduce their taxes to zero or less, options that are rarely available to the average millionaire, nevermind the average Joe. Free speech is another element of American culture that elites seem to have little appreciation for. Leftists of all income ranges favor curtailing conservative speech, with violence a common tactic on college campuses. The elites don’t dirty their hands with violence, of course, rather seeking to act through their control over social and traditional media, or via DEI coercion tactics of firms like BlackRock and Citadel.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Later, through much of European history, monarchs were often thought to be divinely inspired. There existed a concept called the Divine Right of Kings which suggested that kings were anointed by God and ruled by his grace. As such, they did not have to answer to anyone on this earthly plain, whether the Pope, parliament, nobles or anyone else. Of course ruling via God’s grace didn’t always protect kings from earthly dangers – in the form of assassinations or wars between two simultaneously divinely inspired enemies or your run of the mill usurper – but it was a great gig, if you could keep it. As regal and majestic as all of this sounds, in reality, divine rule was nothing more than a tool to help establish legitimacy and maintain power for the ruling elites. Who could be a more powerful ally in demonstrating that an individual or a group should have power than God? Using armies and weapons to keep subjects from questioning authority or revolting could be expensive. It was cheaper to do so through or with the assistance of religious beliefs. If one could convince a man that his king was acting in the stead of God, the threshold of abuse he would accept before revolting would be much higher than if the king were just a man. While the United States has never had a king – divine or otherwise as George Washington quashed that when offered the crown and turned it down – our Declaration of Independence, the document that established our nation, looks to God for inspiration. That doesn’t mean we aren’t ruled by gods, however. I’ve always wondered why some of America’s richest people, particularly tech and finance types lean to the left. How could someone who has benefited so extraordinarily from the American system support ideas that are so anathema to its very existence? The things they support generally include bigger government, higher taxes, limitations on freedoms of speech and the right to bear arms among others. The first is bigger government. Many corporations see increasing regulations as a means to limit competition. By supporting minimum wage hikes or increased reporting regulations or mandates, large companies – many of whom are controlled or owned by billionaires – can and do use the government to impose costs that cripple small competitors while they themselves have the resources to easily comply.

Many corporations see increasing regulations as a means to limit competition. By supporting minimum wage hikes or increased reporting regulations or mandates, large companies – many of whom are controlled or owned by billionaires – can and do use the government to impose costs that cripple small competitors while they themselves have the resources to easily comply. Coincidentally, concurrently, the elites, particularly those in tech and on Wall Street, have little connection to the real world most Americans inhabit. From farms to restaurants to retail stores to truck drivers, the elites, in their remote offices and relatively low regulatory environments aren’t much impacted when OSHA or the DOT or EPA issue new regulations that handicap small business owners. While Wall Street may be heavily regulated as it relates to advertising and fiduciary responsibilities, the actual buying and selling is relatively unregulated when compared to the red tape blue collar industries face. When it comes to higher taxes, this is usually a red herring for America’s barons. Many of America’s wealthiest leftists call for higher income taxes, one most of them don’t actually pay. Most billionaires don’t pay themselves much of a taxable salary and they earn most of their incomes from stock sales or dividends, which are typically taxed at a lower rate. Regardless, even if capital gains taxes were increased, they find opaque tax avoidance schemes that often reduce their taxes to zero or less, options that are rarely available to the average millionaire, nevermind the average Joe. Free speech is another element of American culture that elites seem to have little appreciation for. Leftists of all income ranges favor curtailing conservative speech, with violence a common tactic on college campuses.

Posted on 10/12/2024 8:37:26 AM PDT by george76 The Companies doing the North Carolina Hurricane Helene victim’s home inspections listed on the FEMA website are owned by Vanguard & BlackRock So the same company that owns majority of the lithium mine in the area will be inspecting the victim’s properties they want.. what are the odds! “They want to you don't want to pay attention to this one so who is going to inspect the homes that are damaged or gone in North Carolina well recently brought to me by the American thinker and my brother Mike you sent me the story If you go to the FEMA contract page, you will notice if you search for home inspections, that two companies appear. One is Vanguard and the other one is WSP, who is a Canadian company that is mainly owned by the Canadian pension board. Almost, well, right at a little over 18 million shares represents 15% of its ownership. Now the other piece of the puzzle of who owns WSP is two companies that we well know. One of them being Vanguard. Oh by the way this is all speculation because it's truth right? You only speculate because it's true. The other company that owns it is Vanguard. They represent almost 3% of the ownership of WSP, right a little bit over 3 million shares that company. And the other company is that good old company called BlackRock.” Who will be doing the Home inspections for FEMA in Carolina / Florida -> The same people who own the majority of Ablemarle, the lithium mining company in Kings Mountain..

(Bloomberg) -- Earnings season is here, and the US stock market’s furious $9 trillion 2024 rally is facing perhaps its biggest test of the year. Most Read from Bloomberg Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record Strategists are predicting that companies in the S&P 500 Index will post their weakest results in the past four quarters, with just a 4.3% increase in third-quarter profits compared with a year ago, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. In mid-June, projections were for an 8.4% rise, and in the second quarter growth soared to 14%. Despite the shrunken expectations, the S&P 500 hit another record high on Friday and is up 22% in 2024, its best start to a year since 1997. Investors who keep bidding up stock prices may be onto something, because there appears to be room for an upside earnings surprise if those reduced forecasts turn out to be overly gloomy. It happened in the first quarter, when expectations were for 3.8% growth and it turned out to be 7.9%. “Analysts lowered EPS estimates more than is typical heading into reporting, which could lead to an elevated beat rate and better equity performance across the quarter,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. Earnings season unofficially kicked off on Friday, led by financial bellwethers JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and BlackRock Inc. More key companies will deliver results next week, including Citigroup Inc., Netflix Inc. and JB Hunt Transport Services Inc. Here’s a look at five key themes to watch as the results roll in: AI Slows Down The bulk of the growth in S&P 500 earnings continues to come from the big-technology companies that are seen as major beneficiaries from the development of artificial intelligence. The so-called Magnificent Seven firms — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — are expected to post an 18% rise in profits in the third quarter. Their issue is the rate of increase is slowing, down from more than 30% in 2023, according to BI. For the rest of the S&P 500, profits are expected to climb 1.8% in the July-September period, which would be their second straight quarterly increase, albeit barely, BI data show. They posted 9.1% growth in the second quarter. That said, profits for the S&P’s “other 493” firms are projected to accelerate substantially from here, with double-digit gains anticipated in the first quarter of 2025, according to data compiled by BI. ‘Stock Picker’s Paradise’ Investors should expect some major swings in individual stocks that don’t show up in the broader index. The options market is pricing in the biggest average post-results implied move at the single-stock level since 2021, when Bank of America Corp. started collecting the data. But implied volatility at the index level is relatively muted, a sign that this earnings season could be a “stock picker’s paradise,” the firm’s strategists including Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. Three of the 11 S&P 500 sectors — technology, communication services and health care — are expected to post profit expansions of more than 10%. The energy group, on the other hand, is expected to report a decline of more than 20%. The sector saw the biggest decline in profit estimates among 11 industry groups as crude prices plunged last quarter, according to BI chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams. All About Margins Wall Street pros will be closely watching profit margins, which is a key measure of how effective companies have been at squeezing earnings out of their sales. Net-income margins are expected to slip to about 12.9%, less than the 13.1% reported in the second quarter but slightly higher than 12.8% in the third quarter of 2023, data compiled by BI show. The mild dip reflects the challenges some firms face in passing on input costs to costumers as wage pressures remain sticky in several low-productivity industries that are difficult to automate. Profit margins are going to be the weakest for energy and real estate stocks, BI data show. But looking more broadly, they’re expected to rebound in the coming quarters. Choppy European Markets In Europe, this earnings season could mark a turning point for the Stoxx 600 Index, which is hovering near record highs. Analysts cut profit estimates going into the third quarter, with a Citigroup index showing downgrades outnumbering upgrades since mid-June. Meanwhile, regional economies are seeing anemic growth, and manufacturing powerhouse Germany has forecast a contraction for a second year. While the reduced earnings estimates lower the bar for companies to beat expectations, forecasts for 2025 remain high and any guidance on weakening consumer demand would force them to come down, which would spill over into stock prices. A slew of high-profile companies, including Swedish clothing retailer Hennes & Mauritz AB and Volkswagen AG, have issued profit warnings in recent weeks. And a stunted recovery in China is likely to weigh on earnings at luxury goods makers such as LVMH. Election Focus With the US presidential election only weeks away, investors will be listening for mentions of economic and trade policy risks and other political issues from corporate executives. About 110 companies mentioned the word “election“ in their second-quarter earnings calls, up 62% from four years ago, BofA data show. History suggests that corporate investment activity accelerates after US presidential elections, which may be a catalyst for companies to unleash capital in the quarters ahead, particularly given lower interest rates, according to BofA’s Kwon. But it also may be delaying some expansion plans and other expenditures. “So much of the capital investment these days is AI related, and the election is not likely to curb that much, if at all,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. “However, now that we’re so close to the election, some of the more traditional capital commitments are likely to be delayed due to the political uncertainty.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Inside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary: The Idea That Never Fades Lina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes) The Robotaxi Verdict Is In—And Wall Street Is Taking the Train Why Is It So Hard for Clothing Resale Platforms to Make Money? ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

Iyengar Comments READ LATER Mutual fund houses are rushing to load their armoury with passive funds before the pure play passive fund focused Jio Financial-Blackrock combine launch its business soon. In last nine months, 87 passive schemes were launched against 51 in the whole of last year. Mop-up through passive funds have more than doubled to ₹7,472 crore in September quarter against ₹3,415 crore in the previous two quarters (March and June) put together, according to AMFI data. The number of issuance was also substantially higher at 39 in September quarter against 18 NFOs in June quarter and 30 in March quarter. Capital market regulator SEBI gave in-principal approval to the new player launch mutual fund business subject to fulfilment of certain conditions and also notified MF Lite regulations. After promising to deliver alpha in actively managed funds, MFs are wooing investors with innovative smart beta passive funds instead of index tracking plain vanilla funds. Passive funds launched by large fund houses such as HDFC MF, Nippon MF, Birla MF and Tata MF have become an instant hit with investors. The fund houses either pick up top 10 or 30 stocks of a popular index to deliver smart beta. Tata MF has launched one of its kind Tata Nifty Capital Markets Index Funds. The newly introduced Nifty Capital Market index will consist of 20 companies from Nifty 500 index. Nippon Life India Asset Management recently launched Nifty 500 Equal Weight Index Fund and Nifty 500 Momentum 50 Index Fund. Tata MF launched a passive tourism fund, while DSP MF came out with a fund that invests only in top-10 companies of Nifty index. Investing in concentrated index funds will carry higher risk though it can deliver better return in a bull market. Anand Vardarajan, Chief Business Officer, Tata Asset Management said the country is witnessing a shift particularly among new generation who are not going to yesteryear savings vehicles but considering financial markets for investment. Investors should not be perturbed by the recent fall in market when they are investing for next five years as it is very natural for markets to move up or come down a bit, he added. Anil Ghelani, CFA, Head of Passive Investments, DSP MF said, investor interest is steadily increasing and financial advisors are also finding it useful to include passive funds in their recommendations. “Passive fund carries the risk of the underlying index it aims to track and the risks associated with broader equity markets,” he said.

Title: Scotiabank Initiates Outperform Rating for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Predicts Growth Driven by AI Innovations

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Scotiabank analyst Nat Schindler recently initiated coverage of the stock with an Outperform rating and $245 price target. The advisory has a high level of confidence that consumers will use Amazon's services more in the future. It is also positive on the company's ability to monetize its artificial intelligence investments. The investment firm expects corporate uses, streamlining customer interactions, speeding code development, storing and contextualizing unstructured data, and other business efficiencies to be the most substantial near- to medium-term opportunities. Overall AMZN ranks 1st among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

October 12, 2024 6:30am by Barry Ritholtz The weekend is here! Pour yourself a mug of Los Brasiles coffee, grab a seat outside, and get ready for our longer-form weekend reads: • Mossad’s pager operation: Inside Israel’s penetration of Hezbollah: New details emerge of Israel’s elaborate plan to sabotage Hezbollah communications devices to kill or maim thousands of its operatives. (Washington Post) • How to win a Nobel prize: What subjects have past winners studied? What age were they when they won? Where do they live? Nature crunched the data on every science prizewinner to find out. (Nature) see also ‘You mean I have to stop my experiment?’ Not all Nobel laureates react the way you might expect: Adam Smith has spent 18 years recording the moments after the world’s brightest minds receive a life-changing call from the Nobel Prize committee. They might still be in bed when the call comes. But all Nobel Prize winners receive a phone call to break the big news to them. Then, moments after they hang up, their phone rings again. The man on the other end of the line is Adam Smith. (BBC) • Do Vanguard, Blackrock, and State Street Run the World? (Spoiler: No) In this blog post, I will explain why Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street’s “ownership” of the stock market is not an elaborate scheme to control the world. However, I will also discuss why their ownership may still be concerning for other reasons. To begin, let’s explain why Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street’s ownership of U.S. stocks is not the true definition of ownership.

Near Newcastle and Sunderland it was often even strewn out on the beaches. Yet coal had largely only been used for some very specific, small-scale uses. It was fired in layers with limestone to produce lime, largely used in mortar for stone and brick buildings. And it had long been popular among blacksmiths, heating iron or steel in a forge before shaping it into weapons or tools.

Title: Miriam Lord’s week: ‘More haste, less speed’ makes for an apt slogan as election fever symptoms erupt

Evidence pointing to a late November election continues to pile up, despite the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste’s increasingly wan insistence that it will be happening next year. If the fervent wishes of all those in Leinster House were enough to influence a decision, it would be called tomorrow. RTÉ’s Fiachra Ó Cionnaith’s tweeted a telltale photo this week of pallets of Fianna Fáil election posters shrink-wrapped with hundreds of smiling Micheál Martins and a slogan on the front plaintively whispering “Moving Forward Together” and “With Whoever Will Have Us” on the reverse. And as the parties attempt to stuff as much money into the coffers as possible before the election is called, Fine Gael supporters are noting with interest that the date of its Superdraw money-raising lottery has been brought forward from December 5th. There is major deck-clearing going on in Government Buildings. Sinn Féin is currently banjaxed. Jennifer Bray reports elsewhere on its latest catastrophe where they’re tearing the party to shreds in Kildare. Oh, and here’s what some see as the clincher. The Late Late Toy Show airs this year on December 6th, with “insiders” swearing that programme planners in Montrose moved it back from its traditional slot at the end of November to avoid a possible clash with general election coverage. And all those Fine Gael posters and billboards appearing like a rash on gable walls and bus shelters throughout the land. Like the billboard promising “A new energy for Kildare South” with candidates Joe Neville, Evie Sammon and Bernard Durkan alongside high-wattage Simon Harris beaming down on the masses. FG’s runners in Kildare South must have been shocked to see it. The aforementioned candidates are actually standing in Kildare North. The sense of indecent haste continues with Cllr John Paul O’Shea, the party’s candidate in Cork North West, ending up on the side of a bus shelter in Listowel, birthplace of Billy O’Shea, Fine Gael’s actual candidate in Kerry. And hats off to Minister for Higher Education Patrick O’Donovan, spectacularly ignoring his Government’s line that the election will be next year with huge billboards in Limerick. Featuring one huge photo of Patrick’s smiley phizog, it bears a simple message, writ large: “Patrick O’Donovan TD. Your Cabinet Minister for Limerick.” Nah. It’ll be in February. With TDs and senators all of a dither this week over claims that one of their own is a Russian secret agent, we were surprised not to hear the stentorian tones of former soldier Senator Gerard Craughwell holding forth on this critical issue of national security. Members of the Upper House have seemed far more exercised on this matter than their Dáil counterparts. Rear-Admiral Craughwell, who recently put the wind up Putin by threatening to send out a flotilla of finger-wagging Irish parliamentarians to monitor Russian naval manoeuvres in Irish waters, takes a keen interest in defence matters and his observations on the unfolding espionage crisis were much anticipated. Gerard, however, has been deeply involved in manoeuvres of a different kind. He is busy ensuring his re-election to the Seanad. A member of the Seanad’s independent group of senators, he was first elected in 2014, unexpectedly winning a by-election on the Cultural and Education panel after Fine Gael’s shoo-in candidate became embroiled in a row over government stroke politics and withdrew from the race. Despite it being incredibly tough for an independent to win in a contest where elected local politicians control the vote, he has managed to keep his seat by keeping the councillors sweet. This year, he splashed out on over 940 lapel badges and posted one to every councillor in the country. The pins, produced by Abbey Badges in Blackrock, are attractive items and have been “well received” says Senator Craughwell. “You will note the pins are unique with the name of the council on top, the council coat of arms and ‘elected June 2024′ at the bottom,” he tells us. “They are a mark of recognition and a collector’s item.” Each pin comes with a card from Gerard congratulating them on their success. “Wear it with pride for all that you have accomplished. Keep up the good work!” He also encloses full details of his particulars in case anyone wants to take them down. The race for the next Seanad may not have officially started, but it’s already in full swing. “Be sure I will run!” parps the bullish Craughwell. Of the many tributes paid to Mary O’Rourke since her death just over a week ago, one of the more interesting ones came from Ivan Yates, who was Fine Gael spokesman on public enterprise when Mary ran the department. Speaking on his weekly podcast with Matt Cooper, Ivan was full of praise for the political acumen of his erstwhile sparring partner – but he didn’t rate her at all as a minister. He was very firmly on the side of Brian Joyce, the former chairman of CIÉ who resigned on her ministerial watch citing “interference”, among other things. After the bombshell broke, Mary was shocked, breathlessly telling Morning Ireland how she heard the news. Ivan spoke vaguely of the way “this pressure came up”, which led to Mary revealing to the nation that she was “in the bath listening to the totally unannounced, unexpected resignation of Mr Joyce”. He regaled himself with details of his heroic part in this affair – how he played a blinder on the same programme a short time later, noting that after she went on about her bath “she proceeded to completely drop the towel and put the knife into Mr Joyce in a quite outrageous way”. Then they clashed on Prime Time, where she continued “savaging” Joyce while “letting on she didn’t know anything about it [the resignation] but she absolutely garrotted him”. Mary O’Rourke may not be around now to contradict him, but Richard Moore, her media adviser at the time, offers a more detailed timeline of what happened all those ago. It’s a tale full of drama and intrigue and he has never spoken about it before. That memorable bath and resignation episode happened on a Tuesday morning in the year 2000. On the previous day, Monday, March 6th, Mary was due to appear on RTÉ's Questions and Answers. There would, doubtless, be a question on the ongoing rows between her and her CIÉ chairman over how the organisation and, in particular, the rail system was funded and run. Joyce was appointed by Fine Gael in 1995 and had been due to retire in November 2000. Relations between them were always poor and Mary had been demanding a meeting with CIÉ’s chief executive later that week to discuss the company’s performance. Sadly, in a heartbreaking turn of events, the programme was cancelled due to the unexpected death of the presenter’s son. On Tuesday morning, The Irish Times splashed with a front page exclusive by Arthur Beesley. The story, with its leaked details, was filed on Monday night. Brian Joyce had resigned because of Mary O’Rourke’s “interference”. This came as a bolt from the blue to the Department. The usual practice if the chair of a semi-state was going to resign (or write a stern rebuke) was to call the Minister’s office first to let them know to expect a very important letter. That never happened in this case, recalls Richard Moore. Instead, Joyce’s resignation letter was hand-delivered to the minister’s office in Kildare Street after 8pm on Monday evening when she would have been in RTÉ, had circumstances not intervened. It was accepted by the security/service officer on duty and the unknown individual who delivered it said nothing about alerting the Minister or the Department to its importance. It was eventually opened on Tuesday, well after its contents had been revealed by The Irish Times. And well after RTÉ led its 7am radio bulletin with a report based on Beesley’s scoop. When she heard it, a stunned Mary immediately rang her media adviser. He headed straight into the office, getting in at 7.30am to find her already at her desk. She spoke to Morning Ireland after the 8am bulletin, famously declaring where she was when she heard the shock news. Afterwards, some commentators described the sharing of this detail as a masterstroke. All anyone could remember was that she was in the bath when somebody resigned and the story quickly faded. But back to RTÉ, where the plot thickens. Had Q&A not been cancelled at the last minute, Mary would have been on the panel with Fine Gael’s Jim Mitchell. A view quickly formed in Fianna Fáil circles – one shared by Moore – that the Minister escaped an ambush that night. Inevitably, she would have been asked about her troubled relationship with CIÉ and answered it with her usual confidence, only for someone – possibly the late Mr Mitchell – to remark if she was such a great minister, how come her chairman had resigned? Cue bafflement, consternation ... carnage. There is a delicious final twist. Much later on that fateful Tuesday, the then minister of state Mary Hanafin contacted O’Rourke about a strange voice message someone had left on her mobile phone. Richard Moore says it went something like: “Hello Ivan, I think matters have worked out well; let me know what else I can do.” In those days, TDs were allocated phones with sequenced numbers. There was (and still is) a one-digit difference between the phone numbers of Ivan Yates and Mary Hanafin. Back then, she was used to people leaving messages placing bets on horses. Yates was a bookie as well as an ambitious politician. O’Rourke believed she had her “gotcha!” moment. Her team downloaded Hanafin’s recording on to cassette tapes with a view to releasing it to the media at a snap press conference. It would have been sensational, particularly as the man who thought he was ringing Ivan Yates (and who did not get on with O’Rourke) gave his first name. But in the end they decided against it. Moore, who went on to set up a successful communications consultancy, felt this would complicate the unfolding resignation commentary – which was going well for his minister, while it might be best not to remind people of Fianna Fáil’s past history with recording phone calls. It took a lot of persuading, but Mary agreed to say nothing. A hard ask for the woman concerned, but she kept her part of the bargain. Our politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

Title: We have a problem with squirrels in our garden. What can we do to keep them at bay?

Q: We have a problem with grey squirrels in our city garden. They are digging in the beds and causing damage to some of the plants. Any tips on how to keep them at bay? RL, Blackrock, Dublin A: As charming as their arboreal acrobatics might be to watch, grey squirrels can be a real problem in Irish gardens, stripping bark from broad-leaf trees, raiding birds’ nests, burrowing into lawns and digging up flower bulbs. They also feed on seeds, nuts, fruits, tender shoots and flower buds and act as a vector for diseases such as squirrel pox virus which can kill the smaller native red squirrel in a matter of weeks. They are also known to sometimes overwinter in the attics of houses where they can cause considerable damage by chewing through wires and pipework and ripping up insulation as well as contaminating water tanks. Classed as an invasive species, they were first introduced into Ireland in 1911. Thankfully the spread of their natural predator the pine marten in recent years has acted as a curb on numbers. But in urban areas where the pine marten hasn’t gained much of a foothold, grey squirrels are still common. How to best manage them? I know of one Dublin gardener who tried trapping them in a baited cage before releasing them into the wild. But this is not recommended, not least because they breed so prolifically that it would barely put a dent in their numbers but also because it could potentially threaten red squirrel populations. Bird feeders are an obvious draw, so make sure to use squirrel-proof models that prevent them from easily raiding them for food. Recently planted flower bulbs are another, for which reason seasoned gardeners often like to plant theirs under a protective layer of fine mesh chicken wire concealed beneath the surface of the soil of compost. Alternatively, they can be planted into an aquatic basket (the kind used for pond plants) covered with a layer of chicken wire and then planted into the ground. It’s also a good idea to regularly check your home for any small gaps in the eaves and/or soffit boards that could allow them entry, especially at this time of year when they are searching for a sheltered place in which to overwinter. These should be blocked up with a fine-gauge wire mesh (16 gauge, no more than 25mm size). But even with these measures, I’m afraid that they are likely to continue to be a problem.

Title: Mizuho Raises Equinix, Inc. (EQIX) Price Target to $971, Maintains Outperform Rating Amid Positive Outlook for Cab Billing Growth and xScale Demand

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of IT professionals working on a digital platform, indicating the company's agile digital services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a California-based real estate trust that operates data centers and other technology assets. Mizuho recently raised the price target on the stock to $971 from $873 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after speaking with management. The company's cab's billing growth will improve in the second half of 2024 and when combined with strong pricing power, there is upside to monthly recurring revenue, the advisory told investors in a research note. The investment firm sees multiple levers of earnings and sales growth for Equinix. While still a small part of the business, the company suggested a very robust demand pipeline for its xScale portfolio, added Mizuho. Overall EQIX ranks 16th among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of EQIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EQIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
