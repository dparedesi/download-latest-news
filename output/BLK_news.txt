Title: Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Capital explores tokenized private market access
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/mubadala-capital-kaio-tokenized-private-markets-rwa
Time Published: 2025-12-10T10:41:17Z
Full Content:
Mubadala Capital teams up with Kaio to test tokenized access to private market strategies, signaling growing sovereign interest in onchain real-world assets. Update Dec. 11, 7:06 am UTC: This article has been updated to add comments from a Kaio spokesperson. Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Capital has partnered with institutional real-world asset (RWA) infrastructure provider Kaio to explore tokenized access to private market investment strategies, marking a push from sovereign-linked capital into blockchain rails. The companies said on Tuesday that the initiative will assess how Kaio’s digital framework can enable institutional and accredited investors to access Mubadala Capital’s private market products onchain. The move signals interest in using RWA tokenization as a technological upgrade and a distribution layer for alternative assets traditionally gated behind high minimums, multi-year lockups and geographic limits. While no product is being launched yet, the collaboration marks a step toward digitizing fund structures and potentially opening global access channels to one of the region’s largest asset managers. Mubadala Capital manages, advises and administers over $430 billion in assets across private equity, credit, real estate and alternative strategies through its asset managers and investment platforms. It’s a subsidiary of Mubalada Investment Company, one of the sovereign wealth funds of the government of Abu Dhabi. On Nov. 19, Bloomberg reported that the Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC), another Mubadala subsidiary, held at least $500 million in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Fatima Al Noaimi and Max Franzetti, the co-heads of Mubadala Capital Solutions, said in the announcement that the goal is to leverage regulatory-aligned infrastructure to test how digital rails can broaden access to institutional-grade products. Kaio, which previously supported tokenized feeder structures for asset managers like BlackRock, Brevan Howard and Hamilton Lane, brought over $200 million in institutional assets onchain. The company said the collaboration with Mubadala reflects momentum toward tokenized investment vehicles across public and private markets. “This launch demonstrates how traditional institutional capital is now scaling onchain,” said Kaio CEO Shrey Rastogi. A Kaio spokesperson told Cointelegraph that they will be tokenizing Mubdala Capital’s private market investment strategies. They expect to start the project in the first quarter of 2026 and will communicate specifics next year. Related: Tether’s USDt awarded key regulatory status in Abu Dhabi By engaging with tokenization infrastructure, the company joins a growing group of institutional players exploring whether onchain mechanisms can simplify processes, reduce friction and eventually widen participation. Digital asset investment company CoinShares previously reported that RWAs saw strong growth in 2025, led by tokenized US Treasurys. The report said that onchain Treasurys increased from $3.9 billion to $8.6 billion this year. The company predicted that this trend will continue through 2026, as global demand for dollar yields is expected to continue growing. Apart from asset managers, infrastructure providers are also preparing to meet a surge in tokenized RWAs. On Wednesday, Polygon deployed a hard fork that aims to reinforce its infrastructure and improve performance. The move seemed like a prerequisite for high-frequency use cases, such as stablecoin and RWA tokenization.

Title: Private Equity’s Utility Spending Spree Threatens New Mexico
URL: http://prospect.org/2025/12/10/private-equitys-utility-spending-spree-threatens-new-mexico/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T10:15:00Z
Full Content:
New Mexico is the fifth-largest state by landmass. With its abundance of sunshine and wind, the Land of Enchantment is “a natural location for renewable energy production and clean energy jobs,” the New Mexico State Land Office explains on its website. This ample renewable generation capacity has positioned New Mexico well to supply clean energy to Western states. According to Mariel Nanasi, executive director and president of New Energy Economy (NEE), “New Mexico can not only meet all of its energy needs through renewables and storage but could also produce electricity for the highly consumptive and populous states of Arizona and California.” Using transmission interties and wholesale market arrangements, it often does just that. More from James Baratta But Nanasi and her organization have sounded the alarm on a bid by Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm, to acquire TXNM Energy for $11.5 billion. Announced in May, the deal would give Blackstone control of TXNM subsidiaries Texas-New Mexico Power and the Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), which serve 800,000 customers. Unlike a leveraged buyout, the acquisition would be fully funded with equity. For Nanasi, the proposed acquisition threatens to harm ratepayers by enabling the construction of data centers across New Mexico, rather than supplying affordable power to those who need it. “Blackstone sees this purchase as a very important strategic foray into the West,” she told the Prospect. Before obtaining TXNM, Blackstone must secure regulatory approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, or PRC. Blackstone also finds itself at the center of an ongoing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proceeding, the outcome of which will determine whether the world’s largest alternatives asset manager can acquire TXNM without undermining wholesale competition or transmission service, causing undue cross-subsidization, or adversely impacting consumers. NEE has intervened in the PRC and FERC proceedings. The proposed acquisition threatens to harm ratepayers by enabling the construction of data centers across New Mexico, rather than supplying affordable power to those who need it. Blackstone is not the only private equity player carving up New Mexico’s utility infrastructure. Bernhard Capital Partners, a smaller private equity firm based in Louisiana, has been seeking regulatory approval for its proposed acquisition of New Mexico Gas Company (NMGC), the state’s largest natural gas utility. Bernhard reached an agreement with Emera, the utility’s parent company, to acquire NMGC for approximately $1.3 billion last year. The firm also owns traditional energy assets in Louisiana and Mississippi, after acquiring CenterPoint Energy and Entergy’s natural gas distribution businesses earlier this year. For its part, Blackstone has a 5 percent stake in the embattled Ohio-based electric utility FirstEnergy, and 20 percent of the Northern Indiana Public Service Company, which is reportedly planning to expand its natural gas power plants to meet electricity demand from data centers. Acquiring TXNM would be a first for Blackstone, as the $1 trillion private markets manager has never owned a regulated utility outright. A spokesperson for Blackstone told the Prospect the firm is “the right partner to support PNM’s long-term growth” and that PNM would operate as a stand-alone business with its own leadership, with strictly regulated rates from the PRC. But the Center for Biological Diversity, an intervenor in the FERC case, recently argued that Blackstone’s application neglects the anti-competitive effects of acquiring TXNM on customers, as the company could leverage its ownership of the utility in its continued pursuit of data center investments. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) acknowledged as much in their December 4 letter to Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman. “Private equity’s money-extracting playbook isn’t anything new, and the consequences that usually follow aren’t either,” the senators wrote. BLACKSTONE HAS OFFERED TO PAY a 23 percent acquisition premium, or about $2 billion more than TXNM’s book value at the time the agreement was announced. The firm has proposed a $105 million rate credit to be distributed over a four-year period, equating to $3.51 a month for the average residential ratepayer. But NEE argues the rate credits on the table “are highly likely to prove illusory,” in large part because of the rate shock customers could face if the deal goes through. Blackstone has also announced a $10 million Good Neighbor Fund to assist low-income ratepayers over a ten-year period. The firm has demonstrated its willingness to lay out $25 million in investments for innovative technologies related to grid modernization, as well as $35 million to support economic and workforce development. “As part of the regulatory process, which includes further engagement with parties to the case, there will be opportunities for further discussions around the different ways affordability can be addressed with the benefits proposed in the application,” a TXNM spokesperson told the Prospect. The PRC and most state-level utility commissions have made it clear that customers cannot be charged any acquisition-related transaction costs, but critics say Blackstone could try to recover those costs indirectly by requesting a higher return on equity (ROE) in future rate cases, or by increasing capital spending, both of which are part and parcel of the investor-owned utility financial model. Blackstone disputes this, stating that the PRC and FERC “determine returns on equity and have oversight over capital spending; Blackstone Infrastructure and PNM do not control the authorized return on equity and PNM cannot recover capital spend in customer rates without commission approval.” (Bernhard Capital, in its attempted takeover of NMGC, has explicitly stated that customers “will not, directly or indirectly,” bear the costs of the acquisition.) Apart from customer benefits, there’s also the question of whether Blackstone would allow the PRC to preserve its jurisdiction over TXNM. Nanasi asserts it would not. “Blackstone has more money than the state of New Mexico,” she said. “They’re paying $2 billion more than the company’s worth because their plan is to get that back and then make some more money on it, so that’s how confident they are that they’re going to sweep us clean.” Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. The thrust behind her concern is the potential for affiliate transaction risk. Blackstone could leverage its ownership of PNM to benefit its investments in data centers and other businesses throughout the state. The firm owns three companies that already do business in New Mexico, including data center developer QTS. Under the PRC’s six-part test, Blackstone must demonstrate that it will not use PNM to give preferential treatment to its portfolio companies or cross-subsidize non-utility businesses like data centers. As a regulated utility, PNM has a monopoly on the delivery of electricity in its service area, which is why the burden is on Blackstone to prove that the company will not force ordinary ratepayers to pay more for electricity as a result of its non-utility activities. NEE has suggested that “Blackstone’s opaque corporate structure and history of self-dealing through affiliate transactions undermine transparency and regulatory oversight.” Conversely, Blackstone argues that “any interactions between affiliates are subject to adherence to local and federal regulations that focus specifically on avoiding unfair advantages or disadvantages.” But private equity firms should be expected to use every tool in their arsenal to influence regulatory decisions. One example comes from the Bernhard-NMGC case, which is further along in the PRC process than the Blackstone bid. On October 20, Bernhard and NMGC filed a motion to exclude the direct testimony of NEE witness Jesse George. In addition to his work as an attorney focusing on utility regulation in Louisiana, he serves as New Orleans policy director at the Alliance for Affordable Energy. The PRC hearing examiners disqualified George as an expert witness, based on the apparent lack of evidence for his qualifications to “testify on New Mexico regulatory law or policy,” per the November 3 ruling. “Blackstone is offering a Trojan horse to ratepayers; it’s a deceptive gift.” George’s testimony focused on utilities Bernhard has owned, including National Water Infrastructure (NWI), one of the largest sewer utility companies in Louisiana. According to the Energy and Policy Institute, an inspection by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality “revealed a large amount of sludge build-up, with bloodworms observed throughout the sludge—indicative of stagnant water containing organic matter often associated with sanitary waste.” Bernhard denied any wrongdoing, though it paid a small settlement to the department. In his testimony, George urged the PRC to consider Bernhard’s track record at NWI in its application of the six-factor test. “I think this sort of reducing of his status is pretty unusual,” said Keriann Conroy, research associate at the Energy and Policy Institute. “The only detail that we get from the hearing examiners [is that George] is not qualified because they couldn’t find evidence that he has other significant regulatory experience, so that seems sort of like a denial of his experience in Louisiana in some ways.” At a November 25 hearing, numerous public commenters expressed opposition to Bernhard’s proposed acquisition of NMGC. Among them was Patricia Brown, a longtime Sante Fe County resident and member of the New Mexico Energy Policy Research Advisory. She argued the PRC’s constitutional duty to regulate the state’s public utilities “was effectively subordinated when the hearing examiners barred from the record the history of fines, violations, audits, investigations and settlements associated with Bernhard Capital Partners and its affiliates.” Brown said that information “is directly relevant to whether the firm can be trusted to operate New Mexico’s gas systems safely, prudently and honestly.” These types of maneuvers were also seen the last time TXNM tried to sell itself. In November 2021, the New Mexico PRC rejected the company’s proposed merger with Avangrid, an energy services company and subsidiary of the Spanish multinational electric utility conglomerate Iberdrola. The ruling concluded nearly two years of regulatory proceedings that exposed the prospective buyers’ “record of poor service, high rates, safety violations, bad faith contracts and market manipulation,” according to NEE. The following year, PNM and Avangrid appealed the PRC’s decision to the New Mexico Supreme Court. NEE described the move as “an effort to circumvent the authority and oversight of the Commission in their failed attempt to establish a ‘beachhead’ for domination of the energy generation potential in New Mexico at the expense of New Mexico electricity customers.” The group also alleged that “Avangrid and Iberdrola engaged in back door ex-parte communications” to convince the PRC to remand the case. The prospective buyers also threatened legal action against NEE, the only intervenor in the proceeding to oppose the deal, before abandoning their acquisition bid in January 2024. While that had a favorable outcome from NEE’s standpoint, the persistence shows the disadvantage of public-interest organizations relative to private buyers. PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONERS in New Mexico are appointed by the governor to serve six-year terms. In 2020, voters approved a constitutional amendment that restructured the PRC to be governed by three appointees rather than five elected commissioners, who previously served four-year terms. New Mexico has since counted itself among states like Minnesota where the governor is responsible for appointing public utility commissioners. The Prospect previously chronicled BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners’ efforts to manufacture support for its ultimately successful acquisition of ALLETE, detailing how the Minnesota Department of Commerce consulted with local environmental groups that came out in support of the deal. A similar saga is playing out in New Mexico. As The Candle reported, Dominic Gabello, a former senior adviser to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) and independent consultant, arranged a meeting between his clients at Bernhard and Grisham to “talk about their vision for the company and how the acquisition is progressing.” Both Gabello and Grisham have been silent on the meeting, which reportedly occurred on the morning of October 11, 2024. The Candle also observed that Gabello has yet to register with the New Mexico secretary of state as a lobbyist for Bernhard. NEE has been leaning on its twofold outreach strategy to educate New Mexicans about the implications of taking New Mexico utility companies private. “We have a legal strategy, and we have a political strategy, and we at all times try to marry those,” Nanasi told the Prospect. “Our jobs are to be translators.” As part of its political strategy, NEE has taken to highlighting the inherent irony of the name Blackstone gave to the holding company it will use to acquire PNM: Troy ParentCo. “The mission of the Trojan horse, a ruse, was to destroy Troy from the inside,” Nanasi said. “Blackstone is offering a Trojan horse to ratepayers; it’s a deceptive gift, and one that will ultimately dominate and destroy us if we allow them to enter New Mexico.” If folks in the business of writing, editing, and curating quality reporting and analysis can only make the math work by putting their work behind a paywall, we’re in trouble. Journalism is so critical to democracy that a free press is literally safeguarded in the Constitution. But it doesn’t say, “a free press only for those who can afford it.” Information is becoming available more as a luxury good than the basis of a free society. We will never put the Prospect behind a paywall because we think information should be free. But we need you to be a part of this project.Help keep the Prospect free and available to everyone, not just the few. Can you chip in to support our December fundraising campaign? We need to raise $100,000 by the end of the year to power our journalism in 2026. David DayenExecutive Editor James Baratta is a writing fellow at The American Prospect.

Some 2,500 homes and businesses still without power Around 90 flights cancelled or delayed across all Irish airports yesterday, while all ferries were suspended during the storm Status Orange wind alerts lifted from all areas last night as clean-up operation got into gear Storm Bram causes disruption, damage and power cuts across the country Forecasters have issued a fresh wind warning for three counties as the Storm Bram recovery and clean-up continues. Crews are currently working to restore power to the remaining 2,500 homes and businesses left without connection. Almost 60,000 premises were left without power at the height of the storm and thousands of commuters were hit by cancelled flights, ferries and trains as well as road closures. The south Atlantic storm significantly strengthened as it approached the Irish coast early yesterday morning and struck with powerful wind gusts of almost 120kmh. Now, forecasters have issued a Status Yellow wind warning for Galway, Mayo and Kerry. The warning will be in place overnight from midnight tonight until 7am on Thursday morning. Forecasters are warning of “strong and gusty southerly winds mainly affecting coastal parts.” Ireland is now on high alert for flooding amid fears the heavy rainfall associated with Storm Bram – combined with torrential rainfall over the weekend – will cause rivers and streams to break their banks. Irish Rail has said that all routes are back operational today. “A full schedule of services will operate on all routes today,” an Irish Rail spokesperson said in a statement on X. Flight operations at Dublin Airport are also "largely back to normal" this morning after what was described as a "day of significant disruption" yesterday. More than 100 flights were cancelled by airlines yesterday, and 20 flights were diverted to other airports. Today will be busier than usual for the staff, with more passengers at terminals due to their rebooked flights departing today. Meanwhile, a number of flights were also cancelled this morning following the disruption yesterday. A spokesperson for Dublin Airport, Graeme McQueen, told the Irish Independent: "Flight operations at Dublin Airport are largely back to normal this morning following a day of significant disruption yesterday due to Storm Bram." "In total, more than 100 flights were cancelled by airlines on Tuesday, while 20 flights diverted to other airports, before returning later in the day once the challenging winds had eased." Mr McQueen continued: "The Dublin Airport team worked hard through the night to help airlines prepare for this morning's busy first wave of flights, which has departed as normal, with only a very small number of cancelled flights on the departures board." "Today will be busier than it normally would have been in the terminals with many passengers who were discommoded on Tuesday being re-accommodated on flights leaving today. "We thank passengers for their patience and understanding yesterday in what were challenging circumstances due to the adverse weather conditions. "As always, passengers seeking updates on the status of their flight today should contact their airline directly," he added. Fortunately, major flood damage was avoided at high tides yesterday despite the sea surge associated with Bram as flood defences nationwide proved effective. Cork city suffered the worst of the flooding with some city centre quays closed and a number of low-lying roads outside the city proving impassable though no major property damage was reported. Flooding hit Waterford’s Plunkett railway station where operations had to be suspended after the tracks became totally submerged. Coastal flooding was also reported in Tramore and Dungarvan in Waterford as well as Blackrock in Louth and Clontarf in Dublin. Crews work to clear a fallen tree from Killarney Road in Bray during Storm Bram. Photo: Owen Breslin Waterford City and County director of services Gabriel Hynes told RTÉ the storm had brought an “extremely hazardous day”. He said there were coastal surges and overtopping, but storm barriers had been put up in the centre of Waterford city, which had protected the area. However, areas such as Tramore and Dungarvan had experienced flooding and waves overtopping but no significant damage. ESB Networks said crews have been working since first light to restore power to all homes, farms and businesses affected by Storm Bram. As of 5.00pm today, approximately 2,500 customers remain without supply predominately in the Southeast region. "ESB Networks moved crews from other areas of the country today to assist colleagues in the Southeast region to reconnect customers as fast as they safely can,” a statement said. "Crews will continue to work late into the evening to restore supply but due to the damage to the electricity network, a small number of customers in the region will be without power overnight and we apologise for the particular difficulty this causes. “Customers without power can check for real-time updates on when their fault is expected to be repaired at www.powercheck.ie. “If you come across fallen wires or damaged electricity network, never, ever touch or approach these as they are LIVE and extremely dangerous. Please report any damage to electricity infrastructure by calling 1800 372 999. Customers should have their MPRN available to access recorded information specific to their location." Status Orange wind alerts were lifted from all areas last night as the clean-up operation got into gear. Wind gusts of almost 120kmh were reported in some coastal waters as a Status Red alert was in place for all marine areas, with the south and west feeling the worst of Bram’s fury. This was later downgraded to a Status Orange marine alert. Sea swells caused extensive damage to the carpark at Doolin Pier in Co Clare. Photo: Press 22 A total of 70 schools remained closed or shut early because of the storm, all in exposed coastal areas of Munster and Connacht. The Department of Education said the decision to close rested entirely with local school boards of management who made such decisions based on local advice and the safety of school transport operations.

Photo: Gerry Mooney Multiple public attractions were closed yesterday because of the safety threat posed by Storm Bram including the Cliffs of Moher in Clare. Many outdoor Christmas lights attractions will undergo safety checks before re-opening today. The Punchestown race meeting planned for yesterday will now be staged tomorrow. Water Safety Ireland and the Coast Guard urged people to avoid exposed coastal areas and to exercise extreme caution near lakes, rivers and streams over the coming days as most waterways will be transformed into raging torrents. Met Éireann warned Ireland will experience unsettled weather over the coming days in the wake of Storm Bram. “This mobile Atlantic regime will continue to bring unsettled and mixed conditions over the coming days with spells of wet and windy weather but also some drier and brighter spells,” a forecaster said.

From cross-border payments to tokenized deposits, the world’s top banks are considering rebuilding how payments and liquidity move, settling in seconds and bringing programmability to instruments, markets and identity. Blockchain technology is starting to shift from crypto experiment to institutional infrastructure. Leading banks are building shared ledgers, tokenized money and programmable settlement rails to move value in real time—modernizing liquidity, reconciliation and trust across global payments, treasury and markets. Real-world deployment is now visible across key use cases: tokenized deposits for 24/7 liquidity; instant cross-border settlement; shared trade finance ledgers; tokenized assets; and compliance-built-in identity frameworks. These advances can compress settlement times, enhance transparency and create programmable financial flows. As banks move pilots into live environments, the core design question is public versus private networks. Institutions are considering hybrid models that balance scalability and control, while emerging standards and oversight will shape policy alignment and global interoperability.

Once the domain of startups, it is now part of how global institutions such as Citi, J.P. Morgan, Visa and others are exploring the future of payments and liquidity management. From tokenized deposits and programmable payments to the settlement of digital assets, the technology previously seen as a niche outlier is increasingly being considered as part of the operating system for modern finance. As the landscape shifts from proof of concept to production, blockchain technology is becoming a part of the connective tissue linking payments, deposits and markets—one component of a shared digital architecture that brings new efficiency while preserving the trust on which global finance depends. This Tracker explores where programmable finance is finding real-world traction, what leading institutions are building today, and what these advances mean for treasury, operations and risk leaders alike. But before we dig into the details, here’s a little background for nontechnical readers. What it is: A blockchain is a shared database, designed to be tamper-resistant, that multiple parties can update. Think of it as a common ledger—kept in sync across institutions—where every entry is time-stamped, auditable and hard to alter retroactively. Permissioned blockchains limit access to vetted participants (banks, payment networks, corporates). Public blockchains are open to anyone. Both support tokens and coins, which are digital representations of money, claims or assets that can move and settle in near real time. Why it matters: In banking, blockchains can potentially reduce manual reconciliations, shorten settlement windows and make money programmable. For treasurers and operations leaders, that could mean efficient liquidity management and the ability to commercially interact with underbanked regions. For risk and compliance teams, it could also mean greater traceability if designed accordingly. How to read this: Below, we organize today’s institutional blockchain activity around five use cases your teams are prioritizing: tokenized deposits; cross-border payments; shared ledgers for supply chains; liquidity for assets, including fixed holdings such as real estate; and security and identity. We also address some of the challenges inherent in choosing between public and private blockchain networks. Tokenized deposits are bank-issued digital representations of traditional deposits recorded on a blockchain. They’re backed one-to-one by deposits, operate within existing regulatory frameworks and can be automated (for example, to sweep cash, release escrow or trigger conditional payouts). For corporate clients, they turn static balances into always-available working capital. J.P. Morgan has extended JPM Coin—its permissioned platform that lets clients transfer dollar deposits on a private blockchain—and announced plans for a USD deposit token to settle transactions on Coinbase’s Base network. Together, these initiatives give institutions compliant, round-the-clock access to liquidity. Citi is advancing a similar vision through Citi Token Services, which enables real-time movement of tokenized deposits within its network. Other institutions such as HSBC have also announced plans for tokenized deposits. In parallel, industry groups and consortia are exploring models such as the Regulated Liability Network (RLN) and participating in BIS-sponsored Project Agora—separate initiatives that aim to connect commercial-bank deposits, central-bank money and other regulated liabilities on shared ledgers to support instant settlement between trusted counterparties. In fact, Citi’s “Real Time: 24/7 Finance in an Always-On World” article points to a new baseline: continuous liquidity that shifts treasury operations from reactive to predictive and data-driven. For CFOs, that looks like intraday cash positioning without cutoffs; for controllers, like automated reconciliation; and for risk teams, like programmable controls around when, where and how funds can move. For decades, cross-border transfers moved along correspondent banking networks. Today, banks and FinTechs can also use blockchain rails to move verified value almost instantly—cutting time and uncertainty. J.P. Morgan’s journey started with the Interbank Information Network, later Liink on the Onyx platform, to pre-validate transaction data. In 2024, the bank’s blockchain arm was rebranded as Kinexys to unite payments, tokenization and programmable-money capabilities. Citi likewise integrated Citi Token Services with 24/7 USD Clearing to support real-time payments between its clients and those of participating third-party institutions on a permissioned platform. Networks are adapting, too: Visa B2B Connect routes transactions directly between banks on blockchain, and Mastercard is piloting programmable payments for conditional settlement and instant clearing. Ripple expanded RippleNet to offer near-instant cross-border transfers using tokenized fiat and the XRP Ledger for liquidity bridging. Trade finance has been defined by paper, siloed information and post-fact reconciliation. Distributed ledgers potentially replace all that with a single source of truth that participants can rely on—reducing fraud risk and accelerating funding in jurisdictions where digital contracts are accepted by law. Among the initiatives leading this shift was Contour, founded by banks including Citi, HSBC and ING. It was acquired by FinTech firm Xalts in early 2025, with Xalts continuing its work in digitizing letters of credit (LCs) and related processes across the existing network. Similarly, Komgo digitizes trade documents such as LCs and guarantees, offering real-time verification that helps banks and corporates reduce fraud and speed capital. Even retired platforms left durable standards: TradeLens (IBM and Maersk) pushed open-data models now adopted elsewhere, and the former Marco Polo Network by TradeIX and R3 automated receivables and payments via smart contracts—validating transactions in real time and releasing funds automatically once terms were met. The upshot: fewer disputes, faster cash, better auditability. Tokenization is changing how institutions can issue, trade and hold assets. By representing ownership of securities, funds and even real estate on shared ledgers, banks can combine market liquidity with blockchain transparency for faster settlement, real-time ownership records and more granular control over transfers. A few milestones illustrate the arc. BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund—launched in March 2024—became the first tokenized U.S. Treasury fund for qualified investors on a public chain, enabling instant settlement and verifiable ownership. Goldman Sachs expanded its Digital Asset Platform to issue tokenized bonds and structured products with same-day clearing and real-time portfolio visibility. Citi collaborated with the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) to connect traditional custody with blockchain-based infrastructures for tokenized private-market assets. Across Europe, BNP Paribas and Société Générale are issuing tokenized funds under MiCA, the comprehensive European Union framework for governing digital assets, while the European Central Bank continues integration work in 2025. The direction is clear: Tokenized markets have the potential to compress post-trade timelines and unlock new distribution channels and investor bases. As digital assets enter mainstream banking, innovation and regulation are converging in software. Policymakers are testing privacy and anti-money laundering (AML) controls inside payment instruments, while banks adopt analytics and shared utilities to verify identity and provenance. In particular, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) FinTech Note (August 2025) outlined how central banks can embed safeguards within central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)—digital forms of a country’s fiat currency issued and regulated by its central bank. The Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Orchid tests programmable payments with built-in identity verification, and the United Kingdom’s Project Rosalind—a Bank of England and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) collaboration—prototyped an application programming interface (API) framework that connected banks, FinTechs and merchants for secure CBDC payments. On the private side, partners like Chainalysis and Elliptic give banks tools to detect illicit activity across public and permissioned ledgers. Many banks are also building shared know your customer (KYC) utilities to store verified credentials on permissioned networks—aligning compliance and privacy. Tokenized Deposits & Digital Cash: 24/7 liquidity, programmable cash flows, streamlined treasury. Examples: Citi (RLN), JPM Coin, HSBC Cross-Border Payments: Instant settlement, lower FX/compliance costs, full traceability. Examples: Citi, J.P. Morgan, Ripple, Visa Trade Finance & Supply Chain: Faster documentation, reduced fraud, verifiable provenance. Examples: Contour/Xalts (Citi, HSBC, ING), Komgo Asset Tokenization & Custody: Fractional ownership, instant settlement, transparent reporting. Examples: BlackRock (BUIDL), Goldman Sachs, Citi + SDX Regulated Identity & Compliance: Built-in KYC/AML controls, secure data sharing, enhanced auditability. Examples: MAS CBDC Pilot, BoE Project Rosalind, IMF FinTech Note As blockchain shifts from experimentation to potential implementation in global finance, the question is no longer whether blockchain networks will shape money movement but how they will do so in a controlled, compliant and scalable way across borders, currencies and institutions. As volumes rise and real-world, scalable use cases emerge, the key design choice now sits at the foundation: whether to transact on public, permissionless networks or private, permissioned chains that replicate institutional controls. That decision is not abstract. Public chains offer global reach—an advantage that can support tokenized deposits, cross-border transfers and real-time settlement. But they also introduce questions around risk exposure, liability, regulatory treatment, sanctions compliance and identity assurance, requiring banks to evaluate how they safeguard funds and verify counterparties in an open ecosystem. Private chains, by contrast, provide data privacy, operational control and governance, with defined participants and rule sets. Yet they can face challenges, since scale, liquidity and network effects may develop more slowly when access is limited. As banks accelerate pilots into production, many are evaluating the adoption of hybrid approaches, choosing networks case-by-case based on the functions they need to perform and the risks they must manage. These architectural questions are not roadblocks but design milestones. As institutions move further into rollout, policy frameworks will shape how fast the next wave of adoption unfolds. The foundation is now in place. The next step is alignment on standards and oversight—and that is where our next Tracker turns. In practice, banks are advancing along two parallel blockchain tracks. Public, permissionless networks enable open settlement rails and global liquidity—key to tokenized cash, programmable settlement and institutional decentralized finance (DeFi) access. But they raise material considerations: who holds liability when funds move across a public chain, how risk and AML controls are enforced, and how legal frameworks apply at scale. Private, permissioned networks give institutions confidence around identity, data control and transaction governance, aligning more naturally with existing regulatory expectations. Their challenge is achieving critical mass: If participation is limited, liquidity may remain fragmented and network efficiency could be constrained. The emerging reality is convergence, not competition. Leading banks increasingly are looking to pursue selective interoperability, leveraging private networks for controlled flows and public chains for reach: a model that mirrors early internet adoption and positions blockchain as a shared financial infrastructure layer. Blockchain technology’s widespread institutional adoption is imminent. The largest banks and payment networks are no longer testing—they’re building. The next frontier is alignment: interoperability, standards and policies that connect private-sector innovation with public-sector oversight. The future of finance won’t merely adapt to blockchain; increasingly, it will be built on it.

A status yellow wind warning is set to come into force overnight for counties Galway, Kerry and Mayo. Met Éireann has warned of difficult travel conditions, potential for fallen trees and scattered debris in the coastal regions, which were among those worst affected by Storm Bram. The warning begins at midnight and expires at 7am on Thursday. As of 5pm on Wednesday, the ESB confirmed, 2,500 households and businesses remain without supply predominately in the southeast region. “Crews will continue to work late into the evening to restore supply but due to the damage to the electricity network, a small number of customers in the region will be without power overnight and we apologise for the particular difficulty this causes,” the ESB said. Met Éireann has said a temperature of 17.2 degrees was recorded at its weather station in Dublin’s Phoenix Park during Storm Bram. The temperature, which is subject to verification, was the highest December level recorded at the weather station since December 7th, 2016, when a figure of 16 degrees was noted. The highest verified temperature recorded in Ireland in December is 18.1 degrees which was noted at Dublin’s Peamount weather station on December 2nd in 1948. Met Éireann meteorologist Matthew Martin said the high temperature in the Phoenix Park was associated with Storm Bram, which drew warm and moist air north from the Azores. Mr Martin said the high temperature could have been caused by a weather phenomenon known as the Foehn, or Föhn, effect. This effect is where air is forced up and over a mountain, in this case the Dublin and Wicklow mountains. As it rises, it cools and drops its moisture on the windward side, before descending the leeward side – in this case the Dublin side – becoming compressed and creating rapid warming. Mr Martin said a spell of sunshine in the Dublin area could also have contributed to the rapid warming of the air temperature. Graeme McQueen, a spokesman for Dublin Airport, said more than 100 flights had been cancelled. A further 20 flights were temporarily diverted to other airports. Just one flight was cancelled at Ireland West Airport at Knock, Co Mayo, as the storm was focused on the south and east of the island. There was also flooding in coastal towns and villages from Blackrock, Co Louth, to Clontarf promenade in Co Dublin to Tramore and Dungarvan in Co Waterford and the Cork City quays. Most of the flooding was in coastal areas at times of high tides as wind speeds rose, particularly in the southeast of the island, moving northwest as the day progressed. Sherkin Island, off the coast of Cork, registered the highest wind speed on Tuesday at 119km/h. Roches Point registered 117km/h, as did Malin Head, while Cork airport had wind speeds of up to 100km/h, according to Met Éireann. The Department of Education said about 70 schools closed their doors on Tuesday due to the status orange and yellow wind warnings that affected the entire country. Most of these schools were in western coastal areas. Irish Rail confirmed disruption across its network, including the suspension of services between Greystones and Wicklow town from about 3pm on Tuesday due to flooding. In Dublin, a tree blocked the line and damaged overhead wires between Grand Canal Dock and Lansdowne, affecting operations. Both lines reopened on Tuesday night. There were widespread reports of trees falling and minor road closures. The Road Safety Authority advised drivers to proceed only with all possible care. In Dublin, a tree fell across the bus lane of the N11 dual carriageway at Stillorgan.

Title: Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Is ‘Climbing Another Wall Of Worry’– Here’s Why

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ark Invest’s CEO and CIO, Cathie Wood, joined Fox Business’s “Morning With Maria” to discuss her investment strategy as she believes the US is entering a “historic productivity surge,” and why she is bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) for 2026. On Tuesday, Ark Invest’s CEO, Cathie Wood, shared her perspective on the recent Bitcoin performance, which has retraced over 10% in the past month and struggled to reclaim crucial levels over the past few weeks. To Wood, Bitcoin has been behaving like a risk-on asset and is currently “climbing another wall of worry” that has made investors wary of the leading crypto asset’s upcoming performance. As she explained, there is a fear of the four-year cycle, which suggests that 2026 will be a corrective year for Bitcoin. Historically, BTC has seen significant price pullbacks during bear markets, with retraces of up to 75% to 90% in previous cycles. The aggressive Q4 2025 correction has shattered most investors’ expectations of an end-of-year bull run, raising concerns that the crypto market has already entered the bearish phase of the cycle after the more than 30% drop from the October highs. However, Ark Invest’s CEO considers that “the four-year cycle is going to be disrupted” as volatility has significantly diminished over the past few years, and large-scale investors turn to the rapidly growing industry. “We think that the move by institutions into this new asset class is going to prevent much more of a decline,” Wood affirmed, noting, “we might have seen it a couple of weeks ago,” when BTC managed to hold the $80,000 barrier during the late November correction. She previously asserted that growing institutional adoption will be a powerful driver for long-term value for the cryptocurrency, adding that institutions “really have just dipped their toes into this space. We have just started, so we have a long way to go.” During the interview, Wood also reaffirmed her previous forecast that the flagship crypto will outperform gold next year, despite its choppy performance during the last quarter of 2025. She highlighted that “gold is more of a risk-off asset,” and its 60% year-to-date (YTD) rise is “proof” that Bitcoin is climbing a wall of worry as investors “are using gold as a hedge against geopolitical risks.” Nonetheless, Ark Invest’s CEO pointed out that between the early 80s and the late 90s, gold peaked and “went down as we were in the golden age of innovation, ending with the internet.” Now, she believes that the same could happen soon, as what she calls “the AI age” starts and the market potentially recovers. Meanwhile, she forecasted that Bitcoin would remain risk-on and outperform gold in 2026. “I really believe we are moving from a rolling recession where we’ve been for the last three years, into a rolling recovery, which we think we are entering now. Then, a productivity-driven boom the likes of which we have never seen before,” Wood concluded. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,011, a 3.75% increase in the daily timeframe.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Title: Ethereum Price Climbs Toward $3,300 For The First Time Since November: What’s Driving The Surge?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. On Tuesday, the Ethereum price experienced a notable surge, climbing by 6.5% and reclaiming the critical $3,300 mark for the first time in nearly a month. This has allowed Ethereum to outpace its peers among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, showcasing a nearly 12% recovery for the leading altcoin over the past week. Analysts from Bull Theory attribute this resurgence to several key factors, including significant institutional interest in Ethereum. The firm highlighted BitMine, which holds the largest public company collection of ETH, as a major player in this recovery phase. In a recent social media update on X (formerly Twitter), the analysts pointed out that demand for ETH is on the rise as Wall Street quietly builds on the Ethereum platform. Notably, major financial institutions are beginning to make substantial moves in the Ethereum space. BlackRock, which manages $13.5 trillion, is launching tokenized funds and has filed for a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). Other notable players include JPMorgan with $4 trillion in assets, Deutsche Bank at $1.1 trillion, and Standard Chartered with $800 billion. These firms are developing tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure specifically on Ethereum and its Layer 2 (L2) solutions. In addition, well-known financial entities such as Amundi, HSBC, BNY Mellon, Coinbase (COIN), Kraken, and Robinhood (HOOD) are incorporating Ethereum into their operations for functions like custody, settlement, and rollup infrastructure. As a result, these large companies are holding and staking ETH to generate yield, significantly increasing the altcoin’s demand. BitMine, for instance, anticipates earning over $400 million annually from its staking position. Such institutional involvement has led market experts like Tom Lee to speculate that the Ethereum price could potentially reach $12,000 by 2026, driven by growing staking demand and the scaling of tokenization efforts. Adding to the momentum, Arkham reported that Tom Lee’s Ethereum treasury firm acquired 138,452 ETH since last week, valued at approximately $431.97 million. BitMine currently holds $12.05 billion in ETH and has an additional $1 billion allocated for further purchases. In a different development that could bolster the Ethereum price further, Chris MacDonald, an analyst for The Motley Fool, highlighted reports indicating that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) confirmed US banks can now legally conduct “riskless principal” transactions in crypto assets. The analyst asserted that this new regulatory approval may lead to an influx of capital into digital assets, which would likely benefit the Ethereum price and holders, as well as other top cryptocurrencies. As of this writing, the Ethereum price is trading at $3,325. Despite recent gains, the price is still nearly 33% below the all-time high of $4,946, which was reached earlier this year.

Title: Historic Reversal: Ethereum ETF Flows Plunge To Worst Month Since Launch

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum’s momentum in institutional markets just hit a major roadblock. After months of enthusiasm surrounding spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), new data has shown that ETF flows have sunk to their worst monthly total since their launch. The sharp drop reflects a broader cooldown in investor demand, as market volatility and shifting risk appetite weigh on crypto allocations. In an X post, a crypto analyst known as Milk Road revealed that the Ethereum ETFs had just printed their worst month on record since launch, which is roughly $1.4 billion in net outflows, the largest single-month withdrawal that ETH has ever encountered. Historically, ETF flow reversals tell more about liquidity pressure in the broader financial system than the long-term fundamentals of the asset itself. When redemptions spike this hard, it’s usually a sign that broader risk sentiment is cracking, not that the asset itself broke. Meanwhile, most investors don’t know that while ETFs were handing back, Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) stepped in as aggressive buyers. BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) quietly added over 300,000 ETH, worth nearly $800 million at the time, to its treasuries. If the ETF outflow continues to accelerate, the near-term price action will remain choppy as liquidity gets strained at the edges. However, if DAT inflows continue scaling, it builds the foundation for a tighter supply setup into 2026. The tension between this panicked short-term selling pressure and the quiet structural long-term accumulation is the most important dynamic for positioning. Crypto trader Bull Theory has noted that last week, BitMine bought an astonishing 138,452 ETH, worth $437.7 million. This single transaction solidifies their position as the largest ETH treasury in the world, holding 3.86 million ETH, valued at $12.4 billion and accounting for 3.2% of the entire circulating supply. The true source of rising ETH demand is that Wall Street is quietly building on ETH. BlackRock, with $13.5 trillion AUM, has launched tokenized funds on ETH and has filed for a staked ETH ETF. JPMorgan, with $4 trillion, Deutsche Bank, with $1.1 trillion, and Standard Chartered, with $800 billion, are developing tokenization and DeFi infrastructure using ETH and its Layer-2 networks. Institutions like Amundi, HSBC, BNY Mellon, Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood are all using ETH rails for custody and settlement or rollup infrastructure for scaling and security. Furthermore, large companies are now holding and staking ETH for yield. BitMine alone expects to generate $400 million+ a year in staking revenue from its position. Tom Lee believes that as staking demand grows and institutions scale tokenization increases, ETH could reach $12,000 in 2026. “A Bitcoin miner is now the largest Ethereum whale, Wall Street is building on ETH, and treasuries are shifting toward yield. ETH is quickly becoming part of the Global Financial System.” Bull Theory noted. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: Storm Bram: 8,000 remain without power, country on high alert for flooding after storm struck with gusts of up to 120kmh

Some 2,500 homes and businesses still without power Around 90 flights cancelled or delayed across all Irish airports yesterday, while all ferries were suspended during the storm Status Orange wind alerts lifted from all areas last night as clean-up operation got into gear Storm Bram causes disruption, damage and power cuts across the country Forecasters have issued a fresh wind warning for three counties as the Storm Bram recovery and clean-up continues. Crews are currently working to restore power to the remaining 2,500 homes and businesses left without connection. Almost 60,000 premises were left without power at the height of the storm and thousands of commuters were hit by cancelled flights, ferries and trains as well as road closures. The south Atlantic storm significantly strengthened as it approached the Irish coast early yesterday morning and struck with powerful wind gusts of almost 120kmh. Now, forecasters have issued a Status Yellow wind warning for Galway, Mayo and Kerry. The warning will be in place overnight from midnight tonight until 7am on Thursday morning. Forecasters are warning of “strong and gusty southerly winds mainly affecting coastal parts.” Ireland is now on high alert for flooding amid fears the heavy rainfall associated with Storm Bram – combined with torrential rainfall over the weekend – will cause rivers and streams to break their banks. Irish Rail has said that all routes are back operational today. “A full schedule of services will operate on all routes today,” an Irish Rail spokesperson said in a statement on X. Flight operations at Dublin Airport are also "largely back to normal" this morning after what was described as a "day of significant disruption" yesterday. More than 100 flights were cancelled by airlines yesterday, and 20 flights were diverted to other airports. Today will be busier than usual for the staff, with more passengers at terminals due to their rebooked flights departing today. Meanwhile, a number of flights were also cancelled this morning following the disruption yesterday. A spokesperson for Dublin Airport, Graeme McQueen, told the Irish Independent: "Flight operations at Dublin Airport are largely back to normal this morning following a day of significant disruption yesterday due to Storm Bram." "In total, more than 100 flights were cancelled by airlines on Tuesday, while 20 flights diverted to other airports, before returning later in the day once the challenging winds had eased." Mr McQueen continued: "The Dublin Airport team worked hard through the night to help airlines prepare for this morning's busy first wave of flights, which has departed as normal, with only a very small number of cancelled flights on the departures board." "Today will be busier than it normally would have been in the terminals with many passengers who were discommoded on Tuesday being re-accommodated on flights leaving today. "We thank passengers for their patience and understanding yesterday in what were challenging circumstances due to the adverse weather conditions. "As always, passengers seeking updates on the status of their flight today should contact their airline directly," he added. Fortunately, major flood damage was avoided at high tides yesterday despite the sea surge associated with Bram as flood defences nationwide proved effective. Cork city suffered the worst of the flooding with some city centre quays closed and a number of low-lying roads outside the city proving impassable though no major property damage was reported. Flooding hit Waterford’s Plunkett railway station where operations had to be suspended after the tracks became totally submerged. Coastal flooding was also reported in Tramore and Dungarvan in Waterford as well as Blackrock in Louth and Clontarf in Dublin. Crews work to clear a fallen tree from Killarney Road in Bray during Storm Bram. Photo: Owen Breslin Waterford City and County director of services Gabriel Hynes told RTÉ the storm had brought an “extremely hazardous day”. He said there were coastal surges and overtopping, but storm barriers had been put up in the centre of Waterford city, which had protected the area. However, areas such as Tramore and Dungarvan had experienced flooding and waves overtopping but no significant damage. ESB Networks said crews have been working since first light to restore power to all homes, farms and businesses affected by Storm Bram. As of 5.00pm today, approximately 2,500 customers remain without supply predominately in the Southeast region. "ESB Networks moved crews from other areas of the country today to assist colleagues in the Southeast region to reconnect customers as fast as they safely can,” a statement said. "Crews will continue to work late into the evening to restore supply but due to the damage to the electricity network, a small number of customers in the region will be without power overnight and we apologise for the particular difficulty this causes. “Customers without power can check for real-time updates on when their fault is expected to be repaired at www.powercheck.ie. “If you come across fallen wires or damaged electricity network, never, ever touch or approach these as they are LIVE and extremely dangerous. Please report any damage to electricity infrastructure by calling 1800 372 999. Customers should have their MPRN available to access recorded information specific to their location." Status Orange wind alerts were lifted from all areas last night as the clean-up operation got into gear. Wind gusts of almost 120kmh were reported in some coastal waters as a Status Red alert was in place for all marine areas, with the south and west feeling the worst of Bram’s fury. This was later downgraded to a Status Orange marine alert. Sea swells caused extensive damage to the carpark at Doolin Pier in Co Clare. Photo: Press 22 A total of 70 schools remained closed or shut early because of the storm, all in exposed coastal areas of Munster and Connacht. The Department of Education said the decision to close rested entirely with local school boards of management who made such decisions based on local advice and the safety of school transport operations.

Photo: Gerry Mooney Multiple public attractions were closed yesterday because of the safety threat posed by Storm Bram including the Cliffs of Moher in Clare. Many outdoor Christmas lights attractions will undergo safety checks before re-opening today. The Punchestown race meeting planned for yesterday will now be staged tomorrow. Water Safety Ireland and the Coast Guard urged people to avoid exposed coastal areas and to exercise extreme caution near lakes, rivers and streams over the coming days as most waterways will be transformed into raging torrents. Met Éireann warned Ireland will experience unsettled weather over the coming days in the wake of Storm Bram. “This mobile Atlantic regime will continue to bring unsettled and mixed conditions over the coming days with spells of wet and windy weather but also some drier and brighter spells,” a forecaster said.

Many outdoor Christmas lights attractions will undergo safety checks before re-opening today. The Punchestown race meeting planned for yesterday will now be staged tomorrow. Water Safety Ireland and the Coast Guard urged people to avoid exposed coastal areas and to exercise extreme caution near lakes, rivers and streams over the coming days as most waterways will be transformed into raging torrents. Met Éireann warned Ireland will experience unsettled weather over the coming days in the wake of Storm Bram. “This mobile Atlantic regime will continue to bring unsettled and mixed conditions over the coming days with spells of wet and windy weather but also some drier and brighter spells,” a forecaster said.

Title: Hudson Yards Remakes Its Retail Mix

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily It's been seven years since The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards had its grand opening, leases are turning, and Odyssey Retail Advisors was hired to help fine-tune the lineup. Senior Editor, Retail It’s a new day for The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards. Retail square footage has been reduced and converted to additional office space. Several stores and restaurants have opened in recent seasons, moving in where others have left. And some retailers have been updated with expansions and more efficient shopping layouts. In August, Related Cos. and Oxford Properties, which own the $25 billion Hudson Yards mixed-use complex, hired Odyssey Retail Advisors to bring in better, more relevant tenants, and step up leasing efforts. It’s been seven years since the launch of The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards, situated in 20 Hudson Yards, and leases are beginning to turn.

Among the openings seen on the main floor are Moschino, Preston Lane, Marc Jacobs, Laduree Café, La Maison Du Chocolat and Roberto Coin. You May Also Like On level two, Meulien, Aesop and Baked by Melissa opened and Miznon reopened after closing during COVID-19. Rhone expanded to 2,395 square feet, from 900; Studs expanded to 1,059 square feet from 400 square feet. PIQ, the gift and novelty store, and Van Leeuwen ice cream relocated after being situated on other floors. On level three, Aroma 360 and Mango opened; Zara expanded with a new concept and better configuration after being split on levels three and four, and H&M moved to a new space after also being on levels three and four. On level four, Eataly, Naya, Viva La Crepe, Joe & the Juice and the L’Oréal Academy of Beauty all opened, and additional fast-casual culinary options are expected to debut soon. Beyond The Shops & Restaurants, in and around Hudson Yards, Oyamel and Warby Parker opened at 50 Hudson Yards, Plaza M Spa opened at 531 West 30th Street, Locanda Verde and Los Tacos No. 1 opened at 50 Hudson Yards, and Txula opened within Mercado Little Spain at 10 Hudson Yards. In addition, SLT, a format for high-intensity workouts, is opening next month at 525 West 30th Street. The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards had a grand slam opening in March 2019 with crowds pouring in out of a sense of awe and curiosity, and actress and singer Liza Minnelli performing at the party. The site includes over 400,000 square feet of office space and approximately 400,000 square feet of retail. Initially, there was a total of 750,000 square feet of leasable but the office space increased somewhat by recouping some common space and an atrium. There was initial skepticism over the retail center’s viability and from how far away it could draw shoppers, though that seems to have waned with all the changes. Whether Manhattan really needed a mall on the far west side of Manhattan was also been debated, given the city’s already saturated retail landscape. Initial reviews about the Hudson Yards architecture were mixed, with some calling it modern and luxurious, others considering it sterile and isolated. However, the extension of the 7 subway line in September 2015 made the destination more accessible for many, and there have been additional projects completed in Midtown on the West Side, creating a continuum from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station to Hudson Yards. A year after The Shops & Restaurants debuted, COVID-19 hit. Office workers, tourists and shoppers faded from the scene, and over time, a string of retail and restaurant departures occurred, notably the then-bankrupt Neiman Marcus, as well as the Dallas-based Forty Five Ten, which had a spread of four boutiques. Citarella, the gourmet market; the 3Den lounge with its co-working space and café; Beta, an electronics and technology store, and Micro Kickboard, a Scooter company that failed, also left. Compounding the situation, the Vessel, the 15-story honeycomb-shaped sculpture that visitors could climb and is situated directly in front of the mall, closed temporarily after being the scene of four suicides. It reopened in October 2024 with added safety features. Wells Fargo is expanding by 400,000 square feet at Hudson Yards, joining other major office tenants KKR, BlackRock, Meta, SAP, Boston Consulting Group and Tapestry Inc. Real estate sources said the ground floor retail has been performing well, as are the restaurants, while retailing gets more challenging on the upper floors, with some exceptions. Much of the retail turnover involved changing out more moderate retail concepts. “The center is finding its footing, but there was an anticipation of far greater sales,” said one industry source. “Traffic is growing but there is a sense that they need to further improve the merchandising. Initial lease deals were percentage sale rents and the landlord paying for build-outs. A lot of leases are up this year.” Related’s other major development, the Shops at Columbus Circle, is situated in an area with a greater residential population, and is more productive. It opened in February 2004. “Since coming out of COVID, then introducing Wells Fargo into the building and right-sizing the retail, there’s been a repositioning happening at Hudson Yards for the last 18 to 24 months,” said Esty Ottensoser, vice president of retail at Related, in an interview. “The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards is 93 percent occupied and our office space is 100 percent leased at the moment,” Ottensoser said. “Monday through Thursday we see between 18,000 and 22,000 office workers here.” Between the office workers, residents in the area, and visitors from outside, “there’s a lot of density here, and we’re seeing it in our conversions,” Ottensoser said, referring to store visitors who actually make a purchase. The center’s sales productivity currently stands at $1,700 a square foot across the four retail floors, and is up double digits year-to-date, she said. The luxury component generates double the overall productivity, according to Hudson Yards. “A lot of new retailers and a lot of new food and beverage have been added over the past two years. It’s had a great impact on the project’s sales productivity,” said Rick Strauss, partner at Odyssey, who participated in the interview. “Utilizing the square footage that was Neiman Marcus for Wells Fargo, and then right-sizing the retail space for stores down to 261,000 square feet was very smart.” Retail is now confined to levels one, two, three and four though food and beverage takes up most of level four. “The skepticism is beginning to dissipate,” said Ottensoser. Some “very positive” stories on retail performance have emerged, she said. “This really is the place to be. You see it in the office occupancy. It’s ‘class A’ caliber office space, and we see ourselves as a ‘class A’ shopping center. There’s a lot of density here and it’s not just because of our project. It’s also what Brookfield has been doing and what Tishman has been doing,” in further developing the area. “There’s a lot happening here. There are definitely always underperforming retailers. But most of our retailers have stayed with us.” “Opening a year before COVID hit was unlucky, and obviously bad timing,” said Strauss. “Related, to some degree, was a pioneer on the West Side when they opened this project,” introducing office, residential and retail to what was largely seen as an urban wasteland. “Related was the first. The Penn West corridor is very young, but it has filled in. Look what’s happened just to the east of Hudson Yards,” Strauss said. Since The Shops & Restaurants cut the ribbon, Brookfield’s Manhattan West mixed-use complex, which includes the Pendry Hotel, the Moynihan Train Hall, and Tishman Speyer’s Spiral office and retail skyscraper opened. The Javits Center and the High Line both expanded as well. “The corridor I would say has come of age, and it’s now being highly productive because of the density of office and residential and the drawing power of good retail and good food and beverage businesses,” said Strauss. “The West Side has become a much better catchment area.” There have been approximately 2,500 rentals added in and around Hudson Yards since 2019, and Related has proposed adding thousands of additional residences above the Western Rail Yards, seeing a demand to reside in the neighborhood. The Shops & Restaurants sits atop the Eastern Rail Yards servicing the Long Island Rail Road and other train lines. “We did a full analysis once we got involved of the project, to [examine] the strengths of the project, understand who’s performing, who’s not performing, what segments are performing, what segments are not performing, and where there’s opportunity to grow with retailers or replace those that are underperforming and with better, relevant tenants,” Strauss said. “What has become very apparent is the upscale retail is highly outperforming, which is why they saw fit to bring us in to help with expanding that upscale retail.” Dior, Fendi, Cartier and Watches of Switzerland are among the luxury firms reportedly doing well at Hudson Yards. In the moderate price segments, Alo, Uniqlo, Zara, and Aritzia are said to be performing well. Aesop skin care is also performing well. “We do see opportunity to continue to grow fashion for women’s ready-to-wear, men’s ready-to-wear and women’s shoes,” Strauss said. “Men’s shoes in the upscale segment we need to grow and continue to embrace, because that’s been strong so far. But more is needed. We’re going to raise the entire performance of the project by bringing in more relevant brands.” “The fact that we have a Russ & Daughters here that performs extremely well, a Locanda Verde which opened about a year ago which has been a local TriBeCa [hot] spot, and Los Tacos, says we’ve done a good job creating this very local neighborhood feel,” said Ottensoser. “Many didn’t think we could do it.” Russ & Daughters is a family-owned New York City institution, established in 1914, well known for its traditional Jewish cuisine. Locanda Verde is an often bustling Italian tavern. “There are some vacancies but we also have tenants with leases coming up,” said Strauss. “We can either choose to renew them or replace them. That’s giving us plenty of opportunity to bring in new tenants. Over the next two years you’re really going to see momentum with more significant changes.” He said lease terms anywhere from five to 10 years is typical these days. “So that gives you constant ability to turn and stay relevant.” Initially, Related extended generous incentives to encourage Neiman Marcus and other retailers to sign leases before The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards was launched. “We’re not really doing that anymore, because now it’s a second generation” of leases being signed or renewed. “Now you’re able to make deals that are much more just straight up, deals that are more traditional. But it’s not only that it’s second generation of leases, it’s also because 93 percent of the retail space has stores operating. “As we speak, there’s a handful of tenants that are under construction, so it’s actually higher percentage leased.” Discussing the goals and vision for the Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards, Ottensoser stressed the importance of increasing the center’s appeal to tourists, residents in the area and the office worker population. It’s possible, she said, to further grow the catchment area. “We can have people coming from further north and further south to shop and dine here. And if we can continue to improve the merchandising, you’re going to grow that catchment area. There’s still so much that we can do to get a larger slice of the pie. There’s are a lot of places for tourists to visit in Manhattan, and we’ve seen a lot of them already, but there are plenty of tourists that we haven’t captured. “Locanda Verde and Russ & Daughters, all these New York establishments, have opened with us,” Ottensoser said. Bond Street, another restaurant in the center, has been downtown on Bond Street for 22 years. “They never opened another location in New York City until they came to Hudson Yards, to the fifth floor,” said Ottensoser. “They knew they wanted to be here. They knew we had the density. “We host Frieze New York now at Hudson Yards,” she added. “And I’m sure you have seen the video with Tom Hanks. He’s out there singing about the Shed at Hudson Yards, and he’s performing there right now,” in the play “This World of Tomorrow.” “So you know, there’s a lot happening here.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: Trump to begin interviews with Fed chair finalists this week: FT
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-begin-interviews-fed-chair-finalists
Time Published: 2025-12-10T03:38:55Z
Full Content:
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has presented four names to the White House, with the list reportedly including former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and frontrunner Kevin Hassett. The race for the new US Federal Reserve chair is nearing the finish line, with US President Donald Trump reportedly set to begin interviewing finalists for the top job this week. According to a report from the Financial Times on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has presented a list of four names to the White House. One of these is former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, whom Bessent is scheduled to meet with on Wednesday. Another is National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, who is seen as the frontrunner for the role. Another two names would be picked from a list of other finalists, which includes Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and BlackRock chief investment officer Rick Rieder. Trump and Bessent are expected to hold at least one interview next week, as a decision looks likely to be announced in January. However, Trump has revealed he already has his eye on one particular candidate. “We’re going to be looking at a couple different people, but I have a pretty good idea of who I want,” Trump said to journalists on Air Force One on Tuesday. The upcoming round of interviews suggests that Hassett may not be the clear lock in for the role as previously thought, though he is seen as the favorite. Earlier this month, prediction market odds on Kalshi and Polymarket shot up for Hassett significantly following comments from Trump at the White House on Dec. 2. While welcoming guests, Trump labeled Hassett as “potential Fed chair” leading many to assume the president had let a major hint slip. Related: Trump’s national security strategy is silent on crypto, blockchain With Hassett’s odds spiking to 85% after Trump’s comments last week, they have since declined to around 73% for Hassett, while Warsh’s odds sit at 13% on Kalshi at the time of writing, which has floated around this range over December. Regardless of who ends up taking over as chair, the move is bound to impact crypto markets under the new leadership. If elected, Hassett has asserted that he will be apolitical in terms of running the Fed, despite his close ties to Trump. Speaking with The Wall Street Journal this week, Hassett said that “You just do the right thing” when asked if he would blindly follow orders from Trump. “Suppose that inflation has gotten from, say, 2.5% to 4%. You can’t cut,” Hassett said, adding that he would rely on his own “judgment, which I think the president trusts.” Magazine: The one thing these 6 global crypto hubs all have in common… Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: What BlackRock’s Latest Filing Means For The Ethereum Price

The latest S-1 registration submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission has placed Ethereum back at the center of market speculation. A recent SEC document shows that BlackRock’s iShares division has formally filed to launch a staked ETH exchange-traded fund, a move that would give traditional investors access not only to ETH price exposure but also to staking rewards through a regulated product. The proposed trust, which is called the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHB), differs from previous Ethereum filings because it incorporates staking into its core design. According to the S-1 filing, the ETF would hold ether directly while delegating most of its balance to external validators, allowing staking rewards to feed into the trust’s net asset value. This approach offers institutions a pathway to access ETH’s yield component without interacting with on-chain staking infrastructure themselves. Related Reading: Industry Leader Shares Why Ethereum Price Will Reach $12,000 The structure is bullish for Ethereum, as it shows that major asset managers like BlackRock are looking beyond basic price exposure and toward products that reflect how Ethereum now operates after its transition to proof-of-stake. The first indication of BlackRock’s interest in ETH staking was in July, when it filed an application to add ETH staking in its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). It seems the fund issuer is now taking proactive action on the staking trust with the recent standalone filing. Under SEC procedure, the new filing begins the review period, although a formal approval timeline does not start until the exchange responsible for listing the ETF submits a Form 19b-4. If approved, the ETF could influence Ethereum’s circulating supply over time. The plan is to stake between 70% and 90% of the trust’s ETH, and this means that large inflows would steadily route more ether into long-term staking, reducing the volume actively available on the open market. The potentially smaller liquid supply is going to contribute to a bullish ETH price, particularly during periods when demand for ETH rises. The filing itself does not change ETH’s price in the short term, nor does it signal any immediate regulatory approval. Related Reading: Ethereum Buyers Have Re-Entered The Arena Below $3,400, Here’s How Much They’ve Bought What the filing does provide is a clearer picture of how ETH might fit into the next generation of institutional investment products. A staked ETH ETF would formalize staking as an investable feature and increase the types of investors who consider the altcoin a viable long-term asset. Any eventual impact on Ethereum’s price will depend on how the approval process unfolds and how much capital flows into the product once it launches. BlackRock’s existing footprint in the Ethereum ETF niche shows how influential those inflows can be. Its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has consistently led other spot issuers, including over the past 24 hours, when ETHA recorded $23.66 million in inflows compared to Grayscale’s $11.83 million, while other issuers saw no inflows at all. Once approved, shares of the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust are expected to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker ETHB. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Intel Takes Major Step in Plan to Acquire Chip Startup SambaNova
URL: https://www.wired.com/story/intel-signs-term-sheet-sambanova-ai/
Time Published: 2025-12-09T23:08:59Z
Full Content:
Intel has signed a term sheet to acquire the AI chip startup SambaNova Systems, two sources with direct knowledge of the agreement tell WIRED. The details of the term sheet are unknown. The agreement is nonbinding, meaning the deal is not yet finalized and could be dissolved without penalty. It could take weeks or even months before regulatory approval, liability scrutiny, and financial due diligence are complete. Intel’s interest in acquiring the startup was first reported by Bloomberg in late October. At the time, the talks were in the early stages. The report noted that SambaNova could sell for less than the $5 billion valuation the company said it had reached in April 2021. Notably, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is currently the executive chairman of SambaNova Systems. Intel Capital, which Intel is in the process of spinning off into a stand-alone fund, has also invested in SambaNova Systems. Another investor in SambaNova, Japan’s SoftBank Group, made a major investment in Intel earlier this year. A spokesperson for SambaNova declined to comment. Intel had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication. SambaNova Systems was founded in 2017 in Palo Alto, California, by Kunle Olukotun, Rodrigo Liang, and Christopher Ré. Olukotun and Ré are Stanford professors; Liang previously worked as an executive at Oracle. SambaNova Systems makes an AI chip platform for inference computing, a process where large language models make predictions from vast amounts of data. As of early 2025, the startup had raised $1.14 billion in funding, according to PitchBook data. In 2020 it raised $250 million from asset manager BlackRock, Intel Capital, the venture firm GV, and other investors, bringing the startup’s valuation to $2.5 billion. The following year, SambaNova was valued at $5 billion after a massive funding round of $676 million, led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2. The startup’s implied valuation has dropped since then, with BlackRock reportedly cutting the value of its SambaNova shares by 17 percent over the past year, according to The Information. That likely made it a target for Intel, along with the fact that Intel has lagged the rest of the chip industry in making AI chips. After taking on the top job earlier this year, Intel CEO Tan said he intends to shore up Intel’s debt, spin off the company’s noncore assets, and shift to AI-first strategies. The troubled chipmaker also received an $8.9 billion infusion of capital from the US government in August, which it plans to use to expand domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

First announced in September, the Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible network has been built to this point with early design input from global firms like OpenAI, Shopify, and Visa. On Tuesday, the Tempo team announced additional early partners, including Mastercard, UBS, and buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna—which recently announced plans for a stablecoin on Tempo. “Tempo testnet is now open to anyone,” Tempo project lead and Paradigm founder Matt Huang posted on X. “It's been a pleasure working with great design partners to shape the chain: from teams moving billions across borders, to banks testing tokenized deposits, to AI companies exploring agentic flows. With its testnet live, several key payments-specific features are now available—like dedicated payment lanes that guarantee blockspace and keep fees low, and stablecoin-native gas, which allows transactions to be paid for with USD-denominated tokens instead of a volatile, native blockchain token. "Working with Tempo allows Coastal to test and co-create the next generation of financial infrastructure,” Brian Hamilton, president of Washington-based design partner Coastal Bank, said in a statement posted to X. “It’s not just about improving speed or efficiency—it’s about unlocking new capabilities for the broader ecosystem of fintech and embedded finance partners,” he added. “Together, we’re rethinking what modern banking can deliver.” The network boasts microtransactions, global payments and remittances, agentic commerce, and tokenized deposits as out-of-the-box use cases. Additional features, like creating your own stablecoin from the browser, are also available. Tempo lets you create a new stablecoin straight from your browser.

The network’s full rollout timeline has not yet been determined. In October, the network reportedly raised $500 million at a $5 billion valuation to propel its payments-focused blockchain. Around that time, it also added Dankrad Fiest, a top researcher from the Ethereum Foundation, to help build out the chain. Like Stripe with Tempo, USDC issuer Circle is working on its own stablecoin- and payments-focused blockchain, Arc.

Title: Alleged unauthorised modular homes near Brittas, Dublin, are ‘phase one’ of 71 units, court told
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/12/09/alleged-unauthorised-modular-homes-near-brittas-dublin-are-phase-one-of-71-units-court-told/
Time Published: 2025-12-09T20:11:09Z
Full Content:
An alleged unauthorised development of 28 modular homes near Brittas, Co Dublin, appeared to be “phase one” of an intended development of 71 residential units, a judge has been told. At Dublin Circuit Civil Court on Tuesday, Judge John O’Connor said he will rule in February whether the development at Chianti Park and an adjoining site is exempt from the need for planning permission, or whether it is unauthorised and must be removed. The judge was told the developer and site owners will “respect” the court in the interim. If works continued before his judgment, he would consider that “disrespect”, he said. In separate but similar applications South Dublin County Council and a local resident, John O’Neill, who lives 200m from the development, said it is unauthorised, the units should be removed and the site restored. The applications are opposed by Branach Developments Ltd, the developer, with a registered address at Thomastown, Carragh, Kildare; and the site owners, Mullnassa Limited and Threshford Limited, both with registered addresses at Rock Road, Blackrock, Dublin. Photographs before the court last week indicated about 28 homes have been constructed on the site, formerly used for mobile homes and chalets, with foundations laid for at least 12 more. In submissions on Tuesday Michael O’Donnell, for the respondents, said his core argument was this is exempt development under section 4.1.h of the Planning and Development Act. Works for maintenance, improvement or alternation of a structure that do not materially affect that structure are exempt, he said. Works are any act of construction and the disputed works involve construction, demolition, alteration, improvement, repair or maintenance. This development, he argued, falls within the exemption as it is consistent with the character and nature of the structures that were already on the site. The established use of the previous structures was residential use and the disputed works have not altered that use, he submitted. If the works are not consistent with the character of the existing development, that was “a genuine mistake”, and it would be disproportionate to order their removal, he said. There is a housing crisis, people are sleeping rough on streets, his clients were “doing nothing more than refurbishing existing units to provide a home” and “should not be pilloried”. Stephen Dodd, for the council, said this was “blatant unauthorised development”, which should be removed and the landscape restored. These “structures” are permanent modular style housing with permanent foundations, he said. It would make “a complete mockery of the planning system” if the argument that these new structures were exempt development was correct. The development has transformed the site, which was zoned to protect the outstanding natural character of the area, he said. There was “no genuine mistake”, the council had raised its concerns last August and the development was accelerated after it took proceedings, counsel said. The legal arguments by the respondents were “unstateable”. Any hardship to the respondents was “entirely of their own making”, and any “prudent” developer would have stopped once they started to get warning letters, counsel said. This was “completely uncontrolled and unregulated development in a completely inappropriate location” where the evidence was that one-off housing has been repeatedly refused by An Bord Pleanála for reasons including the location and substandard roads, he said. Barrister Conor Sheehan, instructed by Christine O’Connor, BKC Solicitors for Mr O’Neill, adopted Mr Dodd’s submissions, adding his client has raised issues about the impact of the works on drainage, sewage and roads locally. An affidavit for the respondents referred to the “first phase” of the development being repair and improvement of 29 residential dwellings to the standards necessary for rental in the private market, counsel said. This appeared to be “phase one” of an intended development of 71 units, he said.

Title: BlackRock expands Ethereum strategy with new staking ETF – Details

Time Published: 2025-12-09T19:00:34Z

BlackRock’s iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF signals institutional shift, balancing yield potential with regulatory uncertainty. The race for institutional crypto market dominance is heating up, shifting focus from mere price actions to yield generation. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has signaled this transition with the filing of its iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF. Expanding on its massive, over $11 billion existing Ethereum fund, this proposed product marks BlackRock’s first U.S. offering designed to provide institutional clients with direct exposure to Ether’s staking rewards. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared this news on X (formerly Twitter), stating, Source: Eric Balchunas/X The iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF represents more than just a new product. It signals a major shift in how institutions approach digital assets. Rather than framing crypto purely as speculation, BlackRock is guiding investors toward protocol‑level economics and blockchain‑driven yield. The filing describes a hybrid fund designed to capture both ETH’s price performance and the staking rewards generated from a portion of its holdings. These rewards would, in turn, increase the trust’s net asset value. However, the filing also highlights a key tension. BlackRock aims to offer staking yield, but regulatory and operational uncertainties could still influence how those rewards are ultimately distributed. This move forces the SEC to finally clarify how staking rewards should be classified, an issue that has remained unclear for years. Remarking on the same, an X user commented, “This tells you everything about where demand is heading. They don’t file for products like this unless they’re confident massive capital is waiting to flow in.” BlackRock’s latest filing marks a major shift in Ethereum [ETH] ETF policy, one that seemed impossible under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. When BlackRock first launched the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) in July 2024, the SEC forced issuers to remove staking from their products, arguing that services offered by platforms like Kraken and Coinbase resembled unregistered securities offerings. Under the new Chair, Paul Atkins, however, the agency’s stance appears to be softening. BlackRock and VanEck have now resubmitted or amended ETF filings to add staking, with BlackRock choosing to create an entirely new fund rather than modify ETHA. The original trust, which holds about $11 billion in ETH, will remain separate from the staking‑enabled version. This structure allows investors to gain regulated exposure to Ethereum’s yield‑generating mechanism without directly staking their assets. This policy shift builds on October’s milestone approval for Grayscale, which became the first issuer to offer staking rewards through U.S.‑listed spot‑market ETFs (ETHE and ETH Mini). It also aligns with broader industry momentum, as seen in REX‑Osprey’s staking‑enabled Solana [SOL] and ETH funds, signaling a growing institutional embrace of blockchain‑driven yield strategies. At the same time, on-chain activity suggests large institutions are rapidly accumulating Ethereum. Lookonchain reported substantial withdrawals from Binance involving 6,000 ETH by Amber Group and 3,000 ETH by Metalpha within hours of each other. Meanwhile, Bitmine made an even more aggressive move, adding 138,452 ETH to its holdings, bringing its total to 3.86 million ETH worth $12.4 billion. This surge in institutional buying coincides with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin signaling that an ETH rally may be approaching, even as ETH traded at $3,114 at press time, after a 1.67% daily drop. Source: X Together, rising institutional accumulation and the SEC’s warming stance on staking ETFs suggest that Ethereum’s market structure could accelerate the next phase of ETH adoption.

Title: Ether Surges 8%, Outpacing Bitcoin Gains Amid Staking ETF, Tokenization Optimism

Ethereum's ether ETH$3,197.57 surged on Tuesday to its strongest price since mid-November, leading crypto markets higher as bitcoin BTC$90,346.16 climbed above $94,000. The second-largest cryptocurrency climbed to just shy of $3,400, rallying 8.4% over the past 24 hours. Those gains significantly outpaced bitcoin’s 4.5% advance and the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index’s 6% climb. The rally also drove the ETH/BTC ratio — a closely-watched gauge of ether’s relative performance to bitcoin — to its strongest level since late October, signaling rotation into ETH from the leading crypto. Ether's rally and relative strengths against BTC is being driven by "improving regulatory expectations and renewed optimism around ETF-related inflows" with staking being added to funds on the horizon, Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX, said in a Tuesday note. Asset management giant BlackRock, issuer of the most popular spot ETH ETF, filed Monday to introduce the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust, which would provide yield from staking to investors. "The development revives optimism around ETH-focused inflows and the prospect of yield-bearing crypto products reaching a broader investor base," Kruger wrote. "While regulatory timelines remain uncertain, the headline has added more support to ETH’s relative stability versus bitcoin." ETH could also benefit from regulatory efforts to pave way for real-world asset tokenization, a fast-growing sector focusing on bringing financial instruments like bonds, funds and real estate onto smart contract platforms like Ethereum. Paul Atkins, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has touted tokenization a key innovation for capital markets, saying in an interview with Fox Business last week that it has the potential to change the financial system, reducing settlement risks and trade gaps.

More Info New York-based investment bank Xtellus Partners has proposed that proceeds from the sale of Lukoil's foreign assets be used to compensate American investors who lost money after their Lukoil stock holdings were frozen following Russia’s war in Ukraine. Leading U.S. asset managers such as Goldman Sachs, Blackrock and JP Morgan lost billions of dollars through writing off their Lukoil stocks holdings following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Xtellus has proposed a cashless sale back to Lukoil securities held by U.S. investors in exchange for the company's global assets. Lukoil's international assets are estimated at $22 billion, including upstream oil and gas projects, refining facilities and more than 2,000 filling stations ?across the globe. Buyers of the assets would have to come to an agreement with Lukoil before the U.S. Treasury can clear the transaction. Last month, U.S. Treasury issued the greenlight for companies to begin talks with Lukoil for its foreign assets, with U.S. oil and gas giants Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have already expressed interest. Exxon is in talks with Iraq’s Oil Ministry to buy Lukoil’s 75% stake in the West Qurna 2 oilfield, one of the country’s largest. Iraq's oil ministry has invited several U.S. oil companies to enter negotiations over the West Qurna 2 takeover through a competitive bidding process. West Qurna-2 oilfield produces more than 400,000 bpd of crude. The Iraqi government has taken over operations at West Qurna 2, including paying staff salaries directly. Meanwhile, the Serbian government is preparing an amendment to the country’s budget law that will allow it to nationalize the Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS) refinery, majority owned by Russia's Gazprom Neft and Gazprom, if no third party offers quickly emerge. NIS has submitted a request to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to continue operations until negotiations for an ownership change conclude. Located in the city of Pancevo, near Belgrade, NIS is the only oil refinery in Serbia. The refinery has the capacity to process 4.8 million tons of crude per year. In the first half of 2025, the refinery processed approximately 1.677 million tons, a 20% increase compared to the same period in 2024, when a major maintenance turnaround was carried out.

Title: PNC Bank launches Bitcoin trading for eligible clients via Coinbase integration

The move makes PNC the first major US bank to offer spot Bitcoin trading within its own digital platform, starting with private bank clients. PNC Bank has begun offering direct spot Bitcoin trading to eligible private bank clients, becoming the first major US bank to enable buy, hold and sell functions inside its own digital platform. According to a Tuesday release, the launch marks the first phase of PNC’s partnership with Coinbase. Announced in July, the collaboration is supported by Coinbase’s Crypto-as-a-Service trading and custody stack. PNC Private Bank serves high- and ultra-high-net-worth individuals, families, family offices and business owners. The bank plans to expand access to additional client groups and add more capabilities over time. According to Federal Reserve data, PNC ranks as the eighth-largest commercial bank in the US, with about $564 billion in assets and more than 2,300 branches across the country. While several major US banks have expanded their crypto offerings this year, most are targeting custody services or investment products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Dec. 2, Bank of America said that beginning next year, it will allow its wealth management clients to access four Bitcoin ETFs issued by Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale and BlackRock. The ETFs provide investors with exposure to the Bitcoin (BTC) price through a regulated fund that trades on stock exchanges, without the need to buy and hold the digital asset directly. Related: 21Shares taps Standard Chartered for custody as TradFi tightens grip on crypto As crypto adoption becomes more mainstream, asset managers and crypto exchanges are expanding services to wealthy clients. In June, JPMorgan announced that it would allow its trading and wealth-management clients to use crypto ETFs as collateral for loans. The bank also said it would begin factoring clients’ crypto holdings into assessments of their overall net worth. Binance recently introduced a concierge-style service for family offices, asset managers and private funds entering the crypto market. Crypto allocations are also rising in Hong Kong, mainland China and Singapore, with some planning to put about 5% of their portfolios into digital assets. Wealth managers in the region reported that client inquiries are increasing and new cryptocurrency funds are generating strong interest. The growing demand for cryptocurrency among wealthy investors is reshaping the financial-adviser market. A Zerohash survey of 500 US investors aged 18 to 40 conducted in November found that 35% moved money away from advisers who didn’t offer crypto access.

Time Published: 2025-12-09T18:07:49Z

Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), part of the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, will be investing up to ₹3,000 crore in Aditya Birla Renewables Ltd (ABR), a subsidiary of Grasim Industries Ltd, for a minority stake, the company said Tuesday evening. The GIP investment translates into an enterprise value of about ₹14,600 crore for ABR, as per a press statement issued late on Tuesday. The deal outlines a firm commitment of ₹2,000 crore by GIP in multiple tranches through the issue of compulsory convertible preference shares and equity shares. Further, it will have a greenshoe option to invest an additional ₹1,000 crore in the form of equity shares. Separately, Essel Mining & Industries Ltd, another Aditya Birla Group company, will invest ₹500 crore in the current financial year to fund its urgent capital requirements, as per a separate intimation to the bourses. ABR is the captive renewable energy platform of the Aditya Birla Group with a portfolio of about 4.3 GW spread across 10 states. It includes solar, hybrid, and floating solar, round-the-clock renewable power. It has signed captive power purchase agreements with fellow group companies like Grasim, Hindalco, UltraTech, and Century Enka. The company aims to scale its capacity upwards of 10 GW in the coming years. GIP is a leading infrastructure investor specializing in owning and operating large assets across energy, transport, digital infrastructure, water, and waste management sectors. It was acquired by BlackRock in 2024. “GIP’s experience in infrastructure across the globe, combined with Aditya Birla’s technical, operational and industrial capabilities, aims to develop Aditya Birla Renewables into a leading renewable platform that can contribute to the Indian industry’s decarbonization objective,” said Raj Rao, GIP president and chief operating officer. “Our investment reflects GIP’s confidence in India’s renewables sector and our commitment to advancing the energy transition in India." Grasim is a flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group engaged in the business of manmade fibres. It also holds several of the group’s businesses, including India’s largest cement company, UltraTech and the group’s new decorative paints venture, Opus. Shares of Grasim ended 0.12% higher at ₹2,745.70 on BSE on Tuesday compared to a 0.51% fall in the benchmark Sensex. The scrip has gained over 12% this year.

Title: CZ shuts down fake ASTER ETF rumor – But does his support boost the real rally?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=552475
Time Published: 2025-12-09T18:00:14Z
Full Content:
The fake filing dominated feeds, but ASTER’s fundamentals kept shaping its short-term structure. Fake news moved quickly across the crypto market, and this round spread with force. Multiple creators shared the forged ETF form before Binance’s Changpeng Zhao (CZ) stepped in, calling it photoshopped and reminding the market how easily misinformation travels. His response pulled even more attention toward ASTER just as its activity and volume surged behind the scenes. The image claimed BlackRock had filed for a new “Staked ASTER Trust ETF.” That never happened. CZ corrected it publicly, adding that ASTER didn’t need fabricated hype to grow. Source: X CZ previously stated he bought and held ASTER personally, which added support during the spike in noise. By contrast, the rumor cycle caused confusion while the token’s actual fundamentals continued to build. Behind the headlines, ASTER posted numbers that didn’t require any exaggeration. Daily Volume touched $6 billion, holders climbed past 200k, and last week’s burn removed 77.86M tokens permanently. Stage 4 buybacks accelerated to ~$4 million per day, compressing the time it takes for accumulated fees to hit the chain. Once the system reaches steady state, within 8–10 days, buybacks continue at 60–90% of the previous day’s revenue. The executing wallet remains fully transparent on-chain. Can ASTER’s aggressive buyback model, similar to BNB’s early playbook, drive a larger rally once key resistance breaks? The lower timeframes reacted quickly. ASTER broke above its descending trendline and briefly pushed RSI above 50 before sellers forced it lower again. Source: TradingView On the 4-hour chart, the token continued to consolidate between $0.821 and $1.29, with one fakeout on each side of the range. Source: TradingView Losing $0.821 may open a deeper slide. Clearing $0.96 and breaking through the $1.269 resistance zone could set up a stronger move. RSI stayed oversold without severe extension, and MACD continued to fight for a shift. The day highlighted a clear divide: fake hype created noise, but real metrics carried the narrative. With buybacks increasing, volume rising, and structural resistance tightening, the market now watches whether ASTER builds enough strength to flip the trend decisively. Now, can ASTER’s real fundamentals overpower the rumor cycle? With burns, revenue, and buybacks rising, the market now asks whether this ecosystem push is strong enough to shift its multi-week structure.

Title: ‘Extraordinary talent’: Fashion designer Paul Costelloe mourned at funeral
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fashion/2025/12/09/extraordinary-talent-fashion-designer-paul-costelloe-mourned-at-funeral/
Time Published: 2025-12-09T17:57:13Z
Full Content:
Fashion designer Paul Costelloe’s funeral Mass in Monkstown’s St Patrick’s Church was marked with the understated elegance he brought to his craft over the course of his long career. The only flowers were an abundance of white roses among greenery that covered his coffin like a bower: family flowers in a ceremony that focused almost entirely upon his family life. There were none of the now-customary gifts symbolising a life brought to the altar. The whole ceremony was simple and elemental: the sound of the wind from Storm Bram heard in between the robust singing from the Blackrock College Choir; the school Costelloe attended as a boy. His six sons, William, Robert, Gavin, Justin, Paul-Emmet and Nicholas, carried his coffin into the church. His wife Anne, and daughter Jessica were the other chief mourners. The main celebrant was Canon Michael O’Dea, parish priest of St Simon’s Church in Putney, London, where the family have a home. Costelloe, one of the highest profile names in Irish and UK fashion, died at the age of 80 in London in November after a short illness. In his homily, Canon O’Dea spoke of how, despite the glamorous world Costelloe worked in, designing for famous people and travelling the globe, it was his family who anchored him all his life. “Paul was very much the reference point of the family,” he said. “Home was a very important place for him to relax and enjoy one another’s company, whether it was in Putney, or in Monkstown, or wherever it was. “Paul was always proud of his children and grandchildren. They were the anchor of his life. He told me that ‘my family keep me grounded, especially Anne’.” [ Paul Costelloe obituary: Internationally respected fashion designer who dressed Princess DianaOpens in new window ] Canon O’Dea spoke of a man who enjoyed cycling around southwest London, and the simple things in life. He also recalled the annual Christmas card he was personally given by Costelloe. “I’d wait for Christmas each year, because Paul would give me one of his hand-painted cards. It was something I treasured. There was another card at Easter. This was his own way of expressing his faith, through art.” The front of the memorial card carried a watercolour drawing, by Costelloe, of a small boat close to a rocky shore. It was accompanied by his distinctive coiling signature, recognisable by anyone who has ever bought one of his homeware items in Dunnes Stores; the company with which he had a long and high-profile collaboration. Costelloe’s son Justin, in his eulogy, said his father always made everyone feel welcome, and spoke of “his extraordinary talent that we were all extremely proud of”. He recalled an engaged father, who took his sons to rugby matches, and his daughter to ballet classes. As for who was the boss of the household: “Anne was the only one who could put him back in his box. They loved each other deeply.” After the Communion service, Jessica Costelloe made her way up the choir, high above the congregation. From there she sang a compelling version of Down By The Salley Gardens, lamentation style, in a voice that slowly swelled to fill the cavernous church, while the congregation below listened in astonished silence. The President of Ireland, Catherine Connolly and Taoiseach Micheál Martin, were represented by their aides-de-camp. Burial took place privately afterwards.

Title: Tether makes its boldest expansion yet – AI, robots, and a Billion-dollar mint
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=552354
Time Published: 2025-12-09T17:00:30Z
Full Content:
The company’s expansion machine is in overdrive, and billions are backing it. Tether is making moves on multiple fronts. From backing a major investment round in an Italian AI robotics startup to securing recognition in Abu Dhabi, the company is going well beyond its stablecoin roots. This isn’t a new move. AMBCrypto previously reported that in November, Tether negotiated a €1 billion investment in Germany’s Neura Robotics while deploying $1.5 billion in commodity-backed lending. The company has taken a step into the AI sector, joining an €70 million ($81 million) funding round for Generative Bionics. They’re an Italian startup building next-generation humanoid robots for industrial environments. Source: Tether The round was led by CDP Venture Capital’s AI fund. Tether, as one of its key private backers, supports the development of robots built for heavy-duty performance and natural human interaction. The company says its investment will help the startup scale production, validate its humanoid platform, and integrate into Europe’s fast-growing robotics ecosystem. It fits neatly into Tether’s broader strategy. Their announcement elaborated on the investment, noting, “This includes investments in brain-computer interfaces via Blackrock Neurotech and recent AI initiatives such as Tether’s collaboration with Northern Data and Rumble to deploy a 20,000-GPU global compute network for open, privacy-preserving AI development.” Tether also saw a major win in Abu Dhabi’s ADGM, where USDT is now formally recognized as an Accepted Fiat-Referenced Token across several additional blockchains, including Aptos, Cosmos, Near, Polkadot, and TON. Source: X The decision gives licensed firms in the free zone broader flexibility to use USDT within regulated activities. This expands on earlier approvals limited to Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. In the official statement, CEO Paolo Ardoino said, “The UAE continues to set the global standard for digital asset regulation, and Tether is proud to contribute to this leadership.” Tether also carried out a major mint on the TRON network — a fresh $1 billion USDT. Arkham Intelligence reported the tokens moving from the protocol’s “black hole” address to Tether’s multisig wallet, a standard process the company uses to replenish liquidity for exchanges and institutional customers. Source: Arkham Intelligence Tether has not tied this issuance to any specific deployment. But, large mints typically mean preparations for market demand, new integrations, or upcoming distribution. With billion dollar bets and a foot in multiple grounds, Tether’s influence now far exceeds stablecoins and crypto. It’s not too left field to assume that bigger and better things are yet to come.

Under the deal, there is a commitment of ₹2,000 crore (around $$225 million) and a greenshoe option to invest another ₹1,000 crore (around $110 million). This deal marks one of the largest primary commitments for a minority stake in a renewables platform in India, said ABREN, a Grasim subsidiary. The GIP investment translates into an enterprise value of around ₹14,600 crore for ABREN, it added. ABREN has achieved robust organic growth, building a diversified pan-India renewable energy portfolio of around 4.3 gogawatt (GW) across 10 states. This portfolio delivers solar, hybrid, floating solar, round-the-clock renewable power, reinforcing ABREN’s formidable position in sustainable energy. Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman of Aditya Birla Group, said, “India stands at the cusp of an energy transformation, arguably one of the largest anywhere in the world. The scale of the renewables opportunity in India is extraordinary, driven both by the urgent imperative of decarbonisation, and the sheer arithmetic of demand. This business sits squarely at the intersection of national energy security and climate leadership, two defining priorities for the coming decades. GIP’s investment marks a pivotal moment in our growth journey, laying a strong foundation for an accelerated buildout of our renewables platform, as we target a capacity of 10 GW+ in the coming years. Their global leadership in owning and operating some of the most sophisticated energy assets worldwide brings both rigour and reach to our ambition.” The transaction is subject to receipt of necessary statutory and regulatory approvals and completion of other conditions precedent. Standard Chartered Bank acted as the sole financial advisor to ABREN on this transaction. Raj Rao, GIP President and Chief Operating Officer, said, “We are excited to partner with Aditya Birla Group, one of India’s leading conglomerates, as today’s announcement will allow us to continue to support innovation at scale. GIP’s experience in infrastructure across the globe, combined with Aditya Birla’s technical, operational and industrial capabilities, aims to develop Aditya Birla Renewables into a leading renewable platform that can contribute to the Indian industry’s decarbonization objective. Our investment reflects GIP’s confidence in India’s renewables sector and our commitment to advancing the energy transition in India.” Published on December 9, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Aviva Seeks Partner for New City of London Skyscraper Project
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/12/09/850376.htm
Time Published: 2025-12-09T15:20:28Z

Aviva Plc has kicked off the search for a partner to help fund a planned new skyscraper in the heart of the City of London’s insurance district, as it aims to tempt investors willing to make a bold bet that office rents are set to soar. The insurer’s investment management arm has appointed broker Knight Frank to sell a stake in the 130 Fenchurch Street project, people with knowledge of the process said. A deal could pave the way for a start on the development, which secured planning planning approval in September, or a new partner could wait to secure a tenant for some or all of the 31 story building before commencing construction, the people said, asking not to be identified as the process is private. A representative for Aviva Investors did not respond to requests for comment. The chance to buy a stake in one of the largest planned office developments in central London comes as the city’s biggest tenants, developers and investors face a high stakes stand off. Higher construction costs threaten to make many projects unprofitable unless they achieve much higher rents than are currently being paid, prompting developers to hold off on new starts. The combination of higher asking rents and far higher costs for fitting out new offices are in turn giving large companies pause before committing to long term deals. While higher costs can be spread over time by signing longer term leases, companies are also grappling with significant uncertainties about how much space they need. That’s because some staff are still working flexibly while the rise of artificial intelligence has further complicated the process of forecasting future headcount. The upshot is a severe shortage of new office development, a factor Aviva is counting on to lure investors willing to make a bold bet on higher rents, the people added. There are already signs that rental inflation is starting to accelerate. Law firm Proskauer Rose LLP set a record rent for City of London office space at 8 Bishopsgate in the third quarter, agreeing to pay £140 ($186.82) a square foot for additional space on th 46th floor, according to a report published by broker Savills Plc. BlackRock Inc. has already begun scouting options for a new London headquarters despite having about 10-years left on its lease because of the dearth of available options, two other people said. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink complained in an interview with the Times newspaper in London earlier this year that he was unable to find space to accommodate recent acquisitions. A spokesperson for BlackRock declined to comment. Aviva’s planned 130 Fenchurch Street development, a block south of the key Lloyd’s of London insurance market, will include over 600,000 square feet (57,500 square meters) of office space, a public garden terrace on floor 20. The project, which is set to be overseen by developer Co-re, will also include ground floor stores, bars and restaurants. Demolition of the existing building, known as Fountain House, is set to complete next year and work on the new tower could be concluded as early as 2030, according to a City of London press release.

Title: Former Vue & Disney Exec Alison Cornwell Joins BlackRock-Backed Film & TV Income Rights Platform Easttree

By Andreas Wiseman Executive Editor, International & Strategy EXCLUSIVE: Industry vet Alison Cornwell, who most recently served a decade as CFO of leading international cinema chain Vue, has joined emerging UK media company Easttree Media in the same role. Launched last month, Easttree is an investment platform acquiring income rights in films and TV shows. The company uses a proprietary data-driven model to assess passive profit participations, “enabling actors, writers, directors, producers, financiers and studios to monetise all or part of their income rights”. Easttree says it has closed “multiple transactions involving some of the world’s most prolific shows and artists”, but further details weren’t shared when Deadline asked.

Discovery Retaining Ownership Of CNN In Any Merger Transaction News Read The Screenplay: 'Jay Kelly' From Noah Baumbach And Emily Mortimer Kicks Off Deadline's Annual Script Spotlight Series The company, which is underwritten by funds and accounts backed by U.S. investment giant BlackRock, was launched by former 42 COO Marc Allen, and former Hipgnosis execs Chris Helm and Markku Lonnqvist. Watch on Deadline Management firm Hipgnosis is known for buying the rights to song catalogs of well known musicians, including Neil Young, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Justin Bieber, Shakira and more. The company was sold to Blackstone in 2024 for $1.6BN. Cornwell joins Easttree from Vue International where she served as the company’s Chief Financial Officer for more than 10 years. Prior to Vue, roles included CFO/SVP of Disney’s international TV business, Group CFO of the Sparrowhawk Media Group, which became part of NBC Universal, and Canadian-UK outfit Alliance Films. The trained accountant has also served as a BFI Governor. Chris Helm sayid: “Alison is a fantastic addition to the Easttree team, and we feel privileged to welcome her. Her breadth of industry knowledge and exemplary finance experience strengthen both our capabilities and our ambition for 2026 and the years ahead. Alison brings financial acumen, discipline and a strategic lens that will support Easttree as we scale our participation portfolio and deepen our partnerships with talent and rights-holders.” “I’m honoured to join Easttree Media at such a pivotal moment for the company,” added Alison Cornwell, Chief Financial Officer of Easttree Media. “The opportunity to help build an investment platform that blends institutional rigour with the agility of a founder-led business is rare. This segment of the industry remains under-served, and Easttree’s rapid progress, with multiple deals already completed alongside leading creatives across film and television, speaks for itself. It shows the strength of the model and what this team is capable of as we scale rapidly.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Today’s top news: Two of the biggest names in crypto investing bought big last week. And proved that they still have the ability to raise capital during market downturns. Both Michael Saylor and Tom Lee quietly loaded up last week. First, Saylor’s Strategy added $963M in BTC (10,624 BTC to be exact) to its balance sheet, marking one of its largest buys since the summer. That total is more than the entire amount of BTC bought by Saylor over the past 3 months. Then came Tom Lee, whose firm BitMine boosted its Ethereum holdings to $12B by acquiring another $429M in ETH (138,452 ETH to be exact). Perhaps most notable, BitMine added to its cash position during the week as well, now holding $1B in cash (up from $800M). "BitMine provided its latest holdings update for Dec 8th, 2025: $13.2 billion in total crypto + "moonshots": -3,864,951 ETH at $3,139 per ETH - 192 Bitcoin (BTC) - $36 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) (“moonshots”) and - total cash of $1.0 billion." - BitMNR on X “MSTR raised $1B in one week, the same amount it took them 4 months to raise in 2020. The exponential trend continues” - James Van Straten, Coindesk analyst, on X Strategy has acquired 10,624 BTC for ~$962.7 million at ~$90,615 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 24.7% YTD 2025. As of 12/7/2025, we hodl 660,624 $BTC acquired for ~$49.35 billion at ~$74,696 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD $STRE https://t.co/oyLwSuW7nW — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 8, 2025 There has been a lot of concern about the DAT trade unwinding, and neither Saylor nor Tom Lee have been spared from that conversation. The heat turned up even more recently when it was widely speculated that Strategy would start to sell BTC if and when its mNAV dipped below 1. Well, it got very close to 1 in this latest downturn - and he’s not selling. In fact, the opposite. He’s buying and in big size. It’s relieving for the MSTR bulls out there and confidence-building for those concerned about how Saylor would act in this downturn. But what’s more notable, especially from a near-term trading perspective, is Tom Lee’s ability to raise capital during this ETH downturn. BMNR stock dipped over 60% from local highs, and yet, the team has been able to keep slamming its ATM and raising cash. This has enabled Tom to buy a ton of ETH and grow his cash pile. And for perspective, his $429M buy is about 2x the size of Saylor’s $1B buy in market cap perspective (BTC is 5x ETH in market cap). The ETH / BTC ratio is up 4% on the month now and looking like it’s ready to break out of a 3-month downturn. That matters because ETH breaking out typically means some form of “alt season” rally against Bitcoin where multiple tokens see relatively large gains in a short period. The fact that Tom is still sitting on $1B in cash (and is motivated to lower his average purchase price from $4k/ETH on this dip) means that he is likely to remain a heavy buyer - which is good for ETH, and perhaps, for alts. Tom Lee and crew may just deliver the Santa Rally that crypto bulls are hoping for… A few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye: In Corporate Treasuries / ETFs In Memes / Onchain Movers Here’s a rundown of major token, protocol and airdrop news from the day: Here is the list of other notable headlines from the day in NFTs: Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Exclusive: Circle stablecoin for ‘banking-level privacy’ to launch on Aleo blockchain
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/09/circle-privacy-stablecoin-aleo-udsc-udscx/
Time Published: 2025-12-09T13:30:00Z

Blockchains are public databases. That’s an immediate roadblock for large institutions like banks, whose clients largely don’t want their balances and payments history open to prying eyes. Now, the crypto giant Circle has partnered with the blockchain Aleo to launch a “private” version of its stablecoin called USDCx, which will obscure transaction histories, Howard Wu, cofounder of Aleo, told Fortune. “People don’t want to reveal their business revenues. They don’t want to reveal business intelligence,” Wu said. “But the way that transparent blockchains work today unfortunately means that every time you transact, you are leaking that data.” The new Circle-backed token, which like other stablecoins is pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, won’t be truly private. Every transaction of the token will include what Wu called a “compliance record,” which Circle will be able to access in case law enforcement or other authorities reach out about specific transactions. Still, for public users looking at a blockchain log, the transactions will look unintelligible and like “blobs of data,” Wu said. “This is banking-level privacy, as opposed to ‘privacy privacy,’” he added. The launch of USDCx comes amid a broader push from the crypto industry to persuade big banks and institutions to use blockchain technology. That effort appears to be gaining traction, especially in the realm of tokenization, or the act of putting real-world assets like mortgages or even the U.S. dollar in blockchain wrappers. The asset management giant BlackRock has launched its own tokenized money market fund BUIDL, the online brokerage Robinhood has dabbled in blockchain-based stock trading, and fintech giants like Stripe have invested huge sums of capital into stablecoins. “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized,” Larry Fink, cofounder and CEO of BlackRock, said in his 2025 letter to investors. Wu, the cofounder of Aleo, has seen interest in privacy-enabled stablecoins from a swathe of potential customers, including the crypto payroll processors Request Finance and Toku. He also said that prediction markets, or locales where gamblers can bet on real-world events and sports, are also interested in experimenting with stablecoins like USDCx. Aleo, which specializes in private blockchain transactions, isn’t the only privacy-first technology of its kind in crypto. There are other cryptocurrencies—most famously Zcash—which also promise users encrypted transactions. However, these cryptocurrencies are much more volatile than stablecoins, which, as their name implies, are designed to stay stable relative to the U.S. dollar or other currencies.
