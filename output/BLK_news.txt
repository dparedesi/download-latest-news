Most in the cryptosphere are anxiously waiting to see the next crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) to be approved for listing by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For most Ripple fans, a spot XRP ETF is on the horizon as post-lawsuit momentum builds around the cross-border payments token. But for well-known ETF expert Nate Geraci, the SEC might approve staking in spot Ethereum ETFs before giving the nod to the much-awaited XRP products. On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged Nasdaq’s proposal to accommodate staking for BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA). If the proposal is greenlighted, the ETHA would be able to earn yield by locking up ether to help validate transactions on the Ethereum network, per the SEC’s filing. The ETF could stake a portion of its ETH holdings via one or more trusted providers to generate additional yield. U.S. regulators have yet to definitively determine whether staking services offered through an ETF should be classified as securities. But the inclusion of staking in the BlackRock filing reflects increasing confidence that staking could eventually be part of crypto ETFs. For NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci, who has been closely following ETF-related developments for months, staking is the final item left on his November checklist. His forecast? The SEC could approve ETHA staking “sooner rather than later,” potentially even before any new spot crypto ETFs, including ones based on XRP, get the regulatory blessing. Meanwhile, the SEC has recently approved in-kind creation and redemption for all spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds, a move hoped to boost efficiency for institutional investors. The action implies something bigger — a regulator that once kept crypto at arm’s length is now setting the stage to usher it deeper into Wall Street. That being said, it appears that the SEC is currently focused on streamlining how existing crypto ETFs trade rather than expanding the fund lineup. If Geraci’s prediction comes true and the agency greenlights yield-generating ETH exposure, XRP fans might have to wait a little longer before a spot ETF fund goes live in the US.

Title: What is tokenization?

Asset tokenization is unlocking trillions in finance. Learn how it turns bonds into tradable digital tokens. Finance is getting a digital makeover. A technology called tokenization is quietly re-engineering how we think about assets. By turning ownership of an asset into a digital coin on a blockchain, it’s making it possible to trade things that were once hard to sell, like a stake in a skyscraper or a piece of a government bond. This isn’t just theory anymore; it’s happening now, potentially prying open markets worth trillions and making them faster and more open. Some of the biggest names in finance, from BlackRock to JPMorgan, are already building the tools for this new world, proving that blockchain is moving from the fringes to the financial mainstream. The whole point is to cut through the red tape that makes finance slow and expensive. When an asset lives on a shared, unchangeable digital ledger, you can automate complex tasks, rely less on middlemen, and do new things like sell tiny fractions of a single asset or build compliance rules directly into the transaction. The bond market is an early testing ground, showing how much fat can be trimmed from the old way of doing things. When bonds are issued as digital tokens, things like interest payments can be handled automatically by a bit of code called a smart contract, slashing administrative work. The European Investment Bank (EIB) has already run successful tests, issuing a €100 million digital bond with help from Goldman Sachs on a private blockchain. This wasn’t a small experiment; it was a large-scale deal that proved the concept. More recently, Hong Kong issued a $100 million tokenized green bond, showing that this tech can also help direct money toward sustainable projects. It’s not just for governments. The German industrial powerhouse Siemens put its first digital bond on the Polygon blockchain, highlighting just how quick and clean a blockchain-based issuance can be. These examples point to a future where the entire life of a bond—from its creation to its final payment—is streamlined. Settling trades could take minutes, not days. Tokenizing stocks could finally let ordinary people invest like the big players. By turning shares into digital tokens, companies could sell them in tiny pieces. This fractional ownership would tear down the high-cost barrier that keeps many retail investors out of certain stocks. While turning public stocks into tokens is still a work in progress, the real action is in private markets. Some platforms, like Swarm Markets, are already offering tokenized versions of big names like Apple and Tesla on the Polygon blockchain, making them available to more people. The biggest shake-up, though, is happening in the exclusive world of private equity. Private equity has always been a members-only club with huge buy-ins and long lock-up periods. Tokenization is changing that by creating something that never existed before: a way out. By turning a stake in a private equity fund into a tradable token, fund managers can let their investors sell their positions on a secondary market. Firms are already jumping on this. The investment manager Hamilton Lane teamed up with Securitize to tokenize one of its funds on Polygon [MATIC], letting qualified investors buy into a portfolio of private companies for a much smaller check. In another example, the venture capital firm SPiCE VC turned its whole portfolio into a token, giving investors a tradable security that represents a basket of startups. It’s a win-win. Investors get a shot at cashing out early and spreading their money around, while fund managers can reach a bigger pool of investors and possibly see more stable fund values. For all the progress, tokenization isn’t a sure thing yet. Regulators are still figuring out the rules, which creates uncertainty. This makes the underlying technology bulletproof and building reliable exchanges for these new assets are also huge tasks. And the very transparency of a blockchain, which is often a selling point, can be a problem for private equity, where secrecy is key. Finding a way to get the benefits of the tech without giving up privacy will be essential. Still, the potential is too big to ignore. The ability to make illiquid assets tradable, cut costs, and open up exclusive markets is a fundamental change in how we create and trade value. As the tech gets better and the rules become clearer, tokenized assets will likely shift from a niche experiment to a basic building block of our financial system. It changes everything from how startups raise money to how we save for retirement. The projects happening today are just the first steps on a very long road. The real estate market, a multi-trillion-dollar giant famous for high costs and snail-paced deals, is about to get a serious jolt. A technology known as tokenization is breaking down the old walls of property investment. It’s bringing in an era of fractional ownership and creating lively secondary markets, letting people trade property shares like stocks. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a complete rewiring of how property is bought, sold, and managed. At its simplest, real estate tokenization turns ownership of a property into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token is a share of that asset. This allows a multi-million dollar building to be split into thousands of affordable pieces. Think of it like a company’s stock, but backed by a physical building and secured by the transparency of a blockchain. For a long time, only the wealthy or big institutions could afford to invest directly in prime real estate. Tokenization changes that. By allowing for fractional ownership, it opens the door for people with less capital to buy into properties they could never afford on their own. Instead of needing millions for an office tower, you could buy a few tokens that represent a small piece of it. This shift has clear benefits. Investors can now spread their money across different properties and locations to lower their risk. It also gives them a shot at the higher returns that usually come from institutional-quality buildings. For developers and property owners, tokenization means they can tap into a worldwide pool of investors, giving them a new way to raise money and make their properties easier to sell. Maybe the biggest change tokenization brings is a solution to real estate’s oldest problem: you can’t sell it quickly. Traditional property sales are a nightmare of paperwork, fees, and delays that can drag on for months. Tokenization turns these frozen assets into digital tokens that can be traded on secondary markets, 24/7, almost as easily as stocks. This gives investors a level of freedom and access to their money that was unheard of in real estate. The tech behind this is a mix of blockchain and smart contracts. The blockchain acts as a secure, public log of who owns what, cutting down on fraud. Smart contracts are bits of code that automatically handle parts of the deal, like distributing rental income or transferring ownership. This automation cuts out many of the middlemen, like brokers and lawyers, making deals faster and cheaper. Even with all this promise, the path to a fully tokenized real estate market has some bumps. The biggest is that the law hasn’t caught up. Many countries don’t have clear rules for these kinds of digital assets, creating confusion around things like property rights and taxes. There are also tech risks, like bugs in the smart contract code or the need for blockchains that can handle huge volumes of transactions. Getting the traditional real estate world to trust and understand this new technology is another challenge. The dream of instant trading depends on building active secondary markets, which are still in their early days. But the direction is clear. As governments create rules and the technology improves, tokenized real estate will become a standard part of property investing. By tearing down the barriers of high costs and slow sales, this innovation isn’t just changing the rules; it’s building a fairer, faster, and more open real estate market for everyone. A quiet shift in the financial world is starting to pry open the doors to investments that were once reserved for the very wealthy. This shift is driven by tokenization, a process that turns rights to real-world things into digital tokens on a blockchain. It’s creating a way for regular people to invest in previously off-limits markets like prime real estate, fine art, and private equity. For years, the price of admission to these worlds was simply too high for most. If you wanted to own a piece of a Manhattan skyscraper or a Picasso, you needed to be an institution or a billionaire. Tokenization breaks that mold by creating fractional ownership, letting people buy tiny digital slices of a bigger asset. This is more than just making things cheaper; it’s a fundamental change in how we own and trade things. The process involves creating a digital stand-in for an asset—whether it’s a physical building or a share of a private company—and issuing it as a token. These tokens live on a blockchain, a shared and unchangeable digital logbook that records every transaction transparently, creating a secure and verifiable ownership history. The biggest impact of tokenization is its ability to make hard-to-sell assets easy to trade. Real estate is a classic example of an illiquid market. By dividing a property into thousands of digital tokens, ownership can be traded quickly and easily on global markets that never close. This gives investors more freedom and helps sellers get a better price for their assets. This newfound flexibility comes from a few key features: Tokenization can be applied to almost any asset class, each with its own potential for change: Despite the potential, tokenization faces some real hurdles: Both financial giants and nimble startups are exploring what tokenization can do. As the technology gets better and the rules become clearer, it is set to become a major force in finance. For the average investor, this represents a huge opportunity to get into a world of investments that was once locked away. While it’s important to be cautious and understand the risks, the potential for tokenization to create a more open and efficient financial system is hard to deny. The digital key has been made, and the doors to exclusive markets are starting to open. The market for tokenized assets—real-world things turned into tradable digital tokens—is growing at a breakneck pace. Industry forecasts now predict it will be a multi-trillion dollar industry by the end of the decade. The boom is being driven by big financial institutions getting on board, a growing hunger for fractional ownership, and the promise of making slow, traditional markets faster and more liquid. Market reports paint a picture of rapid expansion. Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and ADDX believe asset tokenization could become a $16.1 trillion opportunity by 2030. Some analysts are even more optimistic, with one report suggesting the market for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could hit $30 trillion in the same timeframe. The value of RWAs already on the blockchain has blown past $50 billion and is projected to hit $500 billion by the end of 2025. This growth isn’t just in one area; real estate, bonds, private credit, and commodities are all seeing significant activity. Property is leading the charge. The market for tokenized real estate was valued at $2.7 billion in 2022 and, according to BCG, could explode to $16 trillion by 2030. For 2024, the market is expected to hit $3.5 billion and then grow to $19.4 billion by 2033, expanding at 21% per year. Another report sees the global market crossing $16.51 billion by 2033. This growth is all about fractional ownership, which lets more people invest in property. The tokenized bond market is also set for huge growth. Projections suggest this slice of the market could reach at least $300 billion by 2030, a 30-fold jump from where it is now. Some even think it could hit $1 trillion by 2028. The appeal is clear: near-instant trade settlements, lower costs, and the ability for small investors to buy a piece of a bond. Tokenized private credit has seen explosive growth, making up about 65% of the total tokenized RWA market in 2024. The market value for these assets now tops $12 billion as of March 2025, accounting for over half of the RWA market. Big money is moving in. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) quickly grew to over $1 billion in assets, showing that major institutions are hungry for on-chain treasury products. A BCG report estimates that tokenized fund assets under management could top $600 billion by 2030, which would be 1% of the total global mutual fund and ETF market. The main reasons for this explosive growth are the potential for more liquidity, greater transparency, and lower investment minimums. Tokenization lets you slice up expensive assets, making them affordable for a much wider group of people. At the same time, smart contracts can automate tasks, making the whole system efficient and cheaper to run. Looking forward, the future of asset tokenization looks very strong. As blockchain technology matures and governments provide clearer rules, adoption should speed up even more. As more financial players and investors see what tokenization can do, the market is on track to become a core part of the global financial system, blending the best of traditional finance with modern technology. Tokenization is creating a new world where you can own a piece of anything from an apartment building to a famous painting. Analysts predict this market will be worth trillions by 2030. But underneath all the hype lies a tricky problem: how do you figure out the true value of these digital slices of real-world things? Pricing a tokenized asset is a hybrid job, mixing old-school financial math with new ideas designed for the digital world. The starting point is always the value of the underlying asset, which is key for building investor trust. Several classic methods are being retooled for this new asset class: You value something by seeing what similar things have recently sold for. This works well for assets with active markets, like real estate or stocks. For a tokenized property, you might compare it to similar, non-tokenized buildings that just sold. This method looks at the future income an asset is likely to produce, like rent from a building or revenue from a business. You estimate those future cash flows and adjust them for risk to find their value today. This is a finance staple, but it’s tough to apply to tokens that don’t generate direct income. This approach calculates what it would cost to replace or rebuild an asset. It’s often used for things like factories or infrastructure that don’t have a clear income stream. Net asset value (NAV) Firms use NAV for funds or companies. You take all the assets, subtract all the liabilities, and what’s left is the value. It’s a good fit for asset-backed tokens. Beyond these traditional tools, the unique properties of tokens have led to new ways of thinking about value: Even with these methods, several challenges make it hard to put a reliable price on a tokenized asset. Figuring out how to value tokenized assets is a work in progress. As the market grows, the most likely outcome is a hybrid approach that combines solid financial analysis with new metrics designed for the digital world. The creation of busy, liquid secondary markets will be crucial for better price discovery. Clearer regulations will also help build investor confidence and provide a more stable foundation for pricing. In the end, specialists who understand both Wall Street and Web3 will be needed to navigate this new landscape. While the rulebook for valuing tokenized assets is still being written, the innovation is real. By tackling these challenges head-on, the market is building a future where the value of almost anything can be unlocked and traded more openly and efficiently. A future where most of the world’s assets are traded as digital tokens is quickly becoming a real possibility. This shift, powered by blockchain, promises to open up finance to everyone, make markets run better, and create new economic opportunities. But this bright vision comes with dark shadows. It could also deepen existing inequalities and create new kinds of financial risk. The social and ethical fallout of a fully tokenized world needs a close and careful look. Turning assets into digital tokens on a blockchain could fundamentally change our social and economic landscape. One of the biggest promises of tokenization is greater financial inclusion. By allowing for fractional ownership, it can break down expensive assets like real estate or private equity into small, affordable pieces. This could let people with less money, especially in developing countries, invest in things that were once only for the rich. Some argue this could be a powerful way to close the wealth gap by letting more people own assets. For example, a luxury resort in Colorado sold tokenized shares of its property for as little as $10,000, a tiny fraction of what a traditional investment would require. Tokenization could make trillions of dollars worth of hard-to-sell assets easy to trade. This increased liquidity could spur more economic activity. By cutting out many of the usual middlemen like brokers and banks, automated smart contracts can make transactions cheaper and faster for everyone. The impact of tokenization goes far beyond the stock market. It could change how industries like healthcare, supply chains, and intellectual property work. Artists could tokenize their work, selling fractional shares and collecting royalties directly. Communities could use it to crowdfund local projects or support non-profits. For all its potential, the widespread use of tokenization creates a messy web of ethical problems. There is no single set of rules for the tokenized economy. Different countries are at different stages of regulating digital assets, creating a confusing and patchwork legal system. This makes cross-border deals tricky and allows companies to shop for the jurisdiction with the weakest rules. A top concern for governments is the risk that tokens could be used for money laundering or other crimes. Strong identity checks are needed to manage these risks, but the anonymous nature of some blockchains makes this a huge challenge. The transparency of a blockchain is a double-edged sword. While it builds trust, it also creates major privacy issues. Once a transaction is on a public blockchain, it’s there forever. This clashes with privacy laws like GDPR, which give people the right to have their data erased. Finding a balance between transparency and privacy is a major ethical hurdle. While tokenization can make markets more liquid, it could also create new dangers for the financial system. The link between digital assets and traditional finance means that a crash in the volatile crypto markets could spread to conventional ones. The International Monetary Fund has warned that if a widely held tokenized asset were suddenly sold off, it could send shockwaves through the entire system. Big market players like Citadel Securities have also cautioned that a rush into unregulated tokenized securities could destabilize stock markets. The risk of new gatekeepers Ironically, a technology praised for being decentralized could end up concentrating power in the hands of a few big platforms or developers. The rules for these new markets are still being written, raising questions about who is in charge. The algorithms that run these systems could also be biased, reinforcing existing inequalities if the rule-writers don’t design and check them carefully. In real estate, tokenization could have unintended negative side effects. It becomes easier for global investors to buy into local property markets. There’s a risk of driving up prices in poorer neighborhoods. This flood of outside capital could lead to gentrification, pushing out long-time residents who can no longer afford to live in their own communities. The move toward a tokenized future seems unstoppable, but where we end up is not. The social and ethical consequences are huge, offering both a better world and a more dangerous one. To make sure we get the benefits, regulators need to work together to create clear rules that protect people without killing innovation. Developers have a duty to build secure, private, and fair systems. And we all need to have an honest conversation about the kind of financial world we want. Tokenization isn’t just a tech revolution; it’s a social one. Its true success will be judged not by the value of the tokens, but by whether it creates a fairer world for everyone.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on the operations on 'Special Report.' FIRST ON FOX: A group of Senate Democratic leaders are accusing President Donald Trump of making "steep concessions to Beijing" by refusing to allow the Taiwanese president to come to the U.S. and allowing China to purchase Nvidia chips. The group claims the Trump administration has "ceded leverage" in trade talks without gaining any "real breakthrough" in negotiations, which took place in Sweden this week. "In the face of lackluster domestic economic forecasts and anemic interest from Beijing in achieving a real breakthrough in talks, Trump and his economic team have ceded leverage and negotiating power to Beijing in a desperate attempt to lure President Xi to a meeting with Trump," Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del., Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Patty Murray, D-Wash., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, Andy Kim, D-N.J., Tim Kaine, D-Va., Jack Reed, D-R.I., Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and Mark Warner, D-Va. said. "Even more dangerously, they risk putting American national security, technological advantage, and economic prosperity on the chopping block in order to do so." CHINA MAY GAIN GREATER CONTROL OF PANAMA CANAL AFTER BLACKROCK DEAL MISSES DEADLINE Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Chris Coons, left, and Sen. Chuck Schumer, right, slammed President Donald Trump for making "concessions" to Beijing without a "real breakthrough" in trade talks. (Reuters) Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te was planning a stopover in New York en route to a trip to Latin America, but the Trump administration reportedly denied permission for the stop after China raised objections. The U.S. does not maintain formal relations with Taiwan, but such stops have happened before. Last week, the Trump administration reversed a ban on selling Nvidia’s lower-powered H20 chips to China to power its artificial intelligence, arguing they were only the U.S.’ "fourth-best chip." That move was a concession in talks with China over rare earth minerals, in hopes that Beijing would stop cutting off exports of the materials needed for all sorts of American technologies. "President Trump is handing our primary geopolitical adversary the keys to the castle of 21st century global technological dominance. Doing so will enable Chinese leadership in artificial intelligence, infusing the Chinese military with the technological advantage it needs to continue hostile operations across the globe," the Democratic statement claimed. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly shot back in a statement to Fox News Digital: "Democrats enabled and applauded Joe Biden’s weakness when they denied the Wuhan lab leak theory and allowed a spy balloon to surveil our country." "President Trump is putting America First, and his strategy is working — China is sending rare earth magnets to the United States, and tariffs are rapidly leveling the playing field for American industries. This President is successful because he will look anyone in the eye to negotiate better deals for our country, and he will continue to advance American interests, such as bolstering our economy and stopping the flow of fentanyl into our communities." SCHUMER CALLS ON FBI TO CONDUCT COUNTERINTELLIGENCE THREAT ASSESSMENT ON EPSTEIN FILES Last week, the Trump administration reversed a ban on selling Nvidia’s lower-powered H20 chips to China to power its artificial intelligence, arguing they were only the U.S.’ "fourth-best chip." (Ton Molina/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The U.S. and China concluded their third round of high-level trade talks on Tuesday, ahead of an August 12 deadline after which the steep China tariffs Trump announced in April are expected to kick in. Trump told reporters Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent felt "very good" about the meeting, but it’s unclear yet if the two sides reached any solid agreements — or plan to extend the August deadline. Trump, the Democrats claimed, "is emboldening Beijing to take aggressive actions and seek even more aggressive concessions in whatever trade negotiations may follow."

Title: BlackRock Staking For Its Spot Ethereum ETF Has Been Acknowledged — But What’s Coming For ETH?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged a Nasdaq filing proposing an amendment to BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). This proposal seeks to enable the ETF to stake its Ethereum holdings, allowing it to participate in the ETH proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and potentially earn staking rewards. BlackRock just received regulatory acknowledgment to include staking in its Spot Ethereum ETF. As mentioned by Çağrı Yaşar on X, acknowledging the filing isn’t a minor regulatory checkbox. It’s the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) handing institutions a key, and not just to ETH price action, but to its engine. This staking isn’t about price speculation. It’s about alignment, incentives, governance, and yield. Unlike traditional asset holding, staking involves actively securing the network by validating transactions and supporting ETH’s consensus. With recent regulatory approvals allowing BlackRock and other institutions to include staking in Spot ETH ETFs, this will enable Wall Street to hold ETH as a speculative asset. Thus, they can begin earning from the yield generated by the ETH core protocol mechanics, and integrate deeply into the network infrastructure. However, if ETH staking becomes ETF-native, it will redefine what it means to invest in a financial network. ETH would become the first global-scale digital infrastructure where traditional capital markets not only invest, but they become active participants in the protocol. The SEC has effectively validated ETH’s consensus model as not only secure but worthy of institutional involvement. This is how empires shift, and not with headlines, but with details no one expected. This highlights that major shifts in power or systems don’t always announce themselves loudly. Instead, they often happen quietly, through small regulatory changes. ETH isn’t becoming Wall Street-friendly. Wall Street is becoming ETH-compatible. This is when a new technology enters mainstream finance, and people assume it’s being reshaped to fit traditional systems. Furthermore, Yaşar noted that the network effect has just turned financial. This means that the value of a network grows as more participants join. In an X post, VirtualBacon stated that BlackRock and JPMorgan aren’t investing in Ethereum for speculative hype or short-term price gains. Instead, their focus lies on ETH’s growing role as a foundational platform for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has been unequivocal about his vision for ETH’s future, stating that he aims to tokenize stocks and build investment funds directly on the ETH blockchain. This marks a significant institutional endorsement of ETH as a platform for next-generation finance. Meanwhile, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan has softened his previously cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, especially following recent regulatory clarity provided by initiatives under the GENIUS Act. This shift signals growing openness among traditional financial leaders to integrate blockchain technology into mainstream finance. My name is Sandra White. I am a graduate.

Title: Ethereum sets sight on becoming the ‘global computer’ in the next 10 years

Ethereum aims to be the backbone of the digital world across AI, robotics, and decentralized infrastructure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ten years ago, Ethereum was little more than an idea on Reddit. Today, it stands as one of the most significant technological innovations in modern finance. Co-founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, Ethereum began with a vision to move beyond Bitcoin’s perceived limitations. That vision sparked interest from fellow technologists, including Gavin Wood, who would go on to write the Ethereum Yellow Paper, a key technical document that helped legitimize the project. In mid-2014, long before Ethereum became a household name in crypto, the Ethereum Foundation launched a public presale. ETH was sold at an initial fixed exchange rate of 2,000 ETH per BTC, gradually decreasing over 42 days to 1,337 ETH per BTC. The sale raised over 31,000 BTC, valued at roughly $18.3 million at the time, and distributed 60 million ETH. Those funds laid the foundation for Ethereum’s network development and community growth. Since then, Ethereum has grown into the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization. It has powered countless innovations, from DeFi and NFTs to Layer-2 scaling and zero-knowledge proofs. The network has also undergone major milestones, including the DAO crisis, the hard fork that followed, and The Merge, which transitioned Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Joseph Lubin, Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder, highlighted the protocol’s resilience during these 10 years, saying: “Ethereum has demonstrated non-stop uptime, proving itself as the definition of antifragile. It has continually evolved to serve as a reliable trust layer for our fast-growing digital world.” Lubin also noted that Ethereum’s appeal now extends far beyond the crypto-native world. Financial giants like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Visa have begun building on the network, attracted by its programmability and security. He noted: “Ethereum offers a borderless, transparent, and decentralized financial architecture, opening up entirely new avenues of growth and innovation and enabling far greater economic and political agency for people and communities.” Ethereum Foundation Co-Executive Director Tomasz Stańczak believes the network is poised to play a central role in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and decentralized infrastructure. According to him, Ethereum aims to be the backbone of a more secure, open, and programmable digital world over the coming decade. He said: “Ethereum is designed for this future. Privacy. Censorship resistance. Security. Open source at the root. These are not features, they’re values. That’s why people come to Ethereum to build their dreams” Co-Executive Director Hsiao-Wei Wang echoed this vision, stating that Ethereum will become a “global computer” seamlessly embedded in daily life. However, Wang noted that realizing this vision will require a balance between innovation and stability, scalability and accessibility, privacy and affordability. The executive said: “As we grow, the ecosystem must maintain its commitment to where it started: decentralized & robust network, permissionless applications, & global open-source contribution. Winning will not rely on any single entity. Resilience is created by the growth of the whole community.” Meanwhile, Lubin also stated that: “Beyond finance, Ethereum will serve as critical infrastructure for the next wave of innovation across networks of decentralized social graphs, stablecoins, decentralized identity systems, decentralized physical infrastructure, data marketplaces and autonomous AI agents.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Ripple CTO reveals why the firm is not currently using XRPL DEX for payments

Ripple CTO envisions permissioned features as key to unlocking XRPL DEX for payments. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has revealed that regulatory risks are the main reason why the company and its partners have not embraced the XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX) for payment settlements. The statement came in response to a user on X (formerly Twitter) who questioned the DEX’s underwhelming activity despite Ripple’s wide-ranging institutional partnerships. According to the community, the network has over a decade of development behind it and more than 300 financial partners. As a result, it is expected to facilitate far greater on-chain volume than it is currently processing. In his post on X, Schwartz acknowledged the slow progress, attributing it to institutional reluctance around public liquidity pools. He said: “Institutions have historically preferred to use digital assets off-chain rather than on-chain. I think we’re close to changing that because institutions are starting to see the benefits of moving on-chain.” Schwartz also pointed out a key concern in the difficulty of verifying liquidity sources on an open DEX. In his words, Ripple currently avoids using the XRPL because “we can’t be sure a terrorist won’t provide the liquidity for payment.” Considering this, Ripple or its counterpart engaging with the DEX poses serious legal and reputational risks without reliable controls. To address these concerns, Schwartz highlighted ongoing efforts to introduce permissioned features. One such tool under development, permissioned domains, could help institutions identify trustworthy liquidity providers, potentially unlocking safer use of on-chain payment rails. Despite the issues Schwartz cited, the Ripple CTO expressed a belief that traditional financial institutional players like BlackRock might find it more efficient to build on existing networks like XRPL, rather than create standalone blockchains from scratch. He cited Circle’s USDC strategy as a prime example of this trend. Instead of launching its own blockchain, Circle deployed its stablecoin across multiple public networks to leverage scale, interoperability, and existing liquidity. According to Schwartz, these traits position XRPL as a strong candidate for future enterprise-grade tokenization projects. He argued that public chains offer the kind of asset mobility and infrastructure depth that private solutions struggle to match. BlackRock has already entered the space through Ethereum. Its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, has amassed over $2.4 billion in assets, making it the largest of its kind. Schwartz suggested that this precedent may hint at how future institutions could use XRPL in similar ways, provided compliance features catch up. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: ‘Point Of No Return’—Fed ‘Doom Loop’ Dollar Crisis Predicted To Trigger ‘Critical’ Bitcoin Price Shock

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 07/30 update below. This post was originally published on July 30 Bitcoin and crypto prices have soared this year, with the combined crypto market topping $4 trillion amid a Satoshi Nakamoto-era bombshell. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price, up almost double from this time last year, hit an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin earlier this month and is braced for an Elon Musk shock after his rocket company SpaceX set alarm bells ringing. Now, as traders bet on a new “infinite money glitch," legendary billionaire Ray Dalio has recommended a 15% bitcoin or gold portfolio allocation, warning the Federal Reserve has been caught up in debt “doom loop" and that the dollar is past the “point of no return.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “We are at the at the point of no return because we’ll be having more debt,” Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said on The Master Investor Podcast and calling the situation in the U.S., the U.K. and other countries a “doom loop.” "How do you pay all this debt and all this debt service plus everything else? The only way to do that is for the government to create debt and borrow that money to pay and the central bank printing the money." U.S. debt has skyrocketed in recent years following huge government spending through Covid-era lockdowns, with interest rates that were rapidly hiked to rein in inflation adding to the cost of servicing the ballooning $37 trillion U.S. debt pile. 07/30 update: The Federal Reserve has left interest rates on hold, as the market had expected it would do, though governor Christopher Waller and Fed vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman voted for a cut, the largest number of dissenting votes by Fed officials in just over three decades. “If we cut rates too soon, maybe we didn’t finish the job with inflation. History is dotted with examples of that,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said during a press conference. “If you cut too late, then maybe you’re doing unnecessary damage to the labor market.” Earlier, data showed the U.S. economy grew at a stronger-than-expected pace in the second quarter as a growing trade balance and renewed consumer optimism propelled GDP to 3% for the three months from April through to the end of June. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market have climbed following the Fed’s interest rate decision, with one crypto company executive dismissing interest rate-led market swings as noise. “Institutions are in a race, for some it’s existential, for relevance in the next-gen financial internet,” Johnny Garcia, managing director of institutional growth and capital markets at VeChain, said in emailed comments, adding the "chatter and excitement around the direction of Fed rates is centrally focused on looking for buoy to send crypto prices higher–not about fundamental adoption.” Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have exploded onto Wall Street and into company’s treasuries in recent years, with companies led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy and bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) sucking up around 2.5 million of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist. “Nothing is stopping this train; least of all short-term one-off market-based factors such as the U.S. Federal funds rate," Garcia said. "When markets take into consideration the effect of central bank lending rates, it’s through the following perspective lens: current state and the direction of financial conditions and secondly expected economic activity as a result.” Tesla billionaire Elon Musk hit the campaign trail for U.S. president Donald Trump last year, issuing doomsday warnings over the spiraling U.S. debt pile and this year falling out with Trump over his failure to rein in spending. Musk called the dollar “hopeless" earlier this month, posting to his social media platform X that his new America Party would use bitcoin over so-called fiat currency. Dalio went on to advise investors to allocate at least 15% of their portfolios to gold or bitcoin, going far beyond the 2% bitcoin allocation recommended by BlackRock, which has found phenomenal success with its $85 billion spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). “[If] you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or bitcoin,” Dalio said, with his comments cheered by those in the bitcoin and crypto world. “The man has a point,” the X account of crypto asset manager Bitwise posted alongside a chart of U.S. debt shown soaring to around $35 trillion. “Dalio is merely suggesting putting a small portion of your deposit into time-tested assets, just like major funds do,” Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, said in emailed comments. “15% of a portfolio is a rather small share—after all, the remaining 85% can be invested however you like. Both gold and bitcoin are considered safe-haven assets in times of high inflation. Gold needs no introduction as it’s a historically protected asset. And bitcoin is often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ especially given the way regulation is evolving and how banks and governments plan to use it." Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious Meanwhile, bitcoin price and crypto analysts are predicting this is "critical" time for the market as investors increasingly pour cash into crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Bitcoin could quickly reclaim $120,000 and push into price discovery,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments. "The timing is critical. Spot bitcoin ETFs, and now ethereum ETFs, which have seen over $5 billion in flows in the past month and outpaced bitcoin on several days, continue to absorb institutional demand. With regulatory clarity taking shape and a coordinated federal stance now emerging, institutional adoption may accelerate meaningfully.” Mena added he believes the bitcoin price could soar be catapulted as high as $150,000 per bitcoin within the next couple of months if the Trump administration makes a “strong declaration around the strategic bitcoin reserve” Trump ordered the creation of in March.

Title: BlackRock Goes Heavy on Ethereum: Buys 4x More ETH Than BTC

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum has entered a volatile and decisive phase following weeks of strong buying pressure and rapid price appreciation. After pushing above $3,800, ETH is now facing resistance, with bulls stepping in to defend key lower demand zones. The market appears uncertain, caught between a potential continuation toward new highs and the risk of a broader cooldown. Adding to the momentum, new data from Arkham reveals that BlackRock purchased over four times more Ethereum than Bitcoin last week. This shift marks a significant moment for institutional involvement in Ethereum and signals growing confidence in its long-term potential. Analysts across the industry are beginning to take note, interpreting the move as a signal that Ethereum may be gaining favor among traditional finance giants. As Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs, Ethereum now stands at a crossroads. Will it continue climbing and close the gap, or will rejection above $3,800 mark the beginning of a local top? Arkham data has revealed a significant development in institutional crypto allocation: BlackRock purchased over $1.2 billion worth of Ethereum last week, compared to just $267 million in Bitcoin. This 4.5x disparity signals a decisive shift in institutional strategy, with capital now flowing more aggressively into ETH than BTC. For many in the market, this is what true institutional Ethereum adoption looks like—massive inflows that reshape market dynamics. This shift didn’t start overnight. Institutional interest in Ethereum began building back in April, when ETH hit a cycle low near $1,380. Since then, a combination of legal clarity, progress around ETF approval, and Ethereum’s maturing role in the financial ecosystem has fueled a steady wave of accumulation from large players. BlackRock’s latest allocation is simply the most visible and significant confirmation of that trend. As the broader crypto market heats up, Ethereum appears well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory. However, not everything is straightforward. ETH is now struggling to break through resistance around the $3,800 level, and the failure to reclaim new highs is beginning to stir uncertainty. Some analysts warn that the current rally may lose steam without a breakout, and fear of a short-term correction is growing. Ethereum has staged an impressive rally over the past few weeks, surging from sub-$2,000 levels to a current price of $3,782.61. The weekly chart shows a strong bullish breakout from the $2,852.16 resistance zone, with ETH now approaching a critical barrier near $3,860.80. Price briefly reached a high of $3,941.86 before pulling back, signaling potential short-term exhaustion after an aggressive upside move. Volume has increased significantly during this breakout, confirming strong buying interest. The 50, 100, and 200-week SMAs—all converging around $2,700–$2,850—now serve as key support, reinforcing the strength of the breakout. As long as ETH remains above the $2,850 level, the broader structure remains bullish. However, the current pause below $3,860 suggests indecision as bulls encounter historical resistance. A clean weekly close above this level could open the door to a continuation toward $4,200–$4,400. On the downside, a rejection followed by a drop below $3,500 may trigger a short-term correction as traders secure profits.

(Bloomberg) -- Earnings season for a handful of megacap tech firms has morphed into capex season with the AI arms race showing no signs of slowing. Focus will be on how much the behemoths Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. plan to dish out to keep up with competitors like Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. as they build out infrastructure and software to power artificial intelligence applications. The answer — estimated at around $70 billion in each company’s current fiscal year — may matter more to investors than actual profits and will go a long way to determining whether blistering rallies in the shares will persist. Both report after the close Wednesday. For nearly two years now, investors have continued to shower Big Tech with cash as the companies churned out lavish profits and then reinvested hundreds of billions of dollars into AI. Now, with Microsoft and Meta having notched rallies north of 40% from April lows, analysts worry massive outlays without corresponding AI profits could dent investor enthusiasm. “If a company is saying, maybe we’ll see an AI benefit in five years, we’re no longer at the point where that will get a pass,” Gabriela Santos, chief strategist for the Americas at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in an interview. “Valuations are mattering more and more, and valuation especially matters if a company can’t grow sales as fast as expected, or as quickly as capex.” Microsoft is expected to report about $18 billion in capital spending in the quarter ended June 30, an increase of nearly 30% from a year ago. Sales at the software giant are forecast to rise 14%. Meta, meanwhile, is expected to show $16.4 billion in spending, double from the year-ago period, while revenue will rise 15%, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Last week provided a hopeful marker for Big Tech bulls. Alphabet shares rose as the company boosted its capex forecast 13% to $85 billion after delivering better-than-expected earnings. A gain in the week erased what had been a loss in 2025. The bar is likely higher for Meta and Microsoft when it comes to spending, not least because their shares have rallied about 20% this year versus Alphabet’s 3.4% gain. They also have different approaches to AI than Alphabet’s search-driven focus, with Microsoft teaming with OpenAI and Meta trying to develop “super intelligence” with an army of engineers, lured with massive pay packages. Last quarter, AI spending proved somewhat beneficial. Meta’s strength was credited to AI improving ad targeting, and Microsoft saw a similar tailwind with its cloud business. “Microsoft is investing aggressively into AI, which looks like the right strategy if you have a long-term view on the stock,” Daniel Flax, a senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, said. Santos struck a more cautious tone specifically on AI outlays. “We’re really honing in on margins this quarter,” she said. “It is still all about ROI, and what companies can grow their sales faster than what they’re invested into AI capex.” With capex swelling at both companies, neither can afford to falter in the businesses that have generated billions in cash flow in recent years — a misstep Flax thinks both can avoid. “Microsoft is executing extremely well on its cloud opportunity,” he said. Azure, the OpenAI investment, and AI assistant “Copilot” should ease worries about spending, said Krishna Chintalapalli, portfolio manager and tech sector head at Parnassus Investments. “Those are all huge and growing businesses, and Microsoft seems like it has less risk in its non-AI business, where there is steady recurring revenue,” he said. Meta’s AI bets also make sense to investors. The company has “multiple ways to earn a return on AI spending,” according to Michael McKinnon, who manages more than $40 billion as a portfolio manager at Artisan Partners and holds Meta shares. He cited the ability to improve efficiency and increase both user engagement and the return on ad spend for its customers as ways for AI to drive growth, in addition to the ability to create new business categories, such as with its smart glasses. This is a “very different kind of spending than what we saw a couple years ago, when it was spending $20 billion on Reality Labs,” which was a “low-probability bet that didn’t justify the level of investment Meta was throwing at it.” Still, with trillion-dollar valuations and P/E ratios near or above long-term averages, investors will likely remain cautious as the results roll in. Option-derived implied moves for the shares following the reports are relatively muted, with Microsoft at 3.9% and Meta at 5.8%. “Historically, high or rising capex is a negative factor, but the more profitable the company is, the more it turns into a positive factor,” said Tony DeSpirito, global chief investment officer of BlackRock Fundamental Equities. “That’s why these big tech companies are getting treated differently than another company might.” Top Tech Stories Earnings Due Wednesday --With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.

Title: 50 Over 50: Investment

As Taxbit’s CEO since 2023, Lindsey Argalas’ expertise in fintech and consumer technology is meeting the rising demand for accounting and tax services for blockchain, crypto and tokenized assets. The Salt Lake City-based unicorn (it has some $235 million in funding) addresses the crypto-related tax needs of exchanges, institutional investors and governments alike. Prior to Taxbit, Argalas was the chief digital and innovation officer at Banco Santander and chaired Santander Innoventures, the bank’s $200 million fintech venture capital arm. TIAA manages the savings of nearly five million customers, but it’s a family story that CEO Thasunda Brown Duckett shares to raise the issue of retirement planning literacy. Her father, Otis Brown, worked for more than 30 years at a warehouse job and didn’t contribute to his 401(k) plan, leaving years of savings, a company match and returns on the table. Since taking the top job at the $1.3 trillion AUM institution in 2021, Duckett has advocated for retirement education and planning services to address the glaring gap in savings. This month, Kate Burke was promoted to the CEO role at Allspring Global Investments, which has more than $600 billion in assets under advisement and 1,325 employees across 19 offices worldwide. Burke joined Charlotte-based Allspring in 2023 as president after 18 years at AllianceBernstein, where she shepherded the firm’s move from New York to Nashville—one of the largest of the industry’s southern migrations. Allspring was spun out of Wells Fargo’s asset management business in 2021. As co-CEO and managing partner of Golden Seeds, Jo Ann Corkran oversees an investor group of more than 300 members that focuses on funding women-led businesses. Founded in 2005, the group is one of the most active angel investment organizations in the U.S. and has invested over $185 million in over 257 women-led startups. Corkran also is a general partner at two Golden Seeds venture funds and was previously a managing director at Credit Suisse Asset Management. After her public breakup with Morgan Stanley in 2007 (which resulted in her resignation as co-president following a 25-year career there) Zoe Cruz found her stride a decade later in the digital asset space, first as an advisor at Ripple Labs and then, in 2020, as founder of Menai Financial Group. Her firm has two offerings: one product that offers diversified exposure to digital assets, and a strategy that helps identify the top 20 to 40 most compelling investments out of more than 15,000 cryptocurrencies. Stephanie Drescher’s grandmother had no schooling beyond 8th grade but followed the markets every day, inspiring her granddaughter to a career in finance. Drescher joined Apollo Global Management, with its more than $785 billion AUM, in 2004 after a decade at JP Morgan, primarily in the alternative investment group. Today, Drescher is in charge of a division of about 130 colleagues in its global wealth business, and she leads Apollo’s Expanding Opportunity Steering Committee as well as the company’s women’s network. She is also on the board of the girls’ college access organization Student Leadership Network. At 54, Molly Duffy took over Standard Chartered’s multi-billion-dollar client segment and, in creating two new growth strategies—one in the public sector and one that doubles down in working with other banks, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds—turned the division into a business that drives 51% of Standard Chartered’s overall Corporate and Investment Banking income. “This chapter has brought together everything I’ve learned so far,” Duffy, who spent 12 years at Credit Suisse before joining Standard Chartered in 2017, told Forbes. “I’m proud that it all came together in a role I wouldn’t have been ready for at 40 but was prepared to fully lead at 54.” Monica Brand Engel leads Quona's Africa, MENA and cross-border investment strategy with a focus on investing in technologies that expand access to quality financial services in emerging markets. Engel, who is half Peruvian and half American, has said “never quite fitting in” helps her spot opportunities that also deliver on impact. “Our goal is to bring what’s on the margins into the mainstream,” she said. With 68 active portfolio companies and a team of nine nationalities speaking 20 languages, Quona has nearly $800 million in assets under management. Samara Epstein Cohen is BlackRock’s chief investment officer leading the teams managing some $7.8 trillion of the company’s index funds and ETFs. In this position, she’s been responsible for the launch of the firm’s target date ETFs in 2023, the only suite of target date ETFs in the U.S. specifically geared towards people without access to a 401(k). BlackRock was a homecoming of sorts: Cohen rejoined the firm in 2015 after starting her career there in 1993 as an analyst. Cohen went on to spend nearly two decades at Goldman Sachs, where she built and led the global market transition team, guiding clients through the changing regulatory landscape following the 2008 financial crisis. Two-time Forbes Midas lister Jennifer Fonstad has spent nearly 30 years in venture capital and has helped fund some of the world’s most influential tech companies. Her early jobs gave her a hand in investing in companies like SpaceX, Athenahealth and Hotmail. She co-founded Owl Capital in 2019 to focus on early-stage startups; the firm has since had nine IPOs, 25 M&A exits and over 600 financings. Fonstad started her career teaching math in sub-Saharan Africa. Owl Capital bills itself as the first investment firm to commit 5% of its carry profit pool to the communities where the entrepreneurs it supports live. Named after the first U.S. birth control clinic that opened in Brooklyn in 1916, Amboy Street Ventures invests in early-stage startups in sexual and reproductive health products and services. Colleen Foster joined Amboy Street in 2022 after more than 20 years at Goldman Sachs, where she was a partner managing a global commodities franchise of more than $1 billion. Foster also has a long tenure of working on behalf of Planned Parenthood (she currently sits on its board of its telehealth platform). “The economics of investing in women and their healthcare from puberty to post-menopause produce outsized returns,” Foster said when Amboy Street closed its debut $20 million fund two years ago. Lori Heinel assumed the role overseeing a worldwide team of more than 600 in 2021. She’s since led the revamping of State Street’s operating model and deployed technologies to focus it on strategic priorities. Last year, State Street posted record returns, with total revenues climbing 13% year-over-year to an all-time high of $2.3 billion; AUM grew by 15% to $4.7 trillion. Heinel’s also been lauded for advocating for women in the industry, once writing in an International Women’s Day essay: “Fearless girls are made not born, and we all have a common interest in creating more of them.” Kristin Hull embraces the role of “activist investor,” pushing companies like Tesla and Apple on workplace, environmental and social justice issues. Growing up in San Francisco and learning trading at her father’s successful market-making firm, Hull founded Nia Impact Capital the year she turned 50. “I wanted to make it easier for women to invest for positive returns and for positive impact,” she says. She’s grown the firm to almost $500 million under management across three investment portfolios and a mutual fund. Kimberly Johnson leads technology, global investment operations and client account services and several other operating teams for T. Rowe Price, an international management firm with $1.68 trillion in assets under management. She joined the financial services holding company three years ago after leading a team of 3,600—and an operating budget of $1.4 billion—at mortgage lender Fannie Mae. An alum of Princeton University, Johnson joined its board of trustees in 2023. Yvette Kanouff is the first (and, so far, only) woman to win a Lifetime Achievement Emmy for television engineering and technology and is an inductee to the Cable Hall of Fame. She’s now putting her expertise to work for startups as a partner at JC2 Ventures, the firm founded by former Cisco CEO and chairman John Chambers. “JC2 Ventures is a very different type of venture capital fund,” she said. With 18 current companies in the JC2 portfolio and a total of eight IPOs and acquisitions, the firm says 40% of the companies in its portfolio are deemed unicorns. Freada Kapor Klein started her career in activism, founding the nation’s first organization dedicated to fighting sexual harassment in 1976. It was through “following the trail to the center of power, which leads to money,” that she landed in Silicon Valley. She and her husband, Mitch Kapor, cofounded early-stage venture firm Kapor Capital in 1999 and, in 2011, changed its strategy to exclusively invest in mission-oriented startups. Between that year and 2017, the firm achieved a 29% internal rate of return, and today, Kapor Klein says, the firm continues to achieve “top quartile returns.” In the last three years, seven of its portfolio companies—including Gusto, Formlabs and Newsela—have reached unicorn status. A member of the charter class of Kauffman Fellows, Karen Kerr went on to found Exposition Ventures in 2019, an investment firm inspired by the Chicago World’s Fair that served as a showcase for the Second Industrial Revolution. With a doctorate in physical chemistry from the University of Chicago (she supported herself during her PhD by consulting for investors ARCH Venture Partners), Kerr’s firm has backed companies in 3D printing, robotics, virtual reality and AI that are crucial to advanced manufacturing in the future. Nataliya Kofman has led the $2.3 billion Vanguard Global Wellington Fund since its 2017 inception and co-leads the firm’s quality equity team. The fund has outperformed its benchmark and the category average every year for the past eight. Kofman has said she developed her global perspective on managing risk growing up in Ukraine and in her first career as a mechanical engineer at Ford Motor Company. There she was part of the team responsible for the launch of the F150 pickup and where she said she honed her skills in analytical thinking and structured decision-making. Colette Kress joined semiconductor giant Nvidia in September 2013, long before it became a $4.2 trillion (market cap) publicly-traded company known for being the backbone of the artificial intelligence revolution. Kress has overseen a historic revenue growth over the last decade–Nvidia recorded $60.9 billion in revenue in 2024, a fifteen-fold growth from a decade ago. Prior to Nvidia, she spent 13 years at Microsoft and three years as CFO at a Cisco division. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says retirement is still years away, but speculation that Marianne Lake will be his successor grows more persistent with each move she makes. Lake recently assumed leadership of international consumer banking and JPMorgan’s strategic growth office. When she spoke at the annual Investor Day in May, Wall Street analysts took note of the full hour she was allotted as much as her message (every other senior executive, including Dimon, was given just 30 minutes to speak). Lake oversees services for 85 million consumers and seven million small businesses. She’s the co-founder of the bank’s Women on the Move program to expand women-run businesses. Most consumers might never recognize the name “Nacha,” but the independent, not-for-profit organization governs the ACH Network, the system of direct deposits and payments that reach all U.S. bank and credit union accounts. That gives Larimer oversight of the staggering 33.6 billion payments (volume in 2024), transactions whose value added up to $86.2 trillion. Larimer was the organization’s first in-house legal counsel when she joined Nacha in 1996 and she took over as CEO in 2019. She’s the granddaughter of the first woman to run a Wall Street brokerage firm, Sayra Fischer Lebenthal, and the daughter of municipal bond legend Jim Lebenthal. And while the family is credited with democratizing bonds as an investment for the masses, there’s been no glide path for its third generation. Alexandra Lebenthal now focuses on advising women-led firms through her leadership role at the $171 billion (AUM) Rockefeller Capital Management. “I’ve been in their shoes,” she says. “Having your name on the door isn’t always easy.” Saira Malik is a member of Nuveen’s executive management team and leads a business with more than $1 trillion in global assets under management across equities, fixed income, private placements, green capital, infrastructure and product. She learned about investments from her mother, who picked stocks as a hobby, and Malik started publishing her own markets newsletter as a college student. She joined Nuveen in 2003 and was named to her current role in 2022. She also continues to write a weekly newsletter. Anna Marrs joined American Express six years ago and oversees relationships with millions of businesses that accept Amex, as well as strategic payment, banking and fintech relationships and credit fraud and risk operations. Her team has more than 6,500 employees and accounts for about a quarter of Amex’s revenue — a record $65.9 billion in 2024. She also serves on the board of DocuSign and on the governing body of the London Business School, where she earned an MBA. In the role since 2020, Kara McShane put Wells Fargo at the top of an array of industry rankings — currently the second-largest commercial real estate lender— amid a challenging market for the sector by building greater collaboration with other bank divisions. That’s given her wide visibility as a banking role model. “I recognize the unique challenges women face and pride myself on being a mentor and leader that walks the walk, helping elevate women throughout their careers,” she said. Oxeon takes a unique approach to building healthcare companies and its own business: It searches for executive talent, invests in healthcare innovation and, as an employee-owned company, shares the equity and returns from its more than $100 million portfolio. Sonia Millsom became Oxeon’s CEO in 2022 and has further expanded Oxeon’s influence as a founding sponsor of Break into the Boardroom, an organization that places women on the boards of healthcare companies. Christina Minnis works at what she calls the “convergence of public and private markets” that is reshaping capital flows to meet the demands in high-need markets such as technology, power and infrastructure. She’s part of Goldman Sachs’ newly formed Capital Solutions Group, with $145 billion in alternative assets and a focus on financing large deals for corporate clients. A former All-American squash player at Yale, Minnis has been in leadership at the banking giant since 1998. Ileana Musa was recruited to Morgan Stanley in 2017 to focus on the firm’s high-net-worth clients. Today she does that through co-leading the bank’s international wealth management business and its international lending operations. She also heads up a Morgan Stanley national initiative to empower the Latino community in building generational wealth through homeownership and entrepreneurship. Born in Cuba and immigrating to the U.S. as a toddler with her mother and siblings, it’s a personal story for Musa. She’s said she continually draws inspiration from her late mother, who supported her family, put her children through college and then earned her own business degree at 70. Racquel Oden joined HSBC last year to lead the bank’s wealth management, global private banking and retail businesses in the U.S. at a time when it wanted to better focus on globally connected, high-net-worth clients. Oden came to HSBC USA from JPMorgan Chase, where she was responsible for its consumer banking network expansion; previous stints included Merrill Lynch, UBS and Morgan Stanley. The daughter of Jamaican immigrants who was the first in her family to attend college, Oden chairs the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, which raises millions for scholarships and mentoring. She’s the first African American woman in her current role. A former group chairman at Johnson & Johnson, Sandra Peterson leads health and consumer investments in North America and Europe at CD&R. It’s the 9th largest private equity firm in the world, and its funds have raised nearly $50 billion over the past five years. Peterson joined the firm in 2019 and has since had a hand in some of its most significant transactions, including one with French multinational health company Opella; Zephyr AI, which advances precision medicine for oncology and cardiometabolic diseases; and Cynosure, which is developing technology for non-invasive and minimally invasive procedures. She’s been an independent director on Microsoft’s board since 2015. A member of BNY’s executive committee, Emily Portney leads its largest unit, Asset Servicing, delivering custody, fund services, as well as middle office and data solutions to asset owners, investment managers, insurers, banks and broker-dealers. She previously served as the chief financial officer for BNY, the first woman to hold the role. BNY has more than $55 trillion in assets under custody and administration. Her career also includes the CFO role at Barclays International and more than 20 years at JPMorgan Chase. There’s more than $251 billion sitting in donor-advised funds (charitable investment accounts), and Jennifer Risher thinks that money can be put to better use sooner. Risher, also an impact investor, cofounded #HalfMyDAF with her husband, Lyft CEO David Risher, to challenge those with DAFs to spend down a portion of their holdings by a specific date and be eligible for matching funds from #HalfMyDAF. The effort, which she promotes through national speaking engagements and outreach, has moved more than $75 million to nonprofits, she says. As Mastercard’s chief commercial payments officer, Raj Seshadri leads the firm’s commercial cards business, B2B payables, healthcare payment services, non-card payments, remittances and disbursements. It’s a role that takes on both the complexities of the global payments system and also closer-to-home issues of small businesses in emerging economies, modernizing transactions and migrant workers sending money to their families back home—issues her division has been addressing through new technologies and innovation. Seshadri first joined Mastercard in 2016 after tenures at BlackRock, Citi and McKinsey. She’s a physicist by training with a PhD in the field from Harvard. Susan Sheffield ascended to the top of the nation’s largest originators of auto loans and leases this year after serving as executive vice president and chief financial officer since 2018. The Fort Worth, Texas-based company is the third-largest U.S. auto financier (based on outstanding balances) and originated a combined $56 billion in retail loans and operating leases in 2024. Sheffield started her career in corporate and commercial banking and is known for championing financial literacy, including the KEYS by GM Financial program. In just over three years, Tamara Steffens has more than doubled Thomson Reuters Venture Fund to $250 million and overseen investments in companies such as Spellbook, Payflow, TrueWind and Materia, as well as six exits. Earlier in her career, she scaled teams at six startups and says one of her most significant post-50 accomplishments was Microsoft’s 2014 acquisition of email app Acompli, a sale she negotiated as the startup’s senior vice president of business development. She later joined M12, Microsoft’s venture fund, leading its Female Founders Fund competition. Razor’s Edge Ventures cofounder Peggy Styer invests in growth-stage national security companies, yielding over $1 billion in returns in the last five years. Styer previously cofounded and led Blackbird Technologies, an enemy tracking and tagging tech acquired by Raytheon in 2014 for $420 million. She also cofounded and served as CEO of mobile communications company RavenWing, acquired by Boeing in 2008. Her first innovation was a “fortune-telling machine” she built in middle school, she once shared in an interview. An executive with a “Rubik’s Cube of healthcare knowledge,” Lisa Suennen leads American Heart Association Ventures as its managing partner, a role she took on in 2024. Suennen oversees $200 million in assets and invests in businesses and organizations with the aim of bridging the funding gap between research and practice across the cardiovascular and brain health sectors. Suennen also founded CSweetener in 2016, a nonprofit network that offers mentorships for women in healthcare, which was acquired by the HLTH Foundation in 2019. Kat Taylor set out to create a new kind of bank in 2007—one with a community-first mission—after watching how income and wealth inequality left too many parts of society at a disadvantage. Beneficial State Bank, which is owned by nonprofits required to distribute excess funds to underserved communities, has since grown to $1.8 billion in assets (as of 2023). Outside of her work with the bank, Taylor led the creation of the California Consumer Financial Protection Law and the DFPI, one of the strongest state consumer protections and bank regulatory agencies in the country. Anne Walsh grew up the daughter of an investor, where business talk occurred around the dinner table. “I actually knew and understood bond math in the sixth grade,” she has said. At Guggenheim, she guides the firm’s investment strategies for its more than $349 billion in total assets. Walsh’s career in financial services spans nearly four decades, and she currently serves on the Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets, an advisory group to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on economic and public policy. The Clearing House is a banking association and payments company owned by the largest commercial banks in the U.S. It is the oldest of its kind in the nation and processes more than $2 trillion each day through wire, bank-to-bank transfers, check images and the real-time payments network. As its chief operating officer, Sheffali Welch plays a key role in the internal operations and strategy for what she describes as the “rails” of the nation’s banking system. Her career includes tenures at BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank and Citi. As an executive partner at 8VC, Karen White collaborates with founders and CEOs to build and scale businesses, a practice she honed in a storied Silicon Valley career, beginning at Oracle in the early 1990s. She joined the firm—which has $6 billion in committed capital and invests across the areas of logistics, biotech, healthcare and defense—in a full-time capacity in 2024 after serving on its board for the prior eight years. White came to 8VC from catastrophe risk modeling company RMS, where as CEO she led the company to a $2 billion acquisition by Moody’s in 2021. Tamar Yehoshua’s career has included leadership roles at Amazon, Google and Slack at crucial times in the companies’ development. In 2023, she joined venture firm IVP, which for more than four decades has funded more than 400 breakout tech companies around the globe, including brand names like Twitter and Netflix. Over the past 15 months, Yehoshua’s held two jobs, adding president of AI startup Glean to her resume before recently transitioning to an advisor’s role there. Glean, valued at an estimated $7 billion after a $150 million Series F raise in June, helps companies like Duolingo and Databricks use AI agents to improve workplace efficiency. Housing market analyst Ivy Zelman had just launched her firm—which provides housing data, analysis and investment services—when she called the 2008 housing crisis and then the bottom of the market in 2012. She further cemented her place in Wall Street lore as a figure in the best-selling novel-turned-movie, The Big Short. In 2021, the $2 billion (market cap) Walker & Dunlop acquired Zelman & Associates, and with U.S. housing facing an ongoing and historic affordability crisis, Zelman’s proprietary research and expertise remain in high demand.

After 20 years in business, Dax still oozes quiet class. Graham Neville’s superb classical cooking is a joy – seared Castletownbere scallops with coral bisque, Tipperary beef, and a mille-feuille of Irish rhubarb are textbook examples. Owner Olivier Meisonnave has compiled one of the country’s great wine lists – from smart biodynamic finds to serious Grand Cru. Corinna Hardgrave Since opening, Killian Durkin and Jess D’Arcy have worked tirelessly to deliver wonderful hospitality and modern Irish cooking from their seaside restaurant. Killian uses local and Irish ingredients such as “lamb lobster” (lamb neck), Winetavern Farm pork and Howth honey to great effect. Don’t miss the iconic cod chip or their exquisite tarts. Joanne Cronin Recently refurbished, mrDeanes is a bistro-style restaurant that encapsulates the very best of chef Michael Deane’s 28 years in business, and this year received a Michelin Bib Gourmand. It’s exactly what a busy city bistro should be, serving up Portavogie crab on toast, entrecôte au poivre, sugar pit pork chops and fish and chips. Look out for their new own label white wine. JC Ruchii is a riot of Indian flavours and bright jewelled colours. Marinated jumbo prawns are cooked to perfection in the tandoor oven while the slow-cooked lamb shank nalli nihari is sheer warmth. Chef Sateesh Sayana also serves up authentic South Indian specialities including rava dosa, masala uttapam and a Sunday special of Hyderabadi chicken dum biryani. Read our full review here. JC John Coffey does not stand still but continues to develop, always cooking with flair. The focus here is on quality produce, resulting in a glossy golden pithivier of potato, onion and Mossfield cheddar; roast cod with cauliflower, capers and golden raisins or a dark chocolate and sesame ganache. JC The words “Asian fusion” can sometimes strike fear, but diners are in safe hands at Umi. Owners Seán Lafferty and Gary Moran have created a fun atmosphere that seamlessly marries great Irish produce with Japanese techniques. Think binchotan grilled steak or crispy dumplings made with local pork and a fiery rayu sauce. They even offer their own wine, a fresh Austrian Blaufränkisch made by ex-employee Jack Mcateer.

Title: After Stablecoins, Tokenized Assets Will Be The Next Major Institutional Play in Blockchain

Time Published: 2025-07-30T09:05:35Z

Recent institutional interest in stablecoins has been something of a watershed moment for the crypto industry. Not only has the mainstream adoption of stablecoins signalled a renewed interest in and a broader acceptance of blockchain, but it is the first sign of the convergence of decentralised finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi). Major institutions such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock have begun integrating stablecoins into their operations. These TradFi heavyweights are utilising stablecoins for transactions, settlements, and as intermediaries bridging TradFi with DeFi. No other blockchain innovation has been adopted by traditional finance players to this extent, underscoring stablecoins’ legitimacy as a bona fide financial instrument. So what comes next? Which new blockchain creation will capture the attention of TradFi or do stablecoins represent the pinnacle of blockchain’s integration into the mainstream? It would appear that we already have a clear answer to this question: Tokenization. Like stablecoins, tokenization enables new market functions that are unfeasible in the traditional financial system. Tokenization, in the simplest terms, is the process of digitally representing real-world assets, including stocks, bonds, and real estate, on the blockchain in the form of a token, and its applications have already begun to pique the interests of private and public institutions. This was no more evident than during the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) public roundtable in May. The event brought together industry leaders, regulatory experts, and academics to discuss the potential of moving traditional assets onto blockchain-based platforms. Executives from BlackRock, Apollo, Fidelity, Invesco, to name just a few, emphasised that tokenization is a significant technological advancement, enabling programmable ownership and providing real-time settlements. Such potential benefits make tokenization particularly attractive for institutions seeking improved market dynamics. Tokenization is a technological shift An interesting theme raised at the SEC roundtable is that tokenization should be seen through the lens of a shift as opposed to the creation of entirely new asset classes. Conversations highlighted how tokenization could address various inefficiencies within traditional markets, including costly intermediaries and limited market access - not dissimilar to how stablecoins have overhauled and simplified traditional methods of processing cross-border payments, facilitating greater financial inclusion. Additionally, panelists emphasised the transformative potential of tokenization in automating compliance processes through smart contracts. They also noted that tokenization was a greater enabler of fractional investments, reducing the minimum purchase price of historically exclusive asset classes, bringing access to a broader range of investors, and therefore increasing liquidity in these tokenized assets. It is clear that tokenization's promise lies in its radical transformation of existing financial infrastructures. By leveraging blockchain's inherent transparency and immutability, tokenization can enhance investor trust and regulatory oversight while reducing systemic inefficiencies, fundamentally reshaping how assets are traded, settled, and owned in traditional markets. Challenges facing tokenization Participants at the SEC roundtable agreed that tokenization offers clear advantages to current market dynamics, but not without drawbacks that must be urgently addressed to enable the kind of institutional adoption seen with stablecoins. Issues such as custody arrangements and the need for regulatory clarity emerged as critical factors. Fortunately, we’re beginning to see Web3 companies that have built tokenization platforms actively address many of the concerns raised by SEC panellists. Standard compliance checks such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and other Anti-Money Laundering safeguards are becoming increasingly standardised across the tokenization ecosystem, reinforcing trust among both retail and institutional investors. Some tokenization organisations have gone a step further in regulatory compliance by securing full Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) licenses from central banks in their regions of operation. These legal advancements are helping to create compliant secondary markets for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), allowing investors to buy, sell and trade property-backed tokens within a safely regulated framework. Of course, there are still areas that need development if tokenization is to reach the scale of institutional adoption seen with stablecoins. While stablecoins have benefited from growing regulatory attention and standardised frameworks, many jurisdictions still lack clear guidelines on how tokenized securities or property-backed tokens are classified, taxed or traded. Interoperability also remains a challenge, with a need for more tokenization protocols and platforms that can integrate across chains and legacy systems, much like how stablecoins operate across exchanges, wallets and DeFi protocols. After stablecoins, tokenisation can be the next blockchain hit From reading coverage of the SEC Roundtable, it’s clear that institutions recognise the immense potential of tokenization to reshape traditional asset markets - provided regulatory frameworks and technological standards evolve in tandem. Tokenization platforms are already scaling to meet some of these requirements. While certain growing pains still need to be addressed, tokenization is well on its way to becoming the next major institutional opportunity in blockchain technology, with the capacity to redefine the future of financial markets, much like stablecoins have begun to do.

Title: BlackRock Analysts Predict Major Bitcoin Surge As US Legislation Strengthens Stablecoins

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a recent expert commentary, executives from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and a leading issuer of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), identified a significant trend in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin (BTC). They foresee a major surge ahead, driven by recent US legislative developments such as the signing of the GENIUS Act. They assert that these developments bolster the role of stablecoins as key players in the future of digital payments. Central to BlackRock’s analysis is the recently enacted GENIUS Act, legislation that aims to establish a comprehensive framework for stablecoins as a means of payment. Stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies such as the US dollar, are gaining significant traction among traditional finance firms seeking to modernize their transactions, and could solidify the dollar’s dominance in global markets. Though their current market share is about 7%—equating to approximately $250 billion—the rapid adoption of stablecoins since 2020 indicates a growing acceptance within the financial landscape. The GENIUS Act delineates stablecoins as payment methods rather than investment products, which includes provisions to prohibit interest payments and restrict issuance to federally regulated banks and select nonbanks. This regulatory framework is poised to create a tokenized ecosystem centered around the US dollar, facilitating easier access for users in emerging markets while potentially limiting adoption in major economies due to the ban on interest payments. Additionally, the act specifies the types of assets that stablecoin issuers can hold in reserve, predominantly consisting of repurchase agreements, money market funds, and US Treasury bills with short maturities. Notably, major stablecoin issuers like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) currently hold over $120 billion in Treasury bills, yet this represents only a small fraction of the total outstanding US Treasury bills. BlackRock’s commentary also suggests that while the demand for Treasury bills may increase as the stablecoin market grows, the overall impact on yields could be limited. This is due to a likely offsetting shift of funds from similar assets rather than generating significant new demand. Furthermore, the US Treasury’s inclination to increase short-term debt issuance to address persistent budget deficits may also dampen any upward pressure on yields. Beyond US borders, other regions are also taking steps to regulate stablecoins. Hong Kong is implementing new regulations aimed at fostering innovation in stablecoins, while Europe is exploring the concept of a digital euro, albeit with limitations to protect traditional banks. Should other nations allow interest-bearing stablecoins or pursue central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), the US dollar’s role in trade finance could be at risk, the experts assert, potentially prompting the US to reconsider its stance on interest payments. As digital assets continue to gain mainstream acceptance, the combination of regulatory support and US administration backing suggests a future where Bitcoin and stablecoins play a more integral role in financial systems. BlackRock remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential as a distinct return driver and a key asset in diversified investment portfolios.

Title: U.S. could resist COSCO inclusion in CK Hutchison port sale

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery The proposed inclusion of Chinese shipping giant Cosco in Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison's contentious global ports sale is a potential win for Beijing in a strategic sector, but the deal is far from final and could face resistance from Washington, sources and analysts say. Since the deal was announced on March 4 to sell 43 of CK Hutchison's ports in 23 countries, including two along the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by U.S. firm BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte's family-run shipping company MSC, it has sparked a firestorm of criticism from China. While the U.S. government might oppose the inclusion of state-run Cosco in the consortium over perceived geopolitical risks posed by Chinese influence, bringing in the shipping giant could provide a more level playing field rather than one company being dominant, said a person with knowledge of the deal. The complex deal would require approval from around 50 jurisdictions involved, and it would take at least two years for the process to be completed, sources and analysts said.

If the proposal is approved, the world’s largest asset manager would be able to participate in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus model using its ETFs’ funds, while also passing along those rewards to its shareholders, according to a filing published by the SEC. The filing notes that the SEC could make a determination within 45 days of the document’s posting to the Federal Registrar, however, that window can be extended. And the regulator has already acknowledged similar filings from other asset managers in recent months. In May, for example, the SEC gave notice that it was extending its decision deadline for a rule change submitted by NYSE Arca to permit staking for Bitwise’s spot Ethereum ETF. The regulator acknowledged the proposal in the Federal Registrar in early April. Later that month, the SEC delayed its decision on Grayscale’s efforts to support staking for its flagship Ethereum ETF fund. The proposal, which was also submitted by NYSE Arca, was acknowledged by the regulator in February. Under the proposal for the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), the asset manager could tap staking providers, and the resulting rewards would be treated as income for the trust. It would prevent the funds from being pooled with Ethereum belonging to other entities as well. Inflows to spot Ethereum ETFs have outpaced those to its Bitcoin counterparts as the asset has climbed recently to a nearly eight-month high. However, the lack of rewards from staking has been viewed as a drawback for the products since their debut a year ago. In April, the SEC approved of a rule change allowing Nasdaq to list options for BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF and three other funds. This year, it has also said that it does not believe staking is subject to securities laws. Spot Ethereum ETFs have generated $9.4 billion in net inflows since their debut, with BlackRock’s ETF contributing $9.5 billion, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. Inflows from seven other products have been outweighed by $4.3 billion in outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum ETF (ETHE). That fund differs from the others because it was a conversion from a trust and carries the highest expense ratio.

Title: NYC gunman Shane Tamura’s former football coach, teammate recall killer as ‘gifted’ athlete who became ‘completely different’ person

Time Published: 2025-07-29T20:37:44Z
Full Content:
Park Avenue ​mass shooter Shane Tamura was “completely different” a decade ago as a star high-school athlete​ — before he ​began express​ing suicidal thoughts ​in recent years and gambling to excess while working nights as a security guard at a Las Vegas casino. ​The Midtown killer’s descent into homicidal madness stunned those who knew him growing up. “Nine years ago, he was a completely different Shane,” a 28-year-old former teammate told The Post on Tuesday — the day after Tamura shot up a Manhattan skyscraper in a failed attempt to target NFL headquarters, which he blamed for alleged brain injuries despite never playing in the league. “Compared to what’s on the news, I don’t think any one of us, none of my teammates, sensed anything like this from Shane,” said the man, who asked not to be publicized. “He was very devoted to football, he was a very good player, but off the field he was very like, nice, positive. He never really had conflict with anyone,” the man said. Tamura was a standout running back at Granada Hills Charter and Golden Valley high schools in Los Angeles County, garnering numerous accolades including being named player of the game five times during his junior year in 2015. “He was very quiet. He led by his actions more than his word. He was athletically gifted. One of the best running backs that I coached,” said Walter Roby, 60, who coached Tamura during his senior year at Granada Hills, to The Post. “He was coachable, meaning when you can ask him to do something he would do it. He was quiet, humble. He knew his athletic ability but he wasn’t boastful about that.” Roby said he was “heartbroken” at the news his former player had perpetrated the heinous mass shooting. “It’s just shocking. It took me a while to come to grips with it. that was tough,” the coach said. Granada Hills Charter issued a statement Tuesday saying Tamura withdrew from the school after attending the 2015 fall semester and has had no connection with the academy since. “We are horrified by the violence in New York. It is heartbreaking, and we extend our deepest sympathies to the victims, their families, and affected communities,” the school wrote​. Tamura took his own life after his shooting spree, in which he killed three office workers and an NYPD officer as he stormed 345 Park Ave. in Midtown with an AR-style rifle Monday evening, apparently targeting the NFL, Mayor Eric Adams said. Police found a rambling three-page note stashed in Tamura’s wallet in which he blamed football for his alleged struggle with CTE — the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy — and begged for his brain to be studied after his death. The note also included an apology to someone named Rick, who sources identified as the owner of the crucial part of the gun that Tamura used. Rick was Tamura’s supervisor at the Horseshoe Las Vegas Casino, sources said. Detectives have located the gun’s owner and are currently questioning him, as well as the seller of the weapon’s lower receiver, which an NYPD spokesman described as “what makes the rifle fire.” Investigators are still working to determine Tamura’s exact motive, but sources said he is believed to have suffered at least two mental health incidents in 2022 and 2024. He received his gun permit in 2022, and a short time later notified police he was having suicidal ideations — which are not grounds for having a permit revoked, a source told The Post. In 2024, Tamura had a second mental health contact. Both mental-health struggled ended up with him being held for 72 hours of observation, sources said. He also had two arrests on his record, including a 2012 trespassing charge in California and a charge in Nevada in 2023 for throwing a substance at a vehicle with intent to cause great bodily harm. In 2021, Tamura had a pair of high-value cash transactions at Nevada casinos, sources said, including spending $16,615 at the Coast Hotel and Casino and months later winning $12,860 at a casino affiliated with Hotspur Resorts Nevada Inc. Sources told The Post police found the prescription medication Sumatriptan, used for relieving migraine symptoms, in Tamura’s BMW, which he had double-parked outside 345 Park Ave. before waltzing into the building with his assault rifle. The gunman’s former high school teammate told The Post he never saw any indication Tamura was struggling with mental illness. He conceded, however, that people sometimes change over time. “You might know someone 9, 10, 12 years ago in general life and time can change a lot of things. I don’t know what happened. It could have been some sort of mental illness, some kind of stress, something could have happened, I really have no idea.” As for whether Tamura ever got banged up enough on the field to wind up with a CTE diagnosis — as has afflicted a number of high-profile NFL players — Roby said he couldn’t recall anything but an ankle injury that sidelined him for a single game. Asked whether he was good enough to have a chance to get drafted into the NFL one day, Roby said it was tough to say. “Did he have the ability to play at the college level? Definitely had that athletic ability. As far as the NFL, I don’t know. Being in the NFL, you’re talking about the 1% of the 1%. I don’t know if he had that type of skill set.” Additional reporting by Tina Moore Advertisement

The new feature will allow clients to buy and sell stocks around the clock—24 hours, seven days a week—in the form of ECR-20 tokens. eToro said that 24/5 trading of 100 of the most popular U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs will come first. "We are part of the largest transfer of wealth in human history, from older generations to younger generations—with the rise of retail investors," eToro CEO Yoni Assia said in a webinar announcing the new product. "[Younger, retail investors] are finding out about capital markets," he said, adding that a big part of the transfer of wealth will be via new technologies and a paradigm shift in financial systems. The announcement comes as eToro and other financial services firms have expanded their crypto-related services and amid growing interest in tokenization. The Israel-based firm has long been involved in tokenizing assets for its customers, introducing tokenized gold and silver after buying Danish token startup Firmo in 2019. In March, BlackRock, the world’s biggest fund manager, announced its first tokenized fund. Its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund runs on Ethereum, the blockchain behind the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, ETH. BlackRock CEO and one-time crypto skeptic Larry Fink has come around to the idea. Real-world assets have notched a combined $12.19 billion in total-value locked on decentralized platforms as digitizing traditional financial instruments becomes increasingly popular in Web3. Analysts are forecasting further gains in the market as investors flock to tokenized RWA products. Global investment firm VanEck has predicted RWAs will surpass $50 billion in market capitalization by the end of 2025. Ethereum is the dominant platform for tokenization. eToro was among the earliest firms to explore Bitcoin, acquiring its first BTC when the largest cryptocurrency by market value was selling for $5 (it subsequently sold these early holdings), and allowed trading of the asset in 2013. It added the same service for a range of other tokens. eToro was down more than 4% in Tuesday trading and is off nearly 10% year-to-date, according to Yahoo Finance. Ethereum was trading at $3,775, down the better part of a percentage point over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

Title: JPMorgan Chase Says ‘Significant Leap Forward’ Underway for Tokenized Money Market Funds Amid Goldman and BNY Partnership: Report

Analysts at the financial giant JPMorgan Chase think Goldman Sachs’ new partnership with BNY is a “significant leap forward” for tokenized money market funds, according to a new Bloomberg report. Goldman and BNY recently announced a joint venture to launch tokenized money market fund services using a blockchain developed by Goldman. BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Asset Management all plan to participate in the launch of the new service. Teresa Ho, a managing director at JPMorgan, tells Bloomberg the partnership could expand the use cases for money market funds. “The true takeaway from this is beyond the typical way we see money funds being used as a cash management asset class — they can now use it as collateral. Instead of posting cash, or posting Treasuries, you can post money-market shares and not lose interest along the way. It speaks to the versatility of money funds.” Ho also notes that numerous other financial firms see the potential benefit of tokenization amid blossoming regulatory clarity. “This is true across banks, asset managers, and payment processors. We wouldn’t be surprised to continue to see more developments with respect to stablecoins being more integrated with the traditional financial system, as well as more tokenization of real-world assets.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Authorities say shooter in New York City blamed NFL for brain injuries
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/29/authorities-say-shooter-in-new-york-city-blamed-nfl-for-brain-injuries
Time Published: 2025-07-29T19:03:06Z
Full Content:
The US football league has previously faced legal challenges over its failure to address players’ concussions. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has said that a gunman who killed five people, including himself, sought out the headquarters of the National Football League (NFL), which he blamed for the brain injuries he suffered from. Adams said on Tuesday that a note carried by the shooter, identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura, suggests his target was the NFL. “The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE [chronic traumatic encephalopathy], a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports,” Adams told CBS News. “He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury.” But Tamura appears to have arrived at the wrong floor of a New York City office tower and instead opened fire in the offices of a real estate firm, on top of shooting people in the ground-floor lobby. The NFL has previously faced litigation relating to concussions suffered by football players. The organisation, which oversees professional US football, has denied any link between conditions like CTE and its sport, but it has nevertheless paid out more than $1bn to settle concussion-related lawsuits. Monday’s shooting has also renewed debate about mass shootings and access to firearms in the US. Tamura reportedly entered the building with an AR-15-style rifle. The NFL’s headquarters are located in a skyscraper that it shares with other firms. Tamara is believed to have started shooting as he entered the lobby of the skyscraper. Then, police believe he took the wrong elevator, arriving at the 33rd floor, which contained the offices of Rudin Management, a real estate firm. There, he opened fire once more and then took his own life. Among those killed in the shooting was a 36-year-old police officer named Didarul Islam, who had come to the US from Bangladesh and had been on the force for three years. Other victims include security guard Aland Etienne, Julia Hyman of Rudin Management, and an executive at the BlackRock investment firm, Wesley LePatner. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell stated in a memo that there would be an “increased security presence” at the organisation’s offices over the coming weeks. Tamura is a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada, with a history of mental health issues. He never played in the NFL, but he did play football in high school. The news outlet Bloomberg reported that Tamura’s note alleges that his football career was cut short by a brain injury. The note also called for his brain to be studied. CTE can only be diagnosed through an autopsy. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: SEC filing starts countdown on BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF staking proposal

The SEC acknowledged a Nasdaq filing from July 16, prompting a 45-day period for response, extendable up to 90 days. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged on July 29 a Nasdaq proposal to amend BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) so the fund may stake the ETH it holds. Nasdaq’s filing would delete a prior representation that neither BlackRock nor the custodian would use any ETH held by the exchange-traded fund (ETF) to validate Ethereum’s proof‑of‑stake chain or earn income. The proposal would add a new “staking” section authorizing the stake some or all ETHA’s Ethereum directly or through one or more trusted staking providers, with any staking rewards payable to the ETF and potentially treated as income. Nasdaq filed on July 16 to add staking to BlackRock’s ETHA, seeking to add a detailed section that permits the staking directly or via trusted providers, treat rewards as income, and operate under the Corp Fin statement while securing tax clarity before launch. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart called the Nasdaq submission “about time,” noting the first final deadline for earlier filings arrives in October, while Nasdaq’s BlackRock filing carries an early‑April, 2026, deadline. Yet, he expects a decision sooner. In the competitive queue, Cboe has sought authority for Fidelity’s FETH, Franklin Templeton’s EZET, Invesco Galaxy’s QETH, and 21Shares’ CETH. At the same time, NYSE Arca is pursuing the same authorization for Bitwise’s ETHW, and Grayscale’s ETHE and its mini trust. The rush for authorization to allow staking in spot ETFs picked up the pace after the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance stated on May 29 that participants in standard protocol staking activities do not need to register those activities as securities transactions. The regulator statement includes self‑staking, delegated staking, custodial staking, and non‑custodial staking. Additionally, service features such as early withdrawals, slashing protection, or asset aggregation do not convert staking into a securities offering under federal law by themselves. Nasdaq argues that permitting ETHA to stake would better align the product with Ether‑holding returns, improve creation and redemption efficiency, and benefit end investors. The filing also describes staking’s role in supporting Ethereum’s validation process and compensating validators via block rewards. After publication in the Federal Register, the Commission has 45 days, extendable up to 90 days, to approve, disapprove, or institute proceedings on the proposal. The SEC has also invited public comments on the matter. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

CK Hutchison's $23 billion deal to sell its global port assets, including Panama Canal terminals, to a U.S.-led consortium has collapsed. Facing pressure from Beijing, CK Hutchison now seeks a major Chinese investor for the deal. This shift raises concerns in the U.S. about China's growing influence over a critical global trade route.

Title: Slog AM: Debora Juarez Back On Council,  Ann Davison Stabs Denny Blaine In The Back(side), Manhattan Gunman Likely Targeted NFL

I’m back from vacation: It was nice (thanks for asking). I’ve returned to better weather. Today, it’ll be sunny with a balmy high of 81. Temperatures will drop to the high 50s tonight before heating back up tomorrow. Expect a slight chance of rain Thursday into Thursday night. Friday should be a pleasant, partly cloudy day in the low- to mid-70s. Dead Heat: Katie Wilson and Bruce Harrell are statistically tied in the mayor’s race a week before the primary election. It’s a limited sample (651) with a 4.1 percent margin of error, but still, this race is not a cakewalk for Harrell. He’ll have to fight to break the curse of the one-term mayor. His campaign seems to be betting on making Wilson, a quite normal woman, out to be a society-restructuring radical (after all, Stalin also said Seattle pizza was too expensive). Those awkward TikToks might come in handy. Welcome Back? Debora Juarez is back in her old City Council seat for the next 16 months, replacing Cathy Moore after her resignation earlier this month. For recent transplants and the generally forgetful, Juarez used to be council president. Mexican American and a member of the Blackfeet Nation, Juarez was the first Indigenous person in that role. In a press release, Chief Seattle Club, Seattle Indian Health Board, Seattle Indian Services Commission, and United Indians of All Tribes Foundation celebrated her appointment. “Debora Juarez has long embodied the power, resilience, and vision of Indigenous leadership,” the release read. While charmingly foul-mouthed, Juarez is a conservative who fits right into the current brat pack. She’s also known for being somewhat unpredictable. It’s interesting that she applied for the vacancy—she made clear that she was tired of the job when she decided not to run for reelection in 2023—but since throwing her hat into the ring, her appointment has been expected. Juarez received 7 votes. Alexis Mercedes Rinck voted for Nilu Jenks, a former candidate for District 5. Ferg Down: Washington voters think Governor Bob Ferguson sucks. A Monday Cascade PBS/Elway poll found his approval rating at the sixth month mark is the lowest for a Washington Governor since 1993. Of the 403 registered voters surveyed, 32 percent consider Ferguson to be doing a “good” or “excellent” job. That’s eight points lower than Gov. Inslee, 11 points below Christine Gregoire, and 20 points below Gary Locke at the same point in their first terms. Almost the same percentage of people (31 percent) think he’s doing a “poor” job; 22 percent rated his job performance as “fair.” Damn, dude. According to Cascade, people are angry that Ferguson is signing off on new taxes, that he’s cut spending, that he’s too focused on President Donald Trump’s administration, that he’s not focused enough on Trump, that he’s too in line with Democrats, and that he’s too moderate. You can’t please everyone all of the time, but Ferguson’s middling centerism seems to please nobody. Now to HMW for the latest on Denny Blaine. Thanks For Nothing: The City submitted its “abatement plan” for Denny Blaine Park on Monday evening. No one is thrilled about its idea to divide the already small beach into a nude area (closest to the water) and a clothed area (the vast majority of the park). “Zoning” Denny Blaine isn’t a new idea. Last year, the Parks Department proposed a nudity DMZ at the parking lot—much further back than the current abatement plan. When it was submitted for public comment, beach goers roundly rejected it because they felt it made a concession to neighbors they didn’t have to make. (This is where we remind you, dear reader, for the hundredth time, that nudity is legal in Seattle.) The city is also planning to increase the presence of park rangers and signage to the park. Sophie Amity Debs, who co-runs the park stewardship group Friends of Denny Blaine, told The Stranger that by cutting the space down to a tiny sliver of the park, the city is “not setting themselves up for success with having people respect and take these guidelines seriously.” This proposal isn’t the worst case scenario. “We are glad that it doesn't just outright ban nudity, because that was one of our big fears … and we are also glad that the enforcement mechanisms are via park rangers and not by SPD.” Back to me :)! Firefighters Saving a Rainforest: The human-caused Bear Gulch fire (first reported July 6, wonder how that started?) is creeping toward the Staircase area of Olympic National Park. The 1,100 acre fire is only 10 percent contained, the Seattle Times reports. Two hundred people, including firefighters, are assigned to this fire. Big Beautiful Electric Bills? Lawmakers say the cuts to renewable energy in President Donald Trump's Beautiful Bill will raise the price of electricity in Washington. As it turns out, massive public infrastructure projects are not optional or spontaneous. They’re important and planned decades in advance. Cities are growing, transmission lines are aging, and AI data centers are siphoning off our excess power to animate photos of dead grandparents at a time heatwaves are more likely to hit California and Washington simultaneously. We can’t just pause this work, cross our fingers and hope the power stays on. We’ll still have to pay for repairs, new energy projects, and extra power with our money. Seattle City Light CEO Dawn Lindell says people “can expect to see significant rate increases for probably the next 10 to 12 years.” The US Department of Energy did not respond to KUOW’s request for comment. Suspect Arrested For Shooting Lummi Nation Officer: Authorities arrested the 26-year-old suspect and Whatcom county resident for investigation of attempted murder yesterday afternoon. Early Monday morning, the officer responded to a call for a vehicle in a ditch in Lummi Nation west of Bellingham. The driver shot the officer and fled on foot. It’s unclear where and how the suspect was apprehended, but multiple law enforcement agencies were involved in the search. The officer was rushed into surgery. As of Monday afternoon, the officer was alive and receiving medical care. Northgate Shooter: Police say they're still searching for two suspects they say shot a man in the back of the head outside the Northgate Transit Center on Monday morning. The victim, 48, was in critical condition as of Monday afternoon. Over 60,000 Killed in Gaza Since October 7: Gaza’s ministry of health puts the total at 60,034. At least 62 have been killed since dawn, reports Al Jazeera, 19 of them aid seekers. Yesterday, two of the most-known Israeli rights groups (B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights —Israel) called the genocide a genocide for the first time. This morning, the UK announced that it would recognize a Palestinian state if Israel doesn't reach a ceasefire with Hamas by September. Shooter Killed Four in Midtown Manhattan: After much unverified online speculation that gunman Shane Tamura had targeted the investment company Blackstone, police say the three-page note found in his wallet indicates Tamura had likely targeted NFL headquarters. Police say Tamura claimed he suffered from CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, from playing football and accused the NFL of concealing the danger to players. Tamura shot himself in the chest. “Study my brain please,” police say he wrote. “I’m sorry.” CTE is a serious condition that increases the risk of suicide. It can only be diagnosed in an autopsy. One study of 2,000 former NFL players published in JAMA Neurology found 1 in 3 believed they had CTE. FIGHT! Paul Dans, a chief architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, is challenging Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican party’s most eligible bachelor. Dans, who looks like something bad happened to Mark Cuban (the Portrait of Mark Cuban?), is expected to formally announce his campaign in Charleston this Wednesday. Chris LaCivita, advisor to Sen. Graham’s campaign and co-manager of Trump’s presidential bid, ominously told the AP that Dans’ campaign would “end prematurely.” Thanks, Chris. Strange and threatening! Not Even Capitalism Safe From ICE Raids: The New York Times reports that work has slowed to a crawl at one Omaha, Nebraska meatpacking plant. Three weeks after ICE came to Glenn Valley Foods with a battering ram and a warrant for 107 workers, production is down by 70%. Half of the maintenance crew is being deported. About 50 workers are in ICE detention. Owner Gary Rohwer told the Times it was a “wipeout.” We don’t need the lens of capitalism to grasp the injustice of ICE abductions, but the bottom line is often the only thing that reaches Americans. *SCREECH*: Two whistleblowers have accused Emil Bove, former defense attorney for President Donald Trump, current top official at the Justice Department, and nominee for the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, of directing Justice Department staff to ignore federal court orders in the way of Trump’s mass deportation plans. A third says he lied to Senators during his confirmation hearing last month. The Senate is expected to vote on his appointment this week. A Tune for You: Thanks, MJ Lenderman. I love to do dishes to your music. Editor's Note: A previous version of this article said that people had speculated that the shooter in Manhattan had targeted Blackrock in the Midtown building. The building is home to the Blackstone offices. Vivian McCall is a staff writer for The Stranger covering queer culture and politics in Seattle and beyond.

Title: This Week In Bitcoin: 4 Things To Keep An Eye On That Could Impact Price
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/this-week-in-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T16:30:07Z
Full Content:
As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade in a volatile yet increasingly bullish market, a crypto analyst points to key developments that could drive a breakout past $130,000. From macroeconomic shifts to major technical breakouts and unexpected geopolitical tailwinds, the analyst outlines four critical factors to watch this week that could significantly impact BTC’s price action. On July 27, crypto analyst Doctor Profit posted a detailed macro report on X social media, highlighting Bitcoin and certain bullish events unfolding around it. Before addressing the latest US trade developments, the market expert noted that Bitcoin recently pulled off a major technical move that went largely unnoticed by the market. After facing four consecutive months of rejection from November 2024 to February 2025, BTC finally broke through a long-term diagonal resistance tied to its 2021 all-time high. It then retested the level as support and followed through with a strong bullish move. On the macro front, Doctor Pillows suggested that a significant shift in the global trade policy could fuel Bitcoin’s continued upward momentum. He highlighted President Donald Trump’s announcement of a landmark trade agreement between the US and European Union, easing fears of a potential tariff war. The analyst described this deal as one of the most bullish trade agreements since 2016, noting that markets are likely to respond positively to the reduced geopolitical risks. With stocks set to open higher and economic friction easing between two of the world’s largest economies, Bitcoin also stands to benefit from the improved macro environment. Earlier this week, Bitcoin saw a brief drop to $114,500 after wallet activity from Galaxy Digital sparked concerns of a potential selloff. However, according to Doctor Profit, those fears quickly faded as spot ETF inflows continued to outpace Bitcoin’s daily issuance. Institutions like BlackRock are also steadily absorbing supply, reinforcing strong underlying demand. Most importantly, the analyst highlighted that many long-term whale wallets remain inactive, indicating that the broader accumulation trend is still intact. Rather than signaling weakness, Doctor Profit suggests that the recent price dip appeared to have been a temporary shakeout that highlights the strength of the ongoing bull market. In his report, Doctor Profit stated that Bitcoin’s real macro engine is emerging from M2 Money Supply growth. Despite ongoing narratives around quantitative tightening, the analyst highlights that M2 has risen by 2.3% in 2025 so far, including a sharp 0.63% spike between May and June— the largest monthly increase this year. Historically, Bitcoin has closely followed M2 expansion, as seen during the 2020 liquidity surge that fueled an 800% rally. While exact outcomes vary, Doctor Profit suggests that the current pace of growth points to a potential 15-17.5% BTC rally to above $130,000 in the coming weeks, based on the cryptocurrency’s typical 60-90 day lag in reacting to monetary expansion. As his final bullish point, Doctor Profit mentioned the next FOMC meeting on Wednesday. While the official stance remains “hawkish,” with only a 5% chance of a rate cut, the analyst noted that the Federal Reserve (FED) has been quietly expanding liquidity and printing. This growing disconnect between Chair Jerome Powell’s rhetoric and the FED’s actual monetary actions is noteworthy. It suggests that the FED may already be laying the groundwork for the next round of quantitative easing. Given Bitcoin’s historical sensitivity to monetary policy shifts, the cryptocurrency may be well-positioned to rally significantly once the pivot becomes more apparent.

The Minnesota-based Ethereum treasury firm, which began the month holding 198,200 ETH, now controls 438,200 ETH, an 121% increase in four weeks, according to a press release. Based on recent prices, that stockpile was worth $1.4 billion on Tuesday, the second largest among corporate Ethereum treasuries. SharpLink aims to increase shareholder value by boosting the amount of Ethereum it owns per fully diluted share. The company consistently issued common stock as a way to fund purchases in July, in addition to raising cash through a private placement last month. Last week, SharpLink said it purchased 77,200 Ethereum, “maintaining its aggressive acquisition pace.” In July, SharpLink gained $852 million from issuing nearly 45 million common shares, capturing a premium that its stock trades at relative to its crypto holdings, mirroring elements of Strategy’s Bitcoin-buying playbook. SharpLink said that the Ethereum it holds per 1,000 assumed diluted shares issued and outstanding, a metric dubbed “ETH Concentration,” increased to 3.4, as of Sunday, from 2.29 three weeks prior. Leveraging Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus model, the company said that it has generated 722 Ethereum worth $2.8 million since it pivoted away from sports gambling marketing. Nearly all the Ethereum SharpLink owns has been devoted to staking protocols, allowing the company to earn rewards by helping validate Ethereum transactions. Ethereum’s price rose above $3,900 on Monday before retreating, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Although the asset’s price has increased 60% over the past month, momentum has cooled over the past week, with the asset around 21% away from its pandemic-era high of $4,900. SharpLink shares have tumbled 31% over the past week to $18.82 as Ethereum’s price has lost momentum; however, the stock is still up 100% over the past month, according to Yahoo Finance. In May, SharpLink’s stock price soared to $124 before plummeting on profit-taking among investors that participated in the company’s private placement. Ethereum software giant Consensys, known for its MetaMask digital wallet, said on Monday that SharpLink would be among firms stewarding the token for its Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Linea. The group, called the Linea Consortium, will help oversee 75% of its eventual supply. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) That means SharpLink, which is chaired by Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, will help distribute tokens to grow the layer-2 network, alongside other members. SharpLink gaming is the second largest holder of Ethereum to join the Strategic Ethereum Reserve, a group of Ethereum-aligned entities. BitMine Immersion, which has pivoted its focus from Bitcoin mining, owns around 625,000 Ethereum, a sum worth roughly $2.4 billion. In July, SharpLink made other notable acquisitions, besides massive amounts of Ethereum. That included a former digital assets executive at BlackRock, Joseph Chalom, who was appointed co-CEO of SharpLink last week.

Title: The untapped potential AI can't replace in underserved communities like mine

Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks says the 'honest work' learned through trade schools could be the key out of poverty for many struggling in today's job market wanting to 'improve their lives.' The crime of post-60s liberalism is that it created permanent Black underclasses all over America, including on the South Side of Chicago where I live. The schools here are poor. Opportunities have been replaced by government handouts. Violence robs far too many families of their loved ones. Yet, there is much untapped potential in these underclasses. I thought about them as I listened to Mike Rowe of "Dirty Jobs" detail the need for hundreds of thousands of tradesmen and women recently at the Pennsylvania Energy & Innovation Summit. He began by saying, "We’ve been telling kids for 15 years to learn to code." I, too, have been told to pursue that as a means of opportunity for my youth. But I always believed in the power of the trades. Rowe pointed out how the advent of AI has decimated many coding jobs but has not come after "the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipefitters, the HVAC, or the electricians." AI cannot do manual labor. MIKE ROWE REVEALS WHICH AMERICAN JOBS WILL REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY THE COMING AI REVOLUTION For the last 20 or so, our nation has emphasized the college degree above everything, including vocational training. In my opinion, this has been disastrous. In my community, there are still those who look down at the prospect of working with their hands. They believe the college degree is their ticket. Maybe it is, but my point here is that work done by our hands should not be looked down upon in our culture. It’s honest work. Rowe said that he heard Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, say in Aspen that "we need 500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." My non-profit has provided training in the electrician field to many individuals, including a Chicago Police officer who eventually left the force to work full time in her new field. He said the over 80,000 collision repair technicians would be needed. Over 140,000 tradespeople are needed to help companies build and deliver nuclear-powered submarines to the Navy. And for the energy field, 300,000 to 500,000 people will be needed. AI can’t do any of this work. But I know people from the South Side and similar neighborhoods across America who can. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION We need to train these people and put them to work. They may be living in poverty and they may not have received the best education. But many of them are hungry to improve their lives. That is why our nation must reverse the decline of post-60s liberalism by giving these people direct pathways to opportunity. If one should fail or act detrimentally, then dismiss that person and let him or her be an example to others of what happens when one doesn’t fully commit.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun HONG KONG/NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) – The proposed inclusion of Chinese shipping giant COSCO in Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison’s contentious global ports sale is a potential win for Beijing in a strategic sector, but the deal is far from final and could face resistance from Washington, sources and analysts say. Since the deal was announced on March 4 to sell 43 of CK Hutchison’s ports in 23 countries, including two along the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by U.S. firm BlackRock, BLK.N and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run shipping company MSC, it has sparked a firestorm of criticism from China. While the U.S. government might oppose the inclusion of state-run COSCO over perceived geopolitical risks posed by Chinese influence, bringing in the shipping giant could provide a more level playing field rather than one company being dominant, said a person with knowledge of the deal. The complex deal would require approval from around 50 jurisdictions involved, and it would take at least two years for the process to be completed, sources and analysts said. There was no immediate response from the White House, COSCO and CK Hutchison to Reuters’ requests for comment. At a time of festering global trade tensions between China and the U.S., the deal showcases the growing rivalry between both sides for maritime influence in the strategic commercial shipping sector that has been dominated by China in recent decades. U.S. President Donald Trump had earlier called for the removal of Chinese ownership in the Panama Canal – now used for more than 40% of U.S. container traffic valued at $270 billion annually. Following months of pressure from Beijing, including Chinese state media lambasting the move as a betrayal, and various Chinese government departments saying they would conduct a legal review, CK Hutchison announced on July 28 that a Chinese investor was being courted. It also said changes to the composition of the consortium and structure of the transaction would be necessary to secure regulatory approval. Two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the investor was COSCO 1199.HK – a shipping and ports conglomerate that is now one of the world’s dominant, vertically integrated marine transportation firms. While any stake by COSCO is not yet clear, a triparty agreement with BlackRock and MSC would alleviate China’s national security concerns and have its blessing, the sources said. “The potential acquisition of Hutchison Ports is driven by the strategic need to secure key port resources amid global competition and U.S.-China tensions,” JPMorgan wrote in a research report. The report also noted that while the inclusion of COSCO would “relieve some concerns by the Chinese government, thus boosting the likelihood of a green-light scenario”, not all ports in the original agreement might be included. COSCO is requesting a bigger stake while the other parties in the consortium are keen to keep it a minority, the sources said. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters on Monday in response to a question on the deal that Beijing “will conduct lawful regulation, firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and uphold justice and fairness in the market.” ‘STRIP CHINESE CONTROL’ A deal involving COSCO would be a “loud reaffirmation of China’s geopolitical influence across the global maritime trade and transport sector, and of its effective leverage in trade negotiations with the U.S.,” Isaac Kardon, Senior Fellow for China Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Reuters. “Beijing’s disapproval clearly forced Hutchison to back off and change tack — and not merely in the optics of the transaction, but in its basic structure and national ownership.” Should the deal proceed, it would be a crucial off-ramp for CK Hutchison, with the Americans wary of COSCO’s growing maritime heft that could undermine U.S. national security. There could also be further blowback amid ongoing and complex bilateral trade talks. Some analysts say the Panama ports, in particular, will be a focus for the Trump administration, and could be taken out of the transaction to meet U.S. strategic interests. “The inclusion of this behemoth Chinese central state-owned enterprise as an owner seems like it should be a non-starter for the Trump administration seeking to strip Chinese control and restore some kind of American suzerainty over the Canal Zone,” added Kardon. The CK Hutchison assets up for sale span the globe, including ports in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Barcelona in Spain, Felixstowe in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Poland and the Bahamas – enlarging Beijing’s global shipping networks and options at a time of great trade and tariff uncertainties. “At the moment they (Beijing) are in a place generally where they want to assert themselves and say, hey, don’t mess with us,” said Andrew Cainey, a senior associate fellow with the defence and security thinktank RUSI (Royal United Services Institute) in London. “If the U.S. were to come back and object to it, China could try to block the deal or demand more (from CK Hutchison).” (Reporting by James Pomfret, Clare Jim and Anne Marie Roantree in Hong Kong, Davide Barbuscia in New York, Ryan Woo in Beijing; Editing by Saad Sayeed) Sign up for gCaptain’s newsletter and never miss an update Essential maritime and offshore news, insights, and updates delivered daily straight to your inbox Dive into a sea of curated content with our weekly ‘Dispatch’ email.

Title: China may gain greater control of Panama Canal after BlackRock deal misses deadline

Fox News contributor Michael Pillsbury joins 'Fox & Friends First' to weigh in on President Donald Trump's trade negotiations with China as they continue to threaten their invasion of Taiwan. China may soon gain greater influence over the Panama Canal following the collapse of a proposed deal between U.S.-based BlackRock and Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison, which had initially sparked tensions with Beijing. The original agreement would have transferred control of dozens of international ports — including two in Panama — to a consortium involving BlackRock. The deal was reportedly welcomed by former President Donald Trump, who voiced support for reducing Chinese influence over the canal and even floated the idea of the U.S. "taking back" the strategic waterway. However, Beijing pushed back. China advocated for state-owned shipping giant Cosco to be included in the transaction, signaling its desire for a direct stake, not just an indirect one through the Hong Kong-based Hutchison, in the canal’s operations. Amid mounting pressure from China and the threat of an anti-monopoly investigation, CK Hutchison announced Monday that the exclusive negotiation window with BlackRock had expired. However, the company also signaled its openness to reconfiguring the deal. CHINA, HONG KONG THREATEN TO THWART SALE OF PANAMA CANAL PORTS TO AMERICA'S BLACKROCK It said it would "remain open to discussions with a view to inviting a major strategic investor from the [People’s Republic of China] to join as a significant member of the consortium." According to the company, changes in deal structure and participant makeup are necessary to gain approval from "all relevant authorities." An aerial view shows cargo vessels docked at Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, on the Panama Canal in Panama City on Feb. 1, 2025. (REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo) The original $23 billion deal involved transferring ownership of 43 ports across 23 countries — including the two critical Panamanian ports located at either end of the canal in Balboa and Cristobal. CK Hutchison has operated both since 1997. The firm is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s wealthiest man, Li Ka-shing. China’s growing footprint in Latin American infrastructure has long raised bipartisan alarms in Washington. However, Trump stands out as the first modern U.S. president to suggest reclaiming the Panama Canal, which the U.S. completed in 1914 and handed over to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 during the Carter administration. CHINA’S BILLION-DOLLAR FOOTPRINT NEAR FLORIDA COAST POSES US NATIONAL SECURITY RISK, EXPERT WARNS "China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn’t give it to China — we gave it to Panama — and we’re taking it back," Trump recently declared. One analyst believes China may ultimately be excluded from the Panama port holdings while gaining control of most other assets in the larger deal. "China will insist this be the quid pro quo: that the other global ports have Cosco participation. And obviously, Cosco is already a major global port holder," said Dane Chamorro, head of Global Risk Analysis at consulting firm Control Risks, in an interview with Fox News Digital.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix, File) The family of Hong Kong billionaire tycoon Li Ka-shing owns CK Hutchison. (REUTERS/Bobby Yip) "From a U.S. perspective, they might say, ‘Okay, great—we got Hutchison, or China (since they tend to refer to them interchangeably), out of the two Panama ports.’ But in the long run, that may result in even more ports globally ending up in the hands of a Chinese state-owned entity." If that happens, Cosco — through this broader consolidation — would become "far and away the dominant port owner and operator globally," Chamorro said. "That aligns with the fact that China is the world’s largest trading economy, the largest manufacturing economy, and the largest shipbuilder." Chamorro also noted that U.S. companies do not operate on the same global scale in the port industry as Chinese, Hong Kong or Singaporean firms. The failed Hutchison-BlackRock deal underscores the precarious position of Hong Kong businesses under growing pressure from Beijing to prioritize national loyalty — even when it threatens ties with Western partners.

Title: Man in 70s sent forward for trial accused of historical sex offences

Time Published: 2025-07-29T11:25:34Z
Full Content:
A man in his 70s accused of historical sex abuse offences has been served with a book of evidence and sent forward for trial to the Central Criminal Court. The man, who cannot be named due to the nature of the charges, faces 79 allegations relating to the sexual abuse of four girls in Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s. Judge Michele Finan at Dublin District Court granted a return for trial order at the request of State solicitor Rory Staines. He told the court that the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) consented to being sent forward on indictment on the 79 charges in the book of evidence served by Garda Sergeant Amy Kelly. They include 78 counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted rape. The offences allegedly occurred at various locations in Co Dublin, including Dún Laoghaire, Killiney, and Blackrock, between 1971 and 1981. At the time, the girls were minors aged between eight and 15. Judge Finan notified the man that he must inform the prosecution within 14 days if he intends to use an alibi in his trial. She also ordered investigating gardaí to provide copies of interview videos to the defence and told the accused that his lawyer would explain it to him later. The man, who has not yet entered a plea, was remanded in continuing custody pending trial with no bail application made. Legal aid has been granted, with the defence stating that he is not working and has no assets. The judge noted that there was no Garda objection, and she agreed to a request by his solicitor, Tracy Horan, that it would include senior and junior counsel representation. The date for his next hearing before the Central Criminal Court has yet to be set but will be held the next legal term, commencing in October. Dressed in a grey tracksuit and black runners, the man sat silently in a wheelchair and spoke only to consult his solicitor, who asked that he get dental attention in custody because he still had no dentures and “is not able to eat solid foods”. He was arrested at Terminal 2, Dublin Airport on the morning of July 22nd. Gardaí charged him at the instruction of the DPP. He faces 41 counts of indecent assault and one for attempted rape of one of the complainants, 34 counts of indecent assault of another female, two counts of indecent assault of another complainant, and one charge of indecent assault of the fourth. The offences are contrary to Common Law. At his first hearing, a few hours after his arrest, the defence solicitor had informed the judge that her client required medical assistance in custody because he had no dentures or hearing aid. The judge had noted this information and agreed to add that he should urgently get dentures and a hearing aid in custody. When the proceedings resumed on Tuesday, she heard that the man still had no dentures and recommended that he get the appropriate treatment.

Title: 21 states warn JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, BlackRock’s Larry Fink to scrap ‘woke’ environmental goals
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/29/business/21-states-warn-jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-blackrocks-larry-fink-to-scrap-woke-environmental-goals/

Nearly two dozen states on Tuesday warned CEOs of the nation’s largest financial firms – including BlackRock’s Larry Fink and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon – to scrap “woke investing” programs focused on environmental goals if they want to continue doing business in their states. Letters signed by 26 state financial officers hit the desks of top bosses at BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Investments, State Street and Vanguard. State officials ordered these firms to take five concrete actions to demonstrate their “commitment to a fiduciary model grounded in financial integrity, not political advocacy.” Among these steps is a commitment to abstain from “international political agendas” like net-zero climate mandates or the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Directive, which requires companies to regularly publish reports on the environmental and social risks they face. In the letters, leaders of red states slammed the erosion of “traditional fiduciary duty” in favor of ESG investing, or the environmental, social and governance goals of financial firms. “While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” officials said in a copy of the letter obtained by The Post. “Our responsibility is to ensure public assets are managed in the best financial interest of beneficiaries and taxpayers. We expect detailed evidence that your firm’s investment practices, proxy voting and corporate engagement behavior…align with traditional fiduciary standards.” Officials from 21 states – including Alabama, Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Utah – demanded that CEOs respond to the letter’s demands by September 1. Some states have more than one official represented on the letters. The letters come after Texas last month removed BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, from its blacklist. For nearly three years, BlackRock was banned from doing business with Texas state pension and investment funds, which hold an estimated $50 billion in assets, over its climate policies. BlackRock earlier this year rolled back some of its environmental goals, exiting the Climate Action 100+ investor group and withdrawing from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The company, however, is still engaging in some practices that seek to restrict fossil fuel output, according to a report from the American Energy Institute and Consumers’ Research, a conservative nonprofit. While Texas may have let up the pressure on BlackRock, these 21 states are doubling down on calls for financial firms to eradicate ESG goals. “Requiring America’s financial giants to prove their independence from woke ideology with concrete steps before doing business with a state’s dollars is fully necessary and just makes sense,” OJ Oleka, CEO of State Financial Officers Foundation, said in a statement. “For too long, firms like BlackRock have followed the ESG gospel to the legal breaking point of violating their traditional fiduciary duty and putting Americans’ retirement savings at risk.” Advertisement

Title: Abaxx to Pilot Digital Title Framework for Tokenized-USD Money Market Funds, Targeting Legal Finality and Identity Gaps in Real-Time Collateral

July 29, 2025 07:00 ET | Source: Abaxx Technologies Inc. Abaxx Technologies Inc. TORONTO, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abaxx Technologies Inc. (CBOE:ABXX)(OTCQX:ABXXF) (“Abaxx” or the “Company”), a financial software and market infrastructure company, majority shareholder of Abaxx Singapore Pte Ltd., the owner of Abaxx Commodity Exchange and Clearinghouse (individually, “Abaxx Exchange” and “Abaxx Clearing”), and producer of the SmarterMarkets™ Podcast, today announces the completion of a pre-feasibility study on the use of tokenized money market funds (MMFs) as financial collateral using Abaxx’s proprietary ID++ and Private Digital Title technologies. Building on its Q4 2025 gold-backed collateral pilot, the Company is now advancing discussions with institutional partners to conduct a second pilot transaction in Q4 2025. This next phase will test how tokenized MMF shares — when paired with Abaxx’s legal and identity infrastructure — can serve as legally enforceable, real-time collateral in regulated markets. The results will inform a full feasibility study and lay the foundation for the Abaxx USD Trust Network, as further detailed below. Key Features of the Second Pilot “The race to tokenize MMFs and the growth of stablecoins have rightly focused on efficiency gains, but they often sidestep the most critical challenge: the legal certainty required by regulated holders,” said Josh Crumb, Founder and CEO of Abaxx. “The ability to reduce settlement risk in atomic Delivery-Versus-Payment (“DvP”) transactions and unlock capital trapped in legacy T+1 cycles is transformative, but those benefits are an illusion without a trusted identity layer and enforceable title. The Abaxx Private Digital Title framework is architected to solve this by embedding identity and legal clarity directly into the asset — creating a truly native digital instrument with the integrity required to serve as high-quality collateral in institutional markets. This pilot is the next step in our mission to build smarter markets.” A New Framework for Digital Collateral Abaxx’s vision is to re-engineer the relationship between financial assets and risk management in global markets. To support this transformation, the Company has developed multi-layered market infrastructure designed to connect tokenized and traditional assets to collateral workflows — anchored by Abaxx’s regulated market infrastructure and proprietary ID++ Technology and suite of console applications, including Verifier+, Abaxx Messenger, Abaxx Sign, and Abaxx Drive. This integrated infrastructure addresses two persistent barriers to real-time finance: limited collateral mobility and the high cost of managing counterparty and legal risk across borders — the default condition when transacting in global commodity markets. Abaxx’s Private Digital Title system embeds legal ownership and verifiable identity directly into the asset through digitally-issued documents of title, offering an enforceable alternative to tokenization models that rely on centralized issuance, new legal constructs, or shared ledgers treated only as mirrors of off-chain records. These architectural decisions are designed to reduce legal and operational friction, shorten onboarding timelines, and support more flexible use of real-world assets as collateral, without compromising regulatory compliance or transaction confidentiality. This approach directly addresses the challenges highlighted by the Futures Industry Association (“FIA”) which notes the cleared derivatives industry is at an “inflection point” in adopting tokenization to accelerate collateral mobility. As the FIA’s recent whitepaper underscores, achieving real impact requires solutions that solve for legal finality and regulatory interoperability², goals that the Abaxx USD Trust Network is designed to meet through a privacy-preserving, real-time cryptographic legal agreement registry. “BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently called the tokenization of stocks and bonds the future of markets³ — and he’s right. But that future depends on solving two core challenges: identity authenticity and legal certainty,” said Ian Forester, Head of Product at Abaxx. “Trends in digital assets tend to focus on building the next ledger, but the core challenge of tokenization isn’t ledger integrity, it’s liquidity. By perfecting legal claims within the asset itself, our Private Title framework allows for the creation of a composable ‘real time USD’ asset secured by tamper-proof, identity-based signatures that are agnostic to the underlying ledger. This approach not only preserves the rights of parties to transact in private, it builds liquidity through trust that is backed by the rule of law.” About the Pilot and Feasibility Study The planned Q4 2025 pilot for the Abaxx USD Trust Network will test the full lifecycle of a tokenized MMF share, with the objective of demonstrating atomic settlement and establishing unequivocal legal finality. The pilot will exclusively use MMFs that are compliant with SEC Rule 2a-7, target a stable $1.00 value per unit, and invest in high-quality assets like U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. Findings of the pilot will inform a full feasibility study and may deliver a comprehensive legal and operational package for regulators and asset management partners, subject to regulatory approvals and compliance requirements. ¹ “Collateral supply, demand and mobility,” Securities Finance Times, June 5, 2024.² “Accelerating the velocity of collateral: The potential for tokenisation in cleared derivatives markets,” Futures Industry Association, June 2025.³ “Tokenization of the market, from stocks to bonds to real estate is coming, says BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, if we can solve one problem,” CNBC, April 12, 2025.

Title: Inside Robinhood’s Crypto-Fueled Plan For World Domination

ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Crypto financiers might seem unlikely guests at the Château de la Croix des Gardes, a 25-acre Belle Époque villa commanding the Bay of Cannes from its hillside perch. Yet on a sun-drenched June afternoon, Robinhood commandeered the storied estate, famous for its star turn in Alfred Hitchcock’s To Catch a Thief, for “To Catch a Token”—a crypto field day conceived by longtime Côte d’Azur resident Johann Kerbrat, the firm’s head of crypto. The spectacle opened with a cinematic flourish: a video of Robinhood cofounder and CEO Vlad Tenev driving a midnight-blue 1962 Jaguar E-Type convertible along the corniche, an homage to Cary Grant’s entrance in Hitchcock’s film. When the reel faded, Tenev stepped out in real time—decked out in a pinstriped white Tom Ford suit, black-and-white ascot, green attaché case in hand—to greet an invitation-only crowd of more than 300 that included Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and top brass from financial heavyweights JPMorgan, Mastercard and Stripe. The theatrics are warranted. Robinhood’s stock is trading at $111 a share, an all-time high 384% above last year’s levels, vaulting the brokerage firm’s market cap to nearly $98 billion and into the ranks of the world’s 250 most valuable companies. In 2024, it generated $1.4 billion in profit on nearly $3 billion in revenue and now holds $255 billion in assets, expanding at a 44% net deposit growth rate over the past year. In terms of active or funded accounts, Robinhood, with 26 million, is rapidly gaining share on Schwab, with 37 million, is three times larger than Morgan Stanley’s E-Trade and six times larger than Merrill Lynch. Tenev’s personal fortune has jumped sixfold in a year to $6.1 billion. The 38-year-old chief executive operates in perpetual motion. In late May, he is in Las Vegas, preaching to 35,000 bitcoiners about how crypto will further disrupt global finance through tokenization—the process of converting assets like stocks, bonds and real estate into digital tokens that can be traded 24/7 on blockchain networks. From there, he bounces to Tampa for a conference for registered investment advisors, and a few weeks later he’s in Robinhood’s posh Manhattan offices for its annual shareholder address. “It’s New York this week, then France, then the U.K.,” he rattles off before listing more than a dozen Robinhood offices across America, Europe and Asia. “I have to visit each one at least once a year, and they just keep multiplying.” Despite his boyish looks, including a hair bob and goatee reminiscent of Errol Flynn’s 1938 Robin Hood, Tenev these days sounds very much like the seasoned chief executive of a giant financial conglomerate. The upstart brokerage that blossomed from the ashes of the global financial crisis and Occupy Wall Street movement has grown up. It wants to be a one-stop financial firm for tech-native generations who prefer transacting digitally. Within the next 20 years, accor­ding to Cerulli Associates, they are expected to receive some $124 trillion in assets, mostly from their Boomer parents. The get-together at the Château marks Robinhood’s first-ever international and crypto-focused event, dense with announcements. Starting in July, Robinhood is allowing European users to trade blockchain-based “stock tokens,” nonvoting derivatives that track hundreds of U.S. stocks and ETFs, including privately owned tech juggernauts SpaceX and OpenAI. The trading will be commission-free, 24 hours a day, five days a week. For U.S. customers, crypto staking—the practice of locking digital assets to blockchain networks like Ethereum or Solana to earn income—will finally be permitted. Robinhood’s June acquisition of Luxembourg-based crypto exchange Bitstamp for $200 million will unlock perpetual futures with no expiration on bitcoin and ether for continental customers. To underpin it all, Robinhood is building its own blockchain. “We as an industry find ourselves at an important preci­pice,” Tenev told the VIPs fanning away the Riviera heat. “We have a chance to prove to the world what we’ve believed all along, that crypto is much more than a speculative asset. It has the potential to become the backbone of the global financial system. We are hoping to turn that from a possibility to an inevitability.” To understand the coup Tenev is planning, it helps to revisit Robinhood’s turbulent past. In 2013, Tenev and his cofounder, Baiju Bhatt, two Stanford physics and math grads, saw a world ripe for disruption. After college, the two developed software for giant hedge funds whose high-frequency trading dominated Wall Street. It was a front row seat to these funds’ nearly insatiable appetite for trading volume, which they were willing to pay for. Retail investors who were accustomed to paying commissions of, say, $10 or $25 per trade at brokerage firms like Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Merrill Lynch could be a great source of this volume. Tenev and Bhatt built a fun and easy-to-use mobile trading app for novice tra­ders that eliminated account mini­mums and commissions because they knew hedge funds would pay them to execute their customers’ trades. They then marketed their zero-commission platform under the slogan of democratizing investing and rolled it out with the fanfare of a new blockbuster video game. Before Robinhood even launched, its Apple app store waitlist swelled to nearly 1 million people. By September 2019, the incumbents—Charles Schwab, E-Trade, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade (acquired by Schwab in 2020) —eliminated their fees, cementing the upstart’s approach as the new industry standard. The triumph, however, didn’t last long. In early 2021, after trading on the app exploded thanks in part to pandemic lockdowns and millions of stimulus checks, Robin­hood became the focus of a regulatory firestorm during the GameStop meme-stock trading frenzy. Spurred by the Reddit community WallStreetBets, GameStop’s stock price soared dramatically—seemingly without regard to the dismal underlying financials. This unprecedented volatility triggered a massive collateral demand from Robinhood’s clearinghouse, forcing Tenev to halt purchases of the stock on the platform. Cue user fury, Main Street vilification and congressional grillings, including questions over the suicide of a young Robinhood options trader. But rather than retreat, the GameStop trading debacle—which exposed how outdated, opaque and slow U.S. stock trading is—crystallized an idea Tenev had been mulling. “Could we actually put stocks on blockchains?” he says. “My belief was that the value would be in taking stocks 24/7.” Robinhood first tried to modernize legacy systems by partnering with alternative trading platforms like West Palm Beach–based Blue Ocean to extend trading hours. However, these efforts hit a wall. “I didn’t realize how difficult it would be to change these core infrastructure elements because so many things depend on them. Maybe that was a little bit naive,” Tenev admits. Meanwhile, his crypto chief, Kerbrat, was exploring other ways to execute his idea. With U.S. regulators taking a cautious stance on digital assets under the Biden administration, the team took the experiment to Europe, where a rulebook was already in place. “Sometimes it’s easier to start with new infrastructure and build it from the ground up. We believe the technology can scale to any jurisdiction, and over time we’ll be able to figure out how to make it available everywhere in the world,” Tenev says, knowing his lucrative trading volume machine could grow exponentially as millions of investors worldwide start trading U.S. stocks like memecoins. While Kerbrat worked on tokenization in Europe, Robin­hood was reinventing itself elsewhere. In March 2024, Bhatt, now worth $6.7 billion, exited the company (he stepped aside as co-CEO in 2020) to pursue a new venture in space-based solar energy. Despite lingering customer litigation from GameStop, Tenev was busy introducing a wave of new products—IRAs, high-yield savings accounts, a credit card offering 3% cash back (with 3 million people on the waitlist), a private banking service for cash delivery on demand and sophisticated options tools previously reserved for institutional investors—turning Robinhood into “a mousetrap to trade anything,” in the words of Brett Knob­lauch, managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald. The whirlwind of launches matches its architect’s own cadence. In a moment of reflection, the Bulgaria-born Tenev lifts his palms in a what‑can‑you‑do shrug. “I just wake up, work, eat, work out, go to sleep. My wife doesn’t love it when I say this, but I actually prefer to integrate work into personal life as much as possible.” What Tenev says he didn’t fully anticipate during Robinhood’s explosive growth was how deeply accessible trading resonates with the entrepreneurial spirit. At a private event in Miami last year, the company’s top users included not just self-taught day traders but small-business owners and startup founders—people who approach markets with the same DIY mindset that built their companies. This fiercely independent impulse, he believes, is Robinhood’s real protective moat: “Entrepreneurs don’t trust other experts to do their stuff for them. They like to figure things out for themselves.” Robinhood is engineered for them—a control panel for those who want to manage their own money without gatekeepers. Tenev plans to dominate next-generation investors in three phases he calls “arcs.” First, win the active trader market, where the ROI is immediate, as evidenced by Robinhood’s current strong results. Medium-term, around five years, he wants to serve the entirety of his customers’ wallets, from credit cards to crypto, mortgages and IRAs. Third arc: Build the number one global financial ecosystem, presumably with Robinhood’s blockchain as its backbone. Says Tenev, prepping for the next day’s shareholder meeting, “This will be much larger than the first two arcs. The opportunities start slowly but compound over time.” Tokenization may be Robinhood’s long-term ambition, but its core crypto business is already a juggernaut. In 2024, its crypto revenue reached $626 million, up from $135 million a year earlier, accounting for more than one-third of total transaction-based revenue. In the first quarter of 2025, crypto revenue has already reached $252 million. “They’re eating Coinbase’s lunch in the U.S. right now,” says Rob Hadick, general partner at crypto VC firm Dragonfly. In May 2025, Robinhood’s crypto volume spiked 36% month-over-month while Coinbase’s dipped, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Knoblauch notes. Coinbase still owns the institutional market, he concedes (“their offering is much broader and custodial”), but Robinhood’s takeover of Bitstamp, finalized in June, handed it 5,000 institutional accounts and additional licenses in Europe and Asia. Tenev and Kerbrat insist Robinhood’s approach is fundamentally different from that of crypto exchanges like Coinbase. “In this industry people talk to you about the advantage of this [blockchain] layer versus this layer and just forget at the end of the day about the end user. We don’t want to build a technology just to talk about the technology. We want to build something that people can use on the day-to-day and actually see the advantage compared to the alternative financial system,” Kerbrat says. Micky Malka, founder of Ribbit Capital and an early backer of Robinhood, Coinbase and their European competitor Revolut, says focusing on the Coinbase-Robinhood rivalry is shortsighted. “To me, the question for the next ten years is how much market share they take from the incumbents. It’s not a fight amongst them,” he says. Knoblauch estimates Robinhood’s $255 billion in assets under custody will rival Interactive Brokers’, which has $665 billion in client assets, within seven years. Next up, Charles Schwab, which the analyst calculates Robinhood has gained share on for 14 straight months. Tenev is also serious about diversifying. The old Robinhood was criticized for being a payment for order flow (PFOF) junkie, dependent on heavy trading volume and the most aggressive Wall Street hedge funds. Transactions still account for 56% of its revenue (down from 77% in 2021), but today Robinhood has ten business lines on track to each generate over $100 million in revenue within two years, according to John Todaro, managing director at Needham & Company. Take Robinhood Gold. What began as a simple $5 per month or $50 per year premium service, offering margin access, professional research and a little extra yield on balan­ces, has evolved into the centerpiece of Tenev’s powerful subscription model. Among its current perks: 4% yields on brokerage cash, interest-free margin loans up to $1,000 and a 3% match on IRA contributions. The newly released Robinhood Gold credit card, which offers 3% cash back on all purchases, was just sent to the first 200,000 customers. “If they get to 15 million users on Gold, you’re looking at close to a billion dollars of subscription revenue. It’s taking a business that used to be very cyclical to having recurring revenue, then diversifying the overall revenue base,” Knoblauch says. Then there’s Robinhood Strategies, Tenev’s new hybrid robo-human advisory product gunning for old-school stalwarts like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch in the $60 trillion U.S. wealth management business. For a 0.25% annual management fee, capped at a flat $250 for Robinhood Gold members, customers get tailored portfolios of stocks and ETFs, algorithmically managed and rebalanced with human oversight. Since launching in March, this disruptive new platform has already brought in $350 million. Tenev describes his company’s approach to new products as scientific, empowering small teams inside Robinhood to test hypotheses with customers who provide immediate feedback to its initiatives on social networks. “A lot of companies will just look at what’s happening in the outside world and copy it, sort of a competitive benchmarking. When we launch products or new features, we do it because we like to figure stuff out,” Tenev says. Robinhood’s recent launch of home mortgages—currently at 6.1% for 30-year fixed plus $500 toward closing costs—is the result of a stealth online pilot it ran starting in June. “It went all over social media. Then I acknowledged we were running the pilot in a tweet. It was probably one of my most viral tweets of the year.” Tenev’s tokenization push is a bit of a moonshot, and Europe, which has already adopted many of the crypto road rules still being deba­ted in Congress, is Robinhood’s lab. “The experiment that we’re running in Europe is, What would Robinhood look like if it was rebuilt from the ground up entirely on crypto rails? Then we’ll see what the pros and cons are and bring the best of that EU app to the U.S. and the rest of the world,” he says. So far the tokenization of stocks is minuscule. xStocks, a new but already leading platform from Switzerland’s Backed Finance, has tokenized more than 60 listed equities, inclu­ding household names such as Apple and Amazon, and made them available on large crypto exchanges like Kraken and Bybit. xStocks has less than $10 million in daily volume. Structural issues abound: These tokens are derivatives backed by assets held off-chain, which means routine corporate actions like dividends, stock splits or other things that might occur over a weekend, when markets are closed, could scramble collateral calculations and risk unintended liquidations. “Some market maker has to take that risk, and how will they hedge that risk when there is no market open? If they’re going to take that risk, they need to blow their spreads and charge people a lot of money,” says Dragonfly’s Hadick. “The infrastructure is not there at the moment on the off-chain side, and the on-chain product is not there yet. . . . I’m worried these initial products are going to be essentially duds.” This hasn’t stopped others from jumping in. In June, the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini launched tokenized trading with MicroStrategy shares for its EU customers. Coinbase is reportedly seeking SEC approval to offer tokenized stocks, and even Larry Fink, CEO of $12.5 trillion (assets under management) BlackRock, is urging the SEC to approve tokenization of stocks and bonds. Robinhood is going further. Besides public stocks, it’s tokenizing private companies and has already announced tokenized shares of Open­AI and SpaceX, each valued at more than $300 billion today. Open­AI has already publicly disavowed Robinhood’s product, emphasizing the tokens are not authorized or recognized by the company. “Nobody, no founder, wants their equity floating around on-chain with holders they don’t know,” Hadick warns. Tenev is a weathered veteran when it comes to facing naysayers. “It’s still a little crufty,” he admits, using pejorative coder slang for unnecessarily complex software. “I don’t think the brokers want to make it easy for us to pull their stocks out. But what happens when it becomes self-custody? When you can tokenize and self-custody, you can be independent of the brokerage infrastructure—the same way you can load a crypto wallet on MetaMask, Robinhood or Coinbase, you’ll be able to seamlessly use any interface to hold your stocks and trade them in pretty much all instances.” This is precisely why Tenev is obsessed with making Robinhood his young customers’ sole tool for all things related to money. When it comes to retail financial services, inertia is second in power only to compound interest. Customers are inherently sticky, but Tenev knows that the old giants of the financial world, including Fidelity, Schwab and Merrill Lynch, are vulnerable as trillions in Boomer assets are bequeathed to their digital-native offspring. In fact, he thinks his biggest competition will come not from firms like Coinbase or Fidelity but from the Anthropics and OpenAIs of the world: “They’re the ones moving the fastest and doing the most interesting stuff. Though I would say it’s too early to proclaim the financial industry being disrupted by ChatGPT.” Early Robinhood investor Malka, whom Tenev calls his mentor and whose firm has already profited on its stake by more than $5 billion by Forbes’ estimates, is an unabashed Tenev fanboy. “Robinhood has a leader who’s not even 40, who is extremely AI-native, understands where AI goes, understands tokenization, and he’s leveraging those two strategies like very few can,” he says. “We’re just starting to get the right setup to bring the ‘internet moment’ of money, where anybody in the world can save in the same product. Loans are going to get cheaper because credit underwriting is going to get better. All those things.” Tenev believes Robinhood will ultimately employ AI agents to replicate and improve on the services of high-net-worth family offices, putting a “family office in your pocket.” AI is so central to Tenev’s vision that the former math Ph.D. candidate couldn’t resist recently cofounding and becoming chairman of AI startup Harmonic, which he leads with computer scientist Tudor Achim, who previously led autonomous driving startup Helm.ai. In July, Harmonic raised $100 million in Series B funding from Kleiner Perkins, Para­digm and Sequoia, valuing it at $875 million. The “mathematical superintelligence” lab is building an advanced reasoning engine, one that “guarantees accuracy and eliminates hallucinations.” No doubt a useful feature in the coming age of AI and money. “It would be pretty amazing to solve the Riemann hypothesis, or one of the other big Millennium problems, on a mobile app,” muses Tenev, referring to the most profound unanswered mathematical questions. “Rather than obser­ving that, I hope to be actively participating.” Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink and Ken Griffin, take note.

The Heritage Foundation's Michael Pillsbury unpacks trade talks with China amid market volatility on 'America's Newsroom.' As data centers multiply across the United States, energy demand is increasing at a rapid pace. This has not escaped the notice of large investment firms from Wall Street. The likes of BlackRock and Blackstone are trying their very best to acquire utility companies in hopes of capitalizing on lucrative grid upgrades. On the other side of things, consumer advocates and regulators are raising alarms, worried that these moves prioritize profits over public service. For your information, BlackRock and Blackstone are two of the biggest investment management firms in the world. They have trillions of dollars' worth of global assets and have become the go-to option for companies that need money. They have enormous influence across various industries and make money by investing in many different types of businesses.

(Wikipedia) In a bold move last year, BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners, along with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, proposed acquiring Minnesota Power, a utility serving 150,000 customers. The acquisition, which could support tech companies with energy access for new data centers, received initial support from state agencies after negotiation. Even the Minnesota Department of Commerce dropped its opposition after reaching an agreement. However, Administrative Law Judge Megan J. McKenzie delivered a surprising recommendation on July 15th, urging regulators to deny the deal. She cited troubling signs that profit was the driving force behind the acquisition. "The nonpublic evidence reveals the partners’ intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control," Judge McKenzie wrote. "The partners themselves have carefully committed to do very little." It's important to note that the judge's recommendation is not final; state regulators will make the ultimate decision on whether the acquisition goes through. Power lines. (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) Opposition is mounting from climate advocates and watchdogs. Nichole Heil from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project voiced concerns over financial burdens and rate hikes: "No one in northern Minnesota wants higher utility bills solely to line the pockets of Wall Street-based private equity firms." Electricity bills are already climbing nationwide. According to the Energy Information Administration, the average monthly household bill rose nearly 4% in April to $175 a month. This is the average for a single household using 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. To address these concerns, the Minnesota Department of Commerce brokered a deal that includes key protections. These measures prohibit passing acquisition costs onto customers and preserve programs for low-income households. "These commitments include a substantial array of additional public interest benefits, risk-mitigation tools and customer protections beyond those originally proposed," the agency noted. A lightbulb with arms and legs plugging itself into a wall outlet. (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) If Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Blackstone acquire your local utility, rates could increase as they strive to maximize returns for their shareholders. Sure, they might improve the infrastructure and service, but history shows that when these types of companies come in, customers often end up paying more. They need to be kept in check to balance infrastructure investment while making energy affordable for regular Americans. The rapid increase in demand for tech has made utility ownership a battleground between profit-driven investors and consumer advocates. While firms like BlackRock and Blackstone argue that their resources can modernize aging grids, critics warn of a future where reliability and affordability take a backseat. With regulators now at a crossroads, the outcome in Minnesota may set the tone for utility ownership nationwide. Do you think companies like BlackRock and Blackstone owning utilities is a good thing?

Title: SharpLink stakes big on Ethereum: Are institutions moving away from BTC?

What could this mean for supply, staking, and Ethereum’s price ceiling? SharpLink Gaming has ramped up to over 438,000 ETH, signaling deep institutional interest and long-term conviction. Analysts warn of a possible short-term dip before the next breakout. While the spotlight remains firmly on Bitcoin [BTC] amid growing institutional accumulation, a quiet but significant shift is unfolding in the Ethereum [ETH] space. SharpLink Gaming, a prominent player in gaming and data analytics, has deepened its Ethereum commitment by purchasing an additional 77,210 ETH over the weekend, worth approximately $295 million, per Arkham. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain also confirmed the purchase, which has pushed SharpLink’s total Ethereum holdings to 438,017 ETH, now worth approximately $1.69 billion. Source: Lookonchain/X A large portion of this stash is staked via platforms such as Figment and Hoppers DApp, signaling a long-term approach rather than speculative accumulation. In fact, SharpLink itself emphasized Ethereum’s 24/7 availability compared to traditional banking hours, pointing to the agility and scalability that make ETH an attractive reserve asset for modern firms. They further added, Source: SharpLink/X Echoing the growing confidence in Ethereum, crypto analyst Crypt Rover posted on X that such large-scale accumulation is a strong signal of deepening institutional inflows. He even predicted that ETH could be on track to hit $10,000, as demand surges and long-term holdings tighten supply. This shows that with Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin serving as chairman and former BlackRock strategist Joseph Chalom as co-CEO, SharpLink is positioning itself at the intersection of traditional finance and Web3. If it fulfills its acquisition goal, the company would hold over 1 million ETH, or approximately 1% of the total supply. According to ETH Strategic Reserve data, SharpLink is now the second-largest holder of ETH, trailing only Bitmine Immersion Tech, which holds 566,000 ETH. This coincided with ETH trading at $3,871.72, up 1.12% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Technical indicators like the RSI also support a bullish case for Ethereum, showing that buyers currently have the upper hand. Source: Trading View The community also seems to have appreciated this move by SharpLink, as noted by one X user, who said, “$ETH will Moon!” Echoing similar sentiments, another page — WISE, added, “Oufff so bullish” Thus, with both sentiment and fundamentals lining up, Ethereum’s current trajectory could be signaling a larger trend in crypto capital allocation. However, Alphractal’s Liquidation Heatmap indicates a cluster of open long positions, hinting that a short-term dip may precede Ethereum’s next breakout as reported by AMBCrypto.

Title: Web 3.0 Founders Must Learn From AI Industry Success

Discords and X threads aren’t fooling investors anymore. Web 3.0 founders must look towards AI to survive. Web 3.0 founders have to pivot. The AI (artificial intelligence) industry has demonstrated itself to be far more apt at innovating than Web 3.0, which as an industry must accept defeat in a way and reorganize. It would behoove AI founders to take a page out of the book of big AI companies, which have impacted lives and scooped up a big market share in short order – leaving crypto very much in the dust when it comes to the mindshare of crypto in the global consciousness versus AI. Web 3.0 founders must ask themselves, ‘What can we learn?’ As AI becomes more powerful, and it will do so quickly, Web 3.0 will quickly become a subservient industry, dependent upon the whims of the almighty big technology corporations in control of AI technology. Web 3.0 will likely only become lucrative and impactful by partnering with AI companies. Web 3.0’s decentralization, which has resulted in thousands of projects promising all sorts of decentralized versions of apps that already exist, has led to the general public – including investors – not understanding which projects are for real. Investors simply don’t know which projects can achieve results or are even offering a solution to a real problem. DAOs, DeFi protocols and metaverse land rushes are largely a cacophony of Discord servers, Telegram groups and X threads. For many Western investors, these business models are completely foreign. The business models of AI companies, including startups, are far more familiar. In addition, Web 3.0 has gained a bit of a reputation for being associated with hype and scams. The AI industry, on the other hand, has forged a clearer path towards deals that make a difference. AI companies aren’t shilling tokens based on future promises, writing convoluted whitepapers and posting endlessly online. They’re building groundbreaking technology from the ground up. In the AI industry, the cream has risen quickly to the top. The world knows that it is companies like xAI, OpenAI, Google and others that dominate the marketplace. Investors know that real innovation doesn’t come from a 10,000 NFT (non-fungible token) collection. BlackRock will tokenize bonds, not NFTs. Partners want to make deals with the AI behemoths building out the world-changing infrastructure, such as cloud providers, chipmakers or platforms like xAI’s Grok, which has revolutionized the way in which humanity seeks out information. Unfortunately for those of us in the Web 3.0 space – for now at least – these companies are building the future, not Web 3.0 startups. Centralization is winning the day over decentralization. The fragmentation in Web 3.0 – the fierce competition over so little – is not nearly as appetizing to investors and strategic partners as AI monopolies. Web 3.0 companies should start looking to partner with those companies sitting on a vast GPU supply or a proprietary data organization. These are the companies – the ones that control algorithms – getting inventor funds. A new way forward for crypto Web 3.0 founders are left with no other option than to pivot. The industry has to face it and move towards a new strategy. Big money has found it difficult to navigate the decentralized web of Web 3.0 companies. Instead, centralized powerhouses are the ones building the future, and they could step into the crypto arena at any time and potentially outcompete crypto native incumbents. It’s time for crypto to move on from its messaging chat and X strategy, as well as the promises of decentralization, and start working the phones to get into the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies touching technology. It’s high time to deliver. The idealism of Web 3.0 is proving not to mesh with reality. The quest for decentralization, ownership and democratized value creation has stalled. In the future, Web 3.0 might further fragment. The biggest blockchains, such as Ethereum and Solana, will begin to pin their fates on centralized solutions, increasingly looking like the tech gatekeepers they once billed themselves as disrupting. The blockchains of tomorrow will exist as integrations into the traditional financial and technology giants, which are looking for supply chain tracking and similar solutions. For the blockchain world, these solutions are the quickest way to real-world utility and a monopoly. The more lofty solutions, such as decentralized data storage, are not making much progress when it comes to market share. Memecoins, redundant DeFi protocols and incomplete metaverses are already suffering under the strain of zero sum competition between one another. There is no crypto community. The incestuous strategic partnerships of crypto projects with each other have resulted in limited innovation. It’s time for Web 3.0 founders to make a change. Billion-dollar partnerships are made via access to C-Suites of the world’s biggest companies – not in the world of hashtags or virtual land. The Web 3.0 companies that don’t adapt to the fact that Web 3.0 has fallen far behind the AI industry in terms of innovation won’t be around for long.
