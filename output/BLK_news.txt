Photo: Adrian Murrell/Getty Images Limerick rugby has always been different. For generations rugby was a middle-class, if not upper-class, pursuit, in Ireland. The vast majority of the rugby playing population began their careers in the most prestigious fee-paying schools in Ireland, like Clongowes and Blackrock College. This point was reflected in Brendan Behan’s observation: “I never heard rugby was a proper game for anyone except bank clerks. It was a game for the Protestant and the shop-keeping Catholic and I never thought it had anything to do with me.”

Title: Best golf courses in Co Louth: Bucket list courses and hidden gems from Baltray to Ardee

The drive from Drogheda along the River Boyne to the village of Baltray is one which heightens expectations of what awaits at the mouth of the river. County Louth Golf Club – a fine, traditional links – has earned its place among the top courses in the country. Originally designed in the 1890s by a Scottish professional with the wonderful name of Mr Snowball, the man most responsible for leaving his imprint on this seaside course – where Shane Lowry won the Irish Open as an amateur in 2009 – was the noted golf course architect Tom Simpson and his assistant Molly Gourlay. [ Fairways to Heaven - Ireland's Ultimate Golf GuideOpens in new window ] The links itself is a true test from start-to-finish, as it weaves its way in different directions but still consists of two loops. The most dramatic run of holes comes on the back nine, with the run from the 10th to 13th comprising arguably the best sequence of four successive par-fours anywhere. The 14th is the shortest of the par-fours but one of the best, playing from the elevated tee with the final destination of a green planted into the sand hills. In every sense, Baltray – the traditional home of the men’s East of Ireland championship – is a links that will reward and captivate, while being at all times challenging. Its clever design, utilising the terrain that is primarily flat before delving into the sand hills from the 12th to the 14th, entices and demands attention on every shot. As part of the bucket list, it is worth factoring in a round at the adjacent Seapoint links – designed by Des Smyth and Declan Branigan – which has matured wonderfully, especially the back nine which takes in views of the Irish Sea from a number of vantage points. The best is probably left to last at Seapoint. The 18th hole running along the coastline back to the clubhouse where the spirit of the 19th hole welcome is very much in play. Co Louth Golf Club, Baltray, Drogheda, Co Louth, A92 HK03; 041-9881530 Seapoint Golf Club, Termonfeckin, Co Louth; 041-9822333; email: ed@seapoint.ie Greenore is a long established course dating back to the 1890s but remains one of those hidden gems, primarily because its location on the Cooley peninsula overlooking Carlingford Lough ... but it is very much worth discovering as a fine test of golf in a wonderful setting with views across to the Mournes. Wind, given its location, is invariably a factor but the layout is open with the challenge set before the player off the tee with no hidden surprises. Although flat, the loughside course has its challenges with tidal water in play, most notably on the sixth and seventh holes. The tee to the Par 3 sixth is located on a disused railway line and plays downhill to the green, while it is followed by a demanding Par 4 with a tee shot over water. Greenore Golf Club, Greenore, Dundalk; 042-9373212 Dundalk Golf Club is a classic parkland course with a reputation for its wonderful greens. Located above the picturesque village of Blackrock, the treelined course has three distinct segments with an opening stretch of four tough Par 4s, then a stretch to the 12th that includes four Par 5s and a tough finishing run all the way to the 18th which is known as “Harrington’s Challenge,” in honour of three-time Major champion Pádraig Harrington who won the Dundalk Scratch Cup in 1995. Dundalk Golf Club, Blackrock, Dundalk, County Louth; 042-9321731; email: manager@dundalkgolfclub.ie Ardee Golf Club has matured into a lovely tree-lined course and, with the Tain Trail part of the local history, has connections with Cuchulainn in the names of the 1st (Cuchulainn’s Crown) and the seventh (Ferdia). The stretch of holes from the 11th to the 14th is very demanding, with the short 13th that has water in play from tee to green showcasing the picturesque nature of the entire layout.

Title: What Wall Street’s rampaging run means for KiwiSaver investors - Stock Takes

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Wall Street's bull run has been a boon for KiwiSaver funds. Photo / File This week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs, boosted by gains in technology stocks and a trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is only a fraction short of its record close on December 4. Meanwhile, a better-than-expected US jobs report for June reinforced expectations that the US Federal Reserve would not cut official interest rates this year. US stocks have more than made up for the tariff-driven selloff, so what will that mean for KiwiSaver investors, many of whom will have some kind of exposure to Wall Street? As at the end of March, investment research firm Morningstar tracked about $121 billion of assets in KiwiSaver, of which $49b was invested in international stock markets. “The MSCI World Index is about 72% US-based, so we would estimate that there would be around $35b invested in the US equity markets,” the firm told Stock Takes. That’s welcome news for KiwiSaver investors, given the New Zealand sharemarket has underperformed, reflecting the weak economy. Mark Lister, investment director at Craigs Investment Partners, said diversification had been a big plus. “The fact that KiwiSaver investors have a healthy allocation of US shares has been a very good thing in recent years because many investors - if they were making their own investment decisions - might have tilted towards the local market, which has been an underperformer. “The fact that KiwiSaver funds have been very internationally focused [and with the US being the world’s biggest share market] has ensured that KiwiSaver members and investors have had some very good returns in recent years.” Lister noted that, while the US market was at record highs, it had suffered a big fall in April on the back of US President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement. The US market had recouped its losses, but the weaker US dollar offset some of those gains for Kiwis. Lister said international diversification in general had been a positive for KiwiSaver investors, not just because of Wall Street’s performance. He noted emerging markets had also been strong, along with Japan, Europe and the UK. “Europe, to me, is probably one of the standouts because the euro has also been strong. “For a New Zealand investor, you’ve got the double whammy of a strongly performing European market and a rising euro against the Kiwi dollar. “All in all, it hasn’t been too bad in the first six months of the year for investors, and it’s been that international exposure that will have helped them, despite the local share market and the housing market continuing to lag.” While US stock markets look to be in full recovery mode, somebody has forgotten the US dollar, which is having its worst start to the year since 1973. Trump’s trade and economic policies have prompted global investors to rethink their exposure to the US, but the greenback’s role as the world’s reserve currency looks to be safe. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, paints an optimistic outlook for US equities, despite the uncertainties posed by Trump’s policies. “As US policy reclaims centre stage, we think immutable economic laws will limit extremes, while tax cuts and deregulation could boost investor sentiment,” BlackRock said in a commentary. US policy developments were coming thick and fast. “As the end of the 90-day tariff pause looms, we think immutable economic laws will prevent a return to a maximal stance. “We are also seeing movement in US policies that could boost investor sentiment, including tax cuts and regulatory reforms like a federal stablecoin framework. “These reforms will take time, but support our US equities overweight [position]. “We stay underweight long-term Treasuries on sticky inflation and deficit concerns.” Trump’s pause on sweeping tariffs expires on Wednesday. In New Zealand’s case, exporters face a 10% tariff on exports to the US. But analysts say the risk lies not so much with tariffs on New Zealand goods but the impact that they will have on world growth. Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr noted the US dollar’s weakness and the questions being asked about its reserve status. “My opinion is that we have not seen a dumping of the US dollar at all. “We have seen a diversification, perhaps, but certainly not a dumping. “Yields on US Treasuries are not rising in a concerning way - in fact, they have fallen (4.24% for US 10-years).” The weak US dollar is good news for Trump, who has long called for a lower greenback to make US manufacturers more competitive. “Trump is pretty sensitive to the financial markets, but having the dollar drop in the way that it has will not concern him at all,” Kerr said. While the New Zealand share market remained sidelined, the one bright spot seemed to be the agricultural sector. “My worry is that, if these tariffs come in, they will start to slow the world economy down, which is what many forecast. “That’s a worry because we are exposed to that slowdown. “And the best-performing sectors of the economy are the most exposed to the global slowdown.” A Malaysian company may be interested in buying Fletcher Building’s construction unit, according to a report in The Australian. The newspaper’s “Dataroom” said Malaysia’s Gamuda had expressed an interest in buying the Fletcher Building construction arm. Gamuda is an engineering, property and infrastructure group and is one of the largest in Malaysia’s infrastructure sector. Early last month, Fletcher Building told the NZX that it had received inquiries from parties interested in its businesses, including its construction division, after the company’s announcement of a strategic review. “The company advises that no decisions have been made to sell any of its businesses,” it said then. Tucked away in NZX-listed Burger Fuel’s annual report was a comment on the number of young people leaving for Australia. The chain said there had been a “significant” exodus of “home-grown, hardcore” Burger Fuel customers to Australia and other overseas destinations. “These younger Burger Fuel customers are not being replaced by incoming migrants, who are unlikely to purchase from Burger Fuel for some years,” the company said. Trading in 2025 had been “one of the toughest on record” for the hospitality industry, the report said. “Although there is talk of economic improvement, we have not seen this translate to sales; the economy remains in recession. “The slow reduction of interest rates and general economic uncertainty has led to consumers keeping their wallets in their pockets. “People are spending less and most certainly eating out less.” “We do not anticipate significant positive changes in the economic environment over the next 12 months,” chairman Alan Gourdie and chief executive Josef Roberts said. Jamie Gray is an Auckland-based journalist, covering the financial markets, the primary sector and energy. He joined the Herald in 2011.

Title: Ondo, Pantera Capital to Invest $250M in Real-World Asset Projects

Tokenization platform Ondo Finance ONDO$0.7840 and digital asset investment firm Pantera Capital have teamed up to invest $250 million in real-world asset (RWA) projects as the red-hot tokenization trend is accelerating. The initiative, named Ondo Catalyst, aims to invest in protocols and infrastructure projects that enhance the development of tokenized finance and on-chain capital markets, according to a Thursday blog post by Ondo. The initiative will do a mix of equity and token investments, a representative of Ondo told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. "The financial system is undergoing a fundamental upgrade," Nathan Allman, founder and CEO of Ondo Finance, said in the blog post. "By supporting the infrastructure and applications that unlock real-world utility for tokenized assets, we're helping reshape how capital moves around the world." Tokenization is one of the fastest-growing crypto use cases and has captivated big banks, fintechs, asset managers and crypto native firms alike. The process aims to bring traditional financial instruments such as bonds, stocks and real estate, often dubbed RWAs, onto blockchain rails, promising more efficient operations, faster and around-the-clock settlements, broader investor access and programmable transactions. For example, Robinhood, Bybit, Kraken and Gemini have recently introduced trading with tokenized versions of U.S. stocks, while BlackRock and Franklin Templeton issue tokenized money market funds backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries. Ondo is one of the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury issuers, with its OUSG and USDY tokens having a combined market capitalization of nearly $1.4 billion, data by RWA.xyz shows. The firm is also developing a layer-1 blockchain network designed for tokenized RWAs. The news of the partnership was first reported by Axios.

Title: Considering A Career Move Or Pension In Crypto? Crypto’s Overdue Respect
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2025/07/03/considering-a-career-move-or-pension-in-crypto-cryptos-overdue-respect/

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. Young stock trader shows executive managers cryptocurrency and market correlation on wall TV. It is estimated that over 55 million Americans use cryptocurrencies, 20% of the adult population. Europe has an estimated 31 million cryptocurrency users, 25% of the adult population, and in the U.K. its 12% of the of the adult population, or 4 million adults. Africa has 38 million users, Latin America has 55 million users, and Asia, comprising 48 counties, has 263 million users. Crypto is moving into the mainstream globally and the broad acceptance of digital assets is accelerating. The U.S. Administration’s pro-crypto stance is certainly delivering greater regulatory clarity with the Genius Act for stablecoins and the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. SEC Chair Paul Atkins says the self-custody of crypto is a fundamental American right, linking it to personal freedom and property control. Under Chair Atkins, with the support of Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, the SEC has dropped most of the crypto lawsuits filed during former chair Gary Gensler’s tenure. Greater regulatory clarity is welcome, and it is increasingly clear that there is a growing change of attitude towards cryptocurrencies among many global regulators driven by a range factors including the prospect of greater economic growth, financial inclusion and wealth creation opportunities for citizens. The markets have witnessed Circle’s eye watering IPO and share price which is helping to drive the path to IPO for crypto exchanges like Kraken, Gemini and Bullish. It is difficult to not conclude that cryptocurrencies and digital assets are becoming respectable. By many estimates, almost half of the professionals working in crypto and digital assets come from TradFi capital markets, top tier banks to asset managers. There has always been somewhat of career risk for TradFi talent working in crypto, especially enduring the hostility by some policymakers and regulators over the past few years. Institutional investment is now piling in crypto - it is estimated that institutions now hold 25% of the U.S. bitcoin ETF market - and this is making crypto more respectable and driving a requirement for TradFi talent that is willing to stake its career on working in the burgeoning digital assets industry. New research by leading European digital assets hedge fund Nickel Digital Asset Management shows that is changing. Nickel Digital itself was founded by an alumnus from Bankers Trust, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan. The research surveyed institutional investors and wealth managers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Singapore, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates who collectively manage over $1 trillion in assets. More than half (53%) surveyed believe the career risk for executives in the crypto industry has fallen under the Trump Presidency with 17% saying it has significantly reduced. Around a third (33%) say the risk has increased with only 1% say it has significantly increased. Mitigating career risks depends largely on regulation of the sector. More than four out of five (83%) questioned said it is extremely or very important in reducing career risk when investing in digital assets with 30% saying it is extremely important. Anatoly Crachilov, ceo and founding partner at Nickel Digital, says, “The mainstream adoption of digital assets pioneered by firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Goldman, has been turbo-charged by the Trump presidency and the fear of career risk is receding, driving greater engagement by traditional allocators. “Robust regulation is central to the growth of the sector but there are more practical issues to be addressed including deeper liquidity and improvements to market infrastructure that will mitigate counterparty risks concerns.” Defined benefit and hybrid pension scheme specialist Cartwright has announced the first bitcoin allocation into the investment portfolio of an unnamed U.K. pension scheme. It described the investment as “a strategic move that, not only offers diversification, but also taps into an asset class with a unique asymmetric risk-return profile.” The Cartwright announcement was denounced as “deeply irresponsible” by some commentators, pointing to the cautionary tale of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan writing down its $95 million investment in FTX following its bankruptcy. This criticism is misplaced as the FTX bankruptcy was down to the founders committing fraud on a grand scale, and is nothing to do with cryptocurrencies or new blockchain digital technologies. U.S. pension schemes however are not worried. Schemes in Wisconsin and Michigan are major investors in crypto ETFs which are regulated. Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma are looking at establishing bitcoin reserves. Zodia Markets Ireland chair Michael Walsh estimates that 1% of crypto ETFs are being bought by U.S. pension funds which sounds small, and adds “1% of a $100 billion market might not seem significant but it represents over a billion dollars with substantial room for growth.” The growth potential in the crypto ETF market is obvious and the direction of travel seems to be up. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recently bought $970 million Bitcoin in a day and now holds over $56 billion in assets. It is estimated to hold 3% of the total global supply of bitcoin. Blackrock’s IBIT is the one of the hottest ETF tickets in the market, overtaking its S&P 500 ETF in annual revenue. BlackRock ceo Larry Fink has talked about bitcoin replacing the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency due to potential concerns about rising U.S. Government debt, especially following the fresh passage of the new budget bill. With record U.S. debt, weak bond auctions, and the weakest dollar since the 1970s, the threat of the U.S. debt default is looming on the mind of foreign debt holders, with some foreign asset managers publicly stating they are now overweight in both U.S. debt and equity. The Nickel Digital research among firms already invested in digital assets shows growth in crypto markets is driving increased respectability. Markets can drift but as long as they are not crashing there is a continuing confidence that builds over the the longer-term. Nearly nine out of 10 (88%) questioned say they will increase their level of investment in digital assets this year, building on the 67% who said they increased investment in the last year. They expect major investor groups to follow suit. Around 70% predict pension funds will dramatically increase investment in digital assets over the next two years while 57% believe wealth managers will dramatically increase investment and 40% say the same about family offices. Most are increasingly positive about the outlook for digital assets as they increase their understanding of the industry with 90% positive on digital assets as an asset class and 13% saying they are very positive. None of the organisations surveyed were negative on the current market with 10% saying they were neutral. Part of the growing confidence is due to deeper engagement with the digital asset industry and a greater understanding of the investment benefits beyond investment returns. Nickel Digital’s research asked professional investors to rank the benefits of investing in the industry. The ability to trade 24/7 and the efficiency of the DeFi ecosystem are rated as the two major benefits of investing in the sector ahead of the prospect of better returns than other asset classes, which was rated third. Capital appreciation and the role of digital assets as a hedge against currency depreciation were ranked fourth and fifth ahead of yield opportunities and their role as a hedge against inflation. Arbitrage opportunities and low correlation to other asset classes were ranked eighth and ninth. Crachilov stresses the importance of regulation saying, "Regulators play a critical role in supporting the evolution of the digital asset sector. While no regulatory framework can eliminate all possible risks, investors appreciate value of global regulators' drive for transparency, accountability, while, at the same time, providing constructive approach to regulation in the crypto sector." The research found 88% believe the risk of another FTX-style scandal has been reduced with more than a third (35%) saying it has fallen sharply. A similar study in July 2024 by Nickel Digital found 75% believed the risk had dropped with 20% saying it had fallen sharply. Confidence in regulation and growing respectability is encouraging more firms to engage. 43% of institutional investors and wealth managers questioned believe there will be a dramatic increase in traditional financial firms launching crypto funds and investment solutions over the next two years. That increasing involvement by traditional institutions is good news for the sector with nearly one in five (18%) say the involvement of major firms is very positive for the sector and 74% saying it’s quite positive. Performance is key – investors questioned believe crypto will be one of their top five asset classes for risk-adjusted returns over the next five years. Private equity was the next most selected followed by emerging market (EM) equities – EMs have become popular destinations for those asset allocators overweight in U.S. equities. Crypto’s journey to respectability has been a long one. There will be bumps in the road ahead, though the threat of the next crypto winter in the short term appears a lower probability to most crypto analysts and pundits. Many TrandFi analysts and pundits are not as sure they can say same the same about traditional markets.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Canadian dessert chain La Diperie is sending some Arctic chill down to the West Village. The Montreal-based La Diperie, known for its customizable dipped ice cream and treats, has signed a 10-year lease for 1,200 square feet at Midwood Investment and Development’s 56 Seventh Avenue, according to tenant broker RJBRE. Asking rent was $150 per square foot. The deal represents the dessert chain’s first location in New York City, following 65 stores across Canada and a spot in St. Petersburg, Fla., according to its website. La Diperie’s new store between West 13th and West 14th streets will be operated by Kishan and Ashlesha Patel and is slated to open early next year, according to the New York Business Journal, which first reported the news. “This marks La Diperie’s first New York location, and a key step in their U.S. expansion,” RJBRE’s Abraham Smouha, who brokered the deal for the tenant along with Richard Bailey, said in a statement to Commercial Observer. “We’re excited to bring their unique soft-serve experience to one of New York City’s most dynamic corridors,” Smouha added. Capricorn Retail Advisors’ Andrew Schulman, Ryan Schimel and Audrey Hersch represented the landlord in the deal. Schulman and spokespeople for La Diperie and Midwood did not immediately respond to requests for comment. La Diperie’s West Village spot will be at the base of the 159-unit Candela Tower, which Midwood bought from BlackRock Realty Advisors in May 2022 for $102 million, property records show. Other retail tenants at 56 Seventh Avenue include coffee shop Birch Coffee and health food store Elm Wellness. Isabelle Durso can be reached at idurso@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Wall Street Moves on-Chain as Tokenization of US Stocks Goes Global

Highlights Major financial players like J.P. Morgan, Kraken and Robinhood are tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) — from carbon credits to U.S. equities. Tokenized assets, often offered through offshore entities, allow for fractional ownership, instant settlement and around-the-clock trading. Despite momentum, regulators in the U.S. and Europe have yet to clarify how tokenized securities fit into existing legal frameworks, raising concerns over investor protection, jurisdiction and systemic risk. One of the overarching themes of 2025, outside of its notable levels of uncertainty, is the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto markets.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ That theme got a shot in the arm this week, with the news Wednesday (July 2) that J.P. Morgan is reportedly developing a new service to tokenize carbon credits, while on Monday (June 30), crypto exchange Kraken unveiled its long-anticipated platform allowing retail investors to buy tokenized versions of major U.S. equities. That same day, Robinhood also announced it was rolling out tokenized stocks to a select cohort of international users. Crucially, Kraken’s own offerings were similarly available only for eligible non-U.S. clients. While the initiatives may appear distinct, ranging from environmental credits to fractionalized equity exposure, the connective tissue is the same. Moving traditional financial services onto the blockchain. These moves represent a coordinated push by financial giants to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), sidestep traditional clearing infrastructure, and begin transitioning toward 24/7, programmable trading markets. But these rapid developments also raise existential questions for market regulators and central intermediaries. Are tokenized securities complementary to, or competitive with, traditional capital markets? Can existing legal frameworks scale across these hybrid asset classes? And who bears responsibility when decentralized and centralized elements collide? Read more: The Digital Asset Primer: Why Equity Markets Are Being Tokenized Tokenization, long the buzzword of blockchain evangelists, has entered its next phase. While initial coin offerings (ICOs) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) dominated earlier narratives, the current wave of interest centers around tangible, regulated assets — stocks, bonds, commodities and now carbon credits. Even BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has gone on record alleging that all assets should be tokenized on a blockchain and tradable online, writing in his 2025 annual shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” Kraken and Robinhood’s own tokenized equities operate through offshore subsidiaries to remain compliant with current U.S. laws. These tokenized shares are backed 1:1 by real stocks custodied by licensed brokerages. The twist? Instead of trading through traditional clearinghouses on a T+2 settlement basis, these assets can now be exchanged 24/7 on blockchain rails, with near-instant settlement and global reach. For retail investors, especially outside the U.S., this offers fractional ownership of American blue-chip stocks without intermediaries or time zone constraints. For institutions, it hints at a future where securities can be programmed with smart contracts, auto-execute dividends and facilitate compliance in real time. PYMNTS explored this topic earlier in the month in an interview with Brett McLain, head of payments and blockchain at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. “The tokenization of real-world assets [has] long been a holy grail for crypto … making those real-world assets more accessible globally to consumers,” McLain said. “We want to see that grow into other things like real estate and other tangible assets.” See also: What Treasury Teams Can Learn From Central Banks’ Tokenization Projects Still, these launches come amid intensifying efforts by U.S. and European regulators to bring coherence to the digital asset ecosystem. And despite the momentum, the regulatory picture remains murky. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not offered formal guidance on tokenized versions of registered securities traded offshore. These assets are typically structured as derivatives or depositary receipts, akin to synthetic products like CFDs and are not true equities in the traditional sense. As with many innovations, there can be a fine line between democratizing access and weakening safeguards. “These ‘OpenAI tokens’ are not OpenAI equity. We did not partner with Robinhood, were not involved in this, and do not endorse it. Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer. Please be careful,” tweeted OpenAI’s press account on X (formerly Twitter). Still, regulatory momentum is gathering in the U.S. and PYMNTS covered how Republican senators at the end of last month (June 24) unveiled a set of principles to serve as a framework for the development of legislation for digital assets and crypto markets. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin said in an interview with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster published April 7. “Without a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable.” Wall Street Moves on-Chain as Tokenization of US Stocks Goes Global European Commission Delays Release of AI Act’s Code of Practice Ford, JPMorgan, Amazon Executives Predict Deep Job Cuts as AI Advances Worldpay Launches Domestic Acquiring Capabilities in Thailand We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) first ran for state office in 2019, her campaign was funded almost entirely by small-dollar donors. As Crockett increased in prominence, however, cryptocurrency moguls, corporations, union bosses, and even foreign governments have lined up to shower her with resources. Crockett, who got her start practicing law, ran to represent a portion of Austin in the Texas House of Representatives in 2020. Early on, her state-level campaign counted on local individuals giving at most a couple hundred dollars apiece to support her. However, as she picked up steam, organized labor and business interests began cutting checks to her political committee as well. Crockett’s biggest financial windfall came during the 2022 election season when super PACs linked to cryptocurrency industry leaders like the since-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried pumped millions into supporting her bid to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson. Recommended Stories Zohran Mamdani took money from groups that help illegal immigrants avoid deportation Trump threatens to sue New York Times and CNN over Iran strike coverage Google promoted content from hijacked local news website posting pro-China content Since winning election to the House, Crockett has continued to enjoy contributions from corporate and union PACs. Foreign governments have also jumped aboard, with India, the United Arab Emirates, and a nonprofit group linked to the Qatari government all paying for Crockett and her family to go on expensive trips abroad, according to congressional disclosures. Crockett has emerged as a Democratic firebrand, frequently going viral for her spats with Republicans. Most recently, she has caught criticism for referring to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is wheelchair-bound, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Crockett later argued that the title was not related to the governor’s disability, a claim that was undercut after the Washington Free Beacon reported that she had “liked” content on Facebook making fun of Abbott’s paralysis. The sophomore congresswoman’s jab at Abbott is just one among her many controversial remarks, including criticizing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) for being in an interracial marriage. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) When it comes to policy, Crockett identifies as a progressive. For instance, the congresswoman has repeatedly railed against “corporate greed” and praised her colleagues for standing up against “corporate interests.” Campaign finance records, however, show that Crockett has accepted over $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. Her donors include pharmaceutical giants such as AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services firms such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and RTX, and household names such as McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon, and Toyota. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, along with other major unions, has also provided financial support to Crockett’s state and federal campaigns. Even before she took office, Protect our Future PAC and WEB3 Forward, two PACs funded by crypto moguls such as Bankman-Fried, Ben Horowitz, and Marc Andreessen, spent well over $2 million supporting Crockett’s campaign during a heated Democratic primary. Crockett’s stated disdain for corporate influence goes back to her time running for state office. In a July 10, 2020, tweet, Crockett claimed to have taken zero dollars from corporate PACs while her opposition had accepted nearly $200,000. A campaign finance disclosure covering the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, however, shows that Crockett accepted thousands in corporate PAC dollars. This means that her tweet was either inaccurate or she began accepting corporate cash shortly after attacking her opponent for doing so. While Crockett has long accepted contributions from corporate PACs, gifts from foreigners are new to her. Between Feb. 21 and 27, 2023, Crockett embarked on a trip to tour Doha, the capital of Qatar. The jaunt, which congressional records show cost over $17,000, was paid for by the United States-Qatar Business Council, a trade association with links to the Qatari government. Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family, is the Qatari managing director of the organization. Additionally, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council maintains a partnership with the Gulf Times, a Qatari state-run news outlet.

(AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili) During her comped trip to Doha, Crockett stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Lusail Doha, a five-star waterfront resort boasting seven luxury restaurants and an entire waterpark. Over the course of the trip, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council arranged multiple meetings between Crockett and high-ranking members of the Qatari government. Four other members of Congress — three Republicans and a Democrat — were also invited on the trip. ELITE US UNIVERSITIES PARTNER WITH ARM OF QATARI GOVERNMENT PUSHING ANTI-AMERICAN MEDIA Crockett also went on cultural exchange trips paid for by the Indian and Emirati governments, according to records. “The congresswoman files her financial disclosures and all required documents in accordance with federal law,” Crockett’s chief of staff told the Washington Examiner. 13 posted on 07/03/2025 8:12:39 AM PDT by Liz (This then is how we should pray...."Our Father, who art in heaven......" ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] To: cuz1961 BTTT 14 posted on 07/03/2025 8:13:28 AM PDT by nopardons [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: cuz1961 DNC should be footing the bill for the mass deportation. 15 posted on 07/03/2025 8:18:31 AM PDT by JudyinCanada (Praying that America's Golden Age includes Canada.)

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) first ran for state office in 2019, her campaign was funded almost entirely by small-dollar donors. As Crockett increased in prominence, however, cryptocurrency moguls, corporations, union bosses, and even foreign governments have lined up to shower her with resources. Crockett, who got her start practicing law, ran to represent a portion of Austin in the Texas House of Representatives in 2020. Early on, her state-level campaign counted on local individuals giving at most a couple hundred dollars apiece to support her. However, as she picked up steam, organized labor and business interests began cutting checks to her political committee as well. Crockett’s biggest financial windfall came during the 2022 election season when super PACs linked to cryptocurrency industry leaders like the since-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried pumped millions into supporting her bid to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson. Recommended Stories Zohran Mamdani took money from groups that help illegal immigrants avoid deportation Trump threatens to sue New York Times and CNN over Iran strike coverage Google promoted content from hijacked local news website posting pro-China content Since winning election to the House, Crockett has continued to enjoy contributions from corporate and union PACs. Foreign governments have also jumped aboard, with India, the United Arab Emirates, and a nonprofit group linked to the Qatari government all paying for Crockett and her family to go on expensive trips abroad, according to congressional disclosures. Crockett has emerged as a Democratic firebrand, frequently going viral for her spats with Republicans. Most recently, she has caught criticism for referring to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is wheelchair-bound, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Crockett later argued that the title was not related to the governor’s disability, a claim that was undercut after the Washington Free Beacon reported that she had “liked” content on Facebook making fun of Abbott’s paralysis. The sophomore congresswoman’s jab at Abbott is just one among her many controversial remarks, including criticizing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) for being in an interracial marriage. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) When it comes to policy, Crockett identifies as a progressive. For instance, the congresswoman has repeatedly railed against “corporate greed” and praised her colleagues for standing up against “corporate interests.” Campaign finance records, however, show that Crockett has accepted over $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. Her donors include pharmaceutical giants such as AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services firms such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and RTX, and household names such as McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon, and Toyota. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, along with other major unions, has also provided financial support to Crockett’s state and federal campaigns. Even before she took office, Protect our Future PAC and WEB3 Forward, two PACs funded by crypto moguls such as Bankman-Fried, Ben Horowitz, and Marc Andreessen, spent well over $2 million supporting Crockett’s campaign during a heated Democratic primary. Crockett’s stated disdain for corporate influence goes back to her time running for state office. In a July 10, 2020, tweet, Crockett claimed to have taken zero dollars from corporate PACs while her opposition had accepted nearly $200,000. A campaign finance disclosure covering the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, however, shows that Crockett accepted thousands in corporate PAC dollars. This means that her tweet was either inaccurate or she began accepting corporate cash shortly after attacking her opponent for doing so. While Crockett has long accepted contributions from corporate PACs, gifts from foreigners are new to her. Between Feb. 21 and 27, 2023, Crockett embarked on a trip to tour Doha, the capital of Qatar. The jaunt, which congressional records show cost over $17,000, was paid for by the United States-Qatar Business Council, a trade association with links to the Qatari government. Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family, is the Qatari managing director of the organization. Additionally, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council maintains a partnership with the Gulf Times, a Qatari state-run news outlet.

(AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili) During her comped trip to Doha, Crockett stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Lusail Doha, a five-star waterfront resort boasting seven luxury restaurants and an entire waterpark. Over the course of the trip, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council arranged multiple meetings between Crockett and high-ranking members of the Qatari government. Four other members of Congress — three Republicans and a Democrat — were also invited on the trip. ELITE US UNIVERSITIES PARTNER WITH ARM OF QATARI GOVERNMENT PUSHING ANTI-AMERICAN MEDIA Crockett also went on cultural exchange trips paid for by the Indian and Emirati governments, according to records. “The congresswoman files her financial disclosures and all required documents in accordance with federal law,” Crockett’s chief of staff told the Washington Examiner. 13 posted on 07/03/2025 8:12:39 AM PDT by Liz (This then is how we should pray...."Our Father, who art in heaven......" ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] To: cuz1961 BTTT 14 posted on 07/03/2025 8:13:28 AM PDT by nopardons [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: cuz1961 DNC should be footing the bill for the mass deportation. 15 posted on 07/03/2025 8:18:31 AM PDT by JudyinCanada (Praying that America's Golden Age includes Canada.)

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) first ran for state office in 2019, her campaign was funded almost entirely by small-dollar donors. As Crockett increased in prominence, however, cryptocurrency moguls, corporations, union bosses, and even foreign governments have lined up to shower her with resources. Crockett, who got her start practicing law, ran to represent a portion of Austin in the Texas House of Representatives in 2020. Early on, her state-level campaign counted on local individuals giving at most a couple hundred dollars apiece to support her. However, as she picked up steam, organized labor and business interests began cutting checks to her political committee as well. Crockett’s biggest financial windfall came during the 2022 election season when super PACs linked to cryptocurrency industry leaders like the since-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried pumped millions into supporting her bid to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson. Recommended Stories Zohran Mamdani took money from groups that help illegal immigrants avoid deportation Trump threatens to sue New York Times and CNN over Iran strike coverage Google promoted content from hijacked local news website posting pro-China content Since winning election to the House, Crockett has continued to enjoy contributions from corporate and union PACs. Foreign governments have also jumped aboard, with India, the United Arab Emirates, and a nonprofit group linked to the Qatari government all paying for Crockett and her family to go on expensive trips abroad, according to congressional disclosures. Crockett has emerged as a Democratic firebrand, frequently going viral for her spats with Republicans. Most recently, she has caught criticism for referring to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is wheelchair-bound, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Crockett later argued that the title was not related to the governor’s disability, a claim that was undercut after the Washington Free Beacon reported that she had “liked” content on Facebook making fun of Abbott’s paralysis. The sophomore congresswoman’s jab at Abbott is just one among her many controversial remarks, including criticizing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) for being in an interracial marriage. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) When it comes to policy, Crockett identifies as a progressive. For instance, the congresswoman has repeatedly railed against “corporate greed” and praised her colleagues for standing up against “corporate interests.” Campaign finance records, however, show that Crockett has accepted over $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. Her donors include pharmaceutical giants such as AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services firms such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and RTX, and household names such as McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon, and Toyota. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, along with other major unions, has also provided financial support to Crockett’s state and federal campaigns. Even before she took office, Protect our Future PAC and WEB3 Forward, two PACs funded by crypto moguls such as Bankman-Fried, Ben Horowitz, and Marc Andreessen, spent well over $2 million supporting Crockett’s campaign during a heated Democratic primary. Crockett’s stated disdain for corporate influence goes back to her time running for state office. In a July 10, 2020, tweet, Crockett claimed to have taken zero dollars from corporate PACs while her opposition had accepted nearly $200,000. A campaign finance disclosure covering the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, however, shows that Crockett accepted thousands in corporate PAC dollars. This means that her tweet was either inaccurate or she began accepting corporate cash shortly after attacking her opponent for doing so. While Crockett has long accepted contributions from corporate PACs, gifts from foreigners are new to her. Between Feb. 21 and 27, 2023, Crockett embarked on a trip to tour Doha, the capital of Qatar. The jaunt, which congressional records show cost over $17,000, was paid for by the United States-Qatar Business Council, a trade association with links to the Qatari government. Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family, is the Qatari managing director of the organization. Additionally, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council maintains a partnership with the Gulf Times, a Qatari state-run news outlet.

Title: BlackRock Wants Bitcoin Higher—IBIT Now Out-Earns Their S&P 500 Fund
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-higher-ibit-out-earns-sp-500-fund/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T13:30:01Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has surpassed the firm’s long-established iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) in annual revenue generation. The development, first highlighted in a June 2 report by Bloomberg, marks a milestone moment for institutional adoption and exposes a growing financial incentive among traditional giants to see BTC’s price rise. Despite being a fraction of IVV’s size in terms of assets under management, IBIT has now overtaken it in fee revenue. IBIT currently manages approximately $75 billion in assets and charges a 0.25% fee, generating around $187.2 million in estimated annual fees. In contrast, IVV, BlackRock’s flagship S&P 500 tracker, holds $624 billion but charges just 0.03%, netting about $187.1 million in fees. As Bloomberg’s Isabelle Lee put it, “a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund now generates more revenue than [BlackRock’s] signature tracker of the S&P 500 Index.” This revenue discrepancy, despite IVV’s immense asset base, stems from the sheer profitability of managing BTC exposure in an ETF wrapper, particularly given IBIT’s higher fee structure and the velocity of capital inflows it has witnessed. The fund has recorded inflows in all but one of the past 18 months and now holds over 55% of all US spot Bitcoin ETF assets. The explosive growth of IBIT is closely tied to the January 2024 decision by US regulators to approve spot ETFs, a watershed moment that brought Bitcoin further into the financial mainstream. This regulatory opening has unleashed a torrent of institutional capital, with hedge funds, pensions, family offices, and banks now actively allocating to Bitcoin in SEC-compliant vehicles. Market commentators were quick to highlight the implications. Anthony Pompliano noted succinctly on X: “BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF drives more revenue than its S&P 500 fund. Bitcoin has Wall Street’s full, undivided attention now.” Crypto analyst Jacob Canfield provided a more detailed financial interpretation, posting: “Blackrock makes more money the higher the price of Bitcoin goes, just an FYI. (not financial advice)” He elaborated further: “Some people don’t seem to understand my meaning. Blackrock makes 0.25% fees on their IBIT ETF. That currently translates to $184 million in annual revenue (just for custody) and it’s based on AUM (assets under management). That means if the price of Bitcoin goes to $1,000,000 (a 10X from here), they will make $1.84 billion per year in fees. This is why Blackrock is incentivized by higher prices in Bitcoin.” Canfield’s logic lays bare the core economic engine at work: BlackRock’s revenue from IBIT is a direct function of the BTC market price. Since ETF fees are derived as a percentage of AUM, any appreciation in price amplifies the dollar-denominated value of the assets under custody—and, by extension, BlackRock’s fee income. At current rates, each doubling of the BTC price could potentially yield nearly double the revenue for IBIT, assuming static inflows. The broader implication is profound: BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with nearly $10 trillion under management, is now structurally aligned with Bitcoin’s success. That alignment goes beyond product strategy or public messaging—it is embedded in fee economics. At press time, BTC traded at $109,240. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Solana’s first staking ETF outpaces XRP and ETH futures in opening day performance

SSK's debut day outshines contenders, ranking in top 1% of ETF launches with $33 million in trading volume. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Solana’s institutional appeal has surged, with data showing significant growth in both its staking Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) and Solana CME futures markets. The impressive performance translated into a 5% rise in SOL’s value in the last 24 hours to $155 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate’s data. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, known as SSK, achieved an impressive debut on June 2, drawing $12 million in inflows and generating $33 million in trading volume. Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that SSK’s first-day performance ranked in the top 1% for new ETF launches. Balchunas noted that the SSK’s $33 million trading volume on its opening day was exceptional, far outpacing the Solana and XRP futures ETFs. While the volume was much lower than Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, the result still indicates a robust investor interest in Solana. The analyst speculated that if the fund maintains its strong momentum, it could reach $10 million in assets under management by close of play today. As the first spot Solana ETF and the first staking ETF in the US, SSK offers a unique opportunity for investors to gain exposure to Solana while benefiting from staking yields. The fund aims to stake at least half of its assets to provide consistent yields to investors. However, SSK differs from the Bitcoin ETFs managed by BlackRock and others. SSK uses an Investment Company Act of 1940 structure, keeping more than 40 % of assets in foreign SOL ETPs to satisfy diversification rules. That makes it slightly different from the 33-Act spot Bitcoin/Ethereum ETFs, but the economic exposure is similar. VanEck, 21Shares, and others are still awaiting SEC approval on ‘true’ spot Solana ETFs, with analysts giving ~95 % odds they will clear by year-end. Meanwhile, the demand for Solana exposure is also evident in the performance of Solana CME futures. According to Coinglass data, open interest in these futures surged 13%, reaching an all-time high of $167 million. This marks a significant increase in institutional interest since Solana futures were first listed on the CME platform in March. The CME offers two types of Solana futures contracts, including the standard contracts (representing 500 SOL) and retail-friendly “micro” contracts (representing 25 SOL). These contracts are settled in cash rather than physical Solana, offering institutions a regulated method for gaining Solana exposure. The spike in open interest illustrates the rising institutional appetite for Solana-related financial products. However, this increased liquidity also brings the potential for greater volatility, as leveraged positions can lead to sharp price movements. The combination of a successful ETF launch and strong futures market activity is a clear signal of Solana’s growing institutional traction. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Antitrust enforcer Gail Slater on American innovation: ‘We can win the AI race against the Chinese without becoming like China’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/business/doj-antitrust-chief-is-betting-american-tech-will-beat-china/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Gail Slater, Donald Trump’s head of antitrust, is tasked with a formidable agenda that requires precision: Foster a business-friendly environment that lets tech companies stay big enough to compete with China while ensuring they don’t become excessively dominant. “It’s about enforcing antitrust robustly in a way that works for all Americans … that’s my starting point,” Slater, 53, told me in her first interview since taking on her role as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice a little over 100 days ago. Slater took over a serious docket of cases that includes suits against Google, in regards to search and ad tech; Apple, for its smartphone market dominance; Visa, in relation to debit card payment processing; and Live Nation/Ticketmaster and its live entertainment business. While she won’t comment on the status of those cases, she’s been a key advisor urging Trump to stay the course on antitrust enforcement — despite tech companies’ efforts to sway him. (When I asked how frequently she discusses agenda with President Trump, she told me, “We get a lot of signals from the White House in the form of Executive Orders.”) Slater is deeply committed and believes aggressive antitrust enforcement can benefit consumers in countless ways — even on seemingly unrelated issues. “Speech and the censorship of speech can be downstream of [tech companies] market power,” she noted. Not everyone on the right agrees with her. Some Republicans, like Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), believe the US government should tread lightly with tech companies. They worry that too much regulation could unintentionally give China a dangerous advantage when it comes to artificial intelligence. But Slater feels antitrust efforts could actually give the US a leg-up. “Companies competing against one another innovate. That’s the free market at its finest,” she explained. “We can win the AI race against the Chinese without becoming like China… we will win the global race to AI the American way.” Bringing cases against massive companies can cost millions, making Slater’s job — at a time when everyone in the federal government is under the gun to cut costs — especially challenging. “The big tech cases alone are a huge, huge lift, both from a human resource standpoint, a scale standpoint when it comes to documents and experts and how we put those cases on a trial,” Slater said. This story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC’s power players (and those who aspire to be). Her efforts, she said, have to be “low resource, high return on investment things.” And even though she is focused on ending unfair monopolies, she’s also trying to implement as many pro-business policies as she can. On the front end, Slater is now allowing early terminations to the (previously) mandatory 30-day waiting period for mergers to close on deals the DOJ deems benign. Since taking the helm, she has granted 58 of 322 filings, worth $71 billion. “In particular, we are taking settlements in merger cases where the previous administration took none,” she said. At the back end of deals, she has embraced the use of consent decrees — allowing parties to resolve competitive overlaps by divesting assets to qualified buyers, a practice the prior administration largely avoided. “We listened hard to concerns that Wall Street and others had about the policy of the prior administration on deal flow,” she told me of efforts to simplify rules where she can. “We inherited a historic docket and we want to be responsible stewards of that, But we’re also setting [the agenda] by fixing the merger review process to make it more transparent, to make work better for deal makers.” Slater, who is soft-spoken, jokes “this is me raising my voice” when talking about the efforts they’ve already made to cut over-regulation. She has also teamed up with the Federal Trade Commission to eradicate what she describes as “useless” regulations. “We opened up a docket and we said to anybody interested with expertise in the area, tell us the regulations that you’re aware that are hindering competition — and the ways in which that could be fixed. Because we want to support free market competition,” Slater said. “That’s the goal here.” Another tool is using amicus briefs to strategically influence federal court cases, like they have done in Texas v. BlackRock — a high-profile antitrust lawsuit where states allege major investors like BlackRock colluded to reduce coal production, raising energy prices. She said it is a way of supporting American companies and administration policies with relatively inexpensive but high-impact interventions. Slater, who was born in Dublin and studied at Oxford, moved to the US in 2003 and worked as a trial attorney at the FTC for a decade. She held positions at the Internet Association, Fox Corporation, Roku and, during the first Trump administration, the National Economic Council, before advising JD Vance on antitrust issues while he was an Ohio senator. She’s excited moving beyond the cases left to her by her predecessor. “A priority for me is health care,” she told me. “We’re looking to set a positive agenda around drug pricing and health care more broadly.

Ethereum finds its footing, but is it enough for lift-off? As the broader market shifts back into bullish territory, short-sellers are being systematically flushed out across major assets. Ethereum [ETH] followed suit. A sharp 6.78% daily gain on the 2nd of July drove ETH back to the $2,600 level, liquidating nearly $90 million in short positions in the process. The real question now is whether ETH can convert this reclaimed level into a springboard for continuation. Risk appetite appears to be returning, elevating the stakes for Ethereum’s next move. Ethereum’s daily structure reveals a clear inflection point. On the 12th of June, Open Interest (OI) hit a record $41.75 billion, coinciding with ETH reclaiming the $2,800 level for the first time since February. However, beneath the surface, stress signals began to emerge. Despite steady spot demand, the number of whale wallets holding more than 10,000 ETH dropped to just 884, marking its lowest level since 2016. This sharp decline triggered aggressive deleveraging, with over $20 billion in OI unwound in under three weeks. The aftermath was a classic bull trap. While Bitcoin[BTC] corrected 10.8% over the following two weeks, ETH plunged 24.6% to $2,113. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) Yet, a rebound that followed marked a key shift in price behavior. ETH rallied 8.28% the very next day and slipped into a tight holding pattern between $2,400 and $2,500 for ten straight sessions. This kind of sideways action after a major flush often hints at quiet accumulation. If that’s what’s playing out here, Ethereum’s clean reclaim of the $2,600 level could represent a strategic pivot, laying the foundation for a sustained breakout with real positioning behind it. As Ethereum pushes through a critical supply overhang, market structure enters a sensitive zone. At the time of writing, Binance’s Long/Short Ratio was locked at 50:50. That kind of balance rarely lasts, and if bears sense weakness or holding pressure, shorts could quickly take over. This makes order book behavior especially important to watch. On the 2nd of July alone, whales rotated over $3 billion in ETH liquidity: 45,155 ETH flowed out of Kraken, while 60,000 ETH moved from Arbitrum to Binance. Source: CryptoQuant Meanwhile, BlackRock continues to accumulate quietly, having added ETH-related positions on 29 of the last thirty trading days. Structurally, Ethereum’s fundamentals are heating up too. Daily transactions have surged to 1.45 million, on par with 2021 bull cycle peaks, while DeFi lending is up 43% this quarter, reflecting renewed capital deployment. This backdrop reinforces that Ethereum’s breakout above $2,600 is structurally driven. If sustained, it sets the stage for another short squeeze, potentially targeting a move toward $2,800.

Title: First Solana ETF Goes Live, Hinting At A Potential Boom For Altcoin Funds

The altcoin market is making significant inroads into traditional finance, with the recent launch of the first Solana ETF on the Cboe BZX stock exchange in Chicago. Named the REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF, this fund is designed for investors looking to gain exposure to Solana. In addition to tracking Solana’s price movements, the fund also offers a variable monthly dividend, currently set at 7.3%. Following this Solana ETF debut on Wednesday, SOL’s price surged by 2%, reaching around $152, while the investment vehicle attracted about $20 million in inflows by midday, as noted by Greg King, CEO of REX Financial. This launch marks a notable shift in how retail investors can access cryptocurrency assets, particularly at a time when many brokerages, such as Vanguard, do not facilitate direct purchases on crypto exchanges. The emergence of cryptocurrency ETFs, which serve as traditional market wrappers for digital assets, is increasingly appealing to both individual and institutional investors. Initially perceived as niche products, the introduction of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year have notably paved the way for broader acceptance of the crypto market, culminating in the arrival of Solana’s fund. These ETFs not only provide a means for new investors to enter the crypto space but also allow for portfolio diversification without the need to navigate the complexities of direct cryptocurrency purchases. For years, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stymied the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns over potential market manipulation. However, a pivotal ruling in October 2023 deemed the SEC’s rejections of Grayscale’s application for a Bitcoin ETF “arbitrary and capricious,” leading to a wave of new products in early 2024. Major financial players, including BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck, entered the market with their own spot Bitcoin ETFs, contributing to an influx of nearly $50 billion into these investment vehicles. Following the success of Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock and other firms rolled out Ethereum ETFs in July 2024, prompting additional applications for various other cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Litecoin (LTC), with Solana included. King noted that under a more favorable regulatory environment with President Donald Trump’s approach toward digital assets, a significant increase in ETF approvals from the SEC could be expected, particularly as the financial landscape shifts with the current administration. As reported by Bitcoinist on Tuesday, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have raised their projections for the approval of single-asset spot crypto ETFs, now estimating a 95% chance of approval by the end of 2025. Seyffart expressed optimism about a forthcoming wave of new exchange-traded funds in the latter half of 2025, signaling a transformative period for the integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream finance.

Title: UK bond rout draws Truss comparisons
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0703/1521608-uk-bond-rout-draws-truss-comparisons/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T07:08:09Z
Full Content:
British government bonds tumbled sharply yesterday as a tearful appearance by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in parliament a day after the government backed down on its welfare reforms reignited concern over Britain's finances. Reeves was attending Prime Minister's Questions following the government's decision to sharply scale back plans to cut benefits. The sharp plunge in British assets immediately drew comparisons with Liz Truss' short-lived premiership nearly three years ago, which was derailed by a bond market selloff. Investors are monitoring Reeves' status after the UK government's reversal on welfare reforms meant the plans would no longer save taxpayers any money, shredding the margin Britain relies on to meet its fiscal rules. The welfare reform U-turn was "signalling that the Labour Party is a lot less concerned about what the gilt market thinks," said Gordon Shannon, portfolio manager, TwentyFour Asset Management. "I would have thought it was seared into politicians' memories what happened to Liz Truss," he added. The yield on the 10-year government bond, or gilt, rose as much as 22 basis points on the day at one point, to 4.681%, as investors ditched British debt. It then recovered somewhat to 4.60%. At its peak, the benchmark yield was set for its largest one-day jump since October 2022, the aftermath of Truss' chaotic package of large, unfunded tax cuts that scuttled her premiership. During the depths of the 2022 crisis, the yield on the 10-year gilt rose by 50 bps in a single day at one point. The selloff also hit very long dated gilts, and 30-year yields rose 17 basis points. "The latest headline would suggest more uncertainty with regards to the current government," said Simon Blundel, head of European fundamental fixed income investments at BlackRock.

Investors in bonds around the world are growing increasingly nervous about government deficits from Japan to the US, with Britain seen as among the more vulnerable. Earlier yesterday, British assets were trading slightly lower, but the selloff intensified rapidly after Reeves appeared alongside Prime Minister Kier Starmer during the weekly prime minister's questions looking exhausted and upset. Traders also focused on comments from Starmer seemingly not endorsing Reeves, though Starmer's press secretary later said Reeves has his full support, and she was upset because of "a personal matter". Reeves has repeatedly emphasised her commitment to self-imposed fiscal rules, limiting the amount Britain will borrow, and, analysts said, yesterday's market moves reflected fears that she would be replaced, creating even more uncertainty. Reeves has also been blamed by some Labour members of parliament for pushing for billions of pounds of savings that were described as cruel and targeting the most vulnerable. Sterling dropped around 1% against the dollar and also weakened sharply against the euro, which rose 0.8% to its highest on the pound in two months. Britain's domestically focused mid-cap index was down 1.3% on the day, sharply underperforming European stocks. "The deficit is going to have to be closed somehow, clearly the signal from yesterday is that can't come from substantial spending cuts, I don’t think it’s possible for the government to borrow the money, that leaves tax rises," Nick Rees, head of macro research at Monex Europe, said. "It's a pretty ugly outlook for sterling," he added. Accreditation: Reuters © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Jio-Blackrock will expand Indian stock market, but not a threat to first-generation founders, says Zerodhas Nitin Kamath

New Delhi [India], : If any company can expand the current market, it is Jio-Blackrock with its huge distribution network, but it will not be a threat to first generation founders noted online brokerage platform Zerodha's Chief Executive Officer , Nithin Kamath, on the social media platform 'X'.Nithin Kamath via his post on 'X' expressed optimism regarding the same. He said, "Many people asked me about Jio-BlackRock getting a stockbroking license. Firstly, this is great news." Kamath further added that, "If anyone can expand the markets beyond the top 10 crore Indians, it's probably Jio with all its distribution might."However, he also raised concerns about the expansion of the Indian stock market. "The biggest issue for the Indian markets is a lack of breadth in participation. We're largely limited to the top 10 crore Indians," he said.Kamath also shared his opinion on what his thoughts are on broking. He believes that Zerodha is not something which is following 'vanity metrics' and the principle online brokerage platform is to 'stay to stay profitable.' "At the heart of our philosophy is to always do the right thing for customers," Nithin Kamath said. Kamath also emphasised that Zerodha's strategy is not to pressure consumers to trade and to make sure that there are no obtrusive notifications, dark patterns, etc., adding that customers who trade less have a better chance of long-term success. However, Nithin Kamath also reflected on the role of other financial services businesses in the sector, who are constantly seeking to grow their business at any cost. "And yeah, I still feel our real competition is going to be more from first-generation founders who are running, breathing, and always thinking about broking. I somehow don't feel it will really come from incumbents. This is not a business where having deep pockets means you have a large moat," said Nithin Kamath.

ByForbes Press Releases ByForbes Press Releases, Forbes Staff. Red Bull’s Chalerm Yoovidhya & family retain top spot SINGAPORE (July 3, 2025) – The combined wealth of tycoons on the 2025 Forbes list of Thailand’s 50 Richest rose more than 11% to US$170.5 billion, despite slower-than-expected economic growth amid trade tensions and mounting political uncertainty. The complete list can be found here, as well as in the July issue of Forbes Asia and the August issue of Forbes Thailand. Overall, the net worths of nearly half the listees were up with the biggest dollar jump—$8.5 billion—recorded by the Red Bull family, led by Chalerm Yoovidhya. In the No. 1 position for the second year in a row, their wealth skyrocketed to a record $44.5 billion as annual revenue of the energy drinks giant rose to €11.2 billion ($12.9 billion) in 2024 on worldwide sales of nearly 13 billion cans. The Chearavanont brothers of the Charoen Pokphand group retained their position as the country’s second-richest with their net worth up by 23% to $35.7 billion. The group is doubling down on digital infrastructure, investing $1 billion with BlackRock to build data centers. The group’s fintech unit Ascend Money recently got approval to set up a virtual bank. Energy-and-telecoms tycoon Sarath Ratanavadi climbed two spots to No. 3 for the first time with $12 billion, up from $9.2 billion last year. Completing the merger between his Gulf Energy Development and Intouch Holdings and listing the combined entity in April as Gulf Development powered his ascent. Taking the No. 4 spot is beverage tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, whose net worth was relatively flat at $10.5 billion. In a key move, the patriarch transferred some holdings to his five children but being the group founder, the fortune continues to be listed under his name. Rounding out the top five on the list is the Central Group’s Chirathivat family, who saw their wealth decline 13% to $8.6 billion, as weak consumer sentiment impacted the retail sector. A total of 19 listees faced a downdraft. Coffee magnate Prayudh Mahagitsiri’s (No. 18, $1.4 billion) wealth took a hit as his PM Group’s long-standing joint venture with Nestle ended. Two patriarchs passed away since the last ranking: Vanich Chaiyawan, chairman emeritus of Thai Life; and Pongsak Viddayakorn, cofounder of Bangkok Dusit Medical Services, who went on to build a separate healthcare business under Principal Capital. Their fortunes are now listed under the Chaiyawan family (No. 6, $4.2 billion) and the Viddayakorn family (No. 30, $1.1 billion). Four people fell from the ranks, including renewable energy magnate Somphote Ahunai, whose Energy Absolute faced financial stress. The minimum net worth to qualify for the list dropped to $420 million from last year’s $550 million. The top 10 richest in Thailand are: This list was compiled using shareholding and financial information obtained from the families and individuals, stock exchanges and analysts, the Stock Exchange of Thailand and regulatory agencies. Unlike the Forbes World’s Billionaires list rankings, this list encompasses family fortunes, including those shared among extended families of multiple generations. Public fortunes were calculated based on stock prices and exchange rates as on June 13. Private companies were valued based on comparisons with similar companies that are publicly traded. The list can also include foreign citizens with business, residential or other ties to the country, or citizens who don’t reside in the country but have significant business or other ties to the country.

The asset’s price has fallen 48% since it hit $293 in January, not long after the debut of U.S. President Donald Trump’s meme coin. Although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve several crypto-focused ETFs this year, Wednesday’s debut represents a new chapter “in the crypto ETF story,” Anchorage Digital co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley said in a statement. As the only U.S. federally chartered digital asset bank, Anchorage is safeguarding the ETF’s digital assets, while using its platform to stake the Solana. McCauley said that Anchorage’s innovation would hopefully translate to other products. “The launch of crypto staking ETFs marks a win for consumers and a significant step forward in full access to the crypto ecosystem,” he said. Anchorage began letting institutions stake Ethereum in the U.S. in 2022, not long before Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model. In April, BlackRock tapped Anchorage as a custodian to safeguard some funds for its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Anchorage’s services mirror a regular bank, but it’s allowed to hold cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients. As far as crypto ETFs in the U.S. go, many asset managers have chosen Coinbase as a custodian, including Grayscale Investments and Bitwise. Unlike spot crypto ETFs approved by the SEC last year, the Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF is structured under the Investment Company Act. That distinction required a qualified custodian, like Anchorage, to hold the fund’s assets. On Wednesday, the Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF got off to a “healthy start,” Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart wrote on X, formerly Twitter, pointing to $8 million in trading volume that the fund notched in its first 20 minutes.

The Chearavanont brothers’ agribusiness-to-telecoms conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Group (CP Group) has lately been on a digital and regional expansion drive. In June, its fintech arm Ascend Money secured approval to establish a virtual bank, which paves the way for the firm to leverage its digital platform TrueMoney, with its countrywide base of 34 million users. ss A month earlier, True IDC, the data center and cloud services arm of the group’s telecoms giant True, which is led by its chairman Suphachai Chearavanont, teamed up with a BlackRock unit to invest $1 billion over the next three to five years to build data centers in Thailand, an up and coming ASEAN digital hub. After its 2023 merger with rival Total Access Communications, True is now the country’s largest mobile operator with nearly 49 million subscribers. With an eye on regional expansion, CP Group will be setting up a $1 billion private equity fund with Philippine sovereign wealth fund Maharlika Investment Corp. to invest in agriculture, digital innovation and renewable energy in the Philippines. Over the past 12 months, the net worth of the Chearavanont brothers has gone up by $6.7 billion to $35.7 billion.

ByPhisanu Phromchanya andNaazneen Karmali ByPhisanu Phromchanya, Contributor andNaazneen Karmali, Forbes Staff. No. 1 Charlerm Yoovidhya. This story is part of Forbes’ coverage of Thailand’s Richest 2025. See the full list here. Thailand’s economy is growing at a slower-than-expected pace amid trade tensions and mounting political uncertainty. While a stronger baht mostly offset the 14% decline of the stock market index from a year ago, a huge boost in the fortunes of the top three propelled a more than 11% rise in combined wealth to $170.5 billion. ss Overall, the net worths of nearly half the listees were up with the biggest dol­lar jump—$8.5 billion—recorded by the Red Bull family, led by Chalerm Yoovidhya. In the No. 1 position for the second year in a row, their wealth skyrocketed to a record $44.5 billion as annual revenue of the energy drinks giant rose to €11.2 billion ($12.9 billion) in 2024 on worldwide sales of nearly 13 billion cans. The Chearavanont brothers of the Charoen Pokphand group retained their position as the country’s second-richest with their net worth up by 23% to $35.7 billion. The group is doubling down on digital infrastructure, investing $1 billion with BlackRock to build data centers. Its fintech unit Ascend Money recently got approval to set up a virtual bank. Energy-and-telecoms tycoon Sarath Ratanavadi climbed two spots to land at No. 3 for the first time with $12 billion. Completing the merger between his Gulf Energy Development and Intouch Holdings and listing the combined entity in April as Gulf Development powered his ascent. Beverage tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi’s net worth was relatively flat at $10.5 billion and he slipped to fourth place. In a key move, the patriarch transferred some holdings to his five children in May but being the group founder, the fortune continues to be listed under his name. Amid weak consumer sentiment in the retail sector, the Chirathivat family’s wealth was down 13% to $8.6 billion. Last October, the group got a new partner: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund acquired a 40% stake in British retailer Selfridges from Austria’s Signa Holdings. (Central group retains 60%.) A total of 19 listees faced a downdraft. Coffee magnate Prayudh Mahagitsiri’s wealth took a hit as his PM Group’s long-standing joint venture with Nestle ended. Two patriarchs died since the last ranking: Vanich Chaiyawan, chairman emeritus of insurance giant Thai Life; and Pongsak Viddayakorn, cofounder of hospital chain Bangkok Dusit Medical Services, who went on to build a separate healthcare business under Principal Capital. Their fortunes are now listed under the Chaiyawan family and the Viddayakorn family. Though the minimum net worth to qualify for the list dropped to $420 million from last year’s $550 million, four people fell from the ranks. A notable absentee is renewable energy magnate Somphote Ahunai, whose Energy Absolute faced financial stress.

Title: JPMorgan’s Blockchain Arm Kinexys Tests Tokenized Carbon Credits With S&P Global

Global bank JPMorgan’s blockchain arm Kinexys is working with S&P Global Commodity Insights to explore tokenization for managing and issuing carbon credits, the firms said on Wednesday. The project, according to a press release, focuses on testing how tokenized carbon credits can be created and tracked using blockchain infrastructure. These credits, which represent greenhouse gas reductions from projects like reforestation or renewable energy, are often bought by companies aiming to offset their emissions. The firms will focus on how blockchain handles credit lifecycle management, data compatibility and registry access. "Our shared aim is to establish standardized infrastructure that enhances information and price transparency, paving the way for financial innovation and increased market liquidity," said Keerthi Moudgal, head of product at Kinexys Digital Assets. The initiative underscores JPMorgan's growing presence in the red-hot tokenization space, a sector that has attracted global banks and asset managers such as BlackRock, HSBC and Citi. Tokenization is the process of using blockchain rails to transact with traditional financial instruments, promising more efficient operations, around-the-clock settlements and increased transparency. JPMorgan has been an early leader operating its own private blockchain network Kinexys, formerly known as Onyx and JPM Coin, which now settles $2 billion in daily transactions, according to the bank. It also piloted last month a deposit token called JPMD on Base, an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by Coinbase.

Title: Solana’s first ETF goes live as crypto analysts predict surge of new altcoin funds

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. First Bitcoin, then Ethereum, and now Solana. The crypto industry is flooding traditional markets with assets pegged to cryptocurrencies that mom-and-pop investors can buy up from their brokerage accounts. On Wednesday morning, the first Solana exchange-traded fund, or ETF, went live on Cboe BZX, a stock exchange based in Chicago. Dubbed the REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF, the fund is available to investors who want exposure to Solana, one of the top cryptocurrencies whose market capitalization is about $81 billion, according to data from Binance. In addition to tracking the price of Solana, the fund, managed jointly by REX Financial and its sister firm Osprey Funds, also pays holders a variable monthly dividend whose current rate is 7.3% The price of Solana jumped 2% after markets opened Wednesday to now around $151. The ETF has seen inflows of about $20 million before midday, Greg King, founder and CEO of REX Financial, told Fortune. When they were first launched, cryptocurrency ETFs seemed exotic to many retail investors, but the successive debut of a Bitcoin, Ethereum, and now a Solana fund suggest the products are gaining a broader appeal. The ETFs also represent an entry point for new crypto investors at a time when brokerages like Vanguard don’t let their users plug into a crypto exchange and buy the newest, hottest token. The arrival of spot crypto ETFs, or traditional market wrappers around the current price of a cryptocurrency, allow traditional and institutional investors to allocate a portion of their portfolio to crypto. For years, the Securities and Exchange Commission blocked the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., even though similar products were available in Europe. The SEC worried that the crypto-tied assets would be prone to market manipulation. Grayscale, a crypto investment firm, battled the regulator in the courts, and, in October 2023, a judge said the SEC’s rejections of Grayscale’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF were “arbitrary and capricious.” In January 2024, a slew of spot Bitcoin ETFs went live, including an entry into the category from the asset management titan BlackRock. Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, almost $50 billion have poured into the investment products, according to data from SoSoValue. In July 2024, BlackRock and other issuers launched ETFs for Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. And then, other issuers filed ETF applications for a slew of other cryptocurrencies, including Solana. “I frankly think it would have been more difficult with the previous administration,” said King, the CEO of REX Financial. Now, amid a more friendly financial regime under President Donald Trump, analysts anticipate that the SEC will approve many of the applications to launch cryptocurrency-tied funds. “We expect a wave of new ETFs in this second half of 2025,” James Seyffart, a research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said on X. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Ethereum ETFs forecast to attract $10 billion by late 2025, says Bitwise CIO

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan foresees Ethereum ETFs surging due to easy adoption via tokenized stocks and stablecoins. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan predicted that Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could experience up to $10 billion in inflows during the second half of 2025. His forecast, made on July 2, builds on the strong momentum observed over the past months, with Ethereum ETFs already bringing in $1.17 billion in inflows in June alone. According to SoSoValue data, Ethereum ETFs have seen total inflows of approximately $1.5 billion for the first half of 2025, despite a brief dip in March when $403 million was pulled out. These funds have recorded inflows in five of the year’s first six months, underlining the sustained investor interest and bolstering Hougan’s optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year. Hougan attributes the growing interest in Ethereum to its expanding role as a platform for tokenized assets, including stocks and stablecoins. The Bitwise executive believes that integrating these assets onto Ethereum provides a straightforward narrative that traditional investors can easily grasp. According to him: “Flows into Ethereum ETFs are going to accelerate significantly in H2. The combination of stablecoins & stocks moving over Ethereum is an easy-to-grasp narrative for traditional investors.” Ethereum has firmly established itself as the backbone of the crypto industry. Its dominance in the stablecoin market and increasing adoption by major institutions like BlackRock and Robinhood for asset tokenization have made it a key player in the sector. Meanwhile, the anticipated approval of staking-enabled Ethereum ETFs will be another major catalyst for Ethereum ETF growth in the year’s second half. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently clarified that crypto staking does not qualify as securities offerings. Market observers believe this guidance paves the way for new Ethereum-based financial products, which would attract more attention to the current spot ETFs. Additionally, the Ethereum network itself is undergoing significant upgrades, with the Ethereum Foundation focusing on scalability through developments like the Pectra upgrade and the upcoming Glamsterdam release. Market observers believe these enhancements will solidify Ethereum’s infrastructure and position the network for long-term success. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF drives more revenue than its S&P 500 fund
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/07/02/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-revenue-sp-500-fund/
Time Published: 2025-07-02T16:23:09Z

At the world’s biggest asset manager, a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund now generates more revenue than its signature tracker of the S&P 500 Index. The roughly $75 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT) has seen a torrent of cash from institutional and retail investors alike, drawing inflows in all but one of the last 18 months. With an expense ratio of 0.25%, the fund brings in an estimated $187.2 million in annual fees, based on back-of-the-envelope math calculated by Bloomberg as of July 1. That slightly edges out the $187.1 million made by BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which is nearly nine times larger at around $624 billion in assets, and charges just 0.03%. “IBIT overtaking IVV in annual fee revenue is reflective of both the surging investor demand for Bitcoin and the significant fee compression in core equity exposure,” said Nate Geraci, president at NovaDius Wealth Management. “Although spot Bitcoin ETFs are priced very competitively, IBIT is proof that investors are willing to pay up for exposures they view as truly additive to their portfolios.” BlackRock declined to comment. Since spot Bitcoin ETFs started trading in Jan. 2024, IBIT has attracted $52 billion of the combined $54 billion in net inflows, and it holds more than 55% of all Bitcoin ETF assets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, the 25-year-old IVV is the third-largest ETF among the more than 4,300 products in the US, only trailing Vanguard Group and State Street Investment Management funds that also track the S&P 500. A surge of cash rushed into Bitcoin ETFs after US regulators reluctantly opened the door to mainstream adoption, prompting an influx of capital from hedge funds, pensions and banks. IBIT, which has an expense ratio similar to its peers, is already a top-20 ETF by trading volume, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s an indication of how much pent-up demand there was for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin as part of their overall portfolio without having to open a separate account somewhere else,” said Paul Hickey, cofounder of Bespoke Investment Group. “It also illustrates the leadership of Bitcoin in the crypto space where it’s perceived utility as a store of value has essentially left the others in its dust.” Bitcoin’s supremacy over smaller altcoins has widened, with the world’s largest cryptocurrency trading above $100,000, propelled by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Wall Street’s buying spree has been led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has used its cash to accumulate a mountain of Bitcoin. Hedge funds have also piled into the firm’s convertible debt, capitalizing on arbitrage trades that involve buying the bonds while shorting the stock. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bolt’s millennial founder has just ‘killed’ its unlimited PTO perk because it was actually causing burnout

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. On paper, unlimited PTO sounds like the holy grail of benefits a company can offer its employees—the ability to take endless vacations and avoid burnout. But for the $11 billion fintech startup Bolt, (not to be confused with the Uber rival, also called Bolt), unlimited PTO has been a double-edged sword that has caused more problems than solutions. “We just killed unlimited PTO at Bolt,” its founder and CEO, Ryan Breslow has just revealed on LinkedIn. “It sounds progressive, but it’s totally broken. When time off is undefined, the good ones don’t take PTO. The bad ones take too much.” While this is contrary to research from financial services firm Empower, which found that employees with unlimited PTO take on average 16 days off versus 14 days for those with limited policies, Breslow said much of that time was taken off by “b performers”—leaving high performers to pick up the slack. “This leads to A-performer burnout. B-performer luxuries. And feelings of unfairness across the board,” the millennial boss explained. “So we’re flipping the script: no more confusion. Every Bolter now gets four weeks of paid vacation (yes, the traditional corporate standard), with the opportunity to accrue more with tenure. Not optional,” Breslow added. “We mandate everyone take all four weeks off.” Now, the company is capping annual leave at around four weeks—but Bolt workers can accrue a maximum of 25 days leave with tenure. “We believe a team executing at the pace and scale we do deserves real, protected time off, not vague promises,” a Bolt spokesperson echoed in a statement to Fortune. “When we saw in our own data that our A-players weren’t taking enough time away, we knew we had to fix it.” Breslow rejoined Bolt this year after a rocky few months that included rounds of layoffs and a failed fundraising attempt that carried a $14 billion valuation. It was last valued at $11 billion in 2022, with investment coming from top firms like BlackRock. Reshaping Bolt’s culture has been a centrepiece of the 31-year-old’s changes since retaking the helm in March. On top of the PTO change, Breslow also publicly announced the company was doing away with its HR department in favor of “people ops”—which is more focused on efficiency over fluff, he wrote on LinkedIn. “HR is the wrong energy, format, and approach,” he said. “People ops empowers managers, streamlines decision making, and keeps the company moving at lightning speed.” The company also had some wins in recent weeks, including securing partnerships with Klarna and Palantir, but the only way to make sure that continues to happen, Breslow said, is to ensure top talent can thrive. “If we’re asking people to move fast, build hard, and operate at the highest level, we need to protect their recovery time with the same intensity,” Breslow said. “Execution requires clarity. That applies to PTO, too.” Despite growing calls from workers for better work-life balance and indications that unlimited PTO could lead to outperforming the S&P 500, the policy remains embraced by just 7% of employers, according to SHRM. Netflix is considered to be an early pioneer of the policy. Reed Hastings, the billionaire cofounder of the streaming service, has said he takes six weeks of vacation each year—and encourages his employees to do the same. “I take a lot of vacation and I’m hoping that certainly sets an example,” the former Netflix CEO said in 2015. “It is helpful. You often do your best thinking when you’re off hiking in some mountain or something. You get a different perspective on things.” Today, the company claims to not have a strict 9-to-5 workday–or even holiday schedule—and encourages workers to take time off to observe what’s important and when their mind and body need a break. More than a quarter of workers, or 26%, say they would consider a lower-paying job if it offered the unlimited option. At the same time, shifting to the policy has sometimes backfired. In 2014, Tribune Publishing—the company behind the Chicago Tribune and formerly the Los Angeles Times—attempted to transition from limited to unlimited PTO, but faced backlash from its employees. Less than two weeks later, the publisher reversed course after receiving “valuable input from employees,” citing that the new policy actually just “created confusion and concern within the company.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: 'Not A Business Where Deep Pockets Mean A Large Moat': Nithin Kamath On Jio-Blackrock
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/not-a-business-where-deep-pockets-mean-a-large-moat-nithin-kamath-on-jio-blackrock

Zerodha Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Nithin Kamath said on Wednesday that he does not see a competitive threat from the mutual funds and investment company Jio-Blackrock receiving a stock-broking license. Jio-Blackrock was formed as a 50:50 joint venture between telecommunication company Jio an arm of Reliance Industries Ltd., and Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, based in the US. The company paired Jio's digital reach and interconnected software service networks with Blackrock's 'Alladin Platform' to provide tech-driven analytics to customers. Many people asked me about Jio-BlackRock getting a stockbroking license. Firstly, this is great news. The biggest issue for the Indian markets is a lack of breadth in participation. We're largely limited to the top 10 crore Indians.If anyone can expand the markets beyond theâ¦ Kamath, in a post on social media platform X, said he sees primary competition coming in from first-generation founders who he described as "running, breathing, and always thinking about broking". "This is not a business where having deep pockets means you have a large moat," the co-founder of the discount brokerage firm said. Kamath said that Jio-Blackrock may expand the breadth in participation for investments saying that it is largely limited to 10 crore Indians. "If anyone can expand the markets beyond the top 10 crore Indians, it's probably Jio with all its distribution might," he said. The joint venture reportedly aims to provide its services to people across various income groups to reach those consumers who don't usually have the capital to invest by offering low-risk investment plans with a minimum investment of Rs 500. Kamath said that Zerodha was not chasing "vanity metrics" and isn't focused on using plans to draw customers in and changing the pricing structure once they have them. He enumerated the firm's principal philosophy as being against pushing customers to invest and making sure they don't have unnecessary notifications or dark patterns. "We understand that in the long term, the odds of success are better if customers trade less; most of our product decisions are based on this," he said. He said the company was "in it for the long haul" and focused on providing product offerings that help their customers grow. "I don't know if you can say the same about many other financial services businesses in the industry, who are constantly looking to grow at any cost," Kamath said.
