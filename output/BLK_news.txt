$600B in futures inflow could be on the horizon as analysts say Europe‚Äôs new ETNs could ignite the next wave of mainstream inflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The 12 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETFs) in the United States reversed sharply last week, recording $1.2 billion in net outflows. According to SoSoValue data, this was their second-largest weekly setback since launching in January 2024. The pullback snapped a two-week run of inflows that had brought in more than $5 billion, a period many read as proof of deepening institutional conviction. Data from SoSoValue show that investors pulled capital from nearly every major issuer. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT recorded a $276 million outflow, while Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC saw $169 million leave. Other major issuers, such as ARK Invest‚Äôs ARKB and Bitwise‚Äôs BITB, lost $290 million and $128 million, respectively, while Grayscale‚Äôs two funds shed $321 million. The reversal followed a volatile week for Bitcoin, which briefly dipped below $104,000 during the reporting period. Notably, this was its lowest price level since June. Industry experts linked the drawdown to macroeconomic conditions triggered by US-China tariff wars, that shook confidence in risk assets like Bitcoin. However, the flagship digital crypto asset has rebounded strongly above $110,000 as of press time amid recent developments in the market. While US flows turned defensive, a different story that would reshape retail access for Bitcoin was unfolding across the Atlantic. On Oct. 20, Bitcoin exchange-traded notes (ETNs) officially began trading on the London Stock Exchange. This marks the end of the UK‚Äôs three-year retail ban on crypto investment products. BlackRock led the debut with its iShares Bitcoin ETP, joined by other leading issuers like Bitwise. Meanwhile, early feedback about these products has been mixed, but they have still shown promising signs. ByteTree founder Charlie Morris said initial trading activity showed ‚Äúsuccess with platforms such as Interactive Investor, Swissquote, and Trading 212,‚Äù though some brokers like AJ Bell were slower to support access. Still, Bradley Duke, Bitwise‚Äôs head of Europe, opined that the launch of these products would mark a ‚Äúbig week‚Äù for retail investors because the ‚Äúdirection of travel is clear for crypto.‚Äù With a new wave of adoption emerging across the Atlantic and renewed institutional focus on Bitcoin, Galaxy Research believes that crypto investment products could attract up to $600 billion in new inflows as traditional financial institutions broaden distribution. According to the firm, the US advisory market represents a vast, largely untapped opportunity that would drive significant flows into BTC. It stated: ‚ÄúRoughly 300,000 financial advisors manage about $30 trillion in client assets. If even a modest 2% allocation to bitcoin ETFs emerged across this channel, that would translate to roughly $600 billion in potential inflows.‚Äù These wave of flows would would rival the entire global gold ETF market, now worth about $472 billion, and quadruple the combined $146 billion in assets under management (AUM) across US spot Bitcoin funds. The asset management firm pointed out that recent policy moves by leading traditional financial institiutions like Morgan Stanley and Vanguard support that thesis. Notably, Morgan Stanley recently recommended up to a 4% allocation to digital assets, while Vanguard is reportedly looking to offer select third-party crypto ETFs to its brokerage clients. These developments are expected to drive fresh capital into the emerging industry and further drive Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption. Galaxy Research argued that the full opening of large advisory platforms could mark a structural shift in how digital assets are integrated into mainstream finance. Once this access is fully enabled, financial advisors will be able to include crypto directly within traditional balanced portfolios, moving the asset class from retail-driven speculation toward advisor-led portfolio construction. It noted: ‚ÄúThe impact could be substantial. New inflows may follow as wealth managers begin allocating to the asset class, potentially pushing total bitcoin ETF AUM to $500 billion within a few years, assuming just a 1% average allocation across managed portfolios. Such flows would reshape market dynamics and reinforce bitcoin‚Äôs position as a mainstream, investable asset.‚Äù Galaxy‚Äôs analysis further suggested that this transition could also bring a more mature form of liquidity. According to the firm, advisory-driven allocations tend to follow longer holding periods and stricter compliance frameworks, reducing the short-term turnover that has defined retail crypto trading. Over time, that discipline could enhance price stability, deepen liquidity, and align Bitcoin more closely with traditional asset classes such as equities, bonds, and gold.

Title: Ethereum In, Bitcoin Out: BlackRock Rebalancing Its Digital Asset Portfolio In Major Crypto Shift

Time Published: 2025-10-20T15:00:15Z

Following the recent market crash due to Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff order, the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced a sharp decline below key support levels. While both coins fell strongly, ETH has emerged as the leading choice among major corporations, as these institutions swap their BTC for the altcoin leader. Major crypto assets such as Ethereum and Bitcoin are beginning to recover lost ground once again. Meanwhile, Ethereum appears to be leading the charge in terms of institutional adoption, reflecting the long-term potential of the leading altcoin. In a move that has triggered a frenzy across the crypto and traditional finance sectors, BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, is reportedly shifting a portion of its Bitcoin holdings into ETH. Coin Bureau shared this institutional pivot on the social media platform X, which has captured the attention of the crypto community. This daring rotation indicates a significant shift in institutional opinion and a rising belief in Ethereum‚Äôs sustained price growth. BlackRock‚Äòs shift to ETH highlights the asset‚Äôs developing importance as the cornerstone of decentralized finance and next-generation financial infrastructure, even though Bitcoin keeps dominating as a store of value. Data shared by Coin Bureau reveals that the leading asset manager firm transferred about 272.4 BTC, valued at approximately $28.3 million, to Coinbase Prime. A few hours later, BlackRock was observed pulling out over 12,098 ETH worth $45.4 million. Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. has also been accumulating ETH at a significant and rapid rate. A recent report from BMNR Bullz shows that the leading treasury company purchased thousands of ETH within the past week to strengthen its digital asset treasury. Despite the recent market crash, the firm continues to double down on the altcoin, scooping up a total of 379,271 ETH, valued at $1.5 billion. With the massive purchase of Ethereum, Bitmine is demonstrating its conviction in the network‚Äôs expanding role in blockchain innovation. During the dip on Friday, Bitmine bought over 72,898 ETH worth $281 million. Three days prior to this acquisition, the firm purchased more than 104,336 ETH, valued at $417 million. Finally, a +202,037 ETH was made after the weekend crash, bringing the total to 379,271 ETH within a week. Bitmine‚Äôs persistent acquisition of the altcoin reflects the firm‚Äôs Co-CEO Tom Lee‚Äôs bold declaration that Ethereum will be the backbone of the digital economy. According to BMNR Bullz, this is not a buy signal, but a seismic shift. Prominent figures in the financial landscape are currently endorsing Ethereum. Robert Kiyosaki, a billionaire and author of the ‚ÄúRich Dad Poor Dad‚Äù book, has included ETH as one of the key assets to hedge against the rising inflation across the world. While inflation keeps increasing and making it difficult for the poor and middle class, the billionaire has urged this set of people not to rely on government fake money or fiat currency. Instead, they should invest in Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, which he labels the real money. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Wall Street might be panicking over private credit but insiders can‚Äôt see what all the fuss is about
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/20/wall-street-private-credit-but-insiders-fuss/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T14:28:45Z

Lily Mae Lazarus is a news fellow at Fortune. Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. His investigative journalism has changed the law in two U.S. federal districts and two states. The U.S. Supreme Court cited his work on the death penalty in the concurrence to Baze v. Rees, the ruling on whether lethal injection is cruel or unusual. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue. On Oct. 15, two Wall Street titans offered radically different visions of the private credit market. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors that recent bankruptcies in private credit could be just the beginning: ‚ÄúWhen you see one cockroach, there are probably more.‚Äù Hours later, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink struck a defiant tone on his firm‚Äôs earnings call: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been more excited about the future of BlackRock,‚Äù he said. BlackRock has bet $12 billion on private credit through its acquisition of HPS Investment Partners. So who is right? Investors have been so worried about the stability of private credit recently that their frantic selling drove up the VIX ‚Äúfear‚Äù index by 35% over the past month. They are spooked by the collapse in September of Tricolor Holdings, a subprime auto lender and dealer, revealing allegations of fraud in which the company allegedly pledged the same collateral to multiple banks. Private credit was dealt another blow late last month when First Brands, an auto parts supplier, collapsed into bankruptcy, owing $10 billion, triggering federal investigations into $2.3 billion in missing funds. Then on Oct. 16, regional banks Zions Bancorporation disclosed fraud-related losses and Western Alliance flagged nearly nearly $100 million in alleged fraud, catalyzing a market rout that erased $100 billion in market cap from U.S. bank stocks and pushed market volatility to four-month highs. Major institutions tallied their damage: JPMorgan took $170 million in Tricolor losses; UBS disclosed over $500 million in First Brands exposure; and Jefferies revealed $715 million in questionable receivables. The private credit market‚Äîwhich has grown from $200 billion to $3 trillion globally in 15 years‚Äîsuddenly looked vulnerable. But credit analysts and executives who spoke to Fortune have mixed views on Wall Street‚Äôs panic. Several argue that the failures aren‚Äôt private credit problems at all. According to them, these instances are traditional bank lending blowups, and the mislabeling reveals more about competitive tensions between old-guard banks and private credit disrupters than genuine systemic risk. The question, however, is whether these analysts are right, or whether they‚Äôre dangerously downplaying cracks in a $3 trillion market that is systemically important to global finance. The definition problem ‚ÄúFirst Brands, if it was rated by us, would not have been considered in any way, shape, or form a private credit transaction,‚Äù said Bill Cox, chief rating officer at Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA), which tracks thousands of private credit loans. ‚ÄúIts main debt was full-on public, broadly syndicated loans.‚Äù This distinction matters. The broadly syndicated loan (BSL) market‚Äîdominated by large commercial banks‚Äîoperates differently from the direct lending market that defines private credit. BSL loans are originated by banks, syndicated to multiple investors, and traded in public markets with daily pricing. Private credit loans, by contrast, are bilateral transactions between a lender and borrower, held to maturity in a ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù strategy with no secondary market trading. First Brands‚Äô bankruptcy involved primarily BSL debt and receivables ‚Äúfactoring,‚Äù a form of lending where banks purchase a company‚Äôs accounts receivable at a discount in hopes of profiting later when clients pay their bills in full. Neither activity represents the core direct lending business that firms like Ares, Apollo, and Blackstone have built. ‚ÄúNone of them do factoring,‚Äù Cox said of the dozens of private credit platforms his firm rates. ‚ÄúWe looked at the entire universe of our CLOs, BDCs, and other facilities for exposure to First Brands. The exposure was de minimis,‚Äù he said, referring to collateralized loan obligations (bundles of loans sold to other investors) and business development companies (which are set up as investment bets on struggling or distressed companies). Brian Garfield, who heads U.S. portfolio valuation at investment banking firm Lincoln International, which performs over 6,500 quarterly valuations of private companies, echoed this view: ‚ÄúFirst Brands [largely had BSL facilities, and] that‚Äôs not the direct lending market. I think it‚Äôs important that we understand that alone in itself is really important, because there‚Äôs this whole combination of things that everyone is just putting ‚Ä¶ in one basket,‚Äù he told Fortune. The real state of private credit This isn‚Äôt to say private credit faces no challenges. Lincoln International‚Äôs proprietary data tracking the direct lending market shows covenant defaults‚Äîtechnical breaches of loan terms rather than payment failures‚Äîhave risen from 2.2% in 2024 to 3.5% currently. Payment-in-kind (PIK) usage, where struggling borrowers defer cash interest payments, increased from 6.5% of deals in Q4 2021 to 11% today, with ‚Äúbad PIKs‚Äù (repriced mid-deal) rising from 33% to over 50% of that total. ‚ÄúAre there cracks? Yes,‚Äù Garfield acknowledged. ‚ÄúBut on average, are we seeing strong fundamental Ebitda growth? Yes.‚Äù His data shows last-12-months year-over-year Ebitda growth of 6% to 7%‚Äîthe highest level since Q1 2021. KBRA‚Äôs analysis of 2,400 middle-market companies representing roughly $1 trillion in debt tells a similar story. Cox‚Äôs team projects defaults could peak at 5%, which he admitted is ‚Äúa lot more than this industry has seen,‚Äù but he said was ‚Äúrelatively‚Äù low for public market comparables, the measure through which private company valuations can be derived by comparing the businesses to other similar companies that are already publicly traded on the stock market. Why the panic? Given the fundamentals aren‚Äôt catastrophic, analysts point to several factors beyond credit quality to explain investor anxiety, namely less stringent guardrails and documentation processes. ‚ÄúIf something grows like a weed, maybe it is one,‚Äù Timur Braziler, who covers regional banks at Wells Fargo, told Fortune. ‚ÄúThe availability of credit over the last five years, when you have more than one source competing for that same loan, maybe the underwriting isn‚Äôt as stringent.‚Äù Andrew Milgram, managing partner and chief investment officer of Marblegate Asset Management, an alternative investment firm focused on middle-market distressed and special situation investments, offered a more pointed critique: The competitive dynamics of unregulated lending inevitably lead to deteriorating standards. ‚ÄúWhen loans were done by banks, they were subject to oversight,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúAs those loans moved out of the banking system into an unregulated environment, they began competing for business by loosening documentation, loosening underwriting standards.‚Äù Private credit loans are typically given out by nonbank lenders such as alternative asset managers, private equity firms, and pension funds. Without the guardrails and protections provided by traditional banks, who are beholden to regulators and the federal government, disaster can ensue, according to Milgram, who has long been skeptical of the private credit market. ‚ÄúLending has been regulated in societies for all time. In fact, the Code of Hammurabi contemplated regulating lenders because every society, everywhere for all time has recognized that durable, responsible lending is central to the proper functioning of the economy,‚Äù he added. Cox sees a different dynamic at work: Competitive tensions between traditional banks and private credit upstarts have led to, in his opinion, a rise in misconstruing the overall risk of private credit and direct lending. ‚ÄúIf your neighbor is saying it‚Äôs your dog that‚Äôs relieving itself on the lawn, and you know it‚Äôs not your dog, it‚Äôs pretty frustrating,‚Äù he says, noting that both Tricolor and First Brands were primarily bank lending failures, not private credit issues. He admits, however, that there are corners of the private credit market that are more exposed and involved in ‚Äúriskier parts of credit,‚Äù where lenders provide loans at high risk in hopes of high returns. Private credit has a reputation for being directed at smaller, middle-market companies that are highly leveraged and potentially unable to secure traditional bank financing. While these firms may offer higher yields to offset the risk, they are more vulnerable to financial shocks. What comes next The debate over private credit‚Äôs risks won‚Äôt end with these bankruptcies. Braziler expects more fraud cases to emerge: ‚ÄúJust the abundance of credit, it makes sense that you‚Äôre going to have more of these bad characters.‚Äù However, he doesn‚Äôt see systemic risk to the banking sector. Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, expects continued stress but not catastrophe: ‚ÄúThe weakest companies are starting to get hit as a result of the tariffs and economic slowdown. You‚Äôre going to see an increase in bankruptcies, but there isn‚Äôt systemic risk.‚Äù The real test may be transparency. Unlike BSL loans with daily market pricing, private credit valuations are less transparent, being updated quarterly using subjective methodologies. ‚ÄúIt is really opaque,‚Äù Braziler notes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really hard to get a good understanding of who the end borrower is.‚Äù As BlackRock doubles down with its $12 billion HPS acquisition and Dimon warns of ‚Äúcockroaches,‚Äù the private credit industry faces a credibility test. The question isn‚Äôt whether some loans will default‚Äîthey will. It‚Äôs whether the industry‚Äôs risk management, documentation standards, and valuation practices can pass a financial stress test. ‚ÄúAnyone who has any amount of meaningful exposure to corporate credit markets, and in particular the leverage loan corporate credit markets, should be reexamining their portfolio in excruciating detail at this moment and really thinking hard about the quality of the underwriting that has gone into making those loans and the veracity of the reporting that supports their understanding of the performance of the business,‚Äù Milgram said. For now, the analysts who track private credit most closely see warning signs, not apocalypse. But in a market where definitional confusion obscures risk and competitive tensions drive narratives, distinguishing signal from noise is increasingly critical and difficult. ¬© 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: BlackRock brings Bitcoin ETP to UK as regulator opens door for crypto products
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-brings-bitcoin-etp-to-uk-as-regulator-opens-door-for-crypto-products/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T13:52:32Z
Full Content:
The investment giant BlackRock has launched its first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product (ETP) in the United Kingdom, signalling a major step in bridging traditional finance with the crypto sector. The move follows the Financial Conduct Authority‚Äôs (FCA) decision to ease restrictions on crypto investment vehicles, allowing investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without directly holding it. The launch not only widens access to digital assets for UK investors but also highlights a growing convergence between global asset managers and regulators in adapting to the evolution of financial markets. The iShares Bitcoin ETP, now listed on the London Stock Exchange, is designed to mirror the price of bitcoin and offer exposure within a regulated structure. The product allows investors to buy fractions of bitcoin through units starting at about $11, making participation in the asset class more accessible. Unlike holding bitcoin directly, investors can trade the ETP through standard brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities of digital wallets or private key management. The product‚Äôs underlying assets are securely held by regulated custodians, ensuring compliance and oversight under the UK‚Äôs financial rules. BlackRock‚Äôs UK-listed ETP builds on the firm‚Äôs earlier success with its bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, which has accumulated over $85 billion in net assets. It also adds to its European range, complementing listings in Switzerland, Paris, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt. The launch comes shortly after the FCA lifted its four-year ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on 9 October 2025. The regulator stated that UK investors could now access such products through approved exchanges, reflecting a broader acceptance of crypto-linked investment options. The decision marks a turning point for crypto regulation in the UK. It suggests a shift from outright restrictions to a more measured approach that balances investor protection with innovation. The FCA‚Äôs announcement followed months of consultation with industry players and international regulators. BlackRock‚Äôs move is expected to encourage other global asset managers to follow suit, as the UK repositions itself as a hub for financial innovation post-Brexit. The FCA‚Äôs approval has opened the door for firms such as VanEck, DWS, and WisdomTree to explore similar launches. For retail investors, the product offers exposure to bitcoin‚Äôs price movements through a traditional investment wrapper. It eliminates the need for managing crypto wallets and navigating unregulated exchanges, while allowing investment through familiar platforms. The regulator‚Äôs decision also aligns with the UK Treasury‚Äôs ambition to make the country a global centre for digital assets. It supports ongoing efforts to integrate blockchain into traditional finance, paving the way for tokenised funds and blockchain-based asset management in the future. Despite the easing of rules, the FCA maintained that its ban on crypto derivatives for retail investors will remain. While the ETP operates under a regulated structure, exposure to Bitcoin still carries the same volatility and market risks associated with the underlying asset. In parallel, the UK is exploring broader blockchain adoption across financial services. On 14 October 2025, the FCA announced new provisions allowing asset managers to use distributed ledger technology for fund tokenisation. The move is intended to foster innovation and efficiency, signalling that the regulator sees long-term potential in blockchain applications beyond cryptocurrencies. By facilitating regulated access to bitcoin and promoting tokenisation, the UK is gradually laying the groundwork for a digital financial ecosystem where traditional and decentralised finance coexist. BlackRock‚Äôs ETP marks a key milestone in this transition, setting the stage for more institutional crypto products in one of the world‚Äôs leading financial markets.

The iShares Bitcoin ETP began trading on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, with securities physically backed by Bitcoin held through Coinbase, as per the Financial Times report. "As the UK crypto investor base is projected to approach 4 million over the next year, today's listing of exchange-traded products like iShares Bitcoin ETP unlock a securer gateway to digital assets through traditional investment platforms,‚Äù the firm's EMEA head of global product Jane Sloan said, speaking to the FT. "Built on institutional-grade infrastructure, [the product] enables UK investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin with the confidence of robust custody and regulatory oversight," Sloan added. The product features institutional-grade security protocols, with Coinbase transferring Bitcoin from trading wallets into segregated, offline cold storage by day's end. The UK launch follows the runaway success of BlackRock's U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF, which became the firm's most profitable fund just 21 months after launch, now managing over $87.5 billion in assets. The fund was on track to hit $100 billion in assets under management and become the youngest ETF to cross that milestone, but last week's market crash derailed the timeline. ‚ÄúThe launch signals the advancing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as an investable asset class by both major regulators and global asset managers,‚Äù Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum, told Decrypt. Dori expects the UK launch to pave the way for broader crypto product offerings, noting that "in the U.S., additional ETPs beyond BTC/ETH and the first diversified crypto baskets are progressing through preparatory stages.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt the same time, various traditional managers are expanding their digital-asset footprint, including tokenized securities in BlackRock‚Äôs case,‚Äù he added. He said it's reasonable to expect the Financial Conduct Authority to "proceed deliberately" by monitoring market conduct and retail outcomes before "broadening issuer participation" and considering additional crypto assets "in close alignment with other major financial centres." The launch also follows CEO Larry Fink's pivot on crypto, from describing Bitcoin as an "index of money laundering‚Äù in 2017 to placing crypto alongside gold in investors‚Äô portfolios. ‚ÄúThe markets teach you, you always have to relook at your assumptions,‚Äù Fink told CBS last week. ‚ÄúThere is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it's an alternative." However, market conditions remain choppy with digital asset investment products seeing $513 million in outflows last week following a Binance liquidity cascade on October 10 that triggered nearly $20 billion in liquidations, including roughly $16.7 billion in long positions, according to a CoinShares report. BlackRock's UK expansion comes amid broader concerns about regulatory fragmentation in the crypto sector. Last week, the Financial Stability Board warned that crypto firms are exploiting loopholes in fragmented global regulations, threatening financial stability as countries adopt wildly different approaches to policing the digital asset market.

Title: How a Cyber Charter Struck Back When It Was Fired by a School District in New Mexico

Time Published: 2025-10-20T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Peter Greene, the best education blogger ever, writes regularly for Forbes magazine. Hopefully, some of the nation‚Äôs business executives are learning about the for-profit entrepreneurs who have entered into the education ‚Äúindustry,‚Äùwhere they are profiting without doing much for students. Greene recently wrote about the latest setback for the giant of the cybercharter industry. It‚Äôs now called Stride, but for many years it was K12 Inc. Top executives are paid millions of dollars. Profit, not learning, is its highest priority. Despite terrible academic results, low graduation rates, complaints about inflated enrollments, there are always school districts happy to host the cybercharter industry because the district gets a cut of the profits. Greene writes: Stride, a giant in the cyber charter school industry, was accused by a New Mexico school district of violating rules and regulations. Now a lawsuit alleges that Stride responded by mounting a coordinated attack on the district and its superintendent. In 2020, Gallup-McKinley County Schools contracted with Stride (formerly known as K12 Inc) to operate its New Mexico Destinations Career Academy. But the district alleges that the for-profit organization repeatedly cut corners, violated staffing rules, and inflated enrollment numbers. In May 2025, the school board voted to end the contract. ‚ÄúOur students deserve better,‚Äù said School Board President Christopher Mortensen in a press release.‚ÄúThis action is not sudden; it is the result of months of effort to address persistent issues with the contractor. We are taking this step to protect our students, uphold academic standards, and meet our obligations under state and federal law.‚Äù Within months, the district had filed a complaint against Stride, charging them with fraud, unfair trade practices, civil conspiracy, and seven other counts. That lawsuit outlines the issues between Stride and the district. According to the complaint, Stride had continuing issues with meeting requirements for student-teacher ratios, having been notified as early as September 2023 that it was out of compliance. Special education teachers were over their permitted caseloads, and IEP students were not receiving their due process. Further, Stride failed to employ certified teachers, complete background checks, or provide state-mandated occupational and professional trainings to their staff. The district also alleges that Stride ‚Äúretained nonexistent students on its rolls‚Äù and took school district funds for educating these ghost students. Stride failed to provide timely required communication with the district. Stride‚Äôs graduation rate, says the district, was ‚Äúhorrific,‚Äù with a graduation rate of 27.67% in 2024. The district also claims that through it all, Stride has ‚Äúignored compliance requirements‚Äù and failed to produce a remediation plan. According to the suit filed by the district, a management representative of Stride came forward in May as a whistleblower, declaring that the increases in student-teacher ratios was ‚Äúintentional‚Ä¶ in order to increase profit margins.‚Äù The whistleblower reported that he made multiple attempts to inform upper management that Stride was out of compliance with state law, and asked for authority to hire the roughly 80 teachers needed. The Vice President of Finance, says the whistleblower, refused to authorize those hires. Instead, in a later meeting, the whistleblower was allegedly told that his ‚Äúprojected profit margin was too low.‚Äù He was directed to cut staff for the next year to meet projected profit margin.‚Äù According to the whistleblower, Stride‚Äôs plans to deal with their troubles were not focused on meeting their obligations to the district. Instead, the whistleblower says, at an April meeting Stride‚Äôs Senior Vice President of School Development ‚ÄúPeter Stewart said the company should attack first publicly and Stride Inc. should develop a strategy for that‚Äù and that Stride CEO ‚ÄúJames Rhyu said [to the group] that the Superintendent [for the School District] was in over his skis on this issue.‚Äù Alleges the district‚Äôs suit, ‚ÄùStride‚Äôs management, including the individual Defendants, engaged in and agreed to a civil conspiracy to cover up its misconduct and illegal activities acting, by and through its employees, agents and attorneys, in planning and engaging in a systemic public attack on the School District and its Superintendent of Schools to distract from its illegal activities and its breach of the contract with the Board of Education.‚Äù And counter-attack they did. On April 22, the district sent Stride a letter charging it had ‚Äúmaterially breached‚Äù its contract. On April 28, the company filed an ethics complaint against GMCS Superintendent Michael Hyatt, alleging that he had tried to leverage Stride‚Äôs contract with the district in order to secure a ‚Äúlucrative position‚Äù with Stride. Hyatt had applied for a management position with Stride in 2024; the company declined to hire him. The list of complaints by the district against Stride is long, but the theme is simple enough. Defendant Stride purposely and willfully disregarded the contractual requirements and the statutory and regulatory requirements in order to defraud the School District to increase its profits‚Ä¶ Defendant Stride, while obligated to provide a certain quality of education to students, disregarded its legal obligations with the sole intent to profit on the education of students that it was supposed to educate, and that profit was obtained illegally through the intentional 27 violations of State law, incomplete and false reporting of student data, withholding technical support and operating and manipulating student counts to include students who had been dropped, withdrawn or were excessively absent. Asked for comment on the suit, a Stride representative directed me to the company‚Äôs suit-related web site which argues that the company has been working on an improvement plan, that their student-to-staff ratios are better than those reported by the district, and that ‚Äúexplosive growth‚Äù of NMDCA makes it hard to stay caught up with staffing. A reply to the district‚Äôs Aprill 22 letter contests virtually every point that the district has made about Stride‚Äôs performance. Since being cut loose from GMCS, Stride has re-opened NMDCA as a cyber charter school partnered with Charna Valley Independent Schools and Santa Rosa Consolidated Schools; a fact sheet from Stride says 3,000 students are enrolled, including 2,300 returning families. Those families, they say, are largely satisfied with the school. They also point out that many students enter the school short of credits, and that the majority of students are closing that gap. The Stride representative also sent a fact sheet alleging that GMCS is facing other legal problems. But Stride is no stranger to legal issues. It was founded in 2000 as K12 Inc by Ron Packard, former banker and Mckinsey consultant, and quickly became the leading national company for cyber schooling. One of its first big investors was Michal Milken. That investment came a decade after he pled guilty to six felonies in the ‚Äúbiggest fraud case in the securities industry‚Äù ending his reign as the ‚Äújunk bond king.‚Äù Besides Milliken, Stride investors have included brothers Lowell and Larry Ellison, and BlackRock, founded by Larry Fink, whose brother Steve sits on the Stride Board of Directors. In 2011, the New York Times detailed how K12‚Äôs schools were failing miserably, but still making investors and officers a ton of money. Former teachers wrote tell-alls about their experiences. In 2012. Florida caught K12 using fake teachers. The NCAA put K12 schools on the list of cyber schools that were disqualified from sports eligibility. In 2014, Packard turned out to be one of the highest paid public workers in the country, ‚Äúdespite the fact that only 28% of K12 schools met state standards in 2011-2012.‚Äù In 2013 K12 settled a class action lawsuit in Virginia for $6.75 million after stockholders accused the company of misleading them about ‚Äúthe company‚Äôs business practices and academic performance.‚Äù In 2014, Middlebury College faculty voted to end a partnership with K12 saying the company‚Äôs business practices ‚Äúare at odds with the integrity, reputation and educational mission of the college.‚Äù In 2016 K12 got in yet another round of trouble in California for lying about student enrollment, resulting in a $165 million settlement with then Attorney General Kamala Harris. K12 was repeatedly dropped in some states and cities for poor performance. In 2020, they landed a big contract in Miami-Dade county (after a big lucrative contribution to an organization run by the superintendent); subsequently Wired magazine wrote a story about their ‚Äúepic series of tech errors.‚Äù K12 successfully defended itself from a lawsuit in Virginia based on charges they had greatly overstated their technological capabilities by arguing that such claims were simply advertising ‚Äúpuffery.‚Äù The district is seeking compensatory and punitive damages from Stride. Four Stride executives are named in the suit in addition to Stride Inc itself. The court will decide who‚Äôs blowing smoke here. In the meantime, school districts continue to learn about the price of teaming up with aggressively for-profit partners. Wow, what a story! Looks like K12 Inc [now ‚ÄúStride‚Äù] may finally be brought down [& hopefully snuffed out], after 26 yrs of ripping off the public with devious/ scurrilous practices. Kudos to New Mexico & its Gallup-McKinley County schools for persevering legally against this scam operation.

Strategy (MSTR), the largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin, purchased 168 BTC at an average price of $112,051, according to a filing on Monday. The company financed the acquisition by raising $18.8 million through the issuance of various perpetual preferred shares and common stock. This latest purchase brings MSTR‚Äôs total bitcoin holdings to 640,418 BTC ($71 billion), with an overall average acquisition price of around $74,010. BTC climbed to over $115,000 on Oct. 13 but fell as low as $103,500 on Oct. 17.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$113,428.63 and the broader crypto market recovered over the weekend, offering a brief reprieve after sticky selling pressure kept cryptocurrency prices depressed in the aftermath of a $500 billion value-destruction event. The price of bitcoin rose 3% in the past 24 hours to $110,770. It remains down about 4% for the month. The recovery came as global risk sentiment improves, with equities rising and investors rotating back into more volatile assets. U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs softer stance on tariffs and signs that the Federal Reserve may ease monetary policy later this year have helped calm markets. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index rose 4.3% in the past 24 hours with all members in the green. ‚ÄúWhile bitcoin has seen a notable short-term correction, the long-term trend remains a different story, as the cryptocurrency‚Äôs trajectory is still heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy, U.S. dollar strength, spot bitcoin ETF flows, and geopolitical risks,‚Äù XS.com markets analyst Linh Tran told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. Still, short-term momentum may not signal a lasting trend. Analysts at Coinbase Institutional warned that thin liquidity, a strong U.S. dollar and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's rate path continue to weigh on market structure. A spike in U.S. Treasury yields at the end of last week and geopolitical tensions with Israel conducting retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza after attacks on its forces while a ceasefire was in effect and as Russia advances in Ukraine, have kept many institutional investors cautious. Nevertheless corporate accumulation has kept on going, with BitcoinTreasuries data showing that in the past 30 days these entities increased their holdings by 8.4% to 4.04 million BTC. Access to crypto exposure is also growing, with BlackRock and 21Shares adding debuting their crypto ETPs on the London Stock Exchange for retail investors. ‚ÄúOverall, in my view, bitcoin is currently in a reaccumulation phase following its short-term correction, with market sentiment stabilizing and institutional demand remaining resilient,‚Äù Tran added.

BlackRock debuted a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, one of a number of similar offerings that started trading after the Financial Conduct Authority ended a ban on retail investment imposed in 2021. In addition to the iShares Bitcoin ETP trading under the ticker IB1T, investors also gained access to products from companies including 21Shares, WisdomTree and Bitwise, which allow retail investors to buy exposure to bitcoin through a regulated market without needing to hold the cryptocurrency directly. BlackRock's product is already available elsewhere in Europe, having been listed on Xetra, Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris in late March according to the BlackRock‚Äôs page for the product. Switzerland-based 21Shares introduced four of its flagship crypto ETNs. These include its bitcoin (ABTC) and ether (AETH) staking products, as well as two lower-fee "Core‚Äù offerings, CBTC and ETHC, with management fees of 0.10%. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs launch represents a landmark step for the U.K. market and for everyday investors who, for years, have been excluded from regulated crypto products,‚Äù 21Shares CEO Russel Barlow said in an emailed press release. Ending the ban ‚Äúbegins to level the playing field with Europe.‚Äù The WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETPs, which were previously available only to wealthy investors, are expected to be available through a range of U.K.-regulated investment platforms starting this week, the company said. Bitwise listed four ETPs on the LSE, two each tracking BTC and ETH. The firm said on Monday it was reducing the management fee of its Core Bitcoin ETP (BTC1) from 20 basis points to 5 bps for the next six months. BlackRock, which manages over $13 trillion in assets globally, has seen strong growth in its crypto-focused products. Its flagship bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has $85.5 billion in net assets according to SoSoValue data. This makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF, followed by Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC, which has $21.9 billion in net assets.

Title: Ethereum Foundation Researcher‚Äôs Pivot Highlights Growing Cultural Divide in Crypto

reading time 3 minutes On Friday, Ethereum Foundation Researcher Dankrad Feist announced he will be joining the stablecoin-focused blockchain startup Tempo, which was incubated via a partnership between fintech giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm. In response, some of the crypto purists on social media, most notably and understandably those who build on Ethereum, shared their disappointment, while others simply saw it as a sign of the times in terms of where the industry is headed more generally. Dankrad leaving Ethereum is a terrible look for open-source vs. corporate blockchains. Huge L for the entire community tbh ‚Äî Andy (@ayyyeandy) October 17, 2025 The reaction to this recent move by Feist is an illustration of the greater cultural divide that has been growing in crypto over the past few years as more of this technology is built around increasingly centralized vectors of control. While Satoshi Nakamoto√¢¬Ä¬ôs original Bitcoin whitepaper and other early writings discussed the need for a new system built on √¢¬Ä¬úcryptographic proof instead of trust√¢¬Ä¬ù and the problems with traditional systems being related to √¢¬Ä¬úall the trust that√¢¬Ä¬ôs required to make it work,√¢¬Ä¬ù much of the more recent activity in crypto has involved centrally-issued stablecoins as poker chips in a meme coin casino. Much of the growth around crypto networks like Ethereum has been centered around centralized stablecoins, which operated in somewhat of a legal grey area in the U.S. prior to the passage of the GENIUS Act earlier this year. With greater regulatory clarity established around these digital dollars, there has been an increase in various developments around so-called √¢¬Ä¬ústablechains,√¢¬Ä¬ù which are focused on these bank-backed dollar tokens rather than crypto-native, permissionless assets. A fundamental problem with ETH valuation is that ethereum's primary uses cases are largely external to ETH's market value. Ethereum can be very useful, its apps can garner great revenue, and ETH can still be low price ‚Äî or vice versa ‚Äî there is little link between them. OTOH,√¢¬Ä¬¶ ‚Äî Nick Szabo (@NickSzabo4) October 7, 2025 Circle and Tether are the two largest stablecoin issuers via their respective USDC and USDT tokens. Earlier this year, Circle announced the creation of their own layer-one blockchain called Arc. Additionally, Tether and its affiliates have supported the development of at least two blockchains where USDT is the native gas token, namely Stable and Plasma. More well-known players in the fintech industry are also getting involved, with Coinbase, Stripe (Tempo), PayPal, and Robinhood all either announcing or already having launched their own blockchain platforms or other expansions into the crypto market. Google Cloud and Cloudflare also have their own blockchain offerings at different stages of development that are focused on payments for artificial intelligence agents. Some of these platforms are being built as secondary layers on top of Ethereum, while others are completely separate blockchain networks. As big tech giants and other notable players get involved in building out their own blockchain networks where they can have more control and extract more value, the cypherpunk values Satoshi wanted to infuse into Bitcoin, such as privacy and censorship resistance, have struggled to gain the hearts and minds of the general public. Sure, the bitcoin price recently hit a new all-time high once again (before subsequently dropping more than 15%); however, much of the recent bull run has been built around centralized, regulated financial products such as the publicly-traded exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the likes of BlackRock and bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy. There are still pockets of activity in crypto that are relatively faithful to the Satoshi vision. Not all use cases reintroduce trusted third parties by building everything around centralized stablecoins or throw away privacy by putting too much financial data on public blockchains. This is becoming an increasingly smaller percentage of overall activity, however, when compared to speculation on dubious token offerings or further empowering financial institutions with new technology that allows them to avoid strict anti-money laundering regulations as long as they put their customers on a database they call a blockchain. Bitcoin itself has remained somewhat resistant to corporate influence at the protocol level, as shown by the resolution of its internal block size war√Ç back in 2017. However, Ethereum√¢¬Ä¬ôs reliance on stablecoins is becoming an increasingly hard-to-ignore issue that is worth watching, as the issuers of these tokens have an incentive to use their centralized point of control to extract as much value as possible from this technology. As seen by the recent √¢¬Ä¬ústablechain√¢¬Ä¬ù phenomenon, this may include a desire to cut the open Ethereum network out of the picture entirely. Contrastly, Bitcoin√¢¬Ä¬ôs main problematic point of centralization in terms of third-party custodians still requires those custodians to use the Bitcoin network. While people are still able to use these technologies in the permissionless, non-custodial manner Satoshi originally intended, the crypto industry as a whole is increasingly turning into a way for centralized financial entities to empower themselves rather than individual users.

Title: $600 Billion Could Flow Into Crypto From Wall Street: Galaxy Research
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/600-billion-inflow-crypto-wall-street-galaxy/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T09:00:10Z
Full Content:
Galaxy Research‚Äôs latest brief argues that the ‚Äúwealth channel‚Äù in the United States‚Äîthe network of roughly 300,000 financial advisors overseeing about $30 trillion in client assets‚Äîis finally starting to open to crypto assets, with implications that are both mechanical and potentially transformative. The crux of the thesis is arithmetic but not trivial: ‚ÄúIf even a modest 2% allocation to bitcoin ETFs emerged across this channel, that would translate to roughly $600 billion in potential inflows,‚Äù the note states, adding that such a sum ‚Äúis comparable to the entire global gold ETF market (~$472 billion) and more than 3x the US spot bitcoin ETF AUM (~$146 billion).‚Äù The firm frames this as the moment crypto begins moving from retail-driven speculation toward advisor-led portfolio construction, as approvals, custody, and compliance guardrails converge inside the largest wirehouses and banks. The catalyst, in Galaxy‚Äôs telling, is a series of platform-level access changes and infrastructure buildouts that remove long-standing bottlenecks. On October 10, Morgan Stanley ‚Äúremoved longstanding restrictions on crypto fund access for its financial advisors,‚Äù allowing proactive recommendations ‚Äúto all clients across any account type.‚Äù Galaxy highlights the bank‚Äôs newest house guidance‚Äî‚Äúup to 4%‚Äù of portfolios in digital assets‚Äîas a conservative but meaningful signal that crypto is being slotted alongside established diversifiers. The shift matters less as a branding exercise and more as a workflow change: when exposure becomes standard inside advisory toolkits, it can be modeled, rebalanced, and supervised under the same risk and suitability processes that govern equities, bonds, and alternatives. The research brief stresses how the wealth channel‚Äôs internal approval machinery has been the real gating factor. Advisors ‚Äúcan only allocate to products formally approved by their firms,‚Äù and those approvals depend on ‚Äúcustody readiness, compliance frameworks, operational integration, and client suitability standards.‚Äù Crypto has lagged not because advisors lack interest, Galaxy argues, but because ‚Äúapproval of crypto products has been especially cautious‚Äù amid volatility, evolving regulation, and a limited on-platform track record. That calculus is changing as banks build the ‚Äúcritical backbone‚Äù internally‚Äîtrading, custody, and advisory systems that let them ‚Äúoffer secure, scalable crypto access through their wealth platforms.‚Äù In the same vein, the note flags movement among the largest brand names in US asset management and banking. Vanguard‚Äîlong the archetype of crypto skepticism‚Äî‚Äúis reportedly preparing to offer select third-party crypto ETFs to its brokerage clients,‚Äù a reversal Galaxy attributes to ‚Äústrong client demand and a more supportive regulatory climate,‚Äù while noting that there is ‚Äúnot yet [a] specific timeline or which ETFs will be made available.‚Äù Citi, for its part, ‚Äúplans to launch institutional-grade crypto custody in 2026,‚Äù and JPMorgan ‚Äúsignaled that its clients will soon be able to trade bitcoin and other crypto assets,‚Äù albeit without in-house custody for now. Galaxy treats these moves less as isolated headlines than as evidence that banks intend to capture crypto flows ‚Äúusing their own integrated trading, custody, and advisory systems‚Äù to provide regulated access at scale. Policy context also features in Galaxy‚Äôs analysis. The brief points to the recent executive order allowing 401(k) plans to include crypto as an option‚Äù as a legitimizing step that helps fiduciaries and compliance teams grow comfortable with the risk profile of digital assets inside retirement plans. While implementation ultimately depends on how plan sponsors interpret fiduciary obligations, Galaxy‚Äôs point is that headline regulatory posture is no longer exclusively restrictive‚Äîreducing a key narrative and operational headwind for wealth platforms. Importantly, Galaxy situates the prospective 2% allocation within a broader spectrum of public guidance from prominent allocators over the past year. The firm notes that ‚ÄúBlackRock, Fidelity, Bridgewater‚Äôs Ray Dalio, and Ric Edelman have publicly suggested crypto allocations ranging from a conservative 1% to as high as 40% in aggressive scenarios.‚Äù Within this range, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs ‚Äúup to 4%‚Äù ceiling is neither fringe nor maximalist; it reads as a risk-budgeted sleeve for an asset class the bank now describes as ‚Äúboth a hedge against inflation and a long-term growth opportunity.‚Äù Galaxy extends the math: if average allocations across advised assets land closer to 1% than 2%, bitcoin ETF assets could still reach ‚Äú$500 billion within a few years.‚Äù The bottom line: If advisors can finally ‚Äúintegrate crypto directly into traditional balanced portfolios,‚Äù the firm concludes, the industry will likely look back on this period as the point ‚Äúwhere crypto transitions from a niche investment to a standard portfolio component, alongside equities, bonds, and gold.‚Äù At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $3.71 trillion.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: ‚ÄúFor my many mentors, who taught me the importance of scientific integrity.‚Äù‚Äî Steven E. Koonin, dedication in Unsettled? (2021) Number of the Week: 0.45% per year, 0.82% per year, and 1.51% per year THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW begins with a discussion of an effort by the UN to establish a global carbon tax. TWTW presents some responses from GROK AI to questions like why do many physicists object to quantum mechanics? TWTW discusses some weaknesses in a new paper from members of the CERES project and it discusses a report on crossing tipping points. TWTW concludes with a discussion of a paper on the world record surface temperature and a UK master food plan. ********************* Global Carbon Tax: For years, some commentators have speculated why the UN was so emphatic in creating fear of carbon dioxide, which is essential for life on Earth. In the 1850s Earth was coming out of the Little Ice Age when famine was a widespread problem in temperate regions when crops did not ripen. A bit of warming was a blessing that permitted crops to ripen. The UN ignored this history. In their efforts to create fear, the UN relied on computer models with questionable assumptions. When tested against atmospheric temperatures the models clearly fail, significantly overestimating the warming of the atmosphere, where the greenhouse effect occurs. The UN ignored this fact and many others in making questionable claims about the warming effect of carbon dioxide in today‚Äôs atmosphere. Based on decades of laboratory experiments, carbon dioxide has a slight warming effect, which is beneficial, not harmful for life on Earth. Further, thousands of studies show that adding carbon dioxide will make most plants more robust, particularly C3 plants that include virtually all food crops except C4 grasses such as corn (maize), sugarcane, sorghum, and millets. Yet even C4 plants do better in an atmosphere richer in CO2. Greenhouses and hothouses growing plants routinely double or even triple the amount of CO2 in their atmospheres to promote growth. These yield fresh vegetables year-round, even in cold climates such as in the northern parts of Europe and North America. The UN typically dismisses or ignores such benefits. The UN‚Äôs actions in creating fear of carbon dioxide prompted some commentators to speculate that the UN hopes to obtain a source of funding independent of governments that can hold it accountable by instituting a carbon tax or a regulatory authority to collect fees for emissions of carbon dioxide. Such commentators have been dismissed as cynics. This year, the UN showed they are not. In April, the UN International Maritime Organization planned to institute a Global Carbon Tax, which was to be implemented in a meeting on October 17. On October 10, the US State Department issued a joint statement by the Secretaries of State, Energy, and Transportation titled ‚ÄúTaking Action to Defend America from the UN‚Äôs First Global Carbon Tax ‚Äì the International Maritime Organization‚Äôs (IMO) ‚ÄúNet-Zero Framework‚Äù (NZF).‚Äù The statement asserts: ‚ÄúPresident Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people. Next week, members of the IMO will vote on the adoption of a so-called NZF aimed at reducing global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector. This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world. The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security. The NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided. The United States is considering the following actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers: The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.‚Äù On October 17, at the IMO meeting in London with over 100 countries represented, Saudi Arabia moved to table the talk of a tax until next year, the motion to table carried, and the meeting was adjourned. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Defending the Orthodoxy. ********************* GROK‚Äôs Answer: Last week‚Äôs TWTW contained a discussion by Tilak Doshi essay describing how big tech censors the news using their search engines by not including dissenting views, no matter how strongly based on physical evidence these views are. Those who desire to obtain differing views on a controversial subject cannot hope to do so using most internet search engines. TWTW asked Google AI: Why do many physicists object to quantum mechanics? It received a mushy answer about the so-called scientific consensus. The response was unhelpful in trying to understand why journal editors routinely reject papers written by Atomic, Molecular, and Optical (AMO) physicists based on evidence obtained by experiment or observation. Is the IPCC false ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù view that dominant? TWTW asked GROK AI the same question it asked Google AI. The response began with: ‚ÄúMany physicists don‚Äôt outright reject quantum mechanics‚Äîit‚Äôs the most successful theory in physics, underpinning technologies from semiconductors to lasers. However, a significant number object to its interpretations, particularly the standard Copenhagen interpretation, due to deep conceptual problems. Here‚Äôs why:‚Äù The response from GROK AI was far more satisfactory than from Google AI. So TWTW asked GROK AI to think harder. The response was: BEGIN QUOTE Many physicists don‚Äôt outright reject quantum mechanics‚Äîit‚Äôs the most successful theory in physics, underpinning technologies from semiconductors to lasers. However, a significant number object to its interpretations, particularly the standard Copenhagen interpretation, due to deep conceptual problems. Here‚Äôs why: 1. The Measurement Problem 2. Nonlocality and ‚ÄúSpooky Action at a Distance‚Äù 3. Lack of a Unified Interpretation 4. Incompleteness and the Classical-Quantum Divide 5. Philosophical and Aesthetic Discomfort Notable Critics and Alternatives Physicist/Thinker Main Objection Proposed Alternative Albert Einstein Nonlocality, incompleteness Hidden variables Edwin Schr√∂dinger Measurement absurdity Unified field theory David Bohm Indeterminism Pilot-wave (deterministic) Gerard ‚Äòt Hooft Observer-dependence Superdeterminism Roger Penrose No gravity integration Objective collapse Sabine Hossenfelder Philosophical vagueness Emergent QM from deeper laws Counterpoint: Why Most Physicists Accept It Bottom Line Objections stem from conceptual ugliness, not failed predictions. Quantum mechanics is like a black box: input experiment, output flawless result‚Äîbut open it, and it‚Äôs philosophically messy. Many physicists (e.g., ~40% in surveys) favor alternatives like Many-Worlds or Bohmian mechanics. The debate rages because physics craves not just what works, but what is real. Ongoing work in quantum gravity (string theory, loop quantum gravity) may resolve this‚Äîor reveal even stranger truths. END QUOTE The response from GROK AI suggests an interesting dilemma for government policy makers. We have global climate models based on principles of classical physics that do not work. And we have calculations by noted physicists based on physical evidence but out of the context of classical physics and objected to by noted classical physicists. Which should be used? It may be disturbing, but because we do not have an intuitive understanding of ‚Äúwhy it works‚Äù is no reason to not use it. ********************* CERES Cloudiness: According to NASA‚Äôs Clouds and the Earth‚Äôs Radiant Energy System (CERES) mission website: ‚ÄúClimate is controlled by the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth and the amount of infrared energy emitted to space. These quantities‚Äìtogether with their difference‚Äìdefine Earth‚Äôs radiation budget (ERB). The Clouds and the Earth‚Äôs Radiant Energy System (CERES) project provides satellite-based observations of ERB and clouds. It uses measurements from CERES instruments flying on several satellites along with data from many other instruments to produce a comprehensive set of ERB data products for climate, weather, and applied science research. The goals of the CERES project are to: Writing in PNAS, the CERES team reports that twenty-four years of satellite observations from CERES show that the Northern Hemisphere (NH) is becoming darker while the Southern Hemisphere (SH) is becoming brighter. The abstract states, in part: ‚ÄúThe emerging darkening of the NH relative to the SH is associated with changes in hemispheric differences in aerosol‚Äìradiation interactions, surface albedo, and water vapor changes. Cloud changes also contribute to a greater ASR [absorbed solar radiation] hemispheric contrast, but the magnitude is small due to opposing trend differences in the tropics and extratropics. The break in hemispheric symmetry in ASR challenges the notion that clouds naturally compensate for forced hemispheric asymmetries in noncloud properties. Hemispheric (a)symmetry in radiation is linked with the atmosphere‚Äìocean general circulation. How clouds respond to this hemispheric imbalance has important implications for future climate.‚Äù The effort to understand changing cloudiness and other properties of Earth that influence climate is notable but as John Robson points out, the reasoning becomes questionable when the authors write: ‚ÄúTo gain some insight, we use the multimodel mean climate model simulations in ref. 25 for 2001 to 2019 to examine hemispheric trends in cloud radiative effect (CRE; defined as the difference between clear and all-sky downward TOA flux) and contributions from cloud feedback, ‚Äúeffective radiative forcing‚Äù ERF (sum of IRF and rapid adjustments), and the associated cloud masking terms (due to variations in noncloud properties).‚Äù [Boldface added.] Why do the authors seek an explanation using ‚Äúthe multimodel mean climate model simulations‚Äù for explanations of the data? The models have been shown to overestimate atmospheric temperature tends, thus falsified. The purpose of the mission is to produce a data record to improve our understanding of the Earth‚Äôs radiation budget by observations and thus hope to improve global climate models. Writing for Net Zero Watch, David Whitehouse has a more generous view of this paper. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Crossing Tipping Points: An organization called Global Tipping Points produced a slick 2025 report by 160 authors, from 23 countries and 87 institutions claiming we are crossing dangerous ‚Äútipping points.‚Äù These ‚Äúare stages reached when it is generally agreed by experts that an ecosystem has reached a point of inevitable major degradation.‚Äù One such point is the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. Jo Nova points out that Peter Ridd and the Reef Rebels use The Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) studies which show a significant improvement in the Great Barrier Reef in the 2020s with a slight decline in 2025. The amount of coral cover at the Reef is now higher than it was any time before 2023 since systematic data collection began in 1985. TWTW asks: How many tipping points were crossed by environmental degradation during the Eemian period, the last interglacial with the environment rebounding from thousands of feet of ice covering most of North America? Will tipping points be crossed when Earth cools again with the onset of a severe glaciation? All this is an effort to drum up support for the 2025, 30th Conference of Parties (COP) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which will take place in November in Bel√©m, Brazil. For the report and Jo Nova‚Äôs pointed criticism see links under Defending the Orthodoxy, for other comments see links under Defending the Orthodoxy ‚Äì Bandwagon Science, for comments about COP-30 see links under After Paris!, and an article on the supposed plight of corals under Changing Seas. ********************* Will It Fall? The generally accepted world record high temperature is 134¬∫ F (57¬∫ C) recorded at Greenland Ranch, Death Valley, California on July 10, 1913. Roy W. Spencer, John R. Christy, and William T. Reid have a paper published by the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society stating that the temperature is approximately 14 ¬∫ F (8 ¬∫C) higher than it should be. They provide their justification for this assertion. We shall see if the record falls. See links under Measurement Issues ‚Äì Surface. ********************* Master Food Plan: Writing in WUWT, Eric Worrall states that the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) has published its Roadmap for Resilience: A UK Food Plan for 2050, ‚ÄúThe Agri-Food for Net Zero Network+ was established by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) in 2022 to consider the challenge of transforming the UK‚Äôs food system to meet our climate commitments. Since then, we‚Äôve built a community of over 3,000 researchers, practitioners, and policymakers from across the UK dedicated to finding pathways to a more sustainable future.‚Äù Key points are: Will fresh vegetables from hothouses with CO2 levels two the three times that of ambient air be permitted? See links under Agriculture Issues & Fear of Famine ********************* Number of the Week: 0.45% per year, 0.82% per year, and 1.51% per year. The UK‚Äôs Climate Change Act was enacted in 2008. Germany started earlier to reduce CO2 emissions, in 1990, but it did not have a legally binding law until 2019. Elected in 2008, the Obama Administration tried to establish a net zero program in the US but failed. According to the US Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, based on data from the World Bank, in 2010 dollars, not seasonally adjusted, the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the UK was 44,065 in 2008 and 47,265 in 2024. This is an increase of 7.26% for the entire 16 years or 0.45% per year. Correspondingly, Germany had a per capita GDP of 38,996 in 2008, 44108 in 2024 for an increase of 13.11% for the period or 0.82% per year. Correspondingly, The US had a per capita GDP of 53,703 in 2008 and 66,682 in 2024 for an increase of 24.17% over the period or 1.51% per year.

Over the past two decades, we have witnessed an ideological capture of science no less insidious, though cloaked in the virtuous robes of DEI, ‚Äòclimate justice‚Äô and public health. In the realms of climate policy and COVID-19 response, institutions that were once bastions of rigorous inquiry ‚Äî the United Nations, the European Union, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and peer-reviewed journals ‚Äî have been co-opted by a progressive ideology.

Oct 14, 2025 What you see is what you get‚Ä¶ unfortunately By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 15, 2025 We call it double nonsense because it starts with the common fatuity Thomas Sowell explores in A Conflict of Visions of believing the key to successful public policy initiatives is sufficiently strong, and sufficiently loudly proclaimed, good intentions. It is a strange thing for adults to believe about anything. It wouldn‚Äôt get you far in car repair, for instance. Or cooking. And after a few years living on your own you ought to know good intentions don‚Äôt get the dog fed, the sink cleaned or much of anything. [Canada‚Äôs Minister of Environment and Climate Change] Dabrusin‚Äôs remarks are rendered doubly and hopelessly inane by the fact that Canadian politicians, mostly in her own party, have had one thing and one thing only on the climate file for a third of a century now. And it is (drum roll please) ambition. They have not had understanding, of the science, the economics or the administration. They certainly have not had success. But over and over again they have brandished their vaulting ambition. What Climate Crisis? By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 17, 2025 17-minute video featuring a proponent of clean energy claiming we need to do more and Daily Sceptic‚Äôs Chris Morrison Yes Virginia, David can slay Goliath By Ronald Stein, America Out Loud News, Oct 13, 2025 The misunderstanding of ‚Äúgreen‚Äù delusionists is treating electricity as interchangeable with materials, as it is the central flaw of the green movement. Electricity is a utility, not a substance. In fact, steel, cement, plastics, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals all require hydrocarbons‚Äînot simply as fuel but as essential feedstocks. Oil, natural gas, and coal are the molecular foundations for over 6,000 everyday products that define modern life. Without them, hospitals would lack sterile equipment, farmers would lose fertilizers, and the construction of roads, bridges, and homes would grind to a halt. Nonprofits Cruelly Normalize Poverty for Climate Virtue By Vijay Jayaraj, CO2 Coalition, Oct 16, 2025 Similarly, Africa today accounts for less than 5% of global oil product demand despite presenting 18% of the world‚Äôs population.‚Äù Government budgets in the U.S. and Europe have poured millions into climate initiatives purportedly aimed at ‚Äúmitigation‚Äù and ‚Äúresilience.‚Äù Disguised is the redirection of funds into programs meant to deny oil and natural gas development in regions that need it most. #HaveItBothWays: Plants going uphill By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 15, 2025 The logic is impeccable. Cold temperature limits plant growth so as temperatures rise, the upper line where plants including trees can and do grow will travel uphill. It is even, awkwardly for climate alarmists, one of the ways we know it was warmer during the Medieval Warm Period: trees grew at higher altitudes (and latitudes). And so it was in 2002 that a group of scientists carefully and logically made the case that the optimal range of trees would start shifting uphill.

But as of the early 21st century ICAT stopped tracking the standard literature and started using the now-canceled and grossly overstated NOAA Billion Dollar Disaster data set, stitching it on to the earlier part of the series despite being constructed on a completely different basis. Putting the two different series together, a hoary statistical no-no, caused an upward trend to appear in the G18 paper where none did previously. It was that the IPCC and NCA ignored over 60 other studies reporting the absence of a disaster trend and put all their faith in one study claiming a trend exists. And then when that study was shown to be invalid, the scientific authorities refused to correct the record. We‚Äôd call that a scandal. We‚Äôd even call it a shocking scandal, except that we‚Äôve seen it too often to be shocked anymore. And clearly many in the field who know better are not sufficiently shocked to speak up.

The battleground is Sunrise Wind, a 924 megawatt (MW) offshore wind project located roughly 30 miles east of Long Island‚Äôs Montauk Point.

Sunrise has all its federal permits, but offshore construction has yet to begin, or, as the industry puts it, there is no ‚Äústeel in the water.‚Äù The Trump administration has vowed to stop all offshore wind projects that are not already under construction, so Sunrise must be in the federal crosshairs.

As early as 2030, a deficit of up to 21,000 MW is expected. This gap will inevitably lead to massive power supply bottlenecks during periods of Dunkelflaute (low wind and no solar radiation). To cover up the misery, the BNetzA is planning a direct attack on energy-intensive German industry. Under the AgNES project, the so-called ‚ÄúBandlastrabatt‚Äú (base-load tariff discount) for the 560 companies in the basic materials industry (chemicals, metals, glass), which operate 24/7, is to be abolished. The justification: Industry must become the scapegoat for the failed energy policy and ‚Äúflexibilize‚Äú its production according to the wind and weather. This is simply impossible for continuous processes like copper or glass production. The cancellation of the ‚Ç¨1.42 billion discount is of existential importance for the basic materials industry.

Tritium‚Äîwhose half-life is 12 years‚Äîbonds with oxygen, meaning the wastewater cannot be filtered. Regulations on radioactive releases from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal body managing decommissions, are based on the dose to the public, regardless of the volume of the discharge. NRC has an internal goal to keep the dose from liquid releases below three millirem per year at the release point, and a legal limit of 25 millirem per year. The calculated dose to the public from Indian Point in 2021 was about 0.011966 millirem‚Äîabout one-thousandth of the federal cap. [SEPP Comment: Tritium or hydrogen3 (3H) is extremely rare. It is produced naturally by the interaction of atmospheric gases with cosmic rays.] Amazon Unveils ‚ÄòCascade‚Äô‚ÄîEnergy Northwest‚Äôs Xe-100 SMR Project, Targeting Construction by 2030 By Sonal Patel, Power Mag, Oct 15,2025 Amazon‚Äôs Climate Pledge, which aims to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, unites more than 550 signatories across 55 industries to accelerate joint action on climate solutions.

Death of a ‚ÄòClean Energy‚Äô Debacle A new ‚Äòendangerment‚Äô study shows that the climate battle is over except for the lawfare. By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., WSJ, Oct. 14, 2025 The columnist begins with: ‚ÄúOh, the humanity, I sarcastically thought on reading the names and affiliations of 39 scientists behind a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine finding that, as the New York Times put it, ‚Äògreenhouse gases are, in fact, a danger.‚Äô Read on and realize their book-length report is concocted for a bureaucratic and legalistic purpose, not a scientific one. It will disappear into the maw of a futile partisan legal squabble over the Trump administration‚Äôs effort to repeal the 2009 so-called endangerment finding by the Environmental Protection Agency. This finding, in the Obama years, would be used to justify regulatory actions that have zero impact‚Äînone‚Äîon climate change. Not only are U.S. emissions too small a share of the global total to matter; in practice, EPA actions mostly just drive U.S. emissions offshore. Whatever they think, the 39 scientists are part of a machine now defending its own activity and privilege, in one of the biggest boondoggles in the history of policy making. Remember the left-wing film director Michael Moore‚Äôs 2019 opus ‚ÄòPlanet of the Humans‚Äô? Of course you don‚Äôt. It was shadow-banned by the left and film distributors not because it was short on climate apocalyptics‚Äîit was over-the-top on climate apocalyptics. It was shadow-banned for pointing out that U.S. climate policy was a fraud. It consisted of colossal pork barrel that was having no effect on the alleged problem. Richard York, of the University of Oregon, is seen marveling in the film at the self-willed blindness of the U.S. policy community to a simple question: Do clean-energy subsidies result in fossil fuels being displaced? ‚ÄòThey don‚Äôt even know that that‚Äôs a question,‚Äô he says in a voice of wonder. As often happens, truth tellers weren‚Äôt really in short supply. As often happens too, we can pinpoint the exact moment and exact dynamics when a policy boondoggle was born. President Obama was taking office amid the 2008-09 financial crisis. Money printing was popular; new energy taxes weren‚Äôt. So he abandoned his party‚Äôs long-standing advocacy of a carbon tax in favor of turning green energy into just another thing government money printing could support. Put it this way: Hot dog consumption would surely rise if hot dogs were subsidized by government. Purely a conceit, though, is any idea that cheeseburger consumption would simultaneously decline. It doesn‚Äôt follow. And so it has proved: Energy consumption has simply grown overall. It‚Äôs almost too big a question. Why, under the First Amendment and the special protections it enjoys, does our press still fail us? If the press has any job, it‚Äôs policy analysis‚Äîto tell us whether government actions are producing their stated aims or devolving into pocket lining by special interests, in this case amounting to trillions of dollars in the U.S. and around the world. Last year a study put paid to magical thinking. Of 1,500 climate policies adopted in 41 countries over two decades, less than 5% have resulted in any reduction of emissions. Donald Trump has been good for one thing, showing millions of Americans why they should feel contempt for their media and leadership elites. But he has mostly succeeded at beating these elites at their own game of electoral politics, not changing the game. This week‚Äôs partial Hamas defeat may prove a game changer. His productive disabling of the green energy elite may be a longer-lasting game changer.‚Äù The columnist compares some politicians, then concludes with: ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt mean we should welcome growing CO2. But if you‚Äôre not trying to get at the truth, you‚Äôre doing something else. ‚ÄòNegative impacts might be more severe in the absence of efforts to adapt,‚Äô the report is reduced to nonsensically arguing, as if adaptation is not the definition of being alive for humans and other creatures. Two lessons are worth drawing from this whole sorry episode: Beings who think themselves independent and science-minded are not immune to the reward system in which they operate. The bigger lesson concerns how democracy‚Äôs error-correction function can be impeded when an unnatural uniformity prevails among elites. This has clearly been the case during the 16 years and approximately 350 days of the green energy fraud.‚Äù ***************** Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Title: One in Four charity sees more men than women come forward for first time

The One in Four charity, which supports survivors of child sex abuse, saw more men than women come forward last year, for the first time in its more than 20-year history. In what was also its busiest year, the proportion of male survivors reached a ‚Äúhistoric high‚Äù ‚Äì a development the charity puts down to the aftermath of the Blackrock Boys radio documentary, which detailed historic sexual abuse of two brothers, Mark and David Ryan, at Blackrock College in south Co Dublin. It led to the establishment of a scoping inquiry into abuse in religious-run schools and, this year, a commission of investigation. Its work is ongoing. The charity‚Äôs 2024 annual report, published on Monday, notes the 14 per cent increase in the proportion of male survivors ‚Äì from 48 per cent of all contacts in 2023 to 62 per cent ‚Äì and that this increase coincided with the Government‚Äôs publication of the Scoping Inquiry Report into Historical Sexual Abuse in Schools. ‚ÄúContacts to the service increased by 17 per cent, with 7,674 support sessions delivered to 1,292 individuals. Advocacy support requests rose by 21 per cent,‚Äù says the report. ‚ÄúThe percentage of male survivors coming forward reached a historic high, climbing to 62 per cent from 48 per cent [in 2023].‚Äù One in Four chief executive Deirdre Kenny said the trend indicated that when the State ‚Äútalks honestly about child sexual abuse and demonstrates that survivors will be heard, people respond. ‚ÄúThe public conversation and the visibility of the scoping inquiry have helped create an environment in which survivors ‚Äì especially men ‚Äì felt able to come forward and seek support.‚Äù In all, the charity delivered almost 8,000 sessions of support to 1,292 people. Nearly half (44 per cent) were living in Dublin, with 45 per cent in the rest of Ireland and the remaining abroad or unknown. More than half were men (62 per cent), with 37 per cent women and 1 per cent non-binary. ‚ÄúThese numbers represent not just statistics, but real people breaking years, sometimes decades, of silence,‚Äù said Ms Kenny. In July last year, the Government published the report of the scoping inquiry into historical sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders. Its primary recommendation, that a commission of investigation be established, was accepted by the Government. It appointed Mr Justice Michael MacGrath to chair the commission which will examine the handling of allegations, suspicions and concerns of historical sexual abuse all primary and post-primary schools. Ms Kenny said the commission would ‚Äúplay a crucial role in examining decades of child sexual abuse in schools and uncovering the lessons of our past‚Äù.

Title: Will Japan‚Äôs banks soon invest in Bitcoin? FSA weighs major reform

Japan‚Äôs crypto adoption exploded 120% in 2025 amid positive policy shift. The interest in digital assets has grown, especially in Japan. Per Chainalysis, Japan topped the 2025 adoption list with a 120% crypto user growth. Japan may be gearing up for a major overhaul to drive crypto adoption. The country‚Äôs regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), is considering allowing banks to hold crypto assets like Bitcoin [BTC] as investments, according to a Livedoor report. In recent years, the cryptocurrency market has grown massively, with the U.S leading in institutional adoption via ETFs. The crypto holdings of the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, BlackRock, recently crossed $100 billion. Other banks and investment firms like JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley allow wealthy clients to have crypto exposure in the U.S. In July, Standard Chartered also made a similar move for its U.K. customers, starting with BTC and Ethereum [ETH]. At that time, the banking giant said there was ‚Äúgrowing interest in regulated digital asset solutions.‚Äù To achieve and catch up with its counterparts in the U.S, Japan seeks to expand its regulatory clarity to allow crypto in banking investments. Per Livedoor, a working group under the Prime Minister is set to discuss the new guidelines to allow banks to act as crypto exchanges. Given crypto‚Äôs volatility, the risk mitigation system for banks will also be explored to ensure the safety of the institutions. In June, the FSA proposed a reclassification of crypto assets into ‚Äúfinancial products‚Äù to pave the way for crypto ETFs (exchange-traded funds). It is the same framework that applies to securities and other traditional financial products in Japan. Pundits also highlighted that the move would slash crypto taxes from over 50% to 20%. Given the similar treatment as traditional stocks, the country also banned crypto insider trading with new rules. Collectively, the recent updates have been geared towards ensuring user protections and further adoption. In fact, Chainalysis‚Äôs report singled out Japan as the fastest-growing crypto market across the broader Asia-Pacific region in 2025. It saw a 120% crypto market growth thanks to regulatory shifts, with Ripple [XRP] as the dominant crypto asset. Indonesia, South Korea, and India followed closely at 103%, 100% and 99% growth rates. Source: Chainalysis As of early 2025, there were about 12 million new crypto accounts in Japan, a 3.5X surge from five years ago.

Title: BlackRock to Develop Tokenization Tech as Bitcoin ETF Passes $100 Billion in Assets

BlackRock is developing technology to tokenize a wide range of assets and expand its digital investment offerings. BlackRock is developing its own technology to tokenize a broad range of assets, from real estate to equities and bonds. CEO Larry Fink said the global market currently holds more than $4.5 trillion in digital wallets, spanning crypto, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. ‚ÄúA lot of that money is outside the United States,‚Äù Fink said on CNBC earlier today, emphasizing the opportunity for the firm to reach new investors through digital channels. Fink said tokenization could allow investors who are entering markets through crypto to access more traditional long-term products, such as retirement funds. ‚ÄúIf we could tokenize an ETF, we could get them into the more traditional long-term retirement products,‚Äù he said, pointing to BlackRock‚Äôs digital platforms, which include tokenized money market funds and Bitcoin investments that have grown to over $100 billion. Fink also said yesterday that Bitcoin and crypto ‚Äúserve same purpose as gold.‚Äù BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, launched just 21 months ago, is BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable fund ‚Äî outranking even products that have been in circulation for more than two decades. The firm‚Äôs growth extends beyond digital assets. Fink highlighted record inflows across ETFs, private markets, AI-driven equity strategies, and investment technology platforms. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt just one product area. It was not just one region. It was a completeness,‚Äù he said, noting the breadth of BlackRock‚Äôs growth across business lines. Fink credited the firm‚Äôs strategy of combining active and passive management, public and private markets, and technology overlays for driving this expansion. Fink also stressed the value of long-term investing in his chat: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about if our market‚Äôs going up or down, is there a bubble in crypto or technology. It‚Äôs about being in the market throughout the cycle,‚Äù he said. He underscored the power of compounding over decades, noting that even a small additional return can significantly grow a retirement portfolio over a 30-year horizon. Looking ahead, Fink said regulatory clarity in the U.S. and further investment in digital asset innovation will be critical to supporting market growth. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets,‚Äù he said. The firm expects that over the coming decades, tokenized financial products will allow investors to remain within a digital ecosystem while accessing the full spectrum of traditional and alternative investments.

October 19, 2025 13:44 ET | Source: NB HASH NB HASH London, United Kingdom, Oct. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As inflation persists and global interest rates continue to fall, institutional capital is searching for a new destination that offers both stability and yield.This month, investment giant BlackRock made headlines by expanding its exposure to Real-World Assets (RWA) ‚Äî a move that many analysts see as the clearest sign yet that real-asset tokenization has entered the mainstream.While large institutions are beginning to capitalize on this opportunity, NB HASH is taking it a step further ‚Äî opening the door for everyday investors to participate in the same asset-backed yield strategies that Wall Street is now chasing.

Title: Sarsfields ease past Midleton to regain Cork crown

RT√â Sport contributor Sarsfields 2-18 Midleton 1-14 Sarsfields lifted their second Co-op SuperStores Premier Senior Hurling Championship title in three seasons following a seven-point victory over Midleton at SuperValu P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh. The Riverstown-based club made light work of their divisional rivals with player of the match Jack O'Connor hitting 0-05 and James Sweeney getting two goals. The result adds another chapter into the story being written by management duo Johnny Crowley and Diarmuid O‚ÄôSullivan, and it follows success in last year‚Äôs Munster championship and three consecutive Cork league titles. It felt like business as usual for the club and their reward was a comfortable 1-09 to 1-03 advantage at the interval. Midleton were missing Conor Lehane and Eoin Moloney, two important components in the team that reached the final via victories over Glen Rovers and Blackrock. Clinical finish from James Sweeney after being set up by Cian Darcy as @SarsfieldsCork register their first green flag in the @OfficialCorkGAA final #rtegaa #sundaygame pic.twitter.com/NGuG8EC15k The Magpies only led once, through an Evan McGrath green flag at the City End in the 10th minute after a mistake by the Sars back-line presented the midfielder with an open goal. That made the scoreboard read 1-00 to 0-02 and the soon to be champions immediately went back in front through a brace of Colm McCarthy frees. O‚ÄôConnor then got in on the action, just before Sweeney rifled the back of the net with a blistering strike after collecting a pass from Cian Darcy. That made it 1-05 to 1-00 and the first half finished with a burst by Midleton that wasn‚Äôt enough to dent Sars‚Äô lead or confidence. The game restarted with O‚ÄôConnor splitting the posts and McCarthy getting his seventh, as their overall lead grew to 1-11 to 1-03. Full-time: @SarsfieldsCork 2-18 @MidletonGaa 1-14 James Sweeney slips home his second goal to ensure that Sarsfields regain the @OfficialCorkGAA senior hurling title, the eighth in their history #rtegaa #sundaygame pic.twitter.com/dJC2GQm8W4 The Magpies did make of a game of it in the end, by bringing it back to four points as more and more black and white jerseys began finding space. This started with a burst that involved Mikey Finn nailing a free and a 45, in addition to Killian McDermott sneaking the sliotar over from the tightest of angles. Then came a goal chance at the near post from Alex Quirke and this was scrambled off the line by Sars. A green flag would have made it a two point game, instead it galvanised the eventual champions as they came through the next 20 minutes without a scratch from their divisional rivals. Even when Midleton got it back to four at 1-13 to 1-09, they remained in control and saw out the game with O‚ÄôConnor scoring three points from play. Sweeney rounded out the win in the dying seconds with a close range goal after escaping his marker at the City End. Sarsfields: Ben Graham; Conor O‚ÄôSullivan, Cillian Roche, Donal English; Bryan Murphy, Luke Elliott, Craig Leahy; Daniel Hogan (0-1), Killian Murphy (0-1); Jack O‚ÄôConnor (0-5), Colm McCarthy (0-8, 7f), Cian Darcy (0-1); Daniel Kearney, James Sweeney (2-0), Barry O‚ÄôFlynn (0-1).

Title: Sunday Summary: Marc Holliday Is Not Playing Around

¬© 2025 Observer Media ¬∑ Terms ¬∑ Privacy SL Green Realty‚Äôs earnings call last week was pretty good. The largest office owner in New York City saw cash flow increase ($164.4 million versus $155.9 million the previous quarter). They scored profitable sales. And leasing was downright great ‚ÄîTeneo Holdings, the global consulting firm, took 46,551 square feet at 280 Park Avenue, and asset management firm Sagard Capital Partners added 31,580 square feet to its previous 8,936 square feet at the same address; at One Madison Avenue, SL Green leased the sixth floor (92,663 square feet) to Harvey AI Corporation; and over at the Lipstick Building (885 Third Avenue) the law firm Fox Horan & Camerini signed a 19,200-square-foot lease. All very good. But the thing that most caught our attention was the big continuation bet CEO Marc Holliday just put on Midtown the day before the call: $730 million on 65 East 55th Street (aka Park Avenue Tower), which the REIT is buying from Blackstone. A month earlier, Holliday scooped up 346 Madison Avenue ‚Äî the former home of Brooks Brothers ‚Äî and 11 East 44th Street from Claudio Del Vecchio for $160 million. On the call, Holliday gave a sense of what SL Green has planned. ‚ÄúOver the past five years, we saw the heightened demand for well-located Park Avenue and Grand Central assets long before the competition, and now it‚Äôs truly paying off,‚Äù Holliday said. ‚ÄúEarlier in the quarter, we delivered on our goal of identifying a major new development site, acquiring 346 Madison Avenue and 11 East 44th across the street from One Vanderbilt. This is the perfect place to build the next great building.‚Äù Hopefully this can make up for losing out on SL Green‚Äôs proposed casino in Times Square ‚Äî although this might have been a blessing in disguise for the real estate giant. A firm further along in the bidding process for a downstate gaming license, MGM Empire City, looked at the numbers for a Yonkers casino and said, ‚ÄúThanks, but no thanks.‚Äù And, maybe it‚Äôs just us, but we‚Äôre seeing a pattern. The major developers and tenants are betting big on the Plaza District. BXP found an anchor for its $2 billion, 930,000-square-foot 343 Madison Avenue: The insurance and investment giant C.V. Starr, which is taking about 30 percent of the unbuilt tower. And fashion deity Prada is getting pretty ambitious with its plans for 720-724 Fifth Avenue ‚Äî they‚Äôre currently finishing up talks with Related Companies to build a skyscraper on the prime spot. A few other sites are wooing tenants and, given the fact that new office construction ground to a halt during the pandemic, these sites are actually poised to do extremely well. Not everyone wants to talk about office By sheer numbers, the deal of the week has to be the dizzying, $40 billion bet that is being organized by BlackRock ‚Äî and includes firms NVIDIA, Microsoft and MGX ‚Äî for Aligned Data Centers, which consists of about 50 data center campuses globally (with a lot more on the way) to cater to AI mania. And that‚Äôs hardly the only big asset bet last week. Whatever anyone thinks about the hospitality market, Cain is seeing the value of the the Dominick Hotel at SoHo‚Äôs 246 Spring Street, having plunked down $175 million for the 390-key lodging, which will be reopened as a Delano hotel. Speaking of Cain, they‚Äôve also been planning a lush new park as part of the multibillion-dollar One Beverly Hills in Southern California. This is notable because parks are an increasingly rarefied amenity, with an average of 6,000 acres of open space going bye-bye throughout the country every single day. (Sheesh! When did fresh air and grass become luxuries?) ‚ÄúLand is a finite resource, and it‚Äôs an incredibly important one for our cities and communities, and there are a lot of pressures on how we use that land,‚Äù said Bianca Clarke of the Trust for Public Land. ‚ÄúThe problem is, if we use land for uses other than public spaces, it‚Äôs really difficult then to create public spaces where we need them.‚Äù The building of parks has fallen increasingly on developers, with private developers accounting for 67 percent of the park and greenway space in 10 major cities in the country. Housing, housing, housing! But the asset we want to talk about most this week is not hospitality, data centers or office. It‚Äôs housing. Part of the reason is because of the activity: the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) plunked down $49.7 million for the 154-unit Emerald Apartments in Downtown L.A.; Crescent Heights nabbed a $238.4 million refinancing for Forma, its 40-story, 588-unit luxury tower in Miami‚Äôs Edgewater (which comes with a Whole Foods to boot!); and the Miami-based Resident Group secured a $113.8 million refinancing from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for a 32-story, 279-unit luxury tower, also in Edgewater (honestly, we didn‚Äôt know HUD backed luxury housing). And we would be lax if we failed to mention that Midtown Park, the $2 billion mixed-use project in Miami from Rosso Development, Midtown Development and Proper Hospitality, got approval last week from the Urban Development Review Board to begin construction. However, the reason we‚Äôre most excited about housing this week is that CO dropped its first ever Power Residential list on Tuesday. The list represents our selections for the 35 most important names in residential real estate throughout the country. Some are developers who have quietly built tens of thousands of houses and apartment buildings. Others are brokers who moved billions of dollars worth of luxury condos. There are architects, lawyers and reality TV stars among their number. Take a leisurely look through it. See you next week! Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: Cardano‚Äôs Charles Hoskinson Chimes in on Bitcoin‚Äôs 4-Year Cycle Discourse
URL: https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-chimes-in-on-bitcoins-4-year-cycle-discourse/
Time Published: 2025-10-19T09:33:31Z
Full Content:
Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson believes the long-standing idea of Bitcoin‚Äôs four-year market cycle may soon become obsolete. In an interview with CNBC, Hoskinson argued that as institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity deepen their involvement in the market, Bitcoin‚Äôs historical rhythm of boom-and-bust tied to halving events could fade away. For more than a decade, Bitcoin‚Äôs price action has followed a familiar four-year pattern, rising sharply after each halving, reaching new highs, and then retracing by as much as 85% before stabilizing. Hoskinson suggested that this predictable pattern no longer fits the realities of a maturing market. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre gonna see those kinds of cycles anymore because there is too much money in the space and there is too much market structure,‚Äù he said, adding that complex financial products like synthetics and derivatives will dampen volatility. According to Hoskinson, the inflow of institutional capital will create ‚Äústronger floors and less volatility,‚Äù gradually pushing Bitcoin toward more stable price behavior. He also predicted that this stability will play a crucial role in onboarding the next half a billion users to crypto, with regulatory developments and risk-managed products reinforcing investor confidence. Despite his skepticism about Bitcoin‚Äôs four-year rhythm, Hoskinson believes altcoin seasons will persist. He recalled how the last cycle revolved around the search for an ‚ÄúEthereum killer,‚Äù spawning projects like Solana and Polkadot. In the next phase, he expects privacy-oriented platforms to take center stage, highlighting Cardano‚Äôs own Midnight project, which he says addresses issues such as oracles and stablecoins while strengthening the Cardano ecosystem. Analysts like Jo√£o Wedson, Alphractal CEO and verified CryptoQuant analyst, argue that the four-year fractal cycle remains intact, pointing to Bitcoin‚Äôs recent market behavior as proof. Others, like popular investor Ted Pillows, believe the absence of a euphoric blow-off top this time signals an evolving, liquidity-driven market that could see Bitcoin extend its rally into 2026.

The crypto market is entering a potentially decisive phase as investors track four developments that could shape sentiment for the rest of 2025. Experts anticipate a possible end to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs tightening campaign and a wave of pending ETF decisions that could widen institutional access to digital assets. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested this week that the central bank‚Äôs balance sheet runoff, known as quantitative tightening, may be nearing its conclusion. Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics conference, Powell noted that bank reserves were approaching an ample level, hinting that quantitative tightening could end in the coming months. Markets interpreted the comments as a sign that liquidity conditions could soon ease, a scenario historically supportive for risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Adding to the optimism, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman reaffirmed the likelihood of two interest rate cuts before the end of 2025, saying the labor market‚Äôs slowdown justifies a gradual policy pivot. Investors view such a shift as a green light for growth sectors. ‚ÄúWhen the Fed begins an easing cycle, bonds in the middle of the curve, around three to seven years, often strike the right balance of income and protection,‚Äù said Gargi Pal Chaudhuri, Chief Investment and Portfolio Strategist Americas at BlackRock. Another major catalyst looms on the regulatory front. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission faces final deadlines this month for 16 crypto-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), covering tokens such as Solana, XRP, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Bloomberg‚Äôs James Seyffart and ETF Store president Nate Geraci have called October a make-or-break period for the sector, with approval of even a handful of products expected to unlock fresh institutional inflows. Together, the potential end of quantitative tightening, prospects of rate cuts, and mounting anticipation over ETF approvals are forming a rare alignment of bullish factors for digital assets. As industry analyst Lark Davis put it, you might be missing what‚Äôs coming next if you ‚Äústill think the crypto market has topped.‚Äù

Title: Spiritan survivor calls for swifter redress and apology

Ailbhe Conneely Social Affairs & Religion Correspondent "I feel very empty, very raw, I'm missing him terribly." The words of David Ryan when asked how he is feeling following the second anniversary of his late brother Mark. "Two years on, it hits more, and while I‚Äôm more grounded, it‚Äôs poignant that he‚Äôs gone two years," he says. David and Mark Ryan were catapulted into the spotlight three years ago following the broadcast of RT√â‚Äôs Doc on One programme 'Blackrock Boys‚Äô. The brothers spoke publicly about the sexual abuse they suffered as boys on the campus of Blackrock College in Dublin run by the Spiritan Order. Their bravery and the manner in which they told their story resulted in former students contacting RT√â‚Äôs Liveline programme, alleging historical physical and sexual abuse. It all snowballed into hundreds of cases of alleged abuse being reported to garda√≠ as well as to the organisation One in Four - which supports survivors of child sexual abuse. Fr Martin Kelly offered a public apology to all victims and survivors on behalf of the Spiritan congregation, and independent experts were brought in by the order to guide survivors through a restorative justice programme. The Spiritan Restorative Justice Framework has six elements including an apology, therapy, testimony (truth telling), redress, memorialisation and restorative justice. Just half of those have been activated in full, according to a group which represents some of the victims/survivors called Restore Together. "Dragging its heels" Outstanding issues include redress, over which; the Order has been accused of "dragging its heels". Just over a week ago, the Spiritans denied deliberately delaying or obstructing the progress on a redress scheme. It confirmed that Rockwell Farm, (at Rockwell College in Co Tipperary), would be the first of the properties to be sold. It has been put on the market with an asking price of ‚Ç¨21m, a sum which is "only the tip of the iceberg", according to David Ryan. Speaking from his home, Mr Ryan questioned the length of time it would take for the Order to untie itself from assets, to provide redress to survivors. "We‚Äôre three years since the Doc on One, what‚Äôs happened in three years? Very little." Since ‚ÄòBlackrock Boys‚Äô aired in November 2022, David Ryan has twice been bereaved. The unexpected death of Mark in September 2023 received national attention. More recently, the death of David‚Äôs mother has focused his mind on the fleeting nature of life. He acknowledges the establishment of the Commission of Investigation into the Handling of Historical Child Sexual Abuse in Schools as a step, however there‚Äôs concern over the length of time it could take. "He (Judge Michael McGrath) will need to go through lots of reports, police statements and judging by how many victims/survivors that came forward through the Scoping Inquiry, and more are expected, it could be a long-drawn-out process which will frustrate people." There are reports that the commission could take five years, which, according to Mr Ryan, "is just way too long; survivors will be dead". "Lack of apology" A significant grievance of the now 61-year-old is a "lack of an apology" from the Taoiseach, which he called for in September 2024. Simon Harris TD who held the position at the time said he could not see a scenario where there would not be a State apology. Mr Ryan has been waiting to hear from Taoiseach Miche√°l Martin since he took up his role and is much aggrieved over the lack of an apology to victims and survivors. For two decades One In Four has supported David Ryan and tomorrow will launch its 2024 annual report. The announcement of the Scoping Inquiry in 2023 led to an increase in waiting lists for treatment and therapy from the organisation. It is likely that more victims/survivors sought help from the organisation last year, due to the publication of Mary O'Toole's report which found almost 2,400 allegations of sexual abuse in respect of 308 schools recorded by religious orders that ran the schools. When he first approached One in Four twenty years ago, David Ryan‚Äôs "head was on the ground". Such was the level of abuse and trauma he had endured; Mr Ryan would not attend a public bathroom, stay in a hotel, or go to a pool. He still can‚Äôt attend an indoor swimming pool, but with significant therapy in recent years he can use outdoor swimming areas. Through therapy and support, he acknowledges "he‚Äôs a different person now". He describes it as being "deprogrammed", requiring huge work on his part - reliving the abuse, playing it back and flashbacks. "I don‚Äôt blame myself any longer, it wasn‚Äôt my fault and looking back on it, they were the sick people, not me. "It‚Äôs only in the last year really that I'm accepting what happened to me."

Title: David McCullagh: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs plenty of people in the long grass hoping I‚Äôll fall flat on my face‚Äô

David McCullagh says it‚Äôs definitely time for him to move to radio. ‚ÄúIn the space of a week before the summer, women approached me at random on two separate occasions and told me I looked much better on telly.‚Äù One of these unsolicited verdicts on his real-life appearance was delivered just outside the RT√â campus in Montrose, Dublin. ‚ÄúI went in and told the make-up department. They were delighted,‚Äù he says. As I meet the journalist, presenter and historian (57) in a hotel lounge not far from Montrose, he‚Äôs limbering up to swap the Six One television news for Radio 1‚Äôs Today with David McCullagh ‚Äì and poised to publish his latest book, From Crown to Harp. Completed with the aid of a ‚Äúreally, really handy bout of insomnia‚Äù, the book covers the 28-year period in which the Anglo-Irish Treaty was undone, with McCullagh exploring three decades of fractious negotiations and much-contested shifts in symbolism. He cites an October 1921 cartoon in British satirical magazine Punch in which an Irish nationalist, asking if the inn he finds himself in is the Harp, is told it‚Äôs the Crown and Harp. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find it any less comfortable for that,‚Äù the innkeeper replies. ‚ÄúIt sort of encapsulates the British attitude of ‚Äòall we‚Äôre asking you, all we‚Äôre asking you, is to give us our symbol, and it will have no practical difference. And to an extent that was true, to an extent they were lying through their teeth.‚Äù Evolving expressions of identity from stamps, coins and passports to flags and anthems are covered, though especially fun to consider now are the diplomatic exchanges over recognition of the Irish president in official toasts. ‚ÄúIt seems kind of arcane and not worth bothering about, but if you feel you‚Äôre in a position of inferiority and you want to assert your independence, sovereignty and identity, it really is important, and you‚Äôre prepared to fight for it,‚Äù he says. One key theme is that few in Dublin were interested in using the Free State‚Äôs association with the Commonwealth to try to achieve unity ‚Äì the removal of partition just wasn‚Äôt a priority. ‚ÄúEvery time there was a choice between extending sovereignty or limiting it to make a connection with unionists, politicians of all parties down here went for sovereignty.‚Äù His catalyst was a ‚Äúlovely, thoughtful present‚Äù Miriam O‚ÄôCallaghan gave him when he left Prime Time in 2020: the Saorst√°t √âireann Official Handbook. He was fascinated by how various essayists in the 1932-published book downplayed constitutional links with Britain and ‚Äúput the best possible gloss‚Äù on the State‚Äôs international standing. Two years later, while in London covering Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs funeral, he was struck by how ‚Äúdeeply odd‚Äù certain elements seemed. ‚ÄúThe Lord Chamberlain was going to break his wand of office and place it on her coffin, and I thought, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs a bit Harry Potter, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äô It just got me thinking. The whole thing about the Crown was the cause of the Civil War, in effect, and yet it‚Äôs the kind of thing that we, at this stage, don‚Äôt really regard as being of any importance.‚Äù I was in Leinster House for 12 years ... you do become institutionalised The book only took three years ‚Äì ‚Äúpretty fast by my standards‚Äù ‚Äì as he was able to draw on research he had done for his biographies of √âamon de Valera and another former taoiseach, John A Costello. [ Dev ‚Äì Rise and Rule review: Chatty, well-made series fails to decode √âamon de ValeraOpens in new window ] Still, he found he had ‚Äúquite a bit to do‚Äù, from trawling through the UK‚Äôs National Archives in Kew to ‚Äújoining the dots in a slightly different way‚Äù, and he‚Äôd sold the project to his wife, Anne-Marie Smyth, on the basis that it would be straightforward. ‚ÄúShe was very enthusiastic about it, possibly because I lied to her about how long it would take.‚Äù Free State to Republic was his planned title, but Smyth ‚Äì who edits RT√â‚Äôs children‚Äôs news programme, news2day ‚Äì proposed From Crown to Harp. ‚ÄúYeah, she‚Äôs good at these things,‚Äù he says. He also obtained the required permission from RT√â management. Would this be a different book if he wasn‚Äôt an employee of RT√â? ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think so. Certainly, consciously, there was nothing where I thought ‚ÄòI better not say that‚Äô. Like, it‚Äôs sufficiently far in the past, I think, that it probably won‚Äôt come back to bite me. But then lots of people have thought that about lots of things. Ha!‚Äù Everything seems to be happening at once for McCullagh, with September seeing the broadcast of his two-part series on de Valera, Dev: Rise and Rule. In it he detailed how no trace has ever been found of Vivion de Valera, the man said to be his father. He worried that the coverage this sparked ‚Äúgave the impression that we were maybe being a bit tabloid about it‚Äù, but he was pleased overall by the reception, and the ratings were ‚Äúnot quite The Traitors, but not bad‚Äù. When I mention that my first introduction to Dev as a child in 1980s Dublin was the skipping rhyme that began ‚Äúvote, vote, vote for de Valera‚Äù, he says a friend told him similar, but only after he‚Äôd spent eight years writing his two-volume biography. ‚ÄúSo, useless!‚Äù he declares cheerily. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre useless as well!‚Äù The new book is dedicated to his parents, Robin and June, who are ‚Äústill hale and hearty, thankfully‚Äù and did a lot for him and his older brother when they were growing up in Dublin, on Newtownpark Avenue in Blackrock. After studying history and politics at UCD, his career began when he was hired by the Evening Press in 1989. A subsequent Master‚Äôs degree ‚Äúbecame a PhD, which became a book‚Äù ‚Äì A Makeshift Majority, about the 1948-1951 government ‚Äì and he discovered he enjoyed longer forms of writing than the ‚Äú12-14 paragraphs, tops‚Äù he had at the newspaper or, later, the 300 words he could squeeze into a typical TV report. He joined RT√â in September 1993 and after various gigs became political correspondent in 2001. ‚ÄúI was in Leinster House for 12 years. [It] sounds like a prison sentence, and you do become institutionalised.‚Äù [ RT√â‚Äôs new radio schedule a hurried defensive reflex to sour taste left by Ray D‚ÄôArcy exitOpens in new window ] Lots of late nights? ‚ÄúIt was mad, particularly because I was there during the whole bailout and everything. It was just the maddest time ever.‚Äù He recalls the chaotic January 2011 day when Fianna F√°il TDs openly conspired outside the D√°il chamber to oust then taoiseach Brian Cowen. ‚ÄúNormally they do their plotting and back-stabbing in private, but they were doing it completely in the open. Wild. Absolutely wild.‚Äù Plunging into history ‚Äì which he self-deprecatingly calls his ‚Äúschtick‚Äù ‚Äì helps him unwind from the intensity of unfolding political drama, and it has underlined for him, too, how so much of politics is about personal relationships. I ask what he thought about Leo Varadkar‚Äôs memoir, but he hasn‚Äôt read it yet ‚Äì it‚Äôs on his list. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm banned from purchasing books for myself from September to Christmas, because my birthday is in December, and apparently I‚Äôm very difficult to buy for,‚Äù he says, with a gentle strain of mock indignation. Varadkar has said it was McCullagh‚Äôs advice that inspired him to release it. Mcullagh confirms: ‚ÄúI told him that if you don‚Äôt write your version of history, people in the future will rely on some other fella‚Äôs version of history, and it might not be to your benefit.‚Äù Perhaps his own book might be a good Christmas gift option for the tough-to-buy-for demographic? ‚ÄúOh, absolutely,‚Äù he says quickly. ‚ÄúEvery home should have at least one copy, if not two.‚Äù He was ready to move on from Leinster House when Pat Kenny‚Äôs surprise departure for Newstalk triggered that station‚Äôs ‚Äúmove the dial‚Äù campaign and left a vacancy on Prime Time. His seven years on the current affairs flagship were ‚Äúgood times, happy times‚Äù. Presenting the Six One ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt something that I particularly envisaged for myself‚Äù, but he has enjoyed that too. The big switch to Today has been instigated by another defection to Newstalk, this time Claire Byrne‚Äôs. McCullagh is one of those broadcasting heavyweights who wears his intellect lightly, and his reporting experience, depth of insight and tonal flexibility should combine to make him a strong and entertaining successor. But the job, which pays a salary of ‚Ç¨209,000, also comes with pressure to maintain the show‚Äôs listenership amid direct competition from ‚Äúclass act‚Äù Byrne. Will his Today be different from Byrne‚Äôs Today? ‚ÄúI guess if you change presenter, it‚Äôs inevitably going to have some differences, but I mean it‚Äôs a very successful programme and people like it.‚Äù True, Today‚Äôs buoyant listener figures throughout the Kenny, Sean O‚ÄôRourke and Byrne eras imply that the midmorning show‚Äôs format and slot ‚Äì rescheduled after we meet to start one hour earlier ‚Äì are more important than the presenter. ‚ÄúSo they can put any eejit in and it won‚Äôt matter. I see what you‚Äôre saying there, Laura!‚Äù Well, he doesn‚Äôt want to be the one to break that streak, does he? ‚ÄúNo, no, indeed,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut, you know, the dial moves both ways.‚Äù Unfortunately, my face betrays me sometimes He will finish on the Six One on Halloween night, then start on Today soon after. He will also stop co-hosting RT√â‚Äôs Behind the Story podcast ‚Äì ‚ÄúI think 10 hours of me on air a week is probably enough‚Äù ‚Äì but he credits it with getting him out of his comfort zone and showing people he isn‚Äôt always completely serious. His eyebrows go into immediate overdrive after I note that viewers often respond to his facial expressions. There can be some side-eye, too, I suggest, referencing one screengrab, captured during an election debate in 2020, that became a meme. ‚ÄúThat was weird, it‚Äôs become a bit of a thing, but I wasn‚Äôt aware the camera was on me. I was actually trying to communicate with the editor in the gallery.‚Äù The eyebrow gymnastics, and everything else, are all ‚Äúcompletely unconscious‚Äù, he says. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, my face betrays me sometimes.‚Äù Surely, in these days of visual radio, he will still be on screen? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll all be on webcam, and apparently you‚Äôll be able to see me on the RT√â News channel, unless something better is on.‚Äù He reminisces about how the addition of cameras meant he had to be ‚Äúcareful with the hand signals‚Äù when he returned to Radio 1‚Äôs This Week in 2018. ‚ÄúIt nearly got me in trouble a couple of times,‚Äù he says. What kind of hand signals? ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not go there!‚Äù When he‚Äôs not working or writing, he swims, reads ‚Äúquite a lot‚Äù and watches TV with his wife ‚Äì the couple live in Stillorgan, while their daughter, Rosie (24), is studying in London. He goes to Leinster rugby matches and gigs when he can, one artist being especially close to his heart ‚Äì in 2022, he said he‚Äôd been to see Bruce Springsteen 33 times. ‚ÄúAh, that was then,‚Äù he says. The updated tally is 41. The last two times he brought Rosie, and she loved it. ‚ÄúThat was just fantastic, because I think I probably overdid playing the Springsteen songs for her when she was growing up, and she wasn‚Äôt really into it then.‚Äù Sending From Crown to Harp to the printers was ‚Äúa great relief‚Äù, he says, and he‚Äôs excited now about his Today adventure. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a challenge, and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs plenty of people out there in the long grass hoping I‚Äôll fall flat on my face.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know who they would be, I say. Has he got a bitter rival at RT√â? ‚ÄúOh god, no. It‚Äôs all sweetness and light in RT√â.‚Äù From Crown to Harp by David McCullagh is published by Gill.

Title: Stephen Donnelly swoops to the rescue of UK healthcare citing his triumphs in Ireland

Unemployment has sent good hardworking Irish people on the boat to seek their fortune in Britain for centuries now, and it‚Äôs no different for former minister for health Stephen Donnelly, who will be rolling up his sleeves with CF, a healthcare management consultant. Quite how the UK, home of the world‚Äôs first modern universal free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare system, wound up requiring expertise from Ireland, home of it costing ‚Ç¨60 to have a doctor tell you to keep an eye on it, is a contemplation for another day. CF spared no fireworks in their announcement of the former Fianna F√°il brainiac who was punted unceremoniously to touch by the people of Wicklow last year. Unappreciated by the hill tribes of Delgany and Roundwood, he ‚Äúdesigned and led the most comprehensive programme of investment and reform in Ireland‚Äôs public health services in decades‚Äù, said the announcement. ‚ÄúStephen brings something truly unique to our UK transformation work ‚Äì direct experience designing and implementing the exact type of comprehensive national health system reform that the UK government is now prioritising,‚Äù said Hannah Farrar, chief executive of CF. He‚Äôll help the company be consulted in the UK, where the cracks in society are growing wider and ministers can offer only words like ‚Äúwe will harness AI‚Äù to fill them. He will also work on expanding the business across Europe and the Middle East, where reforms are also in the offing. ‚ÄúSome years ago I left healthcare consulting in the UK to enter parliament in Ireland,‚Äù said Donnelly in his announcement on LinkedIn, somewhat minimising his 13 years in the D√°il including a spell as founder/ co-leader of the Social Democrats and five years as minister for health. ‚ÄúWhile there is still much to be done, crucial improvements were achieved,‚Äù he said, slipping comfortably back into the metrical worldview of the business-wonk, listing his achievements as follows: ‚Äúa 60 per cent reduction in long waiters; a 50 per cent reduction in outpatient and 30 per cent reduction in surgical waiting times; a shift of care from hospitals to the community; an end to falling productivity; vital new patient services including a transformation of women‚Äôs health services; a new eHealth plan; a step change in public health and preventative care; rebalancing the regional deployment of health assets.‚Äù Sounds like a record of delivery that could be of interest to the Health Service Executive (HSE), which is already regularly spending more than ‚Ç¨100 million a year on external consultants, many of whom have never even been minister for health. The youth of Ireland can rest easy: they have an ally in Frank McDonald, former Irish Times environment editor and author of several books about Dublin‚Äôs transformation into a kip. The renowned critic joined Labour, Green and Independent councillors in a judicial review of the Government‚Äôs planned changes to apartment standards, characterised by the group as a ‚Äúdeveloper-led race to the bottom‚Äù. He filed an affidavit outlining his bona fides (various books, various honours), his shock at the manner of the plans being introduced (‚ÄúI was aghast‚Äù) and his proposed remedy (quash the plans, do an environmental assessment). McDonald, the inadequately housed will be happy to hear, recently ‚Äúmoved out to Blackrock‚Äù where he lives in a ‚Äúspacious new apartment on the top floor of a three-storey block‚Äù. It boasts ‚Äúviews south towards Three Rock Mountain‚Äù, he told the High Court, calling up what a High Court judge might consider a familiar and aesthetically appealing vista. ‚ÄúI could spend my time reading novels and drinking champagne on our planted terrace,‚Äù he went on, no doubt sparking serious interest from judges at this stage. [ Is Ireland ready for drab Soviet-style apartment blocks?Opens in new window ] But no ‚Äì he has chosen to fight for the younger generation, whose ‚Äúplight will be aggravated by the dystopian future set out for them by the new apartment design standards referred to above, which effectively guarantee that they will have no option but to pay dearly for Lilliputian living spaces in glorified 21st-century tenements‚Äù. So, like Bruce Wayne before him, he has set the champagne aside and joined the fight. The Government, extremely annoyed by all this, says it plans to fight back ‚Äúrobustly‚Äù. The youth could use such a champion when it comes to ‚Äúdeemed disposal‚Äù, Brian Cowen‚Äôs tax on unrealised investment gains that is felt as a deep injustice by the type of person who has unrealised investment gains. Gen Z worldwide is interested in stocks and shares, having come of financial age during a long period where the lines have been heading in the right direction and their capital, while at risk, goes up rather than down. Irish dabblers might start out following US advice, before encountering decidedly un-free market taxes taking a bite out of their profits. Last week, in the hotbed of radical political thought that is ‚Äúr/irishpersonalfinance‚Äù, the savings-and-investments subforum of social media network Irish Reddit, a user popped up with a plan: a national walkout to end deemed disposal. [ How Gen Z is taking a different approach to money - and what others can learn from itOpens in new window ] ‚ÄúThis Monday, at 2pm, we walk out of our schools, colleges and places of work,‚Äù the user wrote, in a hint at his youth, ‚Äúdemanding change‚Äù. ‚ÄúFor too long, the ruling coalition has ruled by diktat, without the slightest thought toward the preferences of the electorate,‚Äù quoth the rabble-rouser with a touch of (James) Connolly to his rhetoric. ‚ÄúA people shouldn‚Äôt acquiesce to their government, the government should follow the will of the people.‚Äù Monday, October 13th, came and went, and despite the poster‚Äôs claim that he had the support of ‚Äúthe rest of my placement cohort at the Big Four consulting company I work at‚Äù, Bastilles went unstormed and the fetters on free enterprise remained in place. One to keep an eye on though. If this keeps up, the Progressive Democrats might spontaneously reappear. ¬© 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: $536M In Sell Pressure: Why Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Crashed

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The cryptocurrency market has been hit with another wave of sell pressure as both the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices plunged sharply, triggering widespread panic and uncertainty. With over $536 million in Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows in a single day, the downturn has sparked renewed fears of an extended bearish phase. Analysts are calling this correction a ‚ÄúBloody Friday,‚Äù a less but still severe reflection of last week‚Äôs brutal selloff that wiped billions in the market and saw BTC and ETH spiraling downwards. The recent crash in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices is being attributed to recent large-scale outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Crypto analyst Jana on X social media described the event as one of the bloodiest weekly downturns of the quarter, with Bitcoin tumbling 13.3% in seven days and Ethereum sliding 17.8% over the past month. At press time, Bitcoin is trading slightly above $106,940 while Ethereum sits around $3,870, both suffering steep retracements from their recent highs. Data from SoSoValue shows that Thursday, October 16, saw a staggering $536.4 million in daily net outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking the largest single-day negative flow since August 1, when $812 million exited the market. Out of twelve US Bitcoin ETFs, eight registered major outflows, led by $275.15 million leaving Ark & 21Shares‚Äô ARKB, followed by $132 million from Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC. Notably, funds managed by other major companies like Grayscale, BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and Valkyrie also reported significant withdrawals. These persistent outflows have now stretched into their third consecutive day, with October 17, just a day ago, recording a massive outflow of $366.5 million. The sustained negative ETF flows underscore waning investor confidence and suggest that the broader market downturn could continue in the near term. Combined with the $19 billion liquidation event last Friday, increased outflows in ETFs could put more selling pressure on the already fragile market. Many experts believe that the crypto market may still have more room for a decline. Data from Polymarket, one of the world‚Äôs largest prediction platforms, show that 52% of participants expect Bitcoin to drop below $100,000 before the end of October. Veteran economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has also warned that the coming months could be catastrophic for the industry, predicting widespread bankruptcies, defaults, and layoffs as Bitcoin and Ethereum face another major leg down. Meanwhile, technical analysts are pointing to signs of deeper weakness in Ethereum‚Äôs structure. According to Crypto Damus, Ethereum has broken key weekly support and is displaying a bearish setup on the charts. He says that MACD is about to ‚Äúcross red,‚Äù leaving a significant amount of room for a crash. Other analysts like Marzell have echoed similar concerns, stating that Ethereum is now nearing a ‚Äúcrash zone.‚Äù However, he also highlighted the $3,690 ‚Äì $3,750 range as a possible short-term demand area where buyers could step in again and trigger the next leg up.

Title: Bitcoin Languishes Under $110K As Spot BTC ETFs Shed $536 Million In Biggest Single-Day Outflow Since Early August

U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hemorrhaged money Thursday, snapping a two-week streak of consistent inflows as participants continue to tread carefully in the wake of Friday‚Äôs historic flash crash. The 11 funds recorded $536.4 million in net outflows, marking the sharpest single-day capital flight since August 1. Ark $ 21Shares‚Äô ARKB suffered the largest outflow with $275.15 million exiting, while Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC posted $132 million in withdrawals, and Grayscale‚Äôs converted GBTC product witnessed $45 million flee, according to SoSoValue data. Spot ETFs managed by BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and Valkyrie also saw capital exodus. Spot Ethereum ETFs also registered $56.8 million in net outflows on Thursday, ending the positive inflow streak witnessed in the previous two trading days. Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE suffered the largest single-day outflow with $69 million exiting on Oct. 16, while Bitwise‚Äôs ETHW saw $15.8 million flee. The dwindling demand comes as markets continue to nurse losses after President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that he would impose 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports, responding to Beijing‚Äôs threat to cut off exports of rare earth minerals, which are vital to U.S. technology manufacturing. The surprise announcement sparked the biggest liquidation event on record, with $19 billion in leveraged positions wiped out within 24 hours. While Bitcoin recovered to around $115,000 earlier this week after Trump seemingly tried to de-escalate the tariff war, tensions continue. Crypto prices extended their corrections today, with BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, plummeting to as low as $103,856 in the past day. Meanwhile, Ethereum blockchain‚Äôs native token, Ether, fell 1.9% to $3,829 alongside bigger losses in the altcoin market, according to CoinGecko data.

One important source to distil their India plans is from their quarterly earnings calls. With the September earnings season having just begun, starting this week we will bring to you what CXOs of global corporations are saying about India and their perspectives and plans in this column. Here are some from companies that reported their earnings so far. BlackRock Inc (BLK, $182.3 billion) The world‚Äôs largest asset manager said its JioBlackRock venture marks a key step in expanding access to local investing and retirement products in India. ‚ÄúThe Indian market remains largely untapped and is today a country of savers rather than investors. Through JioBlackRock, we‚Äôre enabling individuals to more easily invest in their local economies and financial assets.‚Äù Brown-Forman Corp (BFB, $13.4 billion) The American spirits-maker sees India as a major long-term growth engine for its flagship Jack Daniel‚Äôs brand, driven by premiumisation and rising social acceptance of alcohol. ‚ÄúSince Covid, there‚Äôs been a rising social acceptance of beverage alcohol in India, particularly among younger consumers. India is the second-largest whiskey market in the world, growing around 8 per cent annually ‚Äî a perfect storm for Jack Daniel‚Äôs growth.‚Äù Firan Technology Group (FTG, C$254.8 billion) The Canadian aerospace and defence electronics firm is setting up a new manufacturing facility in Hyderabad to tap India‚Äôs cost advantages and policy support. ‚ÄúWe concluded India is a very cost-effective place for manufacturing, with Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs Make in India policy and strong aerospace spending making it an ideal place to operate.‚Äù Pernod Ricard SA (RI, ‚Ç¨21.9 billion) The French spirits major reported steady growth in India despite a sharp excise tax hike in Maharashtra that weighed on demand. ‚ÄúWhile India continues to enjoy strong consumer demand, the 50 per cent increase in excise tax in Maharashtra led to higher prices and a consequential impact on sales, partly offset by strong growth in Royal Stag and international brands like Jameson.‚Äù Published on October 18, 2025 Copyright¬© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Apple is still the best brand in the world, according to Interbrand's report

The Best Global Brands shows which brands are going up, and which are going down... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works. Interbrand has released its annual Best Global Brands ranking and there's very little movement at the top. The top five are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Samsung in that order, showing that Apple is still... well.... the Apple of many eyes. Other notable brands that rose up through the ranks include Nvidia, Instagram, YouTube, Uber and Netflix. Nvidia had a particularly huge increase (116 per cent), the biggest in the history of the Best Global Brands. There is also the highest number of new entries of any Best Global Brands report, with Uniqlo, Booking.com, Shopify and Blackrock among the newcomers. The reports methodology includes looking at financial analysis, the role of the brand (the portion of the purchase decision attributable to the brand as opposed to other factors) and brand strength, which takes into account brand loyalty. And it's no surprise to us that some of these top brands are also in our best logos list. In the automotive sector, Toyota held on to its number 6 position while Mercedes and BMW also made the top 20 (10 and 14, respectively). In success stories, Ferrari has seen 17 per cent growth (in at 54) while on the flipside, Tesla declined 35 per cent to number 25. Jaguar was nowhere to be seen and hasn't ranked on its own since 2018. I imagine its recent rebrand probably hasn't helped matters. In terms of media and entertainment brands, it was Instagram that stood out as it surged 27 per cent and entered the top 10 for the first time (at number eight). YouTube also saw huge growth, with an increase of 61 per cent to spot number 13 (explore the brand's history with our YouTube logo history). Elsewhere, Netflix surged 42 per cent, and climbed 10 places to number 28. When you think about brands that people use every day for entertainment, neither of these three are a shock. I'm frankly surprised that Netflix wasn't ranked higher. In the world of luxury, Gucci dropped out of the top 50 altogether (to number 69) while Herm√©s grew 18 per cent (and made it to spot 21) and Chanel managed to cling on to the top 25 at number 24 despite shrinking 8 per cent. Interbrand suggests this may be due to prices post-Covid, which have discouraged some "aspiring middle-class consumers, creating a headwind for the sector". In the world of retail, it was bad news for IKEA and H&M which shrank 9 and 13 per cent, respectively, but good news for Uniqlo, which stormed into the charts at number 47. It must be all those cross-body bags it sold. Interbrand also outlines its Brands to Watch, which shines a light on brands predicted to enter the top 100 in future years. These include Burberry, Canon, KFC, PlayStation, WhatsApp, Zoom and Starbucks. It feels quite amazing that some of those brands aren't on the list already, but I guess there isn't room for everyone.

Investors are plowing money into a broad swath of assets putting the ETF industry in the driver‚Äôs seat of what may be another record year. BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, overseeing $10 trillion, took a victory lap this week, touting ownership of some of the fastest-growing exchange-traded funds in history. "Our digital assets ETPs and active ETFs have grown from practically zero to 10 in 2023 to over $100 billion in digital assets and over $80 billion in active ETFs. The rapid growth of these premium categories is another proof point of our success in scaling distribution and quickly adapting to new offerings and in new markets," said CEO Larry Fink on the company‚Äôs earnings call this week.

Assets topped $100 billion earlier this month but have dipped with Bitcoin‚Äôs drop. The largest crypto by market value hit a record $126,272.76 on Oct. 6, 2025, and has since slipped below $110,000. BITCOIN SAFE HAVEN, INVESTOR SAYS Escalating tensions over the past week between the U.S. and China are hurting sentiment for digital assets. This as gold popped to a fresh record high of $4,280.20 an ounce. Another standout, iShares Ethereum ETF -ticker ETHA with assets around $16 billion. AMERICANS FAVOR TRUMP'S $1,000 BABY SAVINGS PLAN "Our flagship offerings in IBIT and ETHA were among the top five inflowing products in the ETP industry," Martin Small, CFO and global head of corporate strategy detailed on the call. Like bitcoin, ethereum has dipped to the $3,800 level from its high of $4,955.23 reached on Aug. 24, 2025. LIVE CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICES: HERE Still, bitcoin and ethereum have each advanced about 14% this year, slightly outperforming the S&P 500‚Äôs 13% rise as of Friday.

Pressure is among the few certainties of daily life on Wall Street ‚Äî and knowing how to manage it is key to success. Business Insider asked its 2025 Rising Stars of Wall Street how they set boundaries and maintain routines to stay grounded in an industry where the threat of burnout lurks behind each promotion. All of them are standing out at some of the country's top financial firms at age 35 or younger, and somehow maintaining personal lives and sanity in the process. Since Wall Street has little respect for the evening hours, mornings are precious to many of this year's rising stars, particularly when it comes to exercise. From focusing on family, to cooking, to purposefully feeling bored for a few minutes, here are some of the ways finance's young leaders find ‚Äî and keep ‚Äî balance. True to the gym-obsessed stereotype, many of the Wall Streeters said exercising is key to staying grounded, especially in the hours before work. Sweating it out at the gym helps relieve the stress they'll likely face during the day, some told Business Insider. As Lamar Cardinez, a principal at Blue Owl, put it, the gym "helps me feel fully awake quickly and supplies you with the energy needed for a full workday." "I'm a morning person, and I will be the person, unfortunately, who will sacrifice sleep so that I can exercise," Catherine Kress, chief of staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and a big runner, said. For others, playing sports or spending time outside provides the much-needed physical relief. The up-and-comers opt for everything from golf to tennis to snowboarding to yoga to skiing. And though their interests are diverse, Alex Park, a principal at Thoma Bravo, admitted his typical finance bro tendencies when it comes to health habits. "I'm sure you've heard too many people in finance, especially in Miami, talk about padel," he said, referencing the racquet sport popular with America's wealthy. "But I do very much enjoy that sport as well." Another interest that helps him stay grounded? Wellness and longevity science, which he was sure Business Insider had heard "a fair amount." Colleagues might dominate many of the waking hours during the week, but some of the Wall Streeters told Business Insider that prioritizing family is crucial to excelling in their field. For Mohini Chakravorty, a principal at Blackstone, it's knowing that her family pick up the phone "at any point in time." For GTCR's Natalie Lamberton, it's talking after-work walks with her 6-month-old daughter and decompressing her week with her husband every Friday night. Among those who are parents, some said seeing their kids before and after work gives them the perspective they need to walk into the office and inevitable pressure. "I have my wife and my one and a half year old son, and that's my code of comfort," Aman Mittal, a managing director at Moelis & Company, said. "She and my son give me a lot of anchoring so as to make sure that you can do what you need to do once you're out of the house." Joe Slevin, a managing director in Jefferies' Private Capital Advisory group, often unwinds with his wife and three kids, but finds his friends are a necessary lifeline too. "I would say that a few active text threads with old funny friends is essential." Chakravorty is a "huge foodie," and loves to explore the New York City restaurant scene. The same goes for Benson Kane, a vice president at TPG who said he often explores new spots in the city with his wife. Lamberton said she enjoys cooking with her husband, and Chakravorty said she often cooks with her boyfriend as well. A number of the stars treat logging off as more than shutting their computer, and carve out intentional time to get away from their screens. Blackstone's Knut Kirchoff figured out how important it is to spend at least 30 minutes with a book and away from the glow of his phone during the pandemic, and he still keeps up the habit to help him wind down. Cardinez meditates, Lamberton makes time on her commute to purposefully feel bored, and Jake Woodson, the head of US distressed credit trading at Goldman Sachs, spends time in the Catskills. "When it feels like all that matters in the world is XYZ bond all week, getting into the world and getting into nature and experiencing something different is invaluable and gives you motivation to come back to do it," he said. Beyond reading a physical newspaper in the morning with his coffee, Kirchoff tries to bring some analog habits to the office. He tracks his daily tasks in a paper notebook, crossing them off as they're completed. Your daily guide to what's moving markets ‚Äî straight to your inbox.

Title: Ford CEO Admits Automakers Didn‚Äôt Consider Their Customers When Going ‚ÄòFull Bore‚Äô Into EVs

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/18/2025 4:10:31 AM PDT by Adder American automakers have long prided themselves on building vehicles that meet the real needs of hardworking families and businesses across the country. Yet, recent revelations from Ford‚Äôs leadership paint a different picture when it comes to the rush into electric vehicles. Former Ford CEO Mark Fields openly acknowledged that the industry charged ahead with massive EV investments, overlooking what consumers actually wanted. Fields, who led Ford from 2014 to 2017, pointed out the misstep during a discussion on the rapid buildup of EV production. ‚ÄúOver the last couple of years, the automakers really went full bore in putting in capacity for EVs,‚Äù he said. This aggressive push came without enough thought to buyer preferences, leaving companies like Ford and GM facing unexpected market realities. (Excerpt) Read more at thelibertydaily.com ...

It was pretty much a foregone conclusion. i am looking forward to getting an f150 EV for pennies on the dollar. Doofi they have been. Ford deleted all of their IC engined vehicle engineering staff some years ago. Stupid, stupid, stupid. They ran full on to fascism. All these companies just love government mandates for the means of production. They were drooling at the thought of people being forced to buy their crap. And their major shareholders like Blackrock and Vanguard were all in. Mark never asked. Derp. Ya think? Yes, there‚Äôs a market for Leftist Gaia Worshiping virtue signalers in Commiefornia and a few other places....the kind of people who live in cities and don‚Äôt have to drive very far and who live in areas where there are plenty of charging stations. That does not describe most of the country. Your market was always going to be severely limited. You were idiots to think the demand was going to be there for really mass production. Anybody with a lick of sense outside of your echo chamber could have told you that. I am not so sure that it is a question of ‚Äústupid‚Äù, as much as a response to government. Insane fuel efficiency standards and insane amounts of money thrown at EV production give a different result. I could wish that American auto manufacturers were fighting the ‚ÄúClimate Change‚Äù fakers in science and at the EPA, but they‚Äôre not. Perhaps government‚Äôs EV incentives are the reason why. The 5 litre modular V8 was a great engine. I have one 20 years old and it is still running like new.

Or Bud Light. Or..... They were counting on government EV mandates, subsidies and loan guarantees to continue in perpetuity. It‚Äôs that simple. Yes. And they still are. Well, to be fair, EV were forced on automakers by the government. They still are, in some states.

Title: Ethereum: Assessing how ETH could outperform Bitcoin in Q4

Time Published: 2025-10-18T11:00:02Z

BlackRock and institutional moves put Ethereum in focus. Ethereum is holding a net gain of 7.02% versus BTC‚Äôs 4.34% for October, with on-chain stablecoin inflows signaling institutional interest. BlackRock‚Äôs recent moves, combined with the ETH/BTC ratio nearing 0.04, suggest strategic rotation rather than a short-term trade. So far in Q4, Ethereum [ETH] has lagged behind Bitcoin [BTC], showing a 6.94% dip. But if we look closely, BTC is only 1.15% ahead, despite its nearly 11% rally in the first week that pushed it to an all-time high of $125k. From a technical perspective, BTC‚Äôs net gain for October stood at 4.34%, at press time, while ETH remained at a net gain of 7.02% following its 15% first-week surge. In short, ETH is still holding strong relative to BTC. Notably, this resilience is evident on the weekly chart. BTC has dropped 7.15% with two back-to-back lower-low candles, testing its late-June support at $103k. ETH, on the other hand, is holding onto its August gains. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) Against this backdrop, the ETH/BTC ratio is on the verge of snapping its first weekly green, bouncing nearly 9% off the recent crash to 0.03, reinforcing the thesis that rotation into ETH could be gaining momentum. On-chain, Ethereum‚Äôs stablecoin supply is signaling the same strength. The 7-day stablecoin supply on Ethereum has jumped 2.18%, adding $3.47 billion and pushing the total to a fresh all-time high of $163 billion. Simply put, more dry powder is flowing into the ecosystem. Combine this with Ethereum‚Äôs resilience versus BTC, and it raises the question: Is rotation into ETH shaping up to be more strategic than a short-term trade? BlackRock is driving the rotation thesis in action. Arkham data shows the firm moving 300 BTC across its last fifteen transactions, accounting for roughly 4,500 BTC offloaded. At the same time, it accumulated 12,400 ETH from Coinbase Prime. The effects are visible on the chart: Ethereum was up 1.12% intraday, holding the $3,830 support despite ongoing weakness in ETH ETFs, while the ETH/BTC ratio hiked 1.56%, at the time of writing, inching closer to key resistance at 0.37. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) In this setup, the surge in stablecoin liquidity isn‚Äôt random. Instead, it points to ‚Äútargeted‚Äù capital flowing into Ethereum, suggesting that institutions are rotating for a longer-term rather than chasing short-term trades, with October‚Äôs price action so far reinforcing this strategy. Against this backdrop, the ETH/BTC ratio is eyeing the 0.04 zone, signaling a potential breakout in favor of Ethereum versus Bitcoin, suggesting that ETH‚Äôs monthly lag may be nothing more than a short-term blip.

Tributes have been paid to a Dublin man who was killed following a road traffic incident in the US. John Kirby died in hospital on Wednesday, following an incident involving a truck which happened in Austin, Texas, on Friday 10 of October. Mr Kirby, who was in his 20s, had been in the US on a J1 visa and was living with two friends. Blackrock Rugby Football Club has paid tribute to him, saying he "made a huge impact both on and off the field". In a post on the club's website, Director of Rugby Michael Hearty said that Mr Kirby will be remembered "fondly for his smile, his laughter, and his spirit". "John had that special kind of presence. A big, infectious smile and a quick sense of humour that could lift the whole dressing room. "Whether it was during training on a horrible wet Tuesday night or over a pint in the clubhouse, he had a way of making people laugh and feel included. "He was the sort of teammate you were always happy to see walk through the door." Mr Hearty also described John as a great worker, adding that "the word 'no' was not in his vocabulary". He extended his condolences to all of his friends and family. The Department of Foreign Affairs said it is aware of the case and is providing consular assistance. ¬© RT√â 2025.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs see $1.2 Billion in weekly outflows
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/us-bitcoin-etfs-see-1-2-billion-in-weekly-outflows/
Time Published: 2025-10-18T10:27:46Z

The United States‚Äô spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) faced a challenging week, with over $1.2 billion in total outflows as Bitcoin prices tumbled. Despite the decline in institutional inflows, Charles Schwab says investor engagement with crypto-related products is rising, reflecting a growing interest among retail and institutional clients in digital assets. Data from SoSoValue shows that the eleven US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively recorded $366.6 million in outflows on Friday, closing out a negative week for both the products and the broader cryptocurrency market. The largest withdrawal came from BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which lost $268.6 million in a single day. Fidelity‚Äôs Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also saw substantial redemptions totaling $67.2 million, while Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC experienced $25 million in outflows. A smaller withdrawal was reported from the Valkyrie Bitcoin ETF, while the remaining funds saw no activity on Friday. In total, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US witnessed $1.22 billion in outflows over the past week, with only one day‚ÄîTuesday‚Äîshowing minor inflows. The downturn coincided with sharp declines in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, which fell from above $115,000 on Monday to just below $104,000 on Friday, marking a four-month low. The steep decline highlights how sensitive institutional products remain to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements, with ETF investors appearing to pull back amid growing market uncertainty. While ETF redemptions signal cooling sentiment among some investors, Charles Schwab remains optimistic about the long-term potential of digital asset investment products. Speaking on CNBC, CEO Rick Wurster revealed that Schwab‚Äôs clients now hold 20% of all crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the US. He added that interest in crypto has grown substantially over the past year, with visits to the company‚Äôs crypto-related webpages up 90%. ‚ÄúCrypto ETPs have been very active,‚Äù Wurster said, emphasizing that the topic continues to draw high engagement from investors. ETF analyst Nate Geraci noted that Schwab‚Äôs large brokerage platform positions it well to capture future demand. The firm already offers crypto ETFs and Bitcoin futures and plans to launch spot crypto trading for clients in 2026, signaling a long-term commitment to the sector even amid short-term volatility. October, historically one of Bitcoin‚Äôs strongest months, has so far delivered disappointing results. Data from CoinGlass shows that Bitcoin has gained in ten of the past twelve Octobers, but this year, the asset is down 6% month-to-date. Despite the slump, some market analysts remain hopeful that the trend of ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù could return in the second half of the month. Many point to the potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year as a catalyst that could reignite demand for risk assets, including Bitcoin. For now, however, the combination of ETF outflows, price pressure, and macroeconomic uncertainty has weighed heavily on crypto sentiment‚Äîleaving investors to watch whether the coming weeks can reverse October‚Äôs red start.

Title: Analysts Caution Cardano (ADA) May Drop Further Before $1 Rebound After 12% Dip

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Cardano (ADA) fell roughly 27% this week, slipping below the $0.66 support as risk-off flows hit crypto. Bitcoin‚Äôs slide toward $104,000 and softer altcoin liquidity magnified downside, and on-chain data shows large holders leaning defensive. Santiment-tracked wallets holding 1‚Äì10 million ADA offloaded about 40 million ADA over seven days, while broader whale distribution reportedly reached 350 million ADA, pressuring price. other big wallets accumulated 140‚Äì200 million ADA, creating a split tape that‚Äôs fueling choppy consolidation between $0.65‚Äì$0.70. Derivatives add to the cautious tone. Cardano‚Äôs open interest slipped 2.12% to $669.9 million, and long liquidations ($1.13 million) dwarfed shorts ($187,000), signaling bulls bore the brunt of the latest flush. On the 4-hour chart, ADA is carving a falling wedge, but confirmation requires a breakout above $0.74. Until then, momentum indicators remain mixed: RSI 37 (approaching oversold) while CMF 0.12‚Äì0.15 hints at returning spot inflows that have yet to overpower supply from large holders. Technicians flag a ‚Äúrisk-first‚Äù path: losing $0.66 puts $0.65 in play; failure there opens $0.62‚Äì$0.60, then $0.57 (channel/structure confluence). A deeper shakeout could probe $0.53 if broader crypto weakness persists. On the upside, ADA must reclaim $0.66 and then clear $0.74‚Äì$0.80 (50-day EMA cluster) to flip trend strength. Above that range, bulls target $0.86, with a psychological $1.00 retest feasible into Q4 if risk appetite and flows improve. Several analysts still eye a path toward $1.20‚Äì$1.60 on a confirmed breakout, but most caution the market may dip before it rips given leverage resets and uneven liquidity. ETF headlines (including the Oct. 23 Grayscale ADA ETF decision window), stablecoin and ETF net flows, and whether whale selling cools. A rotation back into altcoins typically follows BTC stabilization; conversely, renewed BTC downside would likely extend ADA‚Äôs consolidation near the lows. Beyond price, Cardano‚Äôs community treasury has surpassed 1.6 billion ADA ($1 billion), funded by fees and staking rewards and governed via Project Catalyst, a war chest that supports tooling, DeFi, and infrastructure without VC overhang. New staking access (e.g., eToro U.S.) and ongoing initiatives like Midnight and Leios continue to broaden the roadmap, even as TVL ($288 million) lags larger chains.

Title: Should every midlife woman be on HRT - even with no menopause symptoms?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/10/18/hrt-theres-no-need-for-suffering-any-more-like-our-mothers-and-grandmothers-did/
Time Published: 2025-10-18T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Suzanne Noonan, a mother of three children, struggled for months with debilitating anxiety, hot flushes and poor sleep but was afraid to look for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as there is a history of breast cancer in her family. A friend, a beautician who had heard clients say HRT had changed their lives for the better, urged her to try it. By the time Noonan (45) went to her GP in Co Limerick a year ago, ‚Äúmy adrenaline was through the roof‚Äù. The doctor reassured her about the breast cancer risks and strongly recommended HRT, as the pros outweighed the cons. ‚ÄúSo I bit the bullet.‚Äù Within two weeks, ‚ÄúI was so mellow and just felt right again in the world.‚Äù Now she recommends that any woman troubled by menopausal-related symptoms should go to their GP and ‚Äútake the leap to HRT ‚Äì you will not regret it‚Äù. The message that women need not suffer in silence during perimenopause and menopause is spreading. With increasing evidence of other health benefits from the repletion of waning hormones, even those without troubling menopausal symptoms may wonder if they are missing out by not going on HRT. It doesn‚Äôt even cost anything, since the State has made the medication free since June 1st. Could that prove to be another psychological nudge? This week there was news of a study, led by the University of Galway, that indicated a link between HRT after menopause and a lower risk of dementia. Last week, eminent consultant endocrinologist Dr Donal O‚ÄôShea talked of ‚Äúmedical consensus‚Äù that all women should go on it at the time of menopause, unless there are strong contraindications. ‚ÄúOestrogen replacement is good for bones, it‚Äôs good for heart, it‚Äôs good for brain,‚Äù O‚ÄôShea told Jen Hogan on The Irish Times podcast Conversations with Parents. He said he would be advising his daughters, ‚Äúif I‚Äôm around when they‚Äôre post menopausal‚Äù, to go on it. While many agreed and welcomed his comments, others had a different view. ‚ÄúI think Donal should stay in his lane,‚Äù says Dr Deirdre Lundy, clinical lead of the complex menopause clinic in the National Maternity Hospital (NMH). While she says he is entitled to express his opinion, ‚Äúthat most certainly is not the medical consensus‚Äù. The ‚Äúactual consensus‚Äù, based on international guidelines, according to Lundy, is that there are only two reasons to go on HRT. ‚ÄúOne is for symptom control, and in that case there is no protocol for how long to take it or when to stop it. If your symptoms continue to trouble you and you want to stay on it for 20 or 30 years, which, by the way, I‚Äôve done myself, so I‚Äôm not an anti-HRT person, then you go right ahead.‚Äù The second indication for treatment is bone density. ‚ÄúA primary use of HRT, even for people with no symptoms, would be low bone quality.‚Äù In addition to proven benefits for the heart and bones, it is believed there are other positives ‚Äúbut the data is not there yet. That is why the consensus is not to put everybody on HRT and not to stay on it forever‚Äù. [ Does femtech suggest so-called women‚Äôs troubles might soon be taken as seriously as men‚Äôs?Opens in new window ] About 20-30 new people a month are seen at the NMH clinic, one of six public, specialist menopause services around the country. GPs, who do most HRT prescribing, can refer more complex cases to these clinics. The decision whether or not to take HRT is very individualised, says Cork GP Dr Ciara McCarthy, clinical lead for women‚Äôs health in the Irish College of General Practitioners. It should only be considered by somebody after discussing with a GP the risks and benefits for them personally. Despite it being acclaimed as good for the heart, ‚Äúthe international guidelines would say that HRT is generally not recommended for asymptomatic women solely for the prevention of cardiovascular disease‚Äù. Cardiologist Dr Blaithnead Murtagh of Blackrock Health in Galway also stresses the need for ‚Äúa holistic, individualised approach to menopausal women, including lifestyle advice, diet modification, as well as discussion on the role of HRT‚Äù. If there are no problematic symptoms, she does not recommend HRT for future cardiac health reasons. However, HRT prescribed before the age of 60, or within 10 years of the menopause, ‚Äúis likely associated with a reduction in coronary heart disease and cardiovascular mortality‚Äù. Women with early menopause, she adds, should be encouraged to use HRT until the average age of menopause, which is 51 in Ireland, according to the HSE. Changing the narrative to view menopause as part of healthy ageing may better empower women to navigate this life stage Periods stopping before the age of 45 is considered early menopause and puts women at a higher risk of not only cardiovascular disease but also bone loss, says McCarthy, which is another reason HRT would be recommended. Older women who have, or are at high risk of developing, osteoporosis could also benefit. During a menopause consultation, other factors that may be relevant to optimising health will be considered, such as vitamin D, calcium, smoking cessation, weight-bearing exercise and healthy diet. Addressing problems with blood pressure and high cholesterol, ‚Äúwill lead to knock-on improvements in long-term cardiovascular risk without taking HRT‚Äù. An increased risk of breast cancer, which is the concern women most often raise, is small, she says. The 2002 study by the Women‚Äôs Health Initiative, which linked HRT to an elevated risk of breast cancer, as well as blood clots and stroke, is now regarded as flawed, although the fear it generated still lingers. ‚ÄúFamily history of breast cancer does not preclude the majority of women from using HRT,‚Äù says McCarthy. ‚ÄúBut what your family history influences is your baseline risk of developing breast cancer.‚Äù The average woman, without a strong family history, has a 23 in 1,000 baseline risk of developing breast cancer in their 50s. This increases to 27 in 1,000 within five years of being on combined HRT, ie oestrogen and progestogen. However, among those on oestrogen-only medication, breast cancer incidence actually drops, to 19 per 1,000 women aged 50-59. (Most women are prescribed a combined form because progestogen is needed to protect against womb cancer.) The risk of breast cancer increases the longer HRT is used. The decision to start, or continue, is generally down to a person‚Äôs perception of acceptable risks, adds McCarthy. I asked my GP for HRT patches a few times before finally being listened to. It‚Äôs a game changer There is both ‚Äútoxic negativity‚Äù and ‚Äútoxic positivity‚Äù towards HRT, and it is about finding a balance, says GP Dr Brian Kennedy, clinical lead at the midwest complex menopause clinic in Nenagh, Co Tipperary. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt agree that everybody needs HRT, but I do think everybody needs a conversation about HRT. Everybody needs to be aware of the risks and benefits and make their own decision,‚Äù he says. [ Relationships and ... menopause: ‚ÄòSmall gestures of love can go a long way during this time of change‚ÄôOpens in new window ] He thinks for about 20 per cent of women, menopause ‚Äúis like a horrific illness ‚Äì a mixture of physical, psychiatric and social unwellness that is so disabling‚Äù. It is obvious they need HRT. Another 20 per cent are probably okay without it ‚Äì and there‚Äôs everybody in between. Hot flushes, insomnia and night sweats are widely recognised symptoms, but more subtle signs, such as brain fog, weight gain and stiff, sore joints, tend to be underplayed. Kennedy points out to patients that perimenopause and menopause do not happen in a vacuum. It is generally a very vulnerable time in women‚Äôs lives. They may be caring for teenagers or children, as well as ageing parents, and being pulled in all directions, while approaching the end of their fertility. ‚ÄúHRT is not going to solve everything, but it is definitely much more of a help than a hindrance in the vast majority of cases,‚Äù Kennedy says. There will always be women averse to pharmaceutical remedies for what is a natural transition in life. Indeed, the misconception of the menopause ‚Äúas always being a medical issue which consistently heralds a decline in physical and mental health should be challenged‚Äù, argues Prof Martha Hickey of the Royal Women‚Äôs Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, in the Lancet medical journal. ‚ÄúChanging the narrative to view menopause as part of healthy ageing may better empower women to navigate this life stage and reduce fear and trepidation among those who have yet to experience it.‚Äù Prof Rose Anne Kenny, head of medical gerontology at Trinity College Dublin and founder of the Irish Longitudinal study on Ageing (Tilda), agrees ‚Äú100 per cent‚Äù with O‚ÄôShea‚Äôs sentiments. ‚ÄúI feel very strongly that as medics we should be taking a much more holistic approach to HRT for women.‚Äù The protection it offers for bone density, for example, is important because fractures are a big reason for older people‚Äôs health going downhill. ‚ÄúThe earlier you get in, the better ‚Äì once your hormones have attenuated and you‚Äôre menopausal,‚Äù Kenny says. While it is primarily of value for menopausal symptoms, broader benefits include lubrication of mucosal surfaces, such as the mouth, eyes and vagina. ‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt related to diseases as such, but they‚Äôre very much related to quality of life for women.‚Äù Vaginal dryness can be classed as a menopausal symptom, she says. ‚ÄúEverybody gets that post menopause.‚Äù According to the Department of Health, the State will meet the cost of HRT where it has been prescribed ‚Äúfor the purpose of alleviating the symptoms associated with all stages of menopause‚Äù. Budget 2025 allocated ‚Ç¨20 million for this scheme and, as the pharmacy dispensing fee is now also covered, this was increased to ‚Ç¨24 million for 2026. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fabulous now I don‚Äôt have to pay for it,‚Äù says Suzanne Noonan, who feels she never wants to come off HRT. ‚ÄúI see it as just replenishing the hormones that my body no longer produces. There‚Äôs no need for suffering any more like our mothers and our grandmothers did.‚Äù ‚ÄúI went through perimenopause and menopause not knowing,‚Äù says Tracey Latham, now aged 45. She initially put excessive sweating down to unhealthy lifestyle choices, but was also very angry and irritable. ‚ÄúI asked my GP for HRT patches a few times before finally being listened to. It‚Äôs a game changer ‚Äì if only I was on them sooner, life would have been much better.‚Äù [ Perimenopausal and menopausal skin: How to tackle the most common problemsOpens in new window ] However, Anne from Co Wicklow says: ‚ÄúPersonally, I started HRT and immediately felt much worse. I stopped it and felt better.‚Äù Jaimie (48) says she often raised the question of menopause with a GP after her periods stopped before she was 40. Instead she was prescribed anti-depressants. She ordered a kit online that told her she was in the menopause. ‚ÄúWhen your doctor won‚Äôt even acknowledge your symptoms, how can you proceed? I‚Äôve tried to change GPs but there are so few in my area. It‚Äôs cruel.‚Äù ¬© 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Cavan auctioneer Victor Mee has built up a strong reputation for selling offbeat stuff, such as advertising memorabilia, antique garden furniture and vintage agricultural machinery. His next sale, live online from 3pm on Sunday, October 19th, will be filled with vernacular furniture, kitchen implements and even a few old metal tractor seats. Vernacular furniture ‚Äì also known as country furniture ‚Äì refers to the everyday furniture used in rural homes in the 19th and 20th centuries. In Ireland, pine tables, dressers, wooden chairs, dowry chests and wardrobes ‚Äì mostly made of pine ‚Äì are the main pieces of vernacular furniture for sale in auctions. Mee fell in love with it a long time ago. ‚ÄúI bought my first hedge chair in the 1970s for 50 pence and I‚Äôve been enamoured ever since,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThese pieces of furniture were born out of need and the pieces that survive today are like genuine historical artefacts.‚Äù Dressers remain popular for their original function ‚Äì displaying the best crockery in the house ‚Äì most of which was, and still is, only used for special occasions. There are a few dressers at the Mee auction, the best of which is a 19th-century painted pine dresser from Co Clare (‚Ç¨500-‚Ç¨800). It has three open shelves over a rows of short drawers and two lower cupboards with panelled doors. The pine settle bed was another staple of vernacular furniture. Usually positioned close to the hearth, this high-backed seat provided storage and seating during the day but could be converted to a bed at night-time. The Mee auction includes an early 19th-century pine settle bed from Cork, covered in old flaky paint (‚Ç¨800-‚Ç¨1,200) and another stripped pine settle bed (‚Ç¨250-‚Ç¨450). The 19th-century Irish pine dug-out chair is perhaps one of the more unusual lots (‚Ç¨1,000-‚Ç¨2,000). Dug-out chairs were exactly what you might think ‚Äì a chair carved from a single trunk with the interior ‚Äúdug out‚Äù for sitting on. It is crude and weathered looking, and Mee suggests it ‚Äúspeaks loudly of a forgotten era‚Äù. Shop fittings ‚Äì in particular sets of drawers ‚Äì have become sought after by homeowners drawn to eclectic interior styles. There are a few sets of shop drawers in various sizes but the most noteworthy are two sets of 56 drawers in pine from the 1940s (‚Ç¨1,000-‚Ç¨2,000 each). Auctions are also great places for picking up inexpensive crockery, and the Victor Mee auction has plenty of spongeware plates, platters, mugs and bowls from the 19th and 20th century. The set of six 19th-century spongeware soup bowls (‚Ç¨200-‚Ç¨400) are a good example of the style. As a way of creating a pattern on pottery, spongeware was first developed in the 18th century, becoming popular in Britain, Ireland and the United States in the 19th and 20th century. The patterns are created by pressing shaped sponges dipped in coloured pigment into the earthenware clay plate, bowl, jug or mug. This was a thriving cottage industry in the 19th century, and the pieces were often decorated at home by women before being glazed and refired in factories. Smudges, drips and variations in pattern added to the character, creating unique pieces. Contemporary potters such as Nicholas Mosse from Co Kilkenny were instrumental in reviving interest in spongeware techniques and designs. Three books written and signed by Ireland‚Äôs first president, Douglas Hyde, are among the lots for sale at Usher‚Äôs auction on Monday, October 20th from 6pm. The first edition books ‚Äì Songs of St Columcille, The Children of Lir and The Children of Tuireann (‚Ç¨400-‚Ç¨700) ‚Äì were published in the 1940s and are favourites among collectors. Hyde, who founded the Gaelic League, was a distinguished Gaelic scholar and author of many works, including A Literary History of Ireland. He was president from 1938 to 1945. Most of the wide variety of books at Usher‚Äôs auction, on view Saturday and Sunday, October 18th and 19th, noon-5pm, belonged to the late Gear√≥id Mac Gabhann (Gerry Smith). The son of Cavan footballer Big Jim Smith, Mac Gabhann was the founding member of Kilmacud Crokes club in Dublin. He played club football and later was mentor, coach and manager of football, hurling and camogie teams at Kilmacud Crokes. He was an accountant who worked as secretary manager for St Vincent‚Äôs hospital, Elm Park and later the Mater hospital. He was fluent in Irish and had a deep passion for Irish folklore, nature, political and local history, as this book collection testifies. The auction also includes manuscripts of religions from around the world, intriguing books on textiles and crafts. Many lots don‚Äôt have any estimates ‚Äì leaving bidding completely open to interested parties. As befitting of a passionate supporter of the GAA, Mac Gabhann‚Äôs collection also includes early GAA programmes, medals and other ephemera, many of which are signed. John Weldon‚Äôs jewellery, watches and gold coin auction on Tuesday, October 21st, at 2pm, includes a lifetime‚Äôs collection of 48 pieces of Irish silver. These include a William IV Chinoiserie silver tea caddy made in Dublin in 1834 by James Fray (‚Ç¨1,000-‚Ç¨2,000), and an Irish silver crested two-handled cup by Robert Calderwood, made in the mid 18th century (‚Ç¨1,200-‚Ç¨1,800). victormeeauctions.ie; usherauction.ie; jwa.ie Estimate ‚Ç¨1,200-‚Ç¨1,800 Hammer price ‚Ç¨1,200 Auction house Sheppard‚Äôs Estimate ‚Ç¨1,400-‚Ç¨1,800 Hammer price ‚Ç¨1,300 Auction house Sheppard‚Äôs Estimate ‚Ç¨200 ‚Äì ‚Ç¨300 Hammer price ‚Ç¨640 Auction house Adams Blackrock Hammer price ‚Ç¨1,600 Auction house Adams Blackrock ¬© 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Brains, Gains & Growing Pains: Inside Mount Sinai‚Äôs BCI Crystal Ball

ByNaveen Rao, Contributor. In their second annual Brain-Computer Interface Symposium, Mount Sinai Biodesign entreated attendees to an inside track on the top priorities and polarities defining BCI‚Äôs incomparable rise around the world. The world‚Äôs leading companies, neurosurgeons, clinical researchers, investors, advocates, and other leaders past, present and future convened for two days at the New York Academy of Medicine. After last year‚Äôs inaugural gathering, this installment drew a full house of 440 attendees and over 50 speakers. The program is the brainchild of Dr. Joshua Bederson, whose chairmanship of the neurosurgery department over the past 15 years has catalyzed Mount Sinai‚Äôs ascendance to a leading, ‚Äúliving‚Äù innovation hub for BCI and other breakthrough treatments. His opening remarks outlined a vision for full-spectrum discussion with the field‚Äôs leading voices. The myriad panels, heated debates, heartwarming stories, and innumerable conversations and networking came together to create a forum bustling with the intangible promises of discovery. Protocol Labs anchored this year‚Äôs sponsorship, signaling accelerating private interests in supporting neural research platforms, alongside Precision Neuroscience, Synchron and other companies. BCI defies easy alignment, categorization, or containment, representing a shared challenge and opportunity. For a fecund field tasked with defining, refining, regulating and selling itself while accelerating in every direction in real-time, growing pains are inevitable. The sessions included extensive presentations and discussions on technical advances and clinical methods, but the highlighted themes below are filtered through my lens of bringing this technology to people safely, sustainably, and responsibly, for all parties involved. This chicken-egg neurotech question knows no better stoa than this event, which kicked off with a lightning panel of eight leading BCI neurosurgeons. Their nuanced and wide ranging conversation underscored that progress depends upon and demands a healthy tension between today‚Äôs products and tomorrow‚Äôs science. Or, was it today‚Äôs science and tomorrow‚Äôs products? Invasiveness should not remain a limiting issue in BCI development, argued Michael Lawton, who leads Neuralink implantations as President and CEO of Barrow Neurological Institute. Lawton pointed to minimal scarring and chronic inflammation in both animal and human recipients of Neuralink‚Äôs n1 implant, arguing that the field should be aiming for ‚Äúwhole-brain BCI‚Äù as the goal, to read more data and develop more sophisticated applications. Today, this goal represents a collective effort with many hands on deck. Paradromics shared updates of their benchmarking work to gauge information transfer in neural recording with their Connexus BCI. Blackrock‚Äôs long-awaited neural lace is still in development. Emerging companies like Axoft, Neurobionics and Neurosoft are advancing next-generation arrays. In a later session, Ashwini Sharan, Medtronic‚Äôs chief medical officer of neuromodulation defended the medtech giant‚Äôs ‚Äúright to compete‚Äù in the BCI space with adaptive DBS platform, cleared earlier this year, whose real-time read/write capabilities offer emerging evidence of the practical and clinical benefits of invasive tools, albeit for a narrow band of eligible patients. As for minimalist BCI, the question of electing brain surgery looms large. Elad Levy, from the University at Buffalo, offered a pragmatic view of helping as many people today with the safest technology available in market. He likened today‚Äôs BCI to the Wright brothers airplanes, guaranteed to evolve in the next five years and beyond. Levy, who led the IDE study for Synchron‚Äôs minimally invasive Stentrode device, has devoted his career to advancing less invasive, less expensive, more accessible approaches to next-generation stroke treatment. New neuroimaging tools are enabling the shift. As BCI propagate into neurosurgical suites around the world, precise brain mapping is emerging as a central need, pointed out Matthew Wilsey, a neurosurgeon at the University of Michigan who recently implanted Paradromics‚Äô first human user. Levy outlined his use of Neuronetics‚Äô Trakstar platform along with Medtronic tools, which have helped move implantation towards a faster, more affordable outpatient setting without compromising safety or quality. Ian Cajigas from the University of Pennsylvania has led implants of Precision‚Äôs Layer 7 array. He reviewed how the limits of fMRI and MEG are opening the door for more advanced ‚Äúconnectomics‚Äù to create ‚Äúwiring diagrams‚Äù to guide neurosurgery. In a later session, Michael Ivan from the University of Miami shared how he has used Omniscient‚Äôs mapping tools to optimize placement and performance of Neuralink‚Äôs device as part of their ongoing clinical trial. Chad Bouton of Northwell Health and founder of Neuvotion stole the show by revealing a ‚Äúmind body connection‚Äù wherein Keith, a man living with a spinal cord injury whose double neural bypass was featured at this event last year, controlled a forearm device worn by Kathy, whose stroke left her partially paralyzed. Bouton explained, ‚ÄúWhen she holds something, he's literally helping her close his hand, because she's also living with paralysis. And he can now feel what she's holding.‚Äù In a video shared with attendees, Kathy sipped her diet coke, aided through over-the-skin wearables controlled by Keith‚Äôs thoughts. ‚ÄúIt feels like you‚Äôre getting back a little bit of what was taken from you,‚Äù she told the audience, next to Keith. Neuvotion‚Äôs FDA-cleared sleeve is the first of a planned ‚Äúneurorecovery ecosystem‚Äù of off-the shelf, BCI-compatible devices that defy easy value propositions in the best possible ways. In a later session, Chris Kellner from Mount Sinai charted the rapid advances in stroke rehabilitation over the years, from breakthroughs in vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) systems, EEG-based wearable BCI, and both old and new attempts with cortical implants. Stroke impacts 800,000 new people each year, widening the berth of chronic patients who can benefit from specialized care. Kellner‚Äôs work shows that even patients with several years ‚Äúbetween stroke and rehabilitation can still have a robust improvement‚Äù using standard scales of functional assessment. Quantifying clinical benefits of BCI, whether in stroke, ALS, spinal cord injury, or other areas, remains the central challenge for commercial companies approaching regulatory clearance and reimbursement decisions. Jamie Brannigan from Mount Sinai encouraged conservative market estimates and tight clinical definitions for suitable BCI recipients. Omid Forouzan, VP of clinical affairs at Synchron, was among several leaders who highlighted the progress and pitfalls of advancing objective measures of digital autonomy, contextual functional independence, activities of daily living considered critical or ‚Äúinstrumental,‚Äù and other ways to measure value to end-users. Mariska Vansteensel from UMC Utrecht Brain Center translated these tactical quality of life measures (feels, functions, survives) into the overarching concept of relational personhood, which gauges how people are, and feel, perceived as full persons by each other. Perhaps Congress needs a bit of the Dutch touch. In the first hour of the event, Lawton shared a video showing Brad Smith, one of Neuralink‚Äôs trial participants, playing games with his children through his BCI. In the next session, when Ian Burkhart, founder of the BCI Pioneers Coalition, asked ALS Caregiver and patient advocate MA Fernandez about how BCI could help her family, she answered ‚ÄúI really want Jules to be able to play videogames with Skyler,‚Äù referring to her husband and eight-year old son. Indeed. Former CMS Medical Officer Lee A. Fleischer opened the very next panel by saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs very clear that video games don‚Äôt fit the reasonable, necessary criteria" after explaining that ‚ÄúCMS cannot pay for things unless Congress says so.‚Äù Fleischer pointed to past approvals for speech generation and exoskeleton devices, encouraging innovators to ‚Äúunderstand the process and work within the structures because if not, you don‚Äôt win.‚Äù But when he said the agency‚Äôs job is to consider only the benefit and not the cost of new technologies, his panelists pushed back. Mijail Serruya from Thomas Jefferson University called out ‚Äúquite a bit of hypocrisy in what is paid for‚Äù by CMS, cautioning that one-size fits all reimbursement in BCI ‚Äúcould be a trap‚Äù because people with identical impairments often have different functionality. David Putrino from Mount Sinai argued passionately that at the bedside, his job was to help drowning people, only for insurers to deny coverage by countering ‚Äúpeople are not drowning, their legs just aren‚Äôt working. Send us more documentation on the legs.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a new age,‚Äù Putrino declared. ‚ÄúTechnology is advancing faster than ever before, and if we need to use the same system of checks and balances to get treatments through, it will die on the vine before it can help people. My very big fear about BCI is that if it flops now, it‚Äôs going to be 20 years before there‚Äôs any investor confidence to move forward.‚Äù Later that afternoon I moderated a panel with four neurotech investors to discuss market trends, commercial strategies, funding growth and evolution, categories versus platforms, globalization, and founder/funder dynamics. My panelists included Sean Escola, Head of Neurotech and NeuroAI at Protocol Labs, Peter Zhegin, Neurotech Director at e184, Adam Caplan, Founder at Jumpspace Ventures, and Konstantinos Alataris, BOD at Precision Neuroscience, Managing Director at Forepont, and former founder and CEO of Nevro. This year‚Äôs funding for implanted BCI will double or triple last year‚Äôs $500+ million, driven by Neuralink‚Äôs recent $625 Series E. But beyond growth, the key investment trend to watch is the diversification of capital, traditional VC, strategic philanthropies, cryptocurrency firms, international government programs, and beyond. Zhegin observed this is not a purely market-driven trend, but one stemming from investor interest and personality factors. Escola described braiding grant dollars and venture dollars to optimize support across pre-commercial development. Alataris wants to see new market access options for BCI that diverge from traditional med tech commercialization paths. His remarks followed a series of case studies he‚Äôd presented earlier to illustrate how the lag between FDA approval and CMS reimbursement restricts new product commercialization for both large and small med tech companies. This so-called valley of death hinders innovation and limits exit options for startups: ‚ÄúYou spend 10 years getting to FDA approval, a minimum of $100 to 150 million, then you need to raise another $300 million to create your sales force, and you live and die based on this single product revenue. But there is no commercial strategy that can work with no robust reimbursement. So aligning FDA approval and reimbursement is key.‚Äù All speakers advised founders navigating this landscape to understand their company‚Äôs value fully, and take time to explore all dimensions of the strategic value conferred by different types of backers on clinical and operational goals, from hiring to raising the next round. In a later question about founder X-factors in BCI, they mentioned the ability to secure both grant and venture dollars, quickly launch a research lab, along with requisite technical expertise and capabilities across the founding team. Alataris called on founders to opt for strategic capital and partnerships in big tech over med tech, while exploring profitable paths to sharing technology, revenue, IP, and maybe even data, with other companies, with an eye on building multiple product applications. In discussing BCI platforms, he compared the potential to the smartphone ecosystem and app store, Zhegin envisioned developer ecosystems like those at Intel or NVIDIA, while Caplan named read and write capabilities demonstrating sustained safety and performance. Escola called for more modular infrastructure across the ecosystem, so that each BCI company won‚Äôt have to absorb millions in equipment costs, and can focus more on business innovation. Building economies of scale in BCI will require vision, intention, and action. Science Corp‚Äôs Founder and CEO Max Hodak returned to this year‚Äôs event to share a heady list of updates that spanned bringing their retinal prosthesis closer to market, inventing synthetic proteins to enable optogenetic biohybrid arrays, and launching a new, next-generation technology stack to ‚Äúrewrite the economics of BCI development.‚Äù Science‚Äôs enablement toolkit includes neural probes, next-generation headstage devices, and a full back end of software applications. Hodak said this modular approach ‚Äúcuts the total development costs of bringing BCI therapy to market from over fifty to less than five million dollars." Coming from a single company, these developments demonstrate the platform approach discussed earlier. Similarly motivated offerings to scale innovation through interdependence are underway from Mint Neuro and Neuvotion, while new tools like Omniscient‚Äôs platform could also smooth the path for BCI startups. While these market innovations represent potential boons for a higher throughput R&D flywheel in the near-term, the longer term impacts on commercial BCI companies‚Äô costs, value proposition (and value perception), and pricing strategies remain open questions. From the outside, a successful BCI ecosystem requires external leadership and vision, too. Beyond attracting diverse pools of capital as described above, neurotechnology‚Äôs momentum has drawn interest from public leaders outside the US federal government. Viq Pervaaz, the Senior Vice President of Life Sciences & Healthcare at NYCEDC, shared a macro-economic lens on skilled job creation, catalyzing company formation, leveraging healthcare and life sciences anchors, socioeconomic impact, and more. NYEDC‚Äôs ongoing partnership with Mount Sinai has also supported development of new cutting-edge treatments, entrepreneurship and spinouts, and deeper synergies in development. At a time of political gridlock and federal clawbacks across health, science, and global leadership, NYEDC and Mount Sinai‚Äôs system-driven collaboration offers a relevant playbook for leaders seeking to future-proof their economies. To build an application layer, BCI needs an application taxonomy, a mindset shift that has already brought the field to a crossroads. Bloomberg reporter Ike Swetlitz opened his panel of seven BCI executives and neurosurgeons by asking for perceptions about Neuralink‚Äôs claimed goals to implant ‚Äúotherwise healthy people‚Äù in five years. Several panelists including Tom Oxley, Founder and CEO of Synchron hedged their answers with disclaimers about tight FDA definitions, Musk‚Äôs exuberance and the collective need to prioritize safety over rabbitholes. To be fair, Synchron‚Äôs sedulous leadership in advancing metrics and standards could arguably benefit this field even more than their high-profile partnerships with Apple and NVIDIA. And yet, the blitz of progress in the last year alone is publicly documented and undeniable: BCI is coming. Neuralink has gone from zero to 12 patients with permanent implants in the US and Canada in under two years. Precision has secured an FDA clearance, and in the time it took to publish findings from their first five patients, increased users by more than tenfold to 50+ people. In a notable breakthrough, Precision‚Äôs cofounder and chief science officer Ben Rapoport shared that this now includes patients without disabilities, such as a woman being treated for tumor removal who opted into the temporary implant to help advance research. ‚ÄúBuilding functional maps from healthy individuals could yield detailed maps of hand, speech and sensory representations,‚Äù said Rapoport, adding that such maps could also inform BCI implant targeting. Beyond the lane of motor neuroprostheses, some panelists pushed back on the definition of ‚Äúhealthy people,‚Äù pointing to differences between everyone, as well as market shifts towards a broader audiences and elective same-day procedures. Paradromics‚Äô founder and CEO Matt Angle spoke openly about his dual vision as a ‚Äúprecisely defined medical device,‚Äù as well as a platform technology to turn capital-intensive R&D into ‚Äúapplications that unlock a broader future.‚Äù Jacob Robinson, founder and CEO of Motif Neurotech and author of the application taxonomy paper in question spoke of the BCI field‚Äôs shared goal to ‚Äúcreate technology that is more normalized, with capabilities designed to bring us to the present.‚Äù His comments, underscored by Helen Mayberg later in the program, stressed that psychiatry suffers from need for more quantifiable, objective assessments. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to understand what‚Äôs happening in the circuit that drives your patient‚Äôs suffering. We‚Äôre not used to seeing dramatic, fast changes, in people who have failed to respond to years of medication.‚Äù Mayberg, a neurologist and director at Mount Sinai, pointed to 20 years of promising evidence of DBS‚Äôs efficacy in treating people living with severe depression. She urged the importance of closing clinical gaps with neurotechnology, starting with the lack of validated ‚Äúfacial or behavioral measures, or better, a measure from the brain, that tells us if they‚Äôre on the right track or need an adjustment.‚Äù Mayburg‚Äôs closing observation was that ‚Äúthese patients don‚Äôt know who they used to be. We‚Äôre having to chase the disorder by defining the disorder.‚Äù It reminded me of Alan Watts‚Äôs line, which applies to people as well as the BCI field as a whole: ‚ÄúTrying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth.‚Äù Teeth gnashing about slow diagnostic innovation aside, BCI is evolving towards broader applications that can fit under the category of ‚Äúhuman problems.‚Äù Ignacio Saez from Mount Sinai stressed that unlike motor BCI development, for cognitive and psychiatric BCI, "scientific knowledge, and our understanding of the neurobiological basis of cognitive and psychiatric processes, is still a major limiting factor." Unrelated to implanted BCI, Meta shared in a separate session that their newly launched EMG wristband took 6,000 training sessions for off the shelf-functionality, suggesting that we are in the early innings of this next frontier. Michael Ivan, Neuralink‚Äôs PI at the University of Miami, said our modern understanding of the brain ‚Äúis that multiple areas work together to create something powerful. Together, they shape executive function, attention span, memory. As a neurosurgeon, I try to avoid these areas. But with BCI it‚Äôs the opposite ‚Äì we‚Äôre trying to find these functional areas to figure out how to sense from them and stimulate them." With their second event, Mount Sinai‚Äôs BCI Symposium has cemented itself as a must-attend for those interested in the nexus of brain health and implanted technologies. With an eye on returning to New York in 2026, where I will hope for more interdisciplinary and diversified panels, as well as representation from newer companies in BCI and beyond, some closing thoughts on what‚Äôs ahead. Lastly, I asked MA Fernandez if I could share the message her husband Jules shared with attendees. As a young father to an 8 year old son, his ALS symptoms began six years ago, and have progressed to the point of his being confined to a wheelchair, dependent on a feeding tube and a breathing tube. Their story broke my heart but gave me hope. How much longer will it take before we can turn to BCI to help folks like Jules?

By Amanda Bartolotta October 17, 2025 For years, India has marketed itself as the world‚Äôs next great innovation hub, the emerging Silicon Valley of the East. Politicians, business leaders and industry groups have celebrated the nation‚Äôs engineers as global talent, proudly pointing to every Indian-origin CEO leading a major American tech firm as proof of India‚Äôs global prominence. The narrative being pushed has been that India was no longer just the world‚Äôs back office ‚Äì it was the future of technology. Yet beneath the glossy slogans of ‚ÄúDigital India‚Äù and ‚ÄúMake in India,‚Äù reality dictates a very different story. The promise of innovation has rarely matched the results. As noted in a report by The Wire, India‚Äôs allure for investors stems not from its depth of talent, but from the fact that its ‚Äúlabor is cheap and laws are lax.‚Äù Still, American venture capitalists, eager to stake a claim in the ‚Äúnext tech frontier,‚Äù have bought into the illusion. Capital flowed, partnerships multiplied and billion-dollar valuations were built, not on genuine technological breakthroughs, but on carefully crafted narratives that sold success. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet ‚Äì delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Why India copies well but fails to lead in innovation When ‚Äúmultinational educational technology company‚Äù BYJU‚Äôs emerged, it quickly became the perfect poster child for India‚Äôs startup dream. It was marketed as a unicorn ‚Äì that is, a privately held startup company with a valuation of over $1 billion ‚Äì proof that India could not only serve Silicon Valley, but become it. The company promised to transform how children learn and to usher in a new age of digital education. Yet, true to the national pattern, the promise unraveled quickly. From unicorn to black sheep Before its eventual financial and legal collapse, BYJU‚Äôs stood as one of India‚Äôs most celebrated startup success stories. Founded in 2011 and officially being dubbed a unicorn by 2018, it grew from a small tutoring operation into India‚Äôs most valued startup by 2022, ultimately being valued at $22 billion. Its learning app soon became a household name across India and founder Byju Raveendran earned a spot on the Forbes list of India‚Äôs richest people, celebrated as a self-made visionary transforming education. Former employees recalled his taste for five-star hotels and luxury cars, while his wife and co-founder, Divya Gokulnath, was seen networking in elite tech circles and Silicon Valley gatherings. Together, they emerged as global power players, symbols of a new generation of Indian entrepreneurs reshaping the country‚Äôs image on the world stage. At its peak, BYJU‚Äôs went on a buying spree, acquiring 19 companies for more than $2.6 billion. The goal was to expand its main products and strengthen its presence in the United States. The company added new areas such as coding, job training and lifelong learning to its offerings and even pushed into the Middle East by becoming the official sponsor of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. BYJU‚Äôs also hinted at plans to go public within a year, through an initial public offering (IPO) either in India or the United States. Both options were said to be under review, with no immediate deadline. Industry reports also suggested a possible merger with a U.S. special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that could have valued the business at around $40 billion, though co-founder Divya Gokulnath declined to comment. Yet, beneath the optimism, warning signs were already visible. Despite being valued at $22 billion in September 2022, BYJU‚Äôs parent company, Think & Learn Pvt. Ltd., reported a staggering $554.77 million loss for fiscal 2021, largely attributed to soaring marketing and employee expenses, leading to layoffs and cost-saving measures to push towards achieving profitability. The company‚Äôs rapid rise had been built on hype and expansion, but the financial foundation was already starting to crack. A fall from grace In December 2022, when India‚Äôs child-rights commission called out BYJU‚Äôs over complaints of overly aggressive sales targeting families and first-generation learners. In the months that followed, scrutiny widened to its coding unit, WhiteHat Jr, amid allegations regarding advertising claims and hard-sell tactics. WhiteHat Jr filed defamation suits against critics, but then withdrew the cases after public backlash. In April 2023, India‚Äôs Enforcement Directorate raided BYJU‚Äôs offices and later issued a $1.12 billion show-cause notice under the Foreign Exchange Management Act. The agency reported uncovering ‚Äúincriminating‚Äù documents and digital evidence during the raid, citing serious financial violations, including missing regulatory filings, delayed export payments and unreported foreign direct investment transfers totaling about $3.37 billion between 2011 and 2023. Investigators also found that the company had transferred about $1.18 billion to multiple foreign jurisdictions during the same period, allegedly under the guise of overseas direct investment. Despite being issued multiple summonses, founder Byju Raveendran repeatedly failed to appear before authorities, remaining evasive throughout the investigation. The troubles didn‚Äôt stop there. The startup, backed by major investors including Prosus, Peak XV, Sofina, BlackRock, UBS and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, missed its revenue target for the financial year ending March 2023, according to financial statements released months behind schedule. Soon after, the company‚Äôs chief financial officer, Ajay Goel, resigned to return to Vedanta, marking yet another senior exit following the abrupt departures of auditor Deloitte and three key board members in June. The turmoil deepened when Prosus, one of BYJU‚Äôs earliest and largest investors, holding over 9% of the company, publicly criticized the firm in July for failing to evolve and for repeatedly ignoring investor guidance. These cascading resignations and public rebukes signaled that BYJU‚Äôs once-glowing image had fully unraveled and its troubles were only beginning. BYJU‚Äôs has raised a total of $4.45 billion over 27 funding rounds: 2 Early-Stage, 22 Late-Stage and 3 Debt rounds. BYJU‚Äôs‚Äô largest funding round so far was a conventional debt round for $1.2 billion in November 2021. BYJU‚Äôs had a total of 132 investors, 105 being institutional investors and 27 Angel investors. From loan disputes to courtroom battles Through 2023 and into early 2024, BYJU‚Äôs mounting troubles spilled into the courts as disputes over a $1.2 billion U.S. term loan escalated. Court filings and investigative reports revealed that about $533 million had been routed through BYJU‚Äôs U.S. subsidiary, Alpha, into accounts tied to Camshaft Capital Management, a fund linked to a 23-year-old portfolio manager whose Miami business address once corresponded to an International House of Pancakes. The findings painted a picture of questionable transfers and lax oversight surrounding the billion-dollar loan. The financial strain only deepened. On July 16, 2024, the Board of Control for Cricket in India filed an insolvency case against BYJU‚Äôs over roughly $19 million in unpaid sponsorship dues. By the end of the year, both Deloitte and BDO had resigned as auditors, while major investors, including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Prosus and Peak XV (Sequoia India) quit the board entirely. India‚Äôs Byju‚Äôs can‚Äôt pay employees At the same time, Qatar Holding petitioned the Karnataka High Court to enforce a $235 million arbitral award against Byju Raveendran and Byju‚Äôs Investments Pte Ltd tied to a 2022 $150 million loan for the Aakash acquisition, with interest sought at 4% per annum compounded daily from Feb. 28, 2024. The legal blows culminated in February 2025, when a U.S. bankruptcy court issued a summary judgment finding actual fraudulent transfers and breach of fiduciary duty related to the movement of funds through BYJU‚Äôs Alpha, marking one of the most significant legal setbacks in the company‚Äôs dramatic downfall. The myth of India‚Äôs innovation engine Once hailed as the future of Indian innovation, BYJU‚Äôs now serves as its cautionary tale. What began as a symbol of national pride, the story of a small startup that conquered global markets, has become a lesson in how hype and ego can outpace substance. In one of his last public interviews, founder Byju Raveendran dismissed the crisis, determined that he would see success again, saying,‚ÄúWhy I am confident of a comeback is that the most valuable thing I had is still with me,‚Äù referring to himself. It was a statement that perfectly captured the misplaced faith that defined BYJU‚Äôs rise, a belief not in innovation, governance or results, but in personality and perception. For years, U.S. investors, from BlackRock and UBS to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, poured hundreds of millions of dollars into a single man and his myth, while American innovators back home struggled to break into markets dominated by foreign-backed giants. The question now is unavoidable: If so many investors were willing to stake billions on a person halfway around the world, why are they unwilling to back the homegrown entrepreneurs and talent right here in the United States, those who are locked out of markets increasingly monopolized by global capital and offshore influence? BYJU‚Äôs collapse is more than the downfall of a company; it is a mirror held up to a global investment culture that prizes narrative over national interest and speculation over stewardship. It is a reminder that the same investors who helped inflate the illusion of India‚Äôs innovation miracle have ignored the innovators in their own backyard. In the end, BYJU‚Äôs didn‚Äôt just fail as a business, it exposed the moral and economic blind spots of an era. The myth of India‚Äôs innovation engine has once again met the hard truth of execution and the cost was paid not only in rupees, but in large amounts of misplaced American capital.

A large shareholder in Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, said he would reject a proposed purchase of the company by the rival data center firm CoreWeave in an upcoming shareholder vote. "Under the math of the deal today, I would have to vote no," Trip Miller, the founder of the investment firm Gullane Capital, told Business Insider on Friday afternoon. Gullane, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the third-largest shareholder in Core Scientific, behind Vanguard and BlackRock, and owns a stake in the company worth about $200 million. Miller's opposition adds to other recent pushback against the deal, casting doubt on one of the year's largest data center mergers. CoreWeave ‚Äî the AI cloud darling racing to scale its computing power ‚Äî needs the roughly $5 billion takeover to help it continue to grow rapidly and also cut billions of dollars in soaring costs. But a dip in its stock price has weakened the offer's value, exacerbating investor concerns that the deal sharply undervalues Core Scientific just weeks before shareholders are set to vote on the transaction. On October 14, Two Seas Capital, another investment firm that owns about 6.3% of Core Scientific's stock, published a lengthy presentation that outlined its myriad objections to the takeover, including that it was not profitable enough for stock owners. The firm urged investors to reject it in the upcoming shareholder vote on October 30. In response, the CEO of the Livingston, New Jersey-based CoreWeave said the acquisition was "the most compelling path forward for Core Scientific stockholders" and that the present deal would be its "best and final" offer for the company. "The combination will offer Core Scientific and CoreWeave stockholders the opportunity to benefit from the tremendous upside potential and long-term value creation driven by greater verticalization," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO, wrote in a letter published on October 16. Intrator said the complaints from Two Seas Capital were "misleading and misinformed." CoreWeave's rapid, debt-fueled growth has thrust it into the center of a growing debate over whether AI speculation has become a bubble or if early movers like it are seizing on a historic investment opportunity. In July, CoreWeave announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that valued Core Scientific at roughly $9 billion at the time and $20.40 per share ‚Äî a 66% per share premium over what Core Scientific stock had then been recently trading for. But in the ensuing months, the economics have shifted as CoreWeave's shares have dipped and Core Scientific's have risen. The stock conversion deal currently values Core Scientific's shares at around $17, more than 10% below its market price of about $19 on Friday.CoreWeave and Core Scientific did not respond to requests to comment. "This is not a popular deal, I think for one simple reason: it's a flawed structure," Miller said. "It would be a deal that would value my shares, actually, at a discount to what they currently trade for today." Since a shaky initial public offering in March, CoreWeave has raced to a $70 billion market capitalization ‚Äî more than three times its value after the IPO ‚Äî and a place at the forefront of the booming data center business. It has announced blockbuster deals with some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and the chipmaker Nvidia, and has spent billions of dollars snapping up AI developers and cloud providers to broaden its capabilities and customer offerings. In the company's second-quarter earnings call, Intrator said that its biggest customers required the development of infrastructure, including data centers, on a "planetary" scale. "We are aggressively expanding our footprint on the back of intensifying demand signals from our customers, ensuring that we maintain a durable, multi-year runway for growth," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO and cofounder, said in the company's second quarter earnings call. CoreWeave said it is expanding its roughly 470 megawatts of operating data centers to more than 900 megawatts by the end of 2025 ‚Äî enough power to light up about a fifth of New York City on an average day. The Core Scientific acquisition would more than double that by operational megawattage and expand the company's pipeline of contracted future power by 50% to more than 3 gigawatts. Revenue for CoreWeave in the second quarter was $1.2 billion, more than double the same period a year prior, the company reported, and its revenue backlog of $30.1 billion had doubled since the beginning of the year ‚Äî demonstrating its tremendous business prospects. Its operating margins, however, fell from 20% to 2% year over year, a sign of how costs are increasingly eating into the company's profitability. The company reported its debt had grown to $11.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, a 40% increase from the beginning of the year, and that its borrowing costs ranged from 7% to 15% on its various loans. Gil Luria, an analyst who covers the company, has raised concerns about the high-cost borrowing compared to the company's slimmer profit margins. "They're selling $20 bills for 15 bucks," Luria said. "Sometimes we forget to ask ourselves if this business should even exist," Luria said. "I'm not sure the answer is yes." Acquiring Core Scientific would streamline some of CoreWeave's mounting overhead. CoreWeave rents roughly 270 megawatts of data center space from Core Scientific, and owning the company would allow CoreWeave to save about $10 billion in lease payments for that space over the next 12 years, it has said. "They realize how important this is to the long-term viability of their business model, owning the economics around their largest cost, which is data centers," said Raul Martynek, the CEO of the data center developer and operator DataBank, which is not involved in the deal. Martynek said that Intrator's response letter signified the CEO was making a "full-throated defense of their offer" to purchase Core Scientific. Among the concerns outlined in its presentation, Two Seas said that the deal didn't offer shareholders protection from stock fluctuations that have upended the economics of the transaction. "The initial headline deal price of $20.40 per share undervalued Core Scientific's intrinsic value and strategic value to CoreWeave," Two Seas Capital wrote. "Following one of the worst post-deal drawdowns in an acquirer's stock price since 2020; the current deal value of less than $18 per share reflects a take-under of Core Scientific." In his letter on Thursday, Intrator wrote that CoreWeave represents Core Scientific's only meaningful data center customer and that its business accounts for 76% of Core Scientific's revenue. Intrator added that Core Scientific investors should "think objectively about Core Scientific's stand-alone prospects and the significant risks involved" in rejecting the deal and remaining an independent company." Miller disagreed, stating that in a hot data center market, "the belief is, if you leave this company alone for 18 months, it's a $30 to $40 company" per share, and that he felt it could be a more lucrative acquisition target.
