The latest expected pick is Kelly Loeffler, who Trump is reportedly about to pick for secretary of agriculture. Loeffler, a Republican senator from Georgia, reportedly sold $20 million in stock just days before the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) "pandemic" was declared. Back then, Loeffler was appointed to her seat "against President Trump's wishes," NPR reported. Now, Trump apparently wants Loeffler to occupy a top position in his cabinet. Trump and his allies pushed for Rep. Doug Collins to take what would have been a vacant seat, but that seat was ultimately filled by Gov. Brian Kemp with Loeffler. "She dumped millions in stock in companies to be affected by Covid after a classified briefing on the virus before a pandemic was declared," tweeted Whitney Webb (@_whitneywebb) about Loeffler's insider trading scandal during COVID. (Related: Did you know that just one day before Thomas Matthew Crooks reportedly tried to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump back in the summer a private equity firm out of Austin called Austin Private Wealth reported massive short bets on $DJT and $RUM stocks, which is similar to what happened right before 9/11?) Loeffler's husband co-owns crypto platform that Trump media wants to buy Loeffler's husband Jeffrey Sprecher is also part of a newfound effort to privatize natural resources like air and water through so-called "natural asset corporations." Sprecher, who chairs the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), joined the Rockefeller-backed IEG to implement natural asset corporations that are designed to securitize nature, "particularly parts of the natural world that have up to this point been considered part of the 'global commons' including clean air and water," Webb notes. "It can be used for predatory land grabs, especially troubling for a prospective head of the USDA." Webb further warns that Sprecher partially owns Bakkt, a cryptocurrency firm that Trump's media company just so happens to want to purchase. Once Trump is in office and Loeffler is head of the USDA, it appears as though the next step is for Trump to grease a deal with Sprecher that will benefit the two's private endeavors. A former board member of Trump's media company, by the way, is right now working to turn the precious Amazon rainforest into the world's first "internet of forests." The goal will be to monetize collected data while surveilling and ultimately ending the sovereignty of locals who live there. The same former Trump media company board member wants to tokenize each hectare of the Amazon rainforest with the help of a former top executive at BlackRock "who essentially invented ETFs," according to Webb. "Wall Street is trying to turn all of nature into tradable financial products and it seems like the next admin is down for that (esp. incoming head of Commerce Howard Lutnick!)," Webb warns. Natural asset companies, in case you did not know, are the epitome of climate change nonsense. They involve things like carbon credits, carbon capture, net zero, and more. "Most of the people around Trump's circle are Wall Street investors and they will get even richer in the next four years," warned someone on X / Twitter about the Trump grift. "They give the impression they will cut waste but will instead cut programs which will hurt working Americans." "I feel nauseous," wrote another who feels duped by Trump. "Humanity is not on a good trajectory and the fix (if there is one) seems beyond politics." The latest Trump-related news can be found at Trump.news.

Title: Even a dodgy Firework couldn’t mar day to remember for Gus McCarthy

As debuts go, not least for a 21-year-old hooker, it wasn’t too bad. A try, three try assists, playing the full 80 minutes, the last six of them in the back row, and Ireland winning 52-17 at home in front of extended family and friends. Not even in his wildest dreams could Gus McCarthy have concocted all of that. In a highly impressive, mobile and skilful display made, they are memories that McCarthy admitted he’ll cherish for the rest of his life. There are other too, not least hearing and singing the anthems. As that dream became a reality, as he thought of the route to this point, and those who helped him along the way, the tears streamed down his face. “I was pretty emotional, just because it’s always been a dream of mine growing up. I’ve always come to the games and sang the anthems. It was just a really, really proud moment, not only for myself, but more thinking of my family and the journey to get to there.” It’s funny how McCarthy and Sam Prendergast, the two 21-year-olds, took such contrasting routes to last Saturday’s landmark day for them both. McCarthy was captain, and Prendergast the undoubted star turn, in the Ireland under-20s side that won a Grand Slam and reached the Under-20 World Cup two seasons ago. Prendergast was fast-tracked into Leinster’s first team squad, making his first two starts later that season in South Africa, and his 16 appearances last season, amounting to 473 minutes, led to him being included in Ireland’s squad for the two-Test series in South Africa. By contrast, McCarthy played only 25 minutes for Leinster that season, in their April trek to South Africa, but all changed when Dan Sheehan suffered his ACL injury in the first Test before Rónan Kelleher, Lee Barron and John McKee were all struck down this season. In addition to four starts for Leinster and two for Emerging Ireland, McCarthy was hauled back from that tour to play the second half of the marquee Croke Park fixture. “I probably still haven’t taken in how lucky I have been to get some chances but I’m sure over the next few months I will reflect on that.” McCarthy reckons he played about half a dozen AIL 1A games with UCD last season, and while agreeing that it is a huge jump to Test rugby, he stressed: “But, no, I wouldn’t talk down AIL. There are some physical men. I’m trying to think of my last one. It potentially could have been Ballynahinch away or something like that, which is not a glamour fixture. We actually got pumped.” McCarthy started this season in the Leinster academy and so was, effectively, their fifth-choice hooker. “As well as Dan and Rónan there’s two other great hookers in John McKee and Lee Barron at Leinster, so I’m still competing with a lot. With the five of us it’s very competitive, anyone can step up and perform, as we’ve seen with the lads in the last few years. “So, I’ve just said to myself or when I’m speaking to my parents, and my dad especially, any opportunity I get I have to try to take it. I can’t wait around, especially in training. I just have to try to put my best foot forward and impress the coaches when I get a chance.” In the long term, it’s difficult to see how they can all remain with the province, but that’s another day’s discussion. Even after his unexpected flurry of game time with Leinster, McCarthy was only named as one of five “training panellists” in addition to the 35-man squad for this Series, behind three other hookers, so when he was named to start against Fiji he was as surprised as anybody. “When Faz [Andy Farrell] named the team on Monday I was incredibly surprised. I only got the call on Sunday evening at around 7pm that I was coming back in on Monday. I thought I was going to be back in Leinster this week. So then when I got the call that I was coming in to camp I thought I’d maybe get the chance to be 24th man and experience the match day. Then when I saw Faz put up the team and I was starting I was full of emotions. I was incredibly excited but also nervous.” His week had featured other highs, not least being presented with his jersey by a fellow former Blackrock College player and captain. “Caelan [Doris] actually gave me the jersey in the Shelbourne on Thursday night, which was very special: a fellow Blackrock man and to have the captain of your country present you with your jersey is very special.” To complete his day, after the game McCarthy saw his parents, Robert and Australian-born mum Tara, sisters Naoise and Millie and brother Hubie, as well as cousins and uncles. There was only one blemish. McCarthy was speaking to a small group of journalists in a passageway near the dressingrooms after Saturday’s game, where he was about to return and ready himself for something more daunting than starting his first Test match. That was to be his debut song in front of the squad. He revealed: “I’ll give a terrible rendition of Firework by Katie Perry.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Asia’s Largest Digital Bank Launches Retail Crypto Trading In Hong Kong—Details

Time Published: 2024-11-26T02:30:17Z

Hong Kong’s largest digital bank, ZA Bank, has announced the launch of a retail cryptocurrency trading service. According to the press release, the service enables users to trade cryptocurrencies directly through the ZA Bank app, “simplifying” the trading process by eliminating the need for third-party platforms. This move makes ZA Bank the first bank in Asia to offer such services to retail customers, reflecting the region’s growing interest in digital asset adoption. The trading platform is designed to support transactions in Hong Kong dollars (HKD) and US dollars (USD), allowing users to trade leading cryptocurrencies. To deliver this functionality, ZA Bank has partnered with HashKey Exchange, one of the three licensed digital currency exchanges in Hong Kong. The release revealed that HashKey’s institutional-grade platform, HashKey Pro, provides API trading, block trade services, and “enhanced” account management features, ensuring “secure and efficient trading” for users. Calvin Ng, Alternate Chief Executive of ZA Bank, noted: The rise of cryptocurrency presents investors with more diverse asset allocation opportunities. As a bank, we prioritise security and compliance, which is why we’ve partnered with HashKey, a global-leading licensed virtual asset exchange, to meet regulatory standards and deliver bank-grade security in virtual assets trading – our key competitive advantage in the Asian market. HashKey Exchange plays a crucial role in ZA Bank’s foray into the crypto sector. ZA Bank revealed in the press release that the collaboration leverages HashKey Pro’s infrastructure to “seamlessly” integrate digital currency trading into the ZA Bank app. HashKey Exchange CEO Livio Weng emphasized the broader implications of this partnership, stating that the initiative aims to drive the growth of the Web3 ecosystem in Hong Kong. We are privileged to partner with ZA Bank in advancing innovation in digital banking services across Asia. As Hong Kong’s largest licensed virtual asset exchange, HashKey Exchange is dedicated to providing users with fully compliant and secure digital asset trading solutions. ZA Bank, as the first bank in Asia to offer such service, has demonstrated its strong leadership and a pioneering spirit in fintech integration. Weng noted that as one of the three licensed exchanges in the region, alongside OSL and HKVAX, HashKey is positioned to support the digital asset industry’s compliance with regulatory standards. Overall, it is worth noting that this collaboration highlights Hong Kong’s efforts to establish itself as a leading hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. In addition, collaboration and adoption have come when the cryptocurrency market has consistently seen recognition from major institutions and even countries. Recently, BlackRock launched options trading on its crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) product.

Title: ‘Any opportunity I get, I have to try and take it’ – Gus McCarthy knows what he must do with Ireland pecking order

Ireland's Gus McCarthy during the Autumn Nations Series match against Fiji. Photo: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile It’s hard to remember a better debut or a faster rise than Gus McCarthy’s. At the start of this season, the 21-year-old hooker had made a solitary bench appearance for Leinster on their tour of South Africa, and were it not for injury, he’d have likely lined out for their ‘A’ side against Munster on Friday night. Instead, he has propelled himself into Andy Farrell’s Ireland thoughts after making the most of others’ misfortune. That, in essence, is the game. He came into this season as Leinster’s fifth-choice hooker, but injuries to the other four opened the door in pre-season. He impressed and earned the No 2 jersey for the season opener, making such an impact that he was called up to the Emerging Ireland tour and then called home early to start at Croke Park against Munster. Still in the Academy, he earned a spot in Ireland’s squad as a ‘training panellist’ and was ready to go back to Leinster last Sunday, until he got a tap on the shoulder. He teared up when singing the anthem and his first lineout went astray, but when the whistle blew he was the picture of calm. He threw his first assist for Caelan Doris’s opening try, followed it up with a pre-assist a few minutes later and then offloaded out of the tackle for Craig Casey’s score. After half-time, he got over for a try of his own and set up Bundee Aki for his score. Aki got man of the match, but the hooker was hard done by. He may have been nervous, but the 2023 Ireland U-20s captain delivered an excellent performance – one that is rooted in his days playing minis rugby at Old Belvedere and his school days at Blackrock College. “Growing up, I’ve always played with the rugby ball in hand, always messing around with mates, whether it be at school or in the garden or at home,” he reflected. “I’d just see where the space is, and kind of scan up. “That is something I have to keep working on. Faz (Andy Farrell) is massive on scanning early, so that is something I have to keep working on. I was kind of happy. There’s a few chances that I saw an opportunity to give it early.” McCarthy wasn’t expecting to make the step up so soon. “When Faz named the team on Monday, I was incredibly surprised,” he said. “I only got the call on Sunday evening at around 7pm that I was coming back in on Monday. I thought I was going to be back in Leinster this week. “I thought I’d maybe get the chance to be 24th man and experience the match-day experience. “Then when I saw Faz put up the team and I was starting, I was full of emotions. I was incredibly excited but also nervous. “I was pretty emotional [during the anthems] just because it’s always been a dream of mine growing up. “I’ve always come to the games and sang the anthems. It was just a really, really proud moment, not only for myself but more thinking of my family and the journey to get there. It was just a proud moment for me and my family.” Already, there is a rush to get McCarthy out of Leinster where Dan Sheehan and Rónan Kelleher are established options. Kelleher is likely to start against Australia and Sheehan is back after Christmas, while Lee Barron and John McKee will have a chance to impress in McCarthy’s absence against Ulster this week. He knows he’s in a battle for game-time, but you sense he’ll back himself to get into that match-day 23. “As well as Dan and Ronan, there are two other great hookers in John McKee and Lee Barron at Leinster, so I’m still competing with a lot,” he said. “With the five of us, it’s very competitive, anyone can step up and perform, as we’ve seen with the lads. “So, I’ve just said to myself, or when I’m speaking to my parents, and my dad especially, that any opportunity I get, I have to try and take it. I can’t wait around, especially in training. I just have to try and put my best foot forward and impress the coaches when I get a chance.”

Title: No Fianna Fáil 2011-type disaster for Sinn Féin but repeat of their 2020 success looks unlikely
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2024/11/26/no-fianna-fail-2011-type-disaster-for-sinn-fein-but-repeat-of-their-2020-success-looks-unlikely/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T02:00:00Z
Full Content:
During the local and European elections earlier this year, Sinn Féin canvassers in some of its heartlands area in Dublin were confronted with hostility on doorsteps. The flashpoint was immigration. Tents erected by asylum seekers were lined along the canal. Around the State, there were stand-offs with local residents over proposed accommodation centres. In Dublin, Sinn Féin was facing headwinds in some of its strongest areas, such as west Finglas, Coolock, Ballyfermot and the north inner city. At some doorsteps, the party’s candidates were called “traitors” and “unpatriotic”. In Coolock, a party member was attacked, sustaining a broken nose. Sinn Féin had a poor election. But then, it also had poor local and European elections in 2019 but bounced back spectacularly in the general election seven months later. This time, though, the journey back seemed more perilous. When supporters turn against a party it is never a pretty sight. For a while, it seemed this general election for Sinn Féin might be a minor version of what happened to Fianna Fáil in 2011 after the farcical collapse of its government. Back then, Fianna Fáil candidates faced similar anger from voters. Outgoing TD Mary Hanafin was standing at a school gate in Blackrock as one young parent guided her young child through the gates. “Hi, I am looking for your support,” said Hanafin pleasantly. “Fianna Fáil?” the woman asked. Before Hanafin could reply, she snarled: “I would rather stick pins in my eyes. You are a load of gangsters.” That was then, this is now. Following candidates from different parties across five Dublin constituencies this time, it’s clear it’s not going to be a 2011 for Sinn Féin. Soon after this summer’s elections, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald visited many key Dublin heartlands spoke to community leaders, in order to lance the boil. The party also did a volte face on its immigration policies. Since then, too, the issue has become less fraught and emotional. Two Sinn Féin TDs, Eoin Ó Broin and Mark Ward, are canvassing in Moorfield, a settled and attractive estate in north Clondalkin, where it usually pulls in 50 per cent of the vote. Ó Broin is an impressive operator on the ground. In another life, he would have made a great GP, with a mix of empathy and infinite patience for everybody he meets. “We would have estimated during the [summer election] about 10 per cent talked about migration and the accommodation issues,” he says. “A lot of those conversations were decent. People wanted to know what’s going on and were expressing concerns. There was a portion of exchanges which were hostile.” He said the issue is still being raised but not as often. “It’s perhaps the second or third issue. It does not have the same salience. At the time, it was soon after the riots and there were tents along the canal.” The cost of living, housing, tax and access to healthcare are also big issues. A young woman says her partner earns €50,000 and wants to know if there will be a change in tax bands as he feels the impact of cost-of-living hikes. Ó Broin explains the Sinn Féin plan to scrap the Universal Social Charge for anybody earning under €45,000. There is not enormous engagement. There are some pledged votes, some are non-committal. “We are still thinking,” one woman tells the Sinn Féin canvassers. “We really need a change,” Ó Broin urges her. “We are the only party that can do it.” There is only one hard “No”, an immediate door slam. In another house, a relatively young woman says she can’t vote for Sinn Féin because of “legacy issues”. Canvassing in Dún Laoghaire, the Green Party’s Ossian Smyth says that at this juncture in the campaign four years ago, the pension age issue championed by Sinn Féin had really taken hold and that people on doorsteps in all areas were talking about “change” and “Mary Lou”. “We are not hearing it this time,” he says. There is no doubt in Dublin the Greens are feeling the negative effects of being the small party in Government. On the other hand, there has been a defanging of voter toxicity around Labour and Fianna Fáil. In Tallaght, Fianna Fáil’s Teresa Costello is campaigning on the basis of her working-class roots and her understanding of the community. A cancer survivor and advocate, Costello is chatty and pleasant and gets positive engagement. She gets a few commitments of support but it’s striking how many people on the doorsteps have yet to commit. The bicycle shed invariably crops up. “For the name of Holy God, somebody get hold of the Office of Public Works and, for feck’s sake, tell them to stop spending money like it’s going out of fashion. There doesn’t seem to be any accountability,” a woman in Kingswood tells Costello. “The other thing is the national children’s hospital. Nobody called a halt to that.” One man tells her that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have been in power for too long. “It’s time to give Sinn Féin a twist,” he says. In Beaumont, Paul McAuliffe of Fianna Fáil chats to a manwhose daughter has just graduated as a teacher but who, owing to cost-of-living issues and the cost of houses, will find it hard to stay in Dublin. “Her friends in the [teaching] class are thinking of going to Australia. It’s all to do with the cost of living,” he says. McAuliffe points to the nearby new residential development of 800 homes on Oscar Traynor Road, saying the three-bedroom units will be available to some families at €360,000. The Labour candidate in Dublin South-West Ciarán Ahern is canvassing in Kimmage along with party leader Ivana Bacik. A couple in their 60s say they are worried about “so many people looking for social housing and being on the dole”. The man says: “I wasn’t handed a house. My kids weren’t handed their houses. When I hear people saying it’s a basic human right to have a house, and the Government should be building more houses for people, and it should be beside the mammy. I don’t agree with that.” Immigration is mentioned, but more sporadically than in the summer. “We have loads of immigrants coming in, and they lose their passports between getting off the plane and arriving. I think that they should be sent back to wherever they came from,” the man in Kimmage tells Ahern and Bacik. He says he has no trouble with people arriving who are willing to work in Ireland. They tell him Labour is the party of work and have proposals to ensure that all immigrants, including asylum seekers, can be allowed to work. But no one issue is yet dominating, as housing did in 2020. Nor does there seem to be any huge momentum behind any party. Perhaps we are looking at a scenario like the 2007 general election campaign, where after a fortnight of shadow boxing, everything was decided in the last week?

Title: Crypto firm Prometheum gained an edge under Gary Gensler’s SEC. Suddenly its future appears less certain

For years, the crypto industry has complained about the Securities and Exchange Commission’s hard-line stance, and its refusal to develop rules that account for blockchain’s distinct technology. One firm, though, claimed the SEC’s current crypto rules are just fine. This stance has paid off as the firm, Prometheum, won a first-of-its-kind license for crypto-based securities and—despite being virtually unknown in the crypto world—landed a prestigious slot in 2023 to testify about digital assets before Congress. But now Prometheum has a problem. The election of pro-crypto Donald Trump has led SEC Chair Gary Gensler to announce he will quit his position early next year. So now the firm—whose apparent inside track with the regulator appeared to give it an edge—must compete in a world where the rules of the crypto game are shifting dramatically. Most notably, there is an emerging consensus that many cryptocurrencies will not be considered securities when Trump is president. This is different from the current regulatory environment, where SEC’s Gensler has signaled that every token other than Bitcoin is a security, and filed lawsuits that have forced companies to delist popular tokens like Solana and XRP. Since the election, however, firms like Coinbase and Robinhood have re-listed those assets in anticipation of an incoming SEC chair who will not treat those tokens as securities. This is a potential problem for Prometheum since its business model has been based in large part on selling itself as a platform where crypto tokens are securities, and obtaining the legal infrastructure to support that. It’s unclear where this leaves Prometheum, which has attracted widespread derision from crypto figures over its role as Gensler’s model for the industry. Meanwhile, the firm faces an incoming Congress controlled by hostile Republicans, including figures like John Rose (R-Tenn.), who have accused it of having ties to China. Prometheum strongly denies that allegation. In response to questions from Fortune about Prometheum’s future in a post-Gensler world, the firm supplied written answers from Aaron Kaplan, who shares CEO duties with his brother. According to Kaplan, Prometheum has an opportunity to move beyond crypto and use its first-of-its-kind license (known as special purpose broker-dealer) to offer a wide variety of assets, including “equities, debt instruments, structured products, options, ETFs, money market funds” and more in the form of securities on a blockchain. “We expect that President Trump’s administration will oversee this market transformation as trillions of securities are issued on a blockchain, ushering in the benefits that blockchain technology has long promised market participants,” Kaplan wrote. Others are not so sure. Matt Walsh, cofounder of the influential crypto venture capital firm Castle Island who has been an outspoken critic of Prometheum, told Fortune he has seen little in the way of evidence that anyone is using the firm’s platform for real-world trading. And while financial giants like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, alongside crypto native firms like Superstate, are dabbling in tokenized traditional assets, this remains for now a very niche area of finance. In response to a question about whether Prometheum can point to real-world clients or other evidence of gaining traction in the market, Kaplan said the firm is still in “the very early stages” and that it is “actively engaged in discussions with financial institutions.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: From Bitcoin to Altcoins: Crypto Inflows Hit Record $3.1 Billion, Led by Spot ETFs
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/from-bitcoin-to-altcoins-crypto-inflows-hit-record-3-1-billion-led-by-spot-etfs/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T00:30:20Z

The crypto market witnessed a significant milestone last week as investment products recorded roughly $3.13 billion in net inflows globally, primarily driven by US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to data from CoinShares. This surge highlights growing institutional interest and confidence in the crypto market, with Bitcoin leading the charge. CoinShares reveals that the year-to-date net inflows into crypto funds have reached $37 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) soared to a new high of $153 billion. The recent inflows mark the seventh consecutive week of positive movements for global crypto investment products managed by leading firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and ProShares. A substantial portion of last week’s inflows, approximately $2.05 billion, originated from BlackRock’s IBIT product, underlining the dominance of US-based funds in the global space. These inflows outpaced the first-year debut of US gold ETFs, which attracted only $309 million. Bitcoin-based funds were at the forefront of the inflows, contributing $3 billion of the weekly total. This inflow coincided with Bitcoin’s continued price rally, drawing additional interest from institutional and retail investors. However, the higher prices also spurred a notable $10 million inflow into short-Bitcoin products, bringing the monthly figure for these products to $58 million — the highest since August 2022. While Bitcoin dominated, altcoins also attracted significant investment. Solana emerged as the second-most popular asset among institutional investors, with net weekly inflows of $16 million, surpassing Ethereum’s $2.8 million. Other altcoin-based funds also saw notable inflows, with XRP, Litecoin, and Chainlink attracting $15 million, $4.1 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. These inflows suggest growing confidence in the broader altcoin market, driven by price rallies and increasing adoption. US-based funds’ dominance was evident in regional fund flows, accounting for $3.2 billion in net weekly inflows. However, this was slightly “offset” by outflows from European markets, including $84 million, $40 million, and $17 million from crypto investment products in Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland, respectively. Despite these regional outflows, the overall trend remains bullish, driven largely by institutional participation in the US market. Notably, CoinShares’s continuous inflows reflect a combination of factors, including the market’s positive sentiment regarding the bull run and the increasing acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a pivotal development. It provides institutional investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to digital assets. As a result, the cryptocurrency market is witnessing a shift toward mainstream adoption, further supported by strong price performance and consistent inflows across various investment products.

Meet Samuel Edyme, Nickname - HIM-buktu. A web3 content writer, journalist, and aspiring trader, Edyme is as versatile as they come. With a knack for words and a nose for trends, he has penned pieces for numerous industry player, including AMBCrypto, Blockchain.News, and Blockchain Reporter, among others. Edyme’s foray into the crypto universe is nothing short of cinematic. His journey began not with a triumphant investment, but with a scam. Yes, a Ponzi scheme that used crypto as payment roped him in. Rather than retreating, he emerged wiser and more determined, channeling his experience into over three years of insightful market analysis. Before becoming the voice of reason in the crypto space, Edyme was the quintessential crypto degen. He aped into anything that promised a quick buck, anything ape-able, learning the ropes the hard way. These hands-on experience through major market events—like the Terra Luna crash, the wave of bankruptcies in crypto firms, the notorious FTX collapse, and even CZ’s arrest—has honed his keen sense of market dynamics. When he isn’t crafting engaging crypto content, you’ll find Edyme backtesting charts, studying both forex and synthetic indices. His dedication to mastering the art of trading is as relentless as his pursuit of the next big story. Away from his screens, he can be found in the gym, airpods in, working out and listening to his favorite artist, NF. Or maybe he’s catching some Z’s or scrolling through Elon Musk’s very own X platform—(oops, another screen activity, my bad…) Well, being an introvert, Edyme thrives in the digital realm, preferring online interaction over offline encounters—(don’t judge, that’s just how he is built). His determination is quite unwavering to be honest, and he embodies the philosophy of continuous improvement, or “kaizen,” striving to be 1% better every day. His mantras, “God knows best” and “Everything is still on track,” reflect his resilient outlook and how he lives his life. In a nutshell, Samuel Edyme was born efficient, driven by ambition, and perhaps a touch fierce. He’s neither artistic nor unrealistic, and certainly not chauvinistic. Think of him as Bruce Willis in a train wreck—unflappable. Edyme is like trading in your car for a jet—bold. He’s the guy who’d ask his boss for a pay cut just to prove a point—(uhhh…). He is like watching your kid take his first steps. Imagine Bill Gates struggling with rent—okay, maybe that’s a stretch, but you get the idea, yeah. Unbelievable? Yes. Inconceivable? Perhaps. Edyme sees himself as a fairly reasonable guy, albeit a bit stubborn. Normal to you is not to him. He is not the one to take the easy road, and why would he? That’s just not the way he roll. He has these favorite lyrics from NF’s “Clouds” that resonate deeply with him: “What you think's probably unfeasible, I've done already a hundredfold.” PS—Edyme is HIM. HIM-buktu. Him-mulation. Him-Kardashian. Himon and Pumba. He even had his DNA tested, and guess what? He’s 100% Him-alayan. Screw it, he ate the opp. Disclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Volatility Amid Strong AI Demand and Growth Opportunities

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system." To prove that "equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth," the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that "market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House." The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank "urges caution" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that "generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage." This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms "building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling." While generative AI might be in the "trough of disillusionment," the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 30% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world-leading GPU designer whose products are powering the artificial intelligence industry. Since the release of ChatGPT to the public, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have gained 730%, making it clear that AI is baked into the firm's hypothesis. The firm's fortunes depend on its ability to not only design the best-performing chips but also to sustainably and predictably ship them in high volumes to customers while keeping margins high. Consequently, any turbulence on either the product design, shipping, or cost control fronts leads to tailwinds for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares. Additionally, the high demand for its chips has meant that big tech is eager to find alternatives. The urgency for alternatives is also making companies design in-house AI chips, such as those from Amazon. As a result, unless NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) maintains its performance edge and logistics capabilities, the firm might see trouble in the future. Polen Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "In a reversal from the past two quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market’s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock’s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (“GenAI”) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.” Overall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Advertisement revenue is key for the firm as it accounted for 96% of its revenue during H1 2024. As a result, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) depends on broader economic health for its revenue as advertisers spend more in a robust economy. Its dominance in the social media industry has allowed the firm to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from $43.9 billion in cash. These resources, in turn, have enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to gain a strong foothold in the AI industry courtesy of its investment in training infrastructure and the Llama foundational AI model. As a result, the firm's hypothesis also depends on its ability to generate profit from its AI investments. On this front, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) offers AI marketing services to advertisers to streamline their operations. Polen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.” Overall META ranks 11th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Envestnet Finalizes $4.5 Billion Go-Private Deal With Bain Capital

Wealth technology provider Envestnet has officially become a private company. The firm announced Monday (Nov. 25) that it had closed its acquisition by affiliates of vehicles managed or advised by Bain Capital, a deal worth roughly $4.5 billion. “This represents an exciting new chapter in Envestnet’s history, paving the way for accelerated growth and building on our position as a leading wealth management platform in the industry,” Jim Fox, Envestnet’s board chair and interim CEO, said in a news release. Added Tom Sipp, Envestnet’s executive vice president: “Together with Bain Capital, Envestnet will continue to deliver on its mission, empowering firms and advisors with the wealth technology and solutions to holistically serve their clients.” The company had announced its plans to go private in July. Also taking part in the deal were Reverence Capital and Norwest, along with BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, Franklin Templeton and State Street Global Advisors. According to the release, Envestnet has $6.5 trillion in platform assets, more than 20 million accounts and serves more than 111,000 financial advisors. The company’s technology, advanced insights and comprehensive solutions are designed to help financial advisors improve business growth, productivity and provide better client outcomes. In other news from the financial advice world, PYMNTS spoke last month with Doug Brown, chief product officer, digital banking at Candescent, about the pressures consumers feel in seeking such advice, with many plagued by a fear of missteps. “The best partner is in fact the local community bank who understands them and their environment better than most,” Brown told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. “There’s been a lot of outreach from both banks and others trying to inform, but what they’re probably doing is creating a little bit more panic than rational help. That’s why consumers are seeking a company they can trust to guide through this.” Credit unions and smaller banks “want to be top of mind with the small businesses and the consumers in the communities they serve,” Brown added. These financial institutions, which have existing relationships with consumers, should be natural financial advisors. But research by PYMNTS Intelligence and NCR Voyix (as Candescent was once known) found that only 57% of customers looked to their banks for financial advice last year. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Workday Inc. (WDAY): Resilient Growth Amid Economic Challenges and Focus on Profit Expansion

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system." To prove that "equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth," the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that "market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House." The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank "urges caution" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that "generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage." This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms "building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling." While generative AI might be in the "trough of disillusionment," the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A group of finance professionals analyzing market trends on their computer screens. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 21% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) is an enterprise-focused software company that provides human resource and financial management software. This exposes the firm to the labor market as HR software typically does well when firms have adequate hiring budgets in a relaxed monetary environment. Consequently, with interest rates in the US just recently coming off of a 24-year high, it's unsurprising that Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY)'s shares are down 4% year-to-date. However, the pent-up potential in the stock due to monetary constraints is also evident through the fact that since the November presidential election, the shares have gained 6.70%. Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) has struggled particularly hard due to increasing costs as it posted operating losses each year between 2021 and 2023. However, improved financial performance can carry significant tailwinds, as was evident following Q2 results when the stock jumped by 12.5% after Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY)'s $2.085 billion revenue and $1.75 in EPS beat analyst estimates of $2.071 billion and $1.65. Polen Capital mentioned Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "We added to several existing positions in the quarter including Adobe, Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), Shopify, MSCI, and Paycom Software. Workday is still growing revenue at a mid-to-high-teens rate, but in recent years, slower macroeconomic growth has made closing deals more challenging. Amidst a pullback, we increased our position as we found the valuation attractive for a well-positioned, recurring revenue business with still strong growth potential. The company also recently stated publicly that it will be focused on expanding profit margins meaningfully over the next five years—something we have expected and are pleased to see.” Overall WDAY ranks 10th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of WDAY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WDAY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Wall Street launches new ways to bet on bitcoin

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time For years, bitcoin won by being boring. Investors weren’t able to do all that much with it besides buy and hold it. But that was precisely why the world’s largest cryptocurrency was valuable. It was a commodity, like gold — or corn. It didn’t get too fancy on its offerings. In fact, bitcoin’s core team of developers has intentionally moved as slowly as possible on everything that touches the base blockchain specifically to avoid breaking things. That’s why many of crypto’s more cavalier coders headed to other blockchains to tinker and do things like build decentralized applications. The approach worked. Traders poured their money into bitcoin not just because it was the OG coin but also because the network was robust and reliable, and they knew what they were getting. As solana reported hack after hack, bitcoin didn’t really change. The asset was volatile, but aside from a major system upgrade that took four years to design and green-light, bitcoin kept its status as the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market cap by sticking to the status quo. But times are changing for the original coin. Developers are increasingly building on bitcoin’s base blockchain in unexpected ways. Wall Street is also decking the coin out with all its familiar trappings such as exchange-traded fund wrappers and allowing traders to hedge positions and make leveraged bets. In January, spot bitcoin ETFs began trading, which opened the door to more mainstream investors. Last week, options on those spot crypto products finally started to go live on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. CBOE Global Markets is also set to list its first cash-settled bitcoin ETF options Dec. 2. Creating this new margin framework around bitcoin means that both retail traders and institutions alike will be able to get more exposure to the asset class relative to how much cash they’re investing. Collectively, the U.S.-issued spot bitcoin funds hold north of $100 billion in assets under management. Last week, they notched their largest weekly inflows on record, totaling more than $3.1 billion. And according to CoinShares, year-to-date net flows are up to $37 billion versus U.S. Gold ETFs, which drew around $309 million in their first year. Nearly half of those flows into the spot bitcoin products took place after U.S. interest rates were cut for the first time in four years in September. Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, told CNBC there has been record high open interest for futures on the CME derivatives exchange, the way most U.S. institutions currently buy bitcoin futures contracts. But a lot of traders have been waiting for options on spot bitcoin ETFs on major exchanges such as the NYSE and Nasdaq, since it enhances liquidity and offers hedging tools. Lunde says that demand for leveraged long exposure to bitcoin and ether is climbing, with VolatilityShares’ BTC exposure hitting new all-time highs. Galaxy Digital’s trading team told CNBC the firm has observed significant volume in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF options, the first to launch on the Nasdaq last week. BlackRock is the largest digital asset manager in the world after it eclipsed Grayscale in August. BlackRock’s bitcoin trust IBIT holds $48.4 billion in bitcoin compared with the $34 billion in its gold trust. Options on IBIT had a blockbuster debut, with 353,716 contracts traded on its first day, according to Galaxy Digital. The firm noted that the previous most active debut of options trading was when Facebook options went live in 2012 and 360,000 contracts changed hands. Galaxy sees notable trading activity extending out to January 2027, roughly halfway into Donald Trump’s administration. On the campaign trail, the president-elect had an about-face on bitcoin and went from criticizing digital assets to making big promises to the crypto industry. Bitcoin is up roughly 40% since Election Day, Nov. 5. “This level of concentrated, long-dated activity reflects investor confidence in the ETF’s long-term growth potential, signaling bullish sentiment for the years ahead,” Galaxy’s trading team told CNBC. Until now, offshore crypto native platforms such as Binance and Deribit have been the main marketplace for bitcoin derivatives trading. Galaxy told CNBC there is a noticeable volatility premium between Deribit, CME and IBIT, which could present arbitrage opportunities among the varying platforms offering derivatives trading. On Friday, more than $9 billion in bitcoin options contracts expire on Deribit, which could lead to greater price volatility as the expiration date approaches. “There’s a ton of leverage in the system right now,” Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, a longtime crypto investor, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Friday. “You look at the funding rates to do crypto in our market, right? The perpetual market, as high as they’ve been, the basis is high,” Novogratz said. “The crypto community is levered to the gills, and so there will be a correction.” Bitcoin was within striking distance of $100,000 on Friday but retrenched over the weekend. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $95,000. MacKenzie Sigalos is a technology reporter for CNBC with a focus on cryptocurrency and fintech. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 12% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52 O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) is an American car parts retailer headquartered in Missouri. The firm sells new and refurbished parts through its stores. It's another stock that has been hit hard by the weak consumer spending environment in the US. Ahead of the November election, O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY)'s shares had gained a modest 23% as consumer demand has remained muted. However, the firm benefits from a diversified income statement that depends on consumers and repair shops. The latter business has helped O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) avoid a sharper stock price downturn. This is because during H1 2024, while the firm's consumer revenue grew by 2.5%, the revenue from parts sold to shops grew by 8.5%. Additionally, there might be pent-up potential built up in the stock that can be released due to robust economic activity. This potential was hinted at when O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY)'s shares gained 6% after the election and are up by 4.3% since then. ClearBridge Investments mentioned O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Skepticism over the consumer has left some high-quality stocks with depressed valuations and allowed us to reduce our consumer discretionary underweight with the addition of O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) and Starbucks. While we have been cautious on retailers for quite some time, auto parts retailer O’Reilly is a best-in-class, high-quality operator with high returns on invested capital and a solid history of consistent execution and sustainable share gain, and it enjoys rational competitive dynamics in the broader industry. In addition, auto parts retailing carries some counter-cyclicality as consumers tend to hold on to their cars longer, requiring more repair and maintenance, during softer economic environments. We think a high-quality franchise like O’Reilly trading at a reasonable valuation in an otherwise expensive market is worth our attention and we initiated a starter position.” Overall ORLY ranks 22nd on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of ORLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system." To prove that "equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth," the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that "market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House." The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank "urges caution" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that "generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage." This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms "building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling." While generative AI might be in the "trough of disillusionment," the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 12% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) is a fitness center operator that operates through franchises and equipment sales. The firm's self-owned stores which it operates under the Planet Fitness brand are its largest source of revenue. These stores accounted for 45% of Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)'s revenue during H1 2024, and they were followed by franchise revenue which accounted for 31% of the firm's sales. Consequently, consumer spending on fitness and Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)'s ability to increase its memberships along with stable operations are the keys to the firm's hypothesis. The firm also depends on the ability to open new stores, which has been constrained lately due to the slowdown in the real estate industry because of high interest rates. Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) is currently seeking to grow revenue by increasing its Classic membership fees, as it hopes to attract more consumers after witnessing growth in the premium Black membership segment. Consequently, membership growth and store expansion can lead to tailwinds or headwinds for the shares. During the Q3 2024 earnings call, Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)'s management shared how retail store closures can play into its store expansion plans. Here is what they said: "We – I read a recent study that said there were about 5,300 closures last year and there will be north of 6,000 closures this year. And we do see that as an opportunity for Planet Fitness and to work in partnership with our franchisees. Our real estate team is engaged with brokers on a very regular basis to have line of sight to where space maybe becoming available and then partnering with our franchisees on that availability where there’s an opportunity to develop a new club. So I think you’re spot on. And we’re seeing the same trends. We know that’s market specific. It’s not in every market, but there’s a lot of space coming online. Overall PLNT ranks 23rd on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of PLNT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLNT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Investors weren't able to do all that much with it besides buy and hold it. But that was precisely why the world's largest cryptocurrency was valuable. It was a commodity, like gold — or corn. It didn't get too fancy on its offerings. In fact, bitcoin's core team of developers has intentionally moved as slowly as possible on everything that touches the base blockchain specifically to avoid breaking things. That's why many of crypto's more cavalier coders headed to other blockchains to tinker and do things like build decentralized applications. The approach worked. Traders poured their money into bitcoin not just because it was the OG coin but also because the network was robust and reliable, and they knew what they were getting. As solana reported hack after hack, bitcoin didn't really change. The asset was volatile, but aside from a major system upgrade that took four years to design and green-light, bitcoin kept its status as the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market cap by sticking to the status quo. But times are changing for the original coin. Developers are increasingly building on bitcoin's base blockchain in unexpected ways. Wall Street is also decking the coin out with all its familiar trappings such as exchange-traded fund wrappers and allowing traders to hedge positions and make leveraged bets. In January, spot bitcoin ETFs began trading, which opened the door to more mainstream investors. Last week, options on those spot crypto products finally started to go live on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. CBOE Global Markets is also set to list its first cash-settled bitcoin ETF options Dec. 2. Creating this new margin framework around bitcoin means that both retail traders and institutions alike will be able to get more exposure to the asset class relative to how much cash they're investing. Collectively, the U.S.-issued spot bitcoin funds hold north of $100 billion in assets under management. Last week, they notched their largest weekly inflows on record, totaling more than $3.1 billion. And according to CoinShares, year-to-date net flows are up to $37 billion versus U.S. Gold ETFs, which drew around $309 million in their first year. Nearly half of those flows into the spot bitcoin products took place after U.S. interest rates were cut for the first time in four years in September. Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, told CNBC there has been record high open interest for futures on the CME derivatives exchange, the way most U.S. institutions currently buy bitcoin futures contracts. But a lot of traders have been waiting for options on spot bitcoin ETFs on major exchanges such as the NYSE and Nasdaq, since it enhances liquidity and offers hedging tools. Lunde says that demand for leveraged long exposure to bitcoin and ether is climbing, with VolatilityShares' BTC exposure hitting new all-time highs. Galaxy Digital's trading team told CNBC the firm has observed significant volume in BlackRock's IBIT ETF options, the first to launch on the Nasdaq last week. BlackRock is the largest digital asset manager in the world after it eclipsed Grayscale in August. BlackRock's bitcoin trust IBIT holds $48.4 billion in bitcoin compared with the $34 billion in its gold trust. Options on IBIT had a blockbuster debut, with 353,716 contracts traded on its first day, according to Galaxy Digital. The firm noted that the previous most active debut of options trading was when Facebook options went live in 2012 and 360,000 contracts changed hands. Galaxy sees notable trading activity extending out to January 2027, roughly halfway into Donald Trump's administration. On the campaign trail, the president-elect had an about-face on bitcoin and went from criticizing digital assets to making big promises to the crypto industry. Bitcoin is up roughly 40% since Election Day, Nov. 5. "This level of concentrated, long-dated activity reflects investor confidence in the ETF's long-term growth potential, signaling bullish sentiment for the years ahead," Galaxy's trading team told CNBC. Until now, offshore crypto native platforms such as Binance and Deribit have been the main marketplace for bitcoin derivatives trading. Galaxy told CNBC there is a noticeable volatility premium between Deribit, CME and IBIT, which could present arbitrage opportunities among the varying platforms offering derivatives trading. On Friday, more than $9 billion in bitcoin options contracts expire on Deribit, which could lead to greater price volatility as the expiration date approaches. "There's a ton of leverage in the system right now," Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, a longtime crypto investor, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday. "You look at the funding rates to do crypto in our market, right? The perpetual market, as high as they've been, the basis is high," Novogratz said. "The crypto community is levered to the gills, and so there will be a correction." Bitcoin was within striking distance of $100,000 on Friday but retrenched over the weekend. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $95,000. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

A historic rally fueled by Trump’s crypto agenda pushes bitcoin to new heights. This is a published version of our weekly Forbes Crypto Confidential newsletter. Sign up here to get Crypto Confidential days earlier free in your inbox. Bitcoin temporarily rose above $99,000 last week. Crypto isn’t just back. It’s booming. Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $99,456.01 on November 22. Major altcoins are rallying too: Solana (SOL) touched $262.93, surpassing its 2021 peak. Behind the surge: The bull run signals rising confidence in crypto’s mainstreaming—and in the market’s belief that Trump’s pro-crypto rhetoric could deliver. When crypto prices spike, so does the risk of theft. Ledger, the Paris-based crypto security firm, is thriving in the chaos. Its flagship hardware wallets, which protect the private keys unlocking digital assets, are selling at unprecedented rates—3x increase in hardware sales during bitcoin’s rally from $68,000 to $98,000 and 3.5x surge in transactions on Ledger Live, its companion app. CEO Pascal Gauthier has grander ambitions: positioning Ledger as a cornerstone of the digital era. In his vision, its devices will be as essential to your online life as a passport is to global travel. Read more. Sources: Forbes Digital Assets, CoinGecko. Prices as of 5:25 p.m. on November 22, 2024. Bitcoin is knocking on $100K’s door, with the market up 90% year to date. But who holds the biggest fortune? Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, recently freed from prison, leads Forbes’ crypto rich list with $61.6 billion. But the real wealth story is Bitcoin’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. At current prices, Satoshi’s estimated holdings—600,000 to 1.1 million BTC—could be worth $106 billion, enough to surpass Bill Gates ($104.9 billion) and claim the 15th spot on the global billionaire rankings.

Profits increase to €4.7m for Persian Restaurants, which runs several outlets Amir Afsar The operator of the first McDonald’s outlet in Ireland, on Dublin’s Grafton Street, last year recorded pre-tax profits of €4.68m. Owned by Amir Afsar, Persian Restaurants Ltd operates a number of McDonald’s restaurants in Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford, including the Grafton Street outlet. New accounts show the company’s revenues increased by 9pc from €48.28m to €52.72m. The pre-tax profit of €4.68m followed a pre-tax loss of €220,497 in 2022. The loss was mainly due to a payout of €5.6m to directors. Pay to directors last year was less than 10pc of the 2022 payout at €531,557, made up of emoluments of €487,000, and €44,557 in pension contributions. Persian Restaurants also operates McDonald’s at the Nutgrove Shopping Centre, in Rathfarnham, and the Frascati Shopping Centre, in Blackrock. The Grafton Street outlet is the country’s oldest McDonald’s. It opened in 1977. The company last year recorded post-tax profits of €4.07m after incurring a corporation tax charge of €614,737. The profit last year takes account of non-cash depreciation costs of €1.24m. At the end of December, accumulated profits at the company totalled €19.59m, and the company had cash of €19m. Another McDonald’s franchisee, Elaine Sterio, operates five McDonald’s restaurants in the Co Louth and north Dublin areas. The most recent accounts for Ms Sterio’s Glenellen Restaurants Ltd show its revenues increased from €21.52m to €24.68m in 2022. Ms Sterio started working for McDonald’s in 1989 while studying. Pre-tax profits at Glenellen Restaurants in 2022 decreased by 20pc from €1.47m to €1.16m. Numbers employed decreased from 342 to 320 as staff costs increased from €7.05m to €7.7m. McDonald’s is currently embarking on a €40m expansion plan for Ireland, which will create 1,000 jobs here over the next four years. It now has 95 restaurants here, all of which are operated by franchisees. McDonald’s invested €42m between 2018 and 2023 in Ireland. This included the refurbishment of existing outlets and the opening of new restaurants. As part of the investment, McDonald’s currently has two planning applications before Tipperary Co Council and Wexford Co Council, for new restaurants. A number of locals in Thurles, Co Tipperary, are objecting to McDonald’s Ireland constructing a new drive-thru fast-food restaurant for Thurles, on health grounds. In one objection, Ronan Spain, of Carraig Donn, Clongour, Thurles, told the council: “As a father of two young children, I object to the development of a fast-food restaurant on health grounds, particularly as we are in the midst of an obesity crisis in this country, where one in five children aged under five is obese, according to a study referenced on the HSE website on October 10th 2024.” The council has placed the application but the only item the planning authority has sought further information from concerns a traffic issue. McDonald’s is to provide an assessment of traffic queuing at the drive-thru. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Tether was an outlaw for years. Now the $132 billion stablecoin has a key ally in Trump’s Cabinet
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/11/25/commerce-nominee-howard-lutnick-tether-booster-cantor-fitzgerald/
Time Published: 2024-11-25T18:01:47Z
Full Content:
For a decade, the crypto firm Tether built itself into one of the world’s wealthiest financial institutions, recently surpassing even mighty BlackRock in profits. Today, Tether’s eponymous stablecoin, a digital token pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, is one of the world’s major currencies, and the company, which has long operated in the financial shadows, is making a play for mainstream legitimacy. Now, thanks to a mix of sound strategy or good luck, Tether has a key ally in the highest corridors of power: Howard Lutnick, CEO of U.S. financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, and President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for commerce secretary. Cantor Fitzgerald serves as the main custodian for Tether’s U.S. Treasury bills, which are the primary asset backing Tether’s stablecoin. Lutnick—who rebuilt Cantor Fitzgerald after 658 of its employees died on 9/11—has been touting Tether in TV appearances and recently bought a 5% ownership stake in the crypto firm, according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal. But with Tether facing a reported probe from the Justice and Treasury departments into possible money laundering violations, which the company has denied, critics warn Tether—whose founder is an Italian former plastic surgeon—may have undue influence at the highest levels of the U.S. government. “The first concern is any potential conflicts with the existing engagements that [Lutnick] has,” Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told Fortune. “It’s hard to imagine him remaining engaged in the way he is now and serving as commerce secretary.” To address this conflict of interest, Lutnick reportedly plans to hand over Cantor Fitzgerald’s relationship with Tether to his colleagues and to his son, who interned with the crypto firm. A spokesperson for the Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Tether has long been one of the most powerful—and scrutinized—companies in crypto, thanks to its ubiquitous stablecoin, which is used for global trading and as a financial hedge for people without access to the dollar. As a result of its offshore operations and often opaque business practices, Tether has also faced scrutiny about the integrity of its reserves, and its popularity with drug traffickers and terrorism financiers. Tether has been subject to enforcement actions as well, including by the New York attorney general and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and is reportedly facing a probe by the Justice and Treasury Departments. Tether has denied it is complicit in illegal activities, and touted its work with law enforcement agencies and blockchain analytics firms such as TRM Labs. In the past, a big source of mistrust around Tether has been its reliance on little-known banks as partners, including the Bahamian Deltec, to manage the reserve of dollars and Treasury bills that are intended to keep its stablecoin pegged to $1. For this reason, its relationship with New York–based Cantor Fitzgerald, which Lutnick first disclosed in a December 2023 podcast, has been a key boost. “I’m a big fan of this stablecoin called Tether,” he said at the time. Lutnick has since boosted the company’s work at crypto conferences. According to the Wall Street Journal, the two firms began working together in late 2021. The alliance between Cantor Fitzgerald and Tether is growing closer. In addition to the former’s ownership stake, the Wall Street firm is reportedly planning a Bitcoin lending program. Along with his work at Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick served as one of Trump’s economic advisors during his 2024 presidential campaign, later leading transition efforts. Lutnick was in the running for the Treasury secretary position until last week, when he was named as Trump’s nominee for commerce instead. A Treasury appointment would have created more conflict over Lutnick’s relationship with Tether, owing to the department’s reported probe into the company as well as the fact that Treasury is a much more influential department than commerce. Nonetheless, House, the Columbia professor, warns that any cabinet position will hold substantial influence in the White House, in part owing to access to privileged information and overlapping regulatory frameworks. Stablecoin legislation is set to be a policy priority for the Republican-controlled Congress during the next session. “If the diversion from consideration of Mr. Lutnick for Treasury secretary to commerce secretary is being posited as a way to reduce or weaken concerns about conflict of interest, I think that is misguided,” House said. “Because those concerns will remain regardless of the type of cabinet-level role one would take.” He added that it is common for business executives to take on cabinet positions, but that any possible conflicts should be reviewed during the confirmation process. Despite Lutnick’s assurances that he will step down from Cantor and divest himself of any interests, investors seem to be reacting to Tether’s growing prospects, with its market cap growing by nearly $15 billion since the presidential election. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Renewable Energy Penny Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS) stands against the other renewable energy penny stocks. On November 11, the Financial Times reported that the U.S. clean energy industry faces a significant setback following Donald Trump’s election victory. The article highlights that several developers have halted projects, and investors are selling shares due to uncertainties about policy direction and federal funding under the incoming Trump administration. According to Mike Carr, president of Solar Energy Manufacturers for America, approximately half a dozen clean energy projects are awaiting policy certainty before proceeding. Trump’s election, combined with the prospect of a Republican-controlled Congress, has led to a sharp decline in renewable energy stocks. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF dropped 7% after the election. Additionally, short sellers of renewable energy stocks reportedly profited over $1 billion in the aftermath. Despite the turbulence, some industry leaders and analysts remain cautiously optimistic, suggesting that the economic case for renewable projects could persist under a Trump administration. They also believe that existing tax credits for power generation and manufacturing may remain intact. However, they warn that sectors such as offshore wind and electric vehicles may face significant challenges. Trump has pledged to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, a major driver of U.S. clean energy investment, and vowed to expand oil and gas production while halting offshore wind projects and EV mandates. Biden’s target to reduce emissions by 50-52% from 2005 levels by 2030 is at risk under a second Trump term. Such a shift could result in an additional 500 million tonnes of carbon emissions in the energy sector by the end of the decade. While uncertainties loom over the renewable energy sector, the industry continues to demonstrate resilience. According to a report by Rhodium Group, a New York-based research institute, the renewable energy and transportation investment in the United States has continued to break records, reaching a new high of $71 billion in the third quarter of 2024. This marks a 12% increase from the same period in 2023 and a nearly unbroken quarter-on-quarter growth trend over the past three years. The report highlights that renewable investment accounted for 5% of total US private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods, up from 4.5% in the third quarter of 2023. Retail investment was a major driver of this growth, increasing by 9% relative to the previous quarter, largely due to a surge in zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales. However, investment in renewable technology manufacturing remained flat quarter-on-quarter, while investment in deploying technology to decarbonize energy and industrial production slipped 7% quarter-on-quarter. The report also assessed the progress of the US renewable electricity transition and found that the current pace of capacity expansion is falling short of what is needed to deliver a 40% reduction in net GHG emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. The analysis of projects in the pipeline suggests that both solar and wind are underperforming, aligning more closely with a scenario that would yield only a 30% reduction by 2030. Despite the challenges and uncertainties facing the renewable energy sector, the industry's resilience and potential for growth remain evident. With that in context, let's take a look at the 10 best renewable energy penny stocks to invest in. Our Methodology To compile our list of the 10 best renewable energy penny stocks to invest in, we used clean energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 renewable energy stocks trading below $5 as of November 22. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 10 stocks according to their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from the database of 900 elite hedge funds as of Q3 of 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

However, the company’s net loss was recorded at $300,000 compared to $9.8 million during the prior-year period, which indicates a potential recovery trend. The company’s gross profit percentage came at 24.8% compared to 10.5% in the prior-year period. This increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to the decrease in wire insulation shrinkback expenses. As of September 30, Shoals Technologies’ (NASDAQ:SHLS) has a backlog and awarded orders totaling $596.6 million. Shoals Technologies (NASDAQ:SHLS) has introduced a variety of innovative products designed to optimize solar and electric vehicle (EV) installations.

The company’s patented connectors and wire harnesses with in-line fuses also provide a cost-effective solution for solar installations. Overall SHLS ranks 1st on our list of the best renewable energy penny stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SHLS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Additionally, revenue rose to $105 million, reflecting a 9% increase from $96 million in Q3 2023. A key driver of Clean Energy Fuels Corp.’s (NASDAQ:CLNE) success is its expanding fueling network. Over the past year, the company has grown its network by nearly 15%, including the addition of a new station for Amazon in New Jersey. This strategic expansion is expected to attract more customers and boost fuel volumes. The launch of the Cummins X15N engine, a 15-liter natural gas engine built to match the performance and reliability of its diesel counterpart, is another catalyst for growth, with major fleets such as JB Hunt and UPS already providing positive feedback.

Title: Why Photographers Should Understand Bitcoin

Do you remember Kodak brownies and the like? Obviously digital photograph absolutely crushed Kodak, even though ironically Kodak I think made the first digital camera? Also, the very foolish and shortsighted thing that conducted; she almost self sabotage herself by kind of trying to kill off her own digital camera, concerned that we would eat into the profits of her film business. A similar insight; Steve Jobs, upon unleashing the iPhone, obviously he knew that it was going to eat into the iPod iPod touch market, but obviously it was the right step forward. This is a book that apparently Steve Jobs recommended everyone to read. The general idea is that the paradox and difficulty that innovator’s face is that in order to innovate something new, you kind of need to kill your own business, even have the courage to self cannibalize if necessary. So for example, I think Ford has done a decent job at this semi trying to get into the electric car market, instead of just hoarding her gas guzzler cars. But the difficulty of a Ford or any other car company is that because they did not start off 100% carte blanche electric, they’re never going to catch up to Tesla, Do you remember in the early days of Tesla, in which the evaluation was far greater than that of any major car company and everyone thought that it was insanely overvalued? Who is laughing now? So a book that nobody knows about is the mobile wave by Michael Saylor; in which he accurately predicts that mobile phones, mobile technology, all the big magnificent seven companies to take over the world. He predicted the success of Amazon Facebook Twitter Google and Apple before anyone really took notice. In fact I recommend everyone to read them all way, because it shows the inside that Michael Saylor is not new to the game; he’s been in the game for a long time, over 30 years. Apparently he has seen his stock drop to an ALL TIME LOW of $.20, And now it is currently in the mid 400s. So I guess I was right all along about bitcoin, ever since I bought like 2.2 bitcoins or 2.4 bitcoins for about 20,000 or $25,000, back in 2018 when bitcoin was only around $6000-$7000 a coin. ￼ sing that we’re about to have the hundred K party, I’ve almost I guess like 12 or 13 X ‘d my initial prediction? Anyways, if you’re right about bitcoin and was right about bitcoin… And no no no bitcoin is not gonna drop down to like 60,000 or 30,000, that does not how engineering works. For people who think that bitcoin is risky, ask people… Is it risky to cross the bridge or go on a flight? No. Why? Things were engineered that way! With bitcoin, you’re not gonna have all these people who you’re trying to proselytize turn around and tell you that you were right, and shower you with good news. No no no, they might either feel low-key envious or jealous of you, and won’t probably really say much. This is also why I don’t really tell people about bitcoin too much if they don’t seem like they have a strong need for it; for example my uncle who’s worked in the jewelry business for like over 30 years, he wants to retire, and I’m kind of in the process of helping him Sell his gold and his other reserves and stuff, in order to buy bitcoin. Even he at the age of 64, being a gold jeweler for like over 30 years know that bitcoin is the future. But his issues that he cannot stomach the volatility, he says it is like drugs, “mah-yyak”– when I was with him last I just set him up with Coinbase, and just bought the daily maximum for his account which was $3500, I think we bought windows around $65,000 a coin, and already it’s like $99,000 a coin. But once again, I think the difficult thing with bitcoin is that like is probably the most addictive crack cocaine on the planet, because it is being traded 24 7, it is extremely volatile because volatility is vitality. Anything that is allowed to trade every single waking moment, on weekends as well as the evenings, and also bank holidays, is going to have more volatility because people are just bored at home, they cannot play the traditional market so they’re going to just try to buy and sell bitcoin, do some sort of weird options trading to try to squeeze a few bucks here and there.￼ I was randomly think about Peter Thiel and his zero to one book; I think if you thought about bitcoin like a year or two ago, you might’ve seen that are artificial intelligence in AI was the right bet. But no, it is most certainly bitcoin. Why? Assuming that the world runs on money, and bitcoin is perfect money, it is like maybe 80 to 90% the solution to the problems of humanity. For example, what are the greatest bad things that happened to humans? It mostly has to deal with financial distress. I almost wonder people who get addicted to gambling, drugs, cycles of poverty is because the money right now the fiat currency is toxic. You cannot blame somebody for remaining sick if they only have a sewer water to drink, and they have kids and are also forced to feed their kids sewer water. It doesn’t matter how smart hard-working or intelligent you are, as long as you’re drinking sore water, you’re going to perpetually be sick, throwing up, permanently infected with cholera. So you know you have all these Crusades on the Internet and charity is talking about providing clean water to like poor kids in Africa? I think the same thing with bitcoin– it is like the chance to give clean water to 8 billion people on the planet. Except instead of water, it is clean money. Nontoxic money. It matters if you’re at church a nonprofit a charity, mother Teresa Gandhi etc. Matters if you’re at school, a parent organization, if you have kids you’re single own a dog whatever. Ultimately you’re going to have to pay the rent, pay your mortgage, or pay property taxes. I don’t think there is anyone spot on the planet in which you cannot live or survive without money a banking account or Notes. Even all these weirdos who try to buy a $200,000 AMG sprinter van and live off the grid with star Link or whatever, you still need money, and sooner or later you’re going to have to need some sort of semi permanent address, ideally your mom‘s house or your wife’s family‘s house or something. Because for the most part if you’re American, at this point you cannot really survive without having a single address for doing taxes and stuff. And I also think that now, unfortunately you also need a cell phone number, or else you cannot even apply for basic stuff, because you’re going to have to get the one time password authentication code codes texted to your phone. Anyways, it’s gonna be a big deal once Apple integrate bitcoin into her iCloud ecosystem. This is actually a very very big opportunity for Apple; the head of security, on the planet and privacy… If Apple were able to provide security to your bitcoin or your keys or whatever, Wooden apple being in some way is the best custodian? Even better yet… We already have our bank of counseling to Apple Pay. Wouldn’t it just makes sense for you to buy bitcoin directly on an iPhone using Apple Pay, and store it on your iPhone and or iCloud Apple ID account? For people who don’t trust the cloud I get it, but still… For all practical purposes I think the cloud is like 1 trillion times safer than cold storage options. For example even me, all my photos are backed up to dropbox, Google Drive and Apple photos. Even worst case scenario all my photos get deleted, it’s OK I could start again! I think especially with Apple Apple ID Face ID touch print thumb ID, it’s almost the most logical way to feel secure with your bitcoin. Larry Fink, CEO Blackrock, even Michael Saylor. ￼ even Donald Trump!￼ When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

But no, it is most certainly bitcoin. Why? Assuming that the world runs on money, and bitcoin is perfect money, it is like maybe 80 to 90% the solution to the problems of humanity. For example, what are the greatest bad things that happened to humans? It mostly has to deal with financial distress. I almost wonder people who get addicted to gambling, drugs, cycles of poverty is because the money right now the fiat currency is toxic. You cannot blame somebody for remaining sick if they only have a sewer water to drink, and they have kids and are also forced to feed their kids sewer water. It doesn’t matter how smart hard-working or intelligent you are, as long as you’re drinking sore water, you’re going to perpetually be sick, throwing up, permanently infected with cholera. So you know you have all these Crusades on the Internet and charity is talking about providing clean water to like poor kids in Africa? I think the same thing with bitcoin– it is like the chance to give clean water to 8 billion people on the planet. Except instead of water, it is clean money. Nontoxic money. It matters if you’re at church a nonprofit a charity, mother Teresa Gandhi etc. Matters if you’re at school, a parent organization, if you have kids you’re single own a dog whatever. Ultimately you’re going to have to pay the rent, pay your mortgage, or pay property taxes. I don’t think there is anyone spot on the planet in which you cannot live or survive without money a banking account or Notes. Even all these weirdos who try to buy a $200,000 AMG sprinter van and live off the grid with star Link or whatever, you still need money, and sooner or later you’re going to have to need some sort of semi permanent address, ideally your mom‘s house or your wife’s family‘s house or something. Because for the most part if you’re American, at this point you cannot really survive without having a single address for doing taxes and stuff. And I also think that now, unfortunately you also need a cell phone number, or else you cannot even apply for basic stuff, because you’re going to have to get the one time password authentication code codes texted to your phone. Anyways, it’s gonna be a big deal once Apple integrate bitcoin into her iCloud ecosystem. This is actually a very very big opportunity for Apple; the head of security, on the planet and privacy… If Apple were able to provide security to your bitcoin or your keys or whatever, Wooden apple being in some way is the best custodian? Even better yet… We already have our bank of counseling to Apple Pay. Wouldn’t it just makes sense for you to buy bitcoin directly on an iPhone using Apple Pay, and store it on your iPhone and or iCloud Apple ID account? For people who don’t trust the cloud I get it, but still… For all practical purposes I think the cloud is like 1 trillion times safer than cold storage options. For example even me, all my photos are backed up to dropbox, Google Drive and Apple photos. Even worst case scenario all my photos get deleted, it’s OK I could start again! I think especially with Apple Apple ID Face ID touch print thumb ID, it’s almost the most logical way to feel secure with your bitcoin. Larry Fink, CEO Blackrock, even Michael Saylor. ￼ even Donald Trump!￼ When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/25/2024 6:45:04 AM PST by MtnClimber "If these people had to be honest, it would all be over." -- Mike Benz. “Now that our cheques are bouncing and we are starting to default on our debts, our entire civilization appears to be manifesting suicidal behavior in an effort to control the firing squad.” — Luke Dodson. “Joe Biden” is feeling blue. Not a joke. In the lurid sunset of his dwindling term-in-office, the long shadow of his legacy points toward a gigantic glowing cinder where North America used to be. Such are the grievances of the outgoing president. I pass unto you and your legions of white supremacist slobs the ashtray that was once our mighty nation. Fix that! But, as Sir Mick Jagger observed some time ago: you can’t always get what you want. “Joe Biden,” in despair, sinks deeper into his McTeer power recliner and slips back into the bitter dream of his nemesis, a beast named Chrump. . . . It’s such a chewy name: Chrump, a fricative fiesta! The tongue briefly presses against the alveolar ridge before releasing, then curls back, and the jaw opens slightly to form this vowel sound, the lips close to let the sound resonate nasally before releasing air. Chrump Chrump Chrump. Like, what your mouth would feel like working through a bowl of Froot Loops. So satisfying! The outgoing Party of Chaos can’t stop chanting it on the cable news networks, as if trying to invoke the ancient furies, ghastly, terrifying figures with snakes for hair, dogs' heads, blood-red eyes, and bat-wings, brandishing torches and scourges to mortify their enemy. Otherwise, fantasy aside, they are in paralysis as this enemy, Mr. Trump, marshals his pieces on the gameboard: Musk, Vivek, Bobby Jr, Tulsi, Bondi, Hegseth . . . . Ay-yeeeeee! They are coming to get us. . . . Somebody. . . do something. . . ! Okay, then, who, exactly, in the shadows behind the half-conscious ghoul in the White House, thinks that now is a great time to commence an ATACMS (Attack’ems) missile barrage on Russia as the very thing to salvage our Ukraine project? You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 11/25/2024 6:45:04 AM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber It sure looks like Biden is trying to leave the Donald a little gift of WWIII to deal with so that he won’t have any time to make America great again or any of that nonsense. 2 posted on 11/25/2024 6:46:16 AM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

Too bad after the fall of the USSR we didn't just invite Russia to join NATO ... much saner solution than to have our CIA decide MAGA and Russians are 'the enemy'... Think what a horror it would have been if we treated Japan and Germany the same way after World WarII.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

Okay, then, who, exactly, in the shadows behind the half-conscious ghoul in the White House, thinks that now is a great time to commence an ATACMS (Attack’ems) missile barrage on Russia as the very thing to salvage our Ukraine project? You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 11/25/2024 6:45:04 AM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber It sure looks like Biden is trying to leave the Donald a little gift of WWIII to deal with so that he won’t have any time to make America great again or any of that nonsense. 2 posted on 11/25/2024 6:46:16 AM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows.

It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict.

Ay-yeeeeee! They are coming to get us. . . . Somebody. . . do something. . . ! Okay, then, who, exactly, in the shadows behind the half-conscious ghoul in the White House, thinks that now is a great time to commence an ATACMS (Attack’ems) missile barrage on Russia as the very thing to salvage our Ukraine project? You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be.

You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 11/25/2024 6:45:04 AM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber It sure looks like Biden is trying to leave the Donald a little gift of WWIII to deal with so that he won’t have any time to make America great again or any of that nonsense. 2 posted on 11/25/2024 6:46:16 AM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 11/25/2024 6:45:04 AM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber It sure looks like Biden is trying to leave the Donald a little gift of WWIII to deal with so that he won’t have any time to make America great again or any of that nonsense. 2 posted on 11/25/2024 6:46:16 AM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces.

Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations.

There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Beverage Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against best beverage stocks that pay dividends. Retail sales rebounded significantly in October as the economy remained stable and consumers overcame worries about a port strike and other challenges that had dampened sales in September, according to the CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor. NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay noted that consumer spending picked up again in October, supported by job growth and increased wages throughout the year. He observed that inflation remained largely confined to services, with prices for some retail goods even declining. Shay indicated that October’s sales performance had laid a solid foundation for the holiday shopping season to begin on a positive note. When we examine specific sectors, we see that grocery and beverage stores experienced a 0.87% increase on a seasonally adjusted month-over-month basis and a 3.76% rise year-over-year without seasonal adjustments. The food and beverage industry faced significant challenges during the pandemic. While in-home consumption surged, out-of-home dining virtually ceased, leading to a substantial decline in business and severely impacting the sector. Since then, the industry has undergone numerous transformations and is now in a recovery phase. According to a Market Research report, the global food and beverages market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% between 2022 and 2027. The market's growth is being driven by shifting consumer habits, out-of-town retail parks, and retail stores. READ ALSO: 7 Best Beverage Stocks that Pay Dividends Coffee remains the most popular beverage among Americans. In 2023, spending on out-of-home cold coffee, such as iced coffee, cold brew, and frozen coffee drinks, reached $17.7 billion—more than double the $8.5 billion spent in 2016, according to the food service research firm Technomic. Additionally, the National Coffee Association (NCA) reported that coffee consumption outside the home has returned to pre-pandemic levels as people resume visiting coffee shops and workplaces. Over a third of consumers who drank coffee on a given day did so away from home, marking the highest rate since January 2020, as highlighted in the NCA's National Coffee Data Trends report. Consumer behavior plays a critical role in shaping any industry, and the beverage sector is no exception. This industry is adapting to evolving preferences, with more Americans seeking alternatives to alcohol. Beverage companies emphasizing the health benefits of their products are striving to tap into this trend. According to data insights firm NCSolutions, over 40% of Americans aim to reduce their alcohol consumption in 2024, an increase from 34% the previous year. Among Generation Z, this figure rises to 61%, compared to 40% in 2023 who expressed similar intentions. Technology stocks have been the standout performers this year, with gains of nearly 29%. While food and beverage stocks haven't seen exceptional growth, the Food & Beverage index, which represents companies across various sub-industries in the sector, has still delivered a modest year-to-date return of 7.5%. Over the past 12 months, the index has risen by approximately 14%. Pixabay/Public Domain To select the best beverage stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked companies that are primarily involved in the production and distribution of a wide variety of liquid refreshments, including soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, coffee, tea, bottled water, energy drinks, fruit juices, sports and nutritional drinks, and dairy-based beverages. From that list, we selected 10 companies that pay dividends to shareholders and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69 Warren Buffett's favorite, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ranks second on our list of the best beverage stocks that pay dividends. The American multinational beverage company is well-known to consumers, offering a diverse range of drink brands and maintaining a global presence. The company's greatest competitive advantage is its strong brand, which creates an economic moat, helping it stand out from competitors in the industry. In addition to its long history of providing a consistent product, it has developed exceptional marketing expertise, ensuring the brand remains prominent and top-of-mind for consumers. The stock has delivered a nearly 7% return to shareholders since the start of 2024. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) generated nearly $12 billion in revenues in the third quarter of 2024, which beat analysts' consensus by $290 million. The company's cash performance was also strong as it generated $2.9 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter and its free cash flow came in at $1.6 billion. Its adjusted operating margin reached an impressive 30.7% in Q3, reflecting a highly profitable business model. This consistent profitability has directly benefited shareholders, as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has increased its dividend for an astounding 62 consecutive years. It’s rare for investors to find companies with such an exceptional history of returning excess profits to shareholders. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.485 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.04%, as recorded on November 24. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, 69 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), up from 68 in the previous quarter. These stakes are valued at nearly $35 billion in total. With 400 million shares, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake in the company. Overall, KO ranks 2nd on our list of best beverage dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for KO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Putin Is Throwing Human Waves at Ukraine, But Can’t Do It Forever

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/25/2024 4:46:13 AM PST by Timber Rattler One of the bleakest places on Earth today is the central processing facility for the remains of dead soldiers in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, the logistical hub of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Designed to process hundreds of corpses at a time, this sprawling mega-morgue has been hopelessly overwhelmed for many months. Footage from the inside, posted by witnesses on social media, shows hundreds of bodies in various stages of decomposition and limbs strewn across the corridor floors. In wooden boxes lining the walls from floor to ceiling, row after row after row, are the lucky ones: those whose bodies were recovered from the battlefield, identified, sealed in zinc-lined caskets, and prepared for dispatch to their grieving relatives in the farthest corners of Russia. Many more corpses have been abandoned to rot in Ukrainian fields because evacuating them is impractical under the constant barrage of the defenders’ artillery and drones. To be sure: These soldiers’ deaths are the necessary consequence of Ukraine’s right to defend itself against an illegal war of conquest. What’s more, many of these ordinary Russian soldiers likely committed despicable brutality and war crimes against Ukrainians, including defenseless civilians. But the horrific rate at which Russians are getting killed at the front—much higher than corresponding Ukrainian losses, although exact numbers are kept secret by both sides—points to two disturbing truths about the Russian way of waging war. First, a cruel disregard for human life extends to Russia’s own forces, which the Kremlin systematically deploys in so-called meat grinder and human-wave attacks. Second, mass death among Russian troops has become part of an increasingly explicit eugenics policy, by which the Kremlin seeks to rid Russia of undesirable elements and reconfigure the Russian population.

There seems to be no, none, nada real pushback on it. With reference to kickback, I would say it could be deemed positive in that it drives a bit of controversy, a sense of them/us, that drives daily content, replies, traffic. My problem with that is that if true, it also drives annoyance and ultimately less traffic. Like all the election spam, texts, ads, emails prior to 11/5, I would have hoped that post election the Uke spam would also die down. It seems like they’ve doubled down instead, and have upped the quantity. 17 posted on 11/25/2024 5:20:06 AM PST by C210N (Mundus vult decipi, ergo decipiatur.)

What’s more, many of these ordinary Russian soldiers likely committed despicable brutality and war crimes against Ukrainians, including defenseless civilians. But the horrific rate at which Russians are getting killed at the front—much higher than corresponding Ukrainian losses, although exact numbers are kept secret by both sides—points to two disturbing truths about the Russian way of waging war. First, a cruel disregard for human life extends to Russia’s own forces, which the Kremlin systematically deploys in so-called meat grinder and human-wave attacks. Second, mass death among Russian troops has become part of an increasingly explicit eugenics policy, by which the Kremlin seeks to rid Russia of undesirable elements and reconfigure the Russian population.

I’m starting to think FR is on the Zelinski kickback list for allowing so much of this crap to be posted. The Neocons’ gambit to break Russia at the cost of the Ukes thus paving the way for their friends at Blackrock to pocket the mineral wealth, farmland, etc has failed. They’ve spent huge amounts of money, they’ve wrecked the economies of Western European countries and they’ve solidified a Russa-China-Iran-North Korea alliance against the West. The West is left in a massively weaker position than it was in before they started all this with the meddling in Ukraine, the color revolutions, etc 😂😂😅😅 The zeeperville village idiot has reported that Putin has risen from the dead once again. Hallelujah !!! I guess the Russians don’t have an air power doctrine. Oh well…. bkmk The thought of how freely all this spam is coming at us has led me to similar thoughts. There seems to be no, none, nada real pushback on it. With reference to kickback, I would say it could be deemed positive in that it drives a bit of controversy, a sense of them/us, that drives daily content, replies, traffic. My problem with that is that if true, it also drives annoyance and ultimately less traffic.

Title: Is Uber Technologies (UBER) the Best Stock to Invest in for the Next 3 Months?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months. On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the “Trump trade,” which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies. Despite the current market momentum, the bank’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally. First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms. Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump’s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers. Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration’s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services. Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

In an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil. Marks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies. Marks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced. On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump’s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes. The financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.

The company has revolutionized urban mobility, offering convenient and affordable solutions for millions of users. The company’s diversified revenue streams, including Uber Eats and Uber Freight, make it a key player in the future of transportation and delivery services. On October 31, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) announced financial results for the third quarter, which ended on September 30. The company’s revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $11.2 billion. Whereas, Gross Bookings increased 16% year-over-year to $41.0 billion, with trips during the quarter growing 17% year-over-year to 2.9 billion, or approximately 31 million trips per day on average. Looking ahead to Q4, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has issued an optimistic outlook, reflecting strong growth prospects. The company projects Gross Bookings to range between $42.75 billion and $44.25 billion, representing a year-over-year (YoY) increase of 16% to 20%. This growth is expected to be fueled by sustained momentum in both its Mobility and Delivery segments, with trip growth anticipated to mirror the performance observed in Q3. Overall, UBER ranks 9th on our list of best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.

Title: Investing with a clear conscience: How should Catholics manage their money?
URL: https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/260641/investing-with-a-clear-conscience-how-should-catholics-manage-their-money
Time Published: 2024-11-25T11:00:00Z

By Jonah McKeown CNA Staff, Nov 25, 2024 / 06:00 am In today’s complex society, it takes effort to ensure that your hard-earned money, once invested and out in the financial ether, doesn’t fund the kinds of things that Catholics abhor — like abortion, pornography, or unethical labor practices. But surely the Church itself, with its significant invested assets, has this figured out already… right? Though the principles behind Catholic investing have been clearly articulated in recent years, sources told CNA that many Catholic entities still have a long way to go to make sure their investments actually align with those principles. Case in point: when Daniel Catone, founder of Arimathea Investing, and his team of financial experts started digging into the finances of Catholic entities who approached them, they discovered something extraordinary — and surprisingly pervasive. Nearly all of their Catholic clients, including many U.S. dioceses, were unwittingly funding — sometimes to the tune of millions of dollars — products and practices that directly contradict the faith. “We have to look at the reality of the choices that we’re making with our dollars, [because] just as Our Lord will call us to account for every careless word that comes from our mouths, so too will the Lord call us to account for every careless dollar that left our wallets,” Catone told CNA. Arimathea is just one of a growing number of Catholic firms seeking to help individuals, ministries, and dioceses align their investment portfolios with the teachings of the Catholic Church, all while seeking competitive financial returns. The Church has weighed in quite comprehensively — and quite recently — on the topic of investing, both at the level of the bishops of the United States in 2021 and at the worldwide level with the 2022 Vatican document Mensuram Bonam. Mensuram Bonam — the title of which means “a good measure” — casts a wide net, exhorting investors to consider the ethics and consequences of their actions, especially how their investment choices will affect the world’s most vulnerable. It emphasizes that Catholic investors should seek not only to avoid harm but also actively promote good. The document identifies a set of core principles for investors rooted in Catholic social teaching. The principles include the recognition of the dignity of every human being; promoting the common good; working in solidarity with the most vulnerable; caring for the environment; and subsidiarity — the idea that decision-making should be done at the most appropriate level. The guidelines also lay out specific exclusionary criteria that Catholic investors need to be aware of and screen for. These include the funding of abortion, armaments, nuclear weapons, contraceptives, embryonic stem cell research, pornography, addictive substances, human rights violations such as breaches of labor laws, corruption, and unfair business practices. The development of Mensuram Bonam was prompted, in part, by a controversy in recent years over the Vatican’s own investments. In April 2021, an Italian investigative news program accused the Vatican’s treasury of investing 20 million euros (then around $24 million) in several pharmaceutical companies involved in making emergency contraception, or the “morning-after pill.” A subsequent 2022 policy was drawn up mandating that the Holy See’s financial investments cannot contradict Catholic teaching. The U.S. Catholic bishops’ “Socially Responsible Investment Guidelines,” released in 2021, applies to the U.S. investment landscape many similar concepts found within the latter-written Mensuram Bonam. (Story continues below) The bishops urge the importance of discerning whether investments will protect human life, which means avoiding any company involved in abortion, euthanasia, and assisted suicide, embryonic stem cell research, human cloning, and other practices the Church teaches to be evil. At the same time, investors must endeavor to promote human dignity and the common good, the bishops wrote. This means Catholic investors should avoid companies known to persistently violate the human rights of their workers or who operate in countries with poor human rights records. Companies with ties to pornography, human trafficking, or a non-Catholic view of gender identity and expression should be avoided, the bishops noted. This also means eschewing investments in certain “harmful habitual behaviors” and “addictive materials” such as gambling, tobacco, and recreational drugs; also firearms, the bishops said, except for legitimate hunting, military, or law enforcement use. At the same time, the bishops urged investors to support positive things such as renewable energy sources; biodiversity and water resources; affordable housing; and, in the face of an often negative outlook from many Hollywood productions, virtuous media that strengthens families and contributes to a more positive and humane culture. After a successful two-decade career in finance overseeing billions of dollars in investments, Catone, who has a master’s degree in theology, went all-in on what he calls “faithful investing.” He founded Arimathea in 2023 as an asset management company that conducts in-depth, tech-forward research to ensure its clients’ portfolios — “dollars meant to be used for the people of God” — are truly Catholic-aligned. By trusting large secular firms like BlackRock or Morgan Stanley to manage their money, many Catholics are unknowingly funding organizations and practices that directly contradict the Church’s teachings, he reiterated, citing Arimathea’s own rigorous research. These include investments in companies like Microsoft, which not only pays for employees’ abortion travel but also has been known to violate workers’ rights in developing countries; other companies that directly cause abortions by distributing Plan B drugs; even companies such as hotel chains that directly profit off the sale of pornography, he said. “I came to the realization that the secular world was, in a way, pulling the wool over the eyes of the Catholic Church. And shocking as this may sound, most people do not become bishops because they’re really good at picking stocks, and so they rely upon the expertise of these secular organizations,” Catone said. He urged Catholics to examine their own investments, such as their 401(k), with a trusted financial adviser. “Step 1 is to stop treating our money as ‘out of sight, out of mind.’ Because the Lord is calling us to live a fully integrated life,” Catone said. “Our Lord Jesus Christ needs to be the Lord of every part of our life … and that also includes our 401(k) and our IRA. So in order to wake up, the first step is to open our eyes … because we can’t repent of what we don’t know.” On Arimathea’s website, Catholics can send their investment portfolio to the company, which will then screen it, for free, offering a kind of “report card” on the ethicality of each investment from a Catholic perspective, Catone noted. He added that Arimathea’s research is informed by a strong understanding of Catholic theology — a rarity among investment firms — as well as what he calls a “literal reading” of the 2021 USCCB document. Arimathea is also working to develop a network of accredited advisers who are trained in the principles of Catholic social teaching and can guide Catholic investors, he said. The goal is not merely to avoid “bad” companies but also actively seek out investments that promote human dignity and the common good, he emphasized. One way to do this is through proxy voting, a tool for influencing corporate behavior and promoting change from within that Catone said can be helpful in pushing companies to adopt more ethical practices. He said Catholics should be actively engaged in trying to improve the companies they invest in and have had some success at that in the past. Catone said the success Arimathea has had financially demonstrates that it is possible to invest in a way that is fully in line with the Catholic faith without sacrificing monetary returns. “What we’re trying to show at Arimathea is you can draw the line ... and say you know what? No abortion, no pornography, no drugs, no slave labor. And you know what? The returns are great,” he concluded. Shane Giblin, CEO of The Abbey Group, told CNA that the cultural milieu following the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade exposed “a bit of a crisis in the area of Catholic investing.” The Abbey Group came about in the late 2010s after St. Michael’s Abbey in Orange County, California, under Giblin’s fundraising leadership, managed to raise $150 million to build a new abbey, far outpacing expectations. They started doing pro bono consulting to help other Catholic entities replicate their success, launching officially in 2020 with a goal to help worthy Catholic causes generate and grow the resources they need to fully live out their mission. The Abbey Group is selective in its projects, evaluating them based on alignment with Catholic teachings, the potential impact of their endeavors, and the strength of their leadership. Giblin said in the wake of Roe’s overturn, the “screens” that were being applied to many Catholic investment portfolios needed to be reevaluated; it wasn’t clear how effective they were, or what they were doing to potentially limit returns, he noted. The other thing that Giblin said he noticed was that many Catholic investors weren’t allocating much to private equity — the buying and selling of shares in privately-held businesses. “What we saw was a great deal of interest and encouragement in creating an alternative investment solution that is authentically Catholic, specifically something in the private equity space,” Giblin said. To address the need, Giblin said Abbey Group Capital has partnered with Carrick Capital Partners, a firm run by a faithful Catholic, to help its clients grow the money they raise — and do so in a way that aligns with the Church’s teachings. The partnership, which benefits from the spiritual guidance from the Norbertine priests at the abbey, ensures investments align with Catholic values, such as avoidance of abortion and positive support for mothers wishing to keep and raise their children, Giblin said. Giblin said he hopes their approach will inspire others in the Catholic community to adopt similar strategies, ultimately contributing to a more dynamic and competitive landscape in Catholic investing. “It seems all too often that the Catholic space has to make the decision between either being excellent or being authentically Catholic. I think that’s a problem that we need to really break ourselves out of, a dynamic we need to run away from, because they’re not mutually exclusive terms,” he said. “I’ve seen a resurgence of late that gives me a lot of hope. I think that people are starting to become far more rigorous and far more attentive to the necessity to steward these resources with a great deal of vigilance when it comes to what they’re investing in and what they’re not investing in.” Richard Todd, CEO of Innovest, a Catholic financial firm based in Colorado that manages about $50 billion, said there was little awareness of the possibility, or even the need, for Catholic-aligned investments back in 1996 when he founded his firm. But that landscape has changed significantly with the rise of large, secular investment firms “taking advantage” of trusting Catholics, he said. “The ‘other side’ has been taking advantage of Catholics for, I would say, probably the last 10 years, but very specifically in the last five,” Todd told CNA. “It used to be, as a Catholic investor, if you owned a company, you could trust management to do what’s right for the company. But it’s no longer the case because of this pressure that these large asset managers are putting on.” Todd said Innovest works with clients to develop customized investment guidelines that reflect their unique values, allowing organizations like dioceses and universities to articulate their specific ethical concerns and ensure that their investment portfolios are truly aligned with their mission. They then design diversified portfolios that include traditional stocks and bonds, along with alternative investments such as real estate, private debt, and private equity. Todd, echoing Catone, emphasized the importance of going beyond simply avoiding harmful investments, emphasizing the importance of seeking out companies that promote positive values. He said Innovest looks for companies that prioritize human flourishing and foster a strong company culture, and also reiterated the importance of Catholics with large investments using proxy voting to influence companies for the better. “Many organizations that are Catholic don’t pay any attention to proxy voting. They end up voting for things that are completely outside their values, outside Catholic values. We believe that understanding how proxies are voted is really crucial,” he said. He noted that a popular framework of values-based investing, environmental, social, and governance (ESG), also known as impact investing, can include elements that are “anti-Christian” or misaligned with Catholic values. He said he seeks to educate clients on the differences between secular investing, ESG, and Catholic investing. Like Giblin, Todd said he firmly believes that investors do not have to sacrifice financial returns to invest in alignment with Catholic values. He pointed to the rise of competent asset managers who are adept at managing Catholic-values portfolios while achieving market-competitive or even superior results compared with secular portfolios. “I think, though, that there are [still] very few in the Catholic world that think this way. I think we’re in the first inning,” Todd said. “There are some, I think, that are moving in this direction that are prominent and well known. Our hope is that their courage will help lead others to really take a serious look at the way they manage their money. But there’s a lot to be done.” Your monthly donation will help our team continue reporting the truth, with fairness, integrity, and fidelity to Jesus Christ and his Church.

We recently published a list of 15 AI News You Should Pay Attention To. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other AI news you should pay attention to. AI themes have dominated stock markets around the world over the past few months. Investment titan Blackrock recently released an investor note on the subject, stressing that as the new year unfolds, AI advancements and diplomatic developments will continue to shape the top market trends. In the note, Jay Jacobs, the US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs at the firm, stated that these two themes stayed in the limelight for virtually all of 2024 and are likely to remain in primary focus for 2025. The note further detailed that 2025 could be a pivotal year for technological progress and adoption in AI tech, as GenAI advances and more sophisticated models were combining to drive meaningful growth in AI capabilities.

However, the investment firm also addressed regulatory and geopolitical challenges that were hampering growth. Per the analysts at the firm, the rise and advancements in AI also added strains to the geopolitical map. The note highlighted that regulation and desire to control the technology may lead to divergence between US-focused AI names and those with more global exposure.

(NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor manufacturer. On November 20, tech website PC Gamer reported that plans by the chipmaker to ditch future RDNA 5 graphics architecture in favor of unified UDNA tech were related to adding AI capabilities to AMD gaming GPUs as soon as possible. The report highlights how current gaming graphics cards of AMD are based on the RDNA 3 architecture, while the enterprise, datacenter and AI GPUs are based on the CDNA technology. UDNA would combine the two technologies, while still retaining two separate products, per the report. Overall, AMD ranks 7th on our list of AI news you should pay attention to. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Wall Street Embraces MBS’s Money Man

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access After the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, business leaders made a show of shunning Saudi Arabia, doing deals only behind closed doors. Now it’s all out in the open. On November 14, Wall Street feted Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the head of Saudi Arabia’s nearly $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund and a close confidante of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (MBS). At Cipriani—a private members’ club at 55 Wall Street—bright flowers at the center of the tables matched the ruby-red drapes. This gala, thrown by the Business Council for International Understanding, was a mark of the massive volume of Saudi investment capital percolating through the American economy. That itself isn’t new, but in recent years it’s become clear that the shame associated with Saudi funding in the wake of the grisly 2018 murder and dismemberment of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi has faded. Few seemed to even notice that the governor of the Saudi Public Investment Fund—which a Senate subcommittee is currently investigating for undue foreign influence in the fund’s seemingly hostile takeover of the PGA golf Tour—was receiving an award in Manhattan. On stage in Cipriani’s Greek revival ballroom, the president of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, presented Al-Rumayyan with a large crystal paperweight. Sitting with them at the long head table was HuffPo founder Arianna Huffington, and among the hundreds of minglers making their way through the room were hedge-fund titan Ray Dalio, Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel, former Trump adviser Dina Powell McCormick, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. The evening’s theme—“Champions of Change: Values in Practice”—couldn’t have been more incongruous for Al-Rumayyan, the billionaire lieutenant to one of the world’s most brutal rulers. (I had hoped to attend in person to investigate whether anyone there had qualms about honoring MBS’s money man. Sadly, I was told that the proceedings were closed to journalists.) But the whole event managed to avoid greater scrutiny because Saudi power in the United States, under successive presidents, has become so normalized. In 2023 alone, the Public Investment Fund spent $31.6 billion worldwide, and it currently holds about $20 billion worth of US stocks. Beyond its vanity projects like the futuristic city of Neom or its gifting of $2 billion to Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, PIF is planning a staggering $40 billion AI fund. Meanwhile, its venture capital arm has doled out about $3 billion a year to Wall Street stalwarts and the entire universe of private equity and venture capital firms powering Silicon Valley. “There’s no distinction between the [Saudi fund’s] money and the de facto ruler, who is Mohammed bin Salman,” Hala Aldosari, a Saudi activist living in exile in the US, told me. This is not just a Trump phenomenon. President Joe Biden’s about-face—capped by fist-bumping MBS on a visit to the kingdom in 2022 that broke with his campaign pledge to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah”—explicitly gave American business permission to go all in. Since Israel launched its war on Gaza, the Biden administration has further revived MBS’s global stature and tamped down its already muted human rights rhetoric. As Aldosari put it, “It’s going to get worse with Trump now, but in terms of US foreign policy in the Middle East, it’s very much problematic regardless of the political party.” In anticipation, many American and international companies are already expanding their dealings in Saudi Arabia. Even the consultancy founded by the late Madeleine Albright, which long held itself out as a values-driven firm, just opened a headquarters in Riyadh. In Saudi Arabia, basic freedoms have not improved since Khashoggi was lured inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and murdered. The regime’s crackdown on women’s rights activists has accelerated. “It’s the worst we’ve ever seen,” Aldosari says. Prison sentences are getting longer even for relatively low-profile cases, as part of what she calls the regime’s “systematic approach” to snuffing out dissent. She cited two women recently prosecuted for their tweets, notably Nourah al-Qahtani, who was jailed for 45 years and Salma al-Shehab, who received 34 years. Plus, earlier this year, a Saudi cartoonist named Al-Hazza was sentenced to 23 years. In a new report, Human Rights Watch documents how the Public Investment Fund has enabled internal clampdowns in Saudi Arabia. Drawing upon newly released court documents, Human Rights Watch notes that Al-Rumayyan was a key figure in the 2017 Ritz roundup in which 200 wealthy Saudi royals and businesspeople were detained and blackmailed in the luxury hotel in Riyadh. While it’s tough to get American business to care about issues of global human rights, the risks inherent in working in an autocracy might get their attention. Human Rights Watch details how the state has repeatedly expropriated the assets of people and companies, without due process. One Saudi entrepreneur based in the US (who would speak to me only on the condition of anonymity) emphasized that Western corporations that engage with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund are exposed to financial as well as reputational risks. “By associating with a fund connected to human rights abuses, they face increasing backlash from investors, consumers, and global stakeholders demanding ethical accountability,” he told me. “The absence of reliable dispute resolution mechanisms in Saudi Arabia leaves companies vulnerable to arbitrary practices, such as unjust expropriations, without any credible options for redress.” But investment capital apparently remains in short supply, and Al-Rummayan’s sovereign wealth purse holds $925 billion. (He also chairs the national oil company, Saudi Aramco.) In the months following Khashoggi’s assassination, business and finance leaders only quietly sealed deals with Saudi Arabia; now it’s out in the open. The Ritz Carlton, the site of MBS’s five-star detention facility, is once again home to big business. In late October, a think tank connected to Al-Rumayyan’s sovereign wealth fund hosted its annual summit in Riyadh, known as Davos in the Desert. In the room were billionaires Dalio, Larry Fink, Ken Griffin, Marc Rowan, Eric Schmidt, and Steve Schwarzman. Elon Musk, who has also benefited from Saudi financial largesse, took the time to appear by video. The public panels focused on innovation and financial trends while studiously avoiding politics, yet there were, as ever, moments that revealed why they had really gathered in Saudi Arabia. David Rubenstein, the Carlyle billionaire who as recently as last year played host to the Biden family for Thanksgiving at his Nantucket retreat, has become a regular of these Saudi events. Moderating a panel, Rubenstein began by flattering the host—or perhaps calling the event for what it is. “Let me ask Yasir,” Rubenstein began, “is the biggest problem with being the governor of the PIF fund that you don’t have enough requests for money?” Al-Rumayyan laughed, but the numbers are nothing to joke about. Attendees told The New York Times that just a small check from him could amount to $100 million. The Saudi fund’s venture arm notes on its website 143 startups, investment funds, and real estate companies that it’s currently backing. Among those listed: Rowan’s Apollo, Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors, and Schwarzman’s Blackstone. Fink’s BlackRock received $5 billion from the PIF for a new investment platform. PIF says that $70 billion of agreements were inked at the October confab, including a partnership between the Saudi fund and Google Cloud to “advance AI research in Arabic-language models,” according to the company. Its president and chief investment officer, Ruth Porat, sat on the panel with Al-Rumayyan in Riyadh. A few weeks later, the Google executive presented him with the Eisenhower Award for Global Transformation in New York, for “values in practice.” But what values does Saudi investment represent beyond the value of money? Q&A / John Nichols Books & the Arts / Zoe Adams John Nichols Books & the Arts / David A. Bell Expect to see more of the Saudi sovereign-wealth kingmaker. Days later at Madison Square Garden, Al-Rumayyan chatted with President-elect Trump at an Ultimate Fighting Championship match, with Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy nearby. It’s likely that in Trump’s second term there will be many more galas for Al-Rumayyan, with a full state visit for MBS on the horizon. We now confront a second Trump presidency. There’s not a moment to lose. We must harness our fears, our grief, and yes, our anger, to resist the dangerous policies Donald Trump will unleash on our country. We rededicate ourselves to our role as journalists and writers of principle and conscience. Today, we also steel ourselves for the fight ahead. It will demand a fearless spirit, an informed mind, wise analysis, and humane resistance. We face the enactment of Project 2025, a far-right supreme court, political authoritarianism, increasing inequality and record homelessness, a looming climate crisis, and conflicts abroad. The Nation will expose and propose, nurture investigative reporting, and stand together as a community to keep hope and possibility alive. The Nation’s work will continue—as it has in good and not-so-good times—to develop alternative ideas and visions, to deepen our mission of truth-telling and deep reporting, and to further solidarity in a nation divided. Armed with a remarkable 160 years of bold, independent journalism, our mandate today remains the same as when abolitionists first founded The Nation—to uphold the principles of democracy and freedom, serve as a beacon through the darkest days of resistance, and to envision and struggle for a brighter future. The day is dark, the forces arrayed are tenacious, but as the late Nation editorial board member Toni Morrison wrote “No! This is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak, we write, we do language. That is how civilizations heal.” I urge you to stand with The Nation and donate today.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Trending on Financial Media. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are trending on financial media. The AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Private equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018. The private equity firm has tried twice to get the memory chipmaker listed on the stock exchange, once in 2018 and then again earlier this year.

The advisory cites the recent movement in the shares for the downgrade. It also lowered margin assumptions for fiscal 2026 to reflect management guidance of lower margins due to Blackwell products. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are trending on financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock. Disclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey. The hedge fund manager takes a piece of a popular consumer brand. Today, Millennium has over $70 billion in assets under management and is one of the world's largest hedge funds. Investors should understand that Millennium is a "pod shop," which means it allocates capital to different teams (or "pods") that all have their own strategies and a lot of autonomy. In the third quarter, Millennium sold large portions of its stakes in artificial intelligence (AI) companies Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) and bought a new stock that Wall Street thinks can soar. Broadcom isn't the only way to tap the AI revolution. There are currently eight publicly traded companies with market caps of $1 trillion or more: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Berkshire Hathaway. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), the world's biggest retailer and the largest company in the world by revenue, has quietly blown away the rest of the retail sector in recent years as its commitment to omnichannel sales and reputation for everyday low prices have delivered steady growth. Walmart reported another round of strong quarterly results on Tuesday morning. Microsoft and Broadcom are more stable long-term AI plays. Markets will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving. Earnings from retailers and October inflation data will be the week's highlights. On the surface, Boeing (NYSE: BA) looks as though it has all the ingredients of a potential millionaire-maker investment. The aircraft market is growing, competition is minimal, and government contracts are plentiful. The phrase "economic moat" -- popularized by investing legend Warren Buffett -- refers to certain types of durable competitive advantages a company can possess that make it difficult for potential rivals to make inroads against it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) did it again. Shares pulled back slightly on the news as investors have gotten accustomed to the chip titan regularly besting expectations, and some analysts wanted to see stronger fourth-quarter guidance, which called for $37.5 billion in revenue -- a 70% increase from the quarter a year ago. At the time of this writing, Nvidia is now worth $3.5 trillion. One FAANG stock was unceremoniously left out of the "Magnificent Seven." That was a costly blunder. The party may come to an abrupt end for Wall Street. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: American Tower Corporation (AMT): Are Hedge Funds Bullish On This Real Estate and Realty Stock?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) stands against the other real estate and realty stocks. As reported by Realtor, America’s newly elected president Trump has blamed illegal immigration for the country’s housing affordability crisis since these immigrants are in the race for an already short supply of homes and hence, plans to do the largest deportation operation in American history. It is important to consider that the recent post-pandemic surging home prices started off before the illegal immigration levels climbed. Furthermore, Realtor.com senior economist Ralph McLaughlin referred to this move as something that would create negative consequences for the housing market by stating: “In the short run, reducing immigration could severely hurt the labor supply needed for new homebuilding since up to a third of residential construction employment consists of foreign-born workers” Simultaneously, Trump wants to cut regulations and permit requirements that add unnecessary costs to new homes. Regarding this, economists believe that although reduced regulations might lower homebuilding costs, they would neither solve the entire housing crisis nor fulfill Trump’s dream of cutting the cost of a new home in half by eliminating regulations. Mortgage rates are directly tied to 10-year Treasury bond yields which tend to grow with investors forecasting stronger economic growth and higher inflation. According to Mortgage News Daily, the 30-year fixed mortgage rates briefly rose, settling at 6.98% following Trump’s victory. Despite two rate cuts by the Fed, the rate has surged by almost 1% since the month of September. Trump has also stated his enthusiasm related to somehow lowering mortgage rates, without a clear mechanism unveiled as of yet. Economists and analysts believe that the President’s economic agenda could potentially lead to a surge in mortgage rates. Trump has plans to reduce tax rates, impose tariffs on foreign goods, and ease regulations, policies that are going to lead to a rise in inflation and government debt, which is going to drive up the interest rates and mortgage rates. Before the elections, 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists agreed that Trump's policies would fuel inflation, calling Joe Biden's economic agenda vastly superior to Donald Trump's. Doug Bauer, CEO of Tri Pointe Homes, joined CNBC to discuss what’s next for the US housing market. He sees the lower corporate tax and the easing of regulations for banks as positives. With banks being encouraged to put dollars into all businesses especially the land and land development business to small and medium-sized builders, it is going to help the industry as a whole. Regarding the deportation, he believes the discussion is pretty early but his company, as a larger builder, has not faced any problems on the labor side of the equation. Finally, he mentioned that the core issue remains the supply. While a reduction in interest rates would unlock the resale market, the new homebuilding is a 'state and local issue' as there are a lot of regulations pulling back the land that could be utilized to build affordable housing. Ivy Zelman, Zelman and Associates CEO, also appeared on an interview with CNBC, to reiterate Bauer’s point about the issue regarding the new home market. In her opinion, the housing market weakness is at the entry level while the move-up market remains strong and resilient despite rates moving higher. While first-time homebuyers are facing extreme affordability issues, she thinks cities and municipalities could partner with local builders to utilize land that’s not out so far in the rural areas and that the solution lies at the local government level. Trump also plans to open up federal land for building. However, a limitation of this would be a lack of federal land located near the places where people wish to work and live.

The company’s performance is backed up by the strong underlying demand for its portfolio of communications assets. Its synergy revolves around having that global expertise and experience enabling it to navigate operational risks in new markets while simultaneously creating opportunities. With a resilient demand and strength of underlying fundamentals across the portfolio, AMT is well positioned. The company is pursuing long-term growth by managing its diverse markets. AMT has planned to reduce its exposure to emerging markets which are more vulnerable to the macro environment as the firm continues to focus on incremental investments in developed economies. In September, AMT closed the sale of operations in India to Data Infrastructure Trust, an Infrastructure Investment Trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management. For the third quarter of 2024, the firm’s total revenue grew by less than 0.1% to $2,522 million while net income and adjusted EBITDA declined. As emphasized by CEO Steven Vondran, the carrier rollouts of 5G coverage tend to support robust activity levels in the United States and Europe while demand for AMT’s global portfolio of communications infrastructure assets is evident. Hence, American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is a leading independent owner, operator, and developer of multi-tenant communications real estate, having a solid portfolio of over 148,000 communications sites and a highly interconnected footprint of US data center facilities. Overall AMT ranks 1st on our list of the best real estate and realty stocks to buy according to hedge funds.
