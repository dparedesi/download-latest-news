US clean energy might seem an early victim of policy shifts and funding cuts, but BlackRock says its still a key source of power and an area of the stock market that could rise. Even with renewable power facing heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, coupled with the erosion of tax benefits in the congressional reconciliation bill, two things should keep investors interested in the space. First, energy demand isn't ebbing, and clean energy will be needed more than ever. "The US likely needs more of all kinds of energy to meet AI's needs," BlackRock wrote in a note on Tuesday. "Industry projections see US data center electricity consumption rising between 50% and 200% by 2030 — a big jump after 15 years of flat national power demand." In other words, Washington can't afford to slash a leading source of electricity if the US is to maintain its artificial intelligence leadership. According to the Energy Information Administration, solar is projected to lead US power generation growth through 2026. Together with wind, solar overtook coal in the nation's energy mix for the first time in 2024. Second, BlackRock says industry headwinds are priced into renewable power stocks. "Longer term, we see clean energy stocks positioned for strong growth," BlackRock wrote. "Renewables are quick to build and valuations are attractive: the factors that contributed to their slump — like high rates and tariffs — are now priced in, we think." BlackRock also suggested that investors keep tabs on nuclear stocks, with the Trump administration's focus on nuclear making the sector poised for growth. "Last week, President Trump signed executive orders aimed at expediting nuclear power reactor deployment, and the most recent revisions to the House bill preserved the existing tax credits allotted to nuclear project developers," BlackRock wrote. "But given how long it takes to build nuclear power plants, we see natural gas and renewables benefiting sooner." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Title: Enduring value: Traditional assets with modern strategy

Dominic Kohler, head of investment and client solutions at Brown Shipley, a Quintet Private Bank, reflects on the resilience of traditional assets, equities and bonds, amid inflation, volatility, and a new generation of investor expectations. Marked by rapid macroeconomic shifts, traditional asset classes such as equities and fixed income are being tested like never before. According to Kohler, the investment landscape is one of complexity and opportunity where prudence, adaptability, and trust are more valuable than ever. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more “We have been navigating a challenging environment over the past couple of years,” Kohler notes. “High interest rates, sustained inflationary pressure, volatile markets and continued geopolitical uncertainty” have reshaped how traditional assets are perceived and deployed. For equities, Kohler stresses, “being more selective; quality and resilience matter more than ever.” On the fixed income side, the outlook has brightened. “Things are looking up again now that yields are more attractive.” This combination of cautious optimism and tactical flexibility underscores Brown Shipley’s broader approach. “It’s a market where careful positioning is key – with a focus on the long term whilst also looking for opportunities as and when they present themselves.” Even as inflation shows signs of cooling, Kohler maintains that preserving wealth remains a core priority especially for private clients seeking long-term stability. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. “Apart from capital appreciation, our investment philosophy also includes a focus on wealth protection,” he explains. “Even with inflation starting to ease, this remains key. Quality shares and government or corporate bonds remain reliable tools to help us deliver on our philosophy.” While new asset classes and financial innovations continue to emerge, Kohler believes in the continued importance of traditional investments. “We are convinced that – even with changing market conditions, new asset classes and product innovation – traditional assets will continue to play a key role.” Brown Shipley employs a flexible yet disciplined approach to asset allocation, allowing it to respond quickly to market developments without losing sight of long-term objectives. “We have a dynamic asset allocation approach,” Kohler explains. “We actively adjust our positioning as the market changes, always guided by our long-term outlook but responsive to short-term shifts.” During periods of heightened volatility, this might involve reducing exposure to riskier assets like equities and increasing allocations to higher-quality bonds. “Within equities, we lean towards sectors and companies that are better positioned to weather uncertainty,” he adds. “On fixed income, with yields now more attractive, bonds have become an effective tool not only for capital preservation but also income generation.” While traditional assets form the core of most portfolios, Kohler highlights the growing relevance of alternatives in achieving true diversification. “It’s all about finding the right mix,” he says. “Alternatives can help reduce risk, increase diversification and provide an illiquidity premium.” Private markets, in particular, are gaining traction especially with younger, more growth-oriented investors. However, Kohler offers a word of caution. “Private markets are complex and often poorly understood. Clear communication and positioning of the benefits – and risks – is therefore important.” Despite the rise of alternatives and digital investments, Kohler remains confident in the long-term performance potential of traditional assets. “We are focused on providing consistent risk-adjusted returns over the long term,” he says. “Traditional assets still have a strong role to play. They can offer stability and consistency, particularly when clients see uncertainty and risk in the market.” Moreover, risk management is central to Brown Shipley’s investment philosophy. Through its parent company, Quintet, the bank partners with BlackRock to gain access to cutting-edge risk assessment tools. “As part of our partnership with BlackRock, we utilise best-in-class risk management tools to stress-test portfolios and consider various market scenarios,” Kohler explains. But numbers alone aren’t enough. “It is critical that advisers are close to clients and understand what is most important to them – spending time with them and ensuring their strategy remains aligned to their investment objectives and personal circumstances.” Where geopolitical developments can move markets overnight, Kohler’s advice is to remain level-headed. “Whether elections, conflicts or tariff announcements, we look at how such events may affect markets and adjust portfolios as required,” he says. “However, as we have seen at the start of this year, it is key to filter out the noise – whilst it is important to seek out opportunities, sometimes standing firm in our positioning can be the best course of action in the long run.” Looking ahead, Kohler sees several forces reshaping the future of traditional investing from regulatory shifts and product innovation to the expectations of younger investors. “We are in the midst of the largest wealth transfer in history,” he says. “Younger investors have an increased focus on thematic and sustainable investing. We are continuing to evolve our product offering accordingly, providing clients more choices about how their wealth is managed and invested.” Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations are increasingly front and centre. But Brown Shipley’s approach is personalised rather than prescriptive. “ESG is often about deeply held beliefs, reflecting the individual values of the families we serve,” Kohler explains. “That’s why we do not impose our values but rather offer our clients a wide range of choices so they can invest in alignment with their values.” Incorporating ESG, he notes, is also a matter of sound investing. “Investors are constantly seeking to limit their investment universe by excluding poorly run or excessively risky companies. Incorporating ESG metrics is an attempt to evaluate and avoid risk – and identify opportunities – based on factors not always associated with investment decisions in the past.” While the human relationship remains at the core of client service, technology is playing an increasingly important role in portfolio construction and management. “Technology helps us make more informed decisions faster,” Kohler says. “We have a number of key partnerships that have given us access to market-leading technology that our clients benefit from as they feed into our internal processes and decision-making.” Still, he adds, “human interaction and judgement remain essential.” Traditional assets continue to offer a solid foundation for wealth preservation and growth. For Brown Shipley, it’s not just about selecting the right stocks or bonds, it’s about building long-term trust, leveraging innovation responsibly, and staying anchored to what matters most to clients. As Kohler puts it: “With the right allocation and solid instrument selection, traditional assets can continue to deliver superior long-term returns.”

Title: BTC reclaims $110k as Trump Media announces $2.5B Bitcoin treasury

Trump Media and Technology Group, a Donald Trump-linked company that’s publicly traded in the US, has announced it’s raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin price, which had hovered around $109k before the news, jumped to above $110,000 as bulls looked to reclaim the upper hand. The news comes as Bitcoin 2025, a major Bitcoin conference, begins in Las Vegas, with Trump sons Eric and Trump Jr expected as speakers. Nasdaq and NYSE Texas-listed Trump Media, trading under the ticker DJT, is the operator of Trump’s social media app Truth Social as well as streaming platform Truth+ and financial technology firm Truth.Fi. On Tuesday, the company revealed plans to raise $2.5 billion from 50 institutional investors, with subscription agreements targeting $1.5 billion of Trump Media common stock and $1 billion in convertible senior secured notes. The funds raised from this private placement offering will close on May 29, 2025. According to the announcement, the proceeds of the offering will be used to adopt a Bitcoin treasury. “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions,” said Devin Nunes, chief executive officer and chairman of Trump Media. Adding Bitcoin to the Trump family-owned company’s balance sheet will see it join other publicly-traded companies that now hodl billions of dollars worth of the digital asset. The biggest player in this corporate frenzy for BTC is Strategy, which has amassed over $40 billion in BTC since first buying it in 2020. The surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also seen BlackRock gobble up thousands of BTC as inflows mount. Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital are Trump Media’s custody providers as it embarks on this BTC treasury venture. Other companies to help TMTG are Yorkville Securities and Clear Street as co-lead placement agents, and Cantor Fitzgerald as financial advisor. Bitcoin price changed hands around $110,065 at the time of writing, just 1.7% off its all-time high of $111,970 reached on May 22, 2025.

Title: Google slashes quantum requirement to crack Bitcoin by 95% with technology a decade away

Expert predictions point to a possible Bitcoin split due to rising quantum computing capabilities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s cryptographic resilience is facing renewed questions after a Google researcher suggested that quantum computers may be capable of breaking its encryption far sooner than expected. Craig Gidney, a leading quantum computing researcher at Google, published new findings indicating that the hardware requirements to break 2048-bit RSA encryption, a key mathematical element similar to that of Bitcoin, have dropped significantly. Gidney pointed out that his earlier estimates placed the threshold at 20 million noisy qubits, but the new projection requires fewer than one million. The reduced computational burden marks a significant leap in quantum capability, though it might take several days instead of a few hours. The Google researcher attributes the advancement to more refined quantum algorithms and enhanced error correction techniques that reduce the number of physical qubits needed by encoding logical qubits more efficiently. The revelations arrive as concerns grow over the pace of quantum computing development. Last year, Google introduced its Willow chip, a next-generation quantum processor that many believe brought real-world threats to digital security closer than previously assumed. In response, major financial institutions are updating their disclosures. For example, BlackRock recently flagged quantum computing as a material risk for its Bitcoin ETF product, IBIT. According to the firm: “If quantum computing technology is able to advance and significantly increase its capacity relative to the capacity of today’s leading quantum computers, it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like Bitcoin.” This shift reflects growing awareness that technological breakthroughs could challenge Bitcoin’s foundational encryption earlier than anticipated. Despite the concern, some experts believe the crypto sector still has time to adapt to the potential risks. Today’s logical-qubit demos top out at dozens (e.g., Quantinuum’s 12 logical qubits). Gidney’s 1,000,000-qubit figure is about physical (noisy) qubits, not logical. We’re three orders of magnitude away in sheer qubit count, and need major error-rate breakthroughs. Even the physical-qubit goal is likely 8–12 years out, and a true million-logical-qubit machine is decades away. Meanwhile, Bitcoin analyst Fred Krueger believes the emergence of a “quantum-resistant” version of the top crypto is inevitable. He anticipates a network split between a newly fortified Bitcoin and a legacy version, similar to how Ethereum split into ETH and Ethereum Classic. He stated: “Ulimately there will be a fork. ‘Quantum Resistant Bitcoin (QRB)’ and ‘Bitcoin Classic.’ The big money will recognize and push QRB. Some will fight it. Bitcoin Classic (BTC) will become the new Ethereum Classic.” Still, if Bitcoin becomes vulnerable in eight years, the network will not have long to adopt a quantum-resistant upgrade. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Title: Prometheum Eyes U.S. Tokenization Boom With Acquisition and Fully Regulated Stack
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/05/27/prometheum-eyes-us-tokenization-boom-with-acquisition-and-fully-regulated-stack
Time Published: 2025-05-27T12:26:44Z
Full Content:
Prometheum, the controversial digital asset securities firm, is aiming to achieve a jumpstart in the lucrative tokenization boom, acquiring a broker-dealer and launching a digital transfer agent registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company told CoinDesk exclusively. ProFinancial, the firm’s newly acquired FINRA-member and SEC-registered broker-dealer, can offer primary sales of various securities products, giving issuers a pathway to raise capital directly in tokenized form. Prometheum Coinery, meanwhile, handles shareholder records and corporate actions both on and off the blockchain. The additions build on existing services for custody, clearing, and secondary trading via its affiliated broker-dealers, Prometheum Capital and Prometheum ATS. With the latest move, the company aims to position as one of the few U.S.-regulated players offering a vertically integrated route for bringing real-world assets into a blockchain-native format—a capability likely to become more critical as the tokenization trend matures. "Securities, commodities, everything else is moving on-chain, and there needs to be an infrastructure for that. [There's] a pie that's going to grow significantly, just like everything went from paper to electronic," Aaron Kaplan, co-CEO told CoinDesk in an interview. "We are in a prime position, in my opinion, to be a significant player in that growing ecosystem." The expansion comes as asset tokenization emerges as one of the fastest-growing corners of crypto tech at a time when U.S. regulators signal a friendlier approach towards digital assets. Tokenization stands for using blockchain rails for moving and managing traditional instruments like bonds, funds and other securities, with global asset managers and banks increasingly getting involved to achieve operational efficiencies and cheaper, faster settlements. It's potentially a lucrative opportunity: the tokenized asset market could balloon to multiple trillion dollars over the next few years, a range of reports from BCG, Ripple, McKinsey, 21Shares projected. It's no surprise then that tokenization firms are jockeying for position to seize the opportunity as the sector heats up. Recently, digital asset manager Superstate registered its transfer agent with the SEC and unveiled a tokenized equity trading platform. Securitize, a tokenization firm backed by BlackRock and Jump Crypto, purchased MG Stover's fund administration business, while financial services provider Apex Group last week announced the acquisition of tokenization specialist Tokeny. Prometheum, founded in 2017, made headlines over the past years with efforts to comply with the Gary Gensler-led SEC, known for its harsh stance towards crypto. The company also divided the digital asset industry with wanting to provide securities-focused services for cryptocurrencies like ether ETH$2,657.09. With the new entities, the firm is now able to offer a fully-integrated platform for tokenized securities, from initial issuance to secondary market trading and custody, all within U.S. securities laws, something that's difficult to achieve, Kaplan argued. "It's a much bigger lift than what was done previously with these other [tokenization] firms," Kaplan said. Creating a digital token of an asset is the "low-hanging fruit," while being able to handle trading and post-trading are "exponentially harder," he explained. "The harder parts are what we built first," he said. "Other [firms] went the other route, which was the lowest hanging fruit first, and they've had a harder time transitioning the other way." "So with this announcement, it's pretty clear that the low-hanging fruit is in our purview," he said. Jesse Hamilton contributed reporting.

ByMax (Chong) Li ByMax (Chong) Li, Contributor. ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - MAY 15: U.S. President Donald J. Trump signs the guestbook as UAE ... More President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan looks on and gives a thumbs up gesture after a meeting at Qasr al Watan (Palace of the Nation) on May 15, 2025, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Trump is on the third day of his visit to the Gulf to underscore the strategic partnership between the United States and regional allies including the UAE, focusing on security and economic collaboration. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) I’ve spent a decent amount of springtime in Abu Dhabi this year, seeing the UAE orchestrate a remarkable transformation from a traditional oil giant to a competent leader in the global digital economy. The push? AI and crypto, leveraging the nation's favorable policies and strategic geographic location while the two biggest economies in this world are at odds. Despite their individual strengths, AI and blockchain are increasingly interlaced, both striving towards systems that offer better autonomy, transparency, and data-driven intelligence, reshaping industries through their combined innovative potential. This drive will largely help the UAE capitalize on their complementary advantages to rewrite the global economic and technological race during this time of uncertainty. To know how the UAE is playing their range, we must look differently through the lens of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the two iconic sites that share responsibility for the nation’s strategic ascent to leadership in Web3 and AI. Dubai's strategy is characterized by its emphasis on agility, a strong commercial focus, and a clear ambition to be a global hub for FinTech, AI, and Web3. It leverages its established reputation as a business-friendly environment with world-class infrastructure, together with its latest push to build supportive regulatory frameworks to attract innovation, talent, and capital. Abu Dhabi's strategy is more geared towards a top-down, institutional approach, emphasizing foundational research, advanced technology development, and the establishment of strategic, large-scale infrastructure projects.

US government authorities are accusing the asset management giants BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard of colluding against the coal industry. In November of last year, 11 state attorneys general, led by Texas AG Ken Paxton, accused the three financial firms of engaging in an anticompetitive conspiracy to drive down coal production. The attorneys general allege the firms tapped their influence as shareholders in competing coal companies to reduce industrywide coal output, illegally sharing competitively sensitive information in the process. Now, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) have filed a “Statement of Interest” in support of the AGs’ case. The federal officials argue that BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard’s alleged conduct increased energy prices for consumers and businesses. “This case is not about ordinary activity by asset managers such as passive index investing or even pro-competitive activism. As alleged, the holders of large quantities of stock in competing companies agreed to use those shareholdings to reduce the output of US coal to increase profits at the expense of American consumers and businesses. This case is about precisely the sort of conduct, including concerted efforts to reduce output, which have long been condemned under the antitrust laws.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Google Researchers Claim Quantum Computers Could Break Bitcoin with 20x Less Effort than Previous Estimates

Google has released a research paper which suggests that quantum computers may be able to crack encryption standards, such as those used by Bitcoin, with 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. A Google quantum researcher, Craig Gidney, said developers must ascertain the costs of creating quantum-safe cryptocurrencies to achieve the transition process. Cryptography standards, such as RSA, may be at a higher risk of being cracked than previously thought. Bitcoin users, especially those with custodial funds, may need to measure the risks to safeguard their crypto from quantum attacks. Quantum computing can solve complex puzzles, such as the ones used by Bitcoin to measure proof-of-work, thus presenting a new threat vector that places Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at risk. Bitcoin was designed for older computers, which are quickly becoming obsolete. Peter Shor, cryptographer and computer scientist, created a method called Shor’s algorithm to solve the complex puzzles used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Shor’s algorithm could be combined with a quantum computer to crack crypto wallets rapidly. An efficient algorithm, combined with a powerful computer, could increase the risk of a crypto portfolio, including digital assets that use proof-of-stake algorithms. Craig Gidney and Sophie Schmieg, quantum researchers at Google, discussed their findings on their Google security blog. They addressed the ability of quantum computers to crack public key cryptography, particularly RSA, which could be compromised with a quantum computer of around 1 million noisy qubits. They made this conclusion after taking into account recent advancements in quantum computing. The number of qubits required to crack cryptography is lower than previous estimates. The researchers outlined strategies corporations could take to mitigate the risks of quantum computers, such as collaborating with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to transition to a post-quantum computing world. Symmetric cryptography is largely unaffected by this attack. However, cryptography, such as that used by cryptocurrencies, is vulnerable to this attack due to the public exposure of addresses and the longevity of these wallets, providing attackers with a target they can attack for an extended period. NIST has set a timeline to phase out vulnerable systems by 2030 and ban them by 2035. Google has been confirming its strategy with NIST by implementing PQC signatures on its Cloud KMS service. IBM’s Condor, the most powerful quantum computer to date, can only reach 1,121 qubits, which is way short of the million qubits needed to crack RSA encryption. Cryptocurrency seems to be safe for now, unless a new technological innovation can dramatically increase the number of qubits. Google’s Sycamore, another quantum computer, can only get 53 qubits. However, the trend of quantum development suggests that crypto users must take these risks seriously. The Google researchers argue that the increased risk occurs because of technological advancements such as improved error correction and better algorithms. Modular exponentiation, for example, has been made more efficient, effectively doubling its speed. Modular arithmetic is a vital part of cryptographic systems. Further, the researchers found that error correction improvements can speed up their algorithm. They found that creating a separate layer for error correction allowed the qubits layer to be more dense, holding more information to be processed, speeding up the algorithm overall. The researchers could drop the qubit requirement by optimising code at a programmable level. Hackers could further exploit such optimizations to secretly lower the qubit requirements until a future date when quantum computers are more accessible. In early May 2025, BlackRock added a line to their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing, stating that quantum computing poses a risk to the long-term security of Bitcoin. The filing states that if quantum computing advances enough, it could be used to crack the underlying encryption algorithms used to power Bitcoin. BlackRock is concerned that quantum computers will undermine crypto markets and technology. Quantum computers can potentially disrupt the business model of Silicon Valley, potentially causing a market crash. BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, should consider the potential risks of quantum computers. The fact that such a large bank like BlackRock is taking the risk seriously shows that quantum risks could be closer than we think.

Title: Locked Out of the Dream: Regulation Makes Homes Unaffordable

Full Content:
The first in a two-part series on the global housing crisis. Next to inflation, Americans ranked housing as their top financial worry in a Gallup survey last May. It’s only gotten worse. January home sales were down 5% from last year’s dismal numbers. Record numbers of first-time buyers are stuck on the sidelines as housing affordability stands at the lowest level ever recorded, while one in three Americans now spend over 30% of their income on mortgage or rent. The housing crisis is not just an American problem, but a global phenomenon that hits the middle and working classes the hardest. Studies of the Canadian, British, European, and East Asian markets have also found that housing prices have risen far faster than household incomes and inflation. A report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development concluded that “housing has been the main driver of rising middle-class expenditure.” In prosperous and communitarian Switzerland, Zurich studios sell for well over $1 million, and small houses even more, making downpayments unaffordable to affluent people despite the overwhelming financial advantages to homeowners. Underlying the plight of home buyers worldwide is a sometimes overlooked but profound influence – the spread of restrictive land-use regulations. It’s reshaping political and economic alignments in ways that may further destabilize the social order. Home ownership is strongly correlated with positive social indicators, and as renting grows twice as quickly as buying, this trend poses a threat to Western democracy by deepening economic inequality, depressing demographic vitality, and undermining the upward mobility that has driven Western progress for the past century. Cost of Over-Regulation The price increase may seem surprising because there has not been a huge spike in fundamental demand. In California, and most of the United States, as well as Europe and East Asia, population growth is tepid, if not declining. Today’s higher interest rates are below those that prevailed from 1970 to 1995, when housing costs were considerably lower relative to incomes. Nor is this predominantly a technical problem; the rise of remote work, which is connected to migration to smaller metros, as well as new technologies for building, including using 3D printers, actually offers the chance to build more cheaply. And yet, the principal cause for housing shortages and rising prices stems from the failure to build enough new housing units, particularly the single-family homes consumers most desire. Homebuilders built 1 million fewer homes (including rental units) in 2024 than in 1972, when there were 130 million fewer Americans. One estimate puts the U.S. housing market shortage at an estimated 4.5 million homes, according to Commerce Department data. The rapid inflation of housing costs stems primarily from ever more constricting land-use regulations. Inflated prices are particularly rife in countries and states with strict regulations like California, where high-income households now utterly dominate the housing market, and more than a third of all real estate transactions in recent years topped $1 million. At the crux of the problem is a series of housing policies referred to as “urban containment.” First implemented in Britain at the end of the Second World War, urban containment policies typically seek to manage growth by imposing boundaries or greenbelts around urban areas, outside of which new development is either prohibited or severely limited. Decades ago, there was ample land within these boundaries, but this has changed as population growth has stimulated more demand. The simple fact is that once the urban limits are reached, land prices along the boundaries – the suburbs and exurbs – and in the areas still open to development inevitably rise. This mimics the effects of the 1970s gasoline embargoes that drove prices through the roof – and is nothing more than basic economics. Rationing tends to increase prices. To this flawed approach, many jurisdictions have imposed other costs such as high-impact fees, lengthy environmental reviews, minimum parking mandates, and historical preservation designations. But generally, nothing quite compares with urban containment, as it drives up land costs by restricting development on the periphery, where land prices are the lowest. In almost all cases, the highest housing prices occur in markets that are characterized by this planning strategy. This includes all markets in Australia and New Zealand and many in Canada, the United Kingdom, the U.S., Western Europe, and China. In the U.S., the worst housing inflation has been in California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, and Colorado, all states that apply the tightest large regulatory noose around new developments, particularly on and beyond the urban fringe. The connection between policy and prices is clearly evident. As late as 1970, only a few markets were shaped by urban containment. As its influence grew, so did prices. As late as about 1990, national price-to-income ratios were “affordable,” at three or less in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. Today, the median multiple in these countries tends to be over five. But the worst results, as seen in most recent Demographia International Housing Affordability Study – Hong Kong, Sydney, San Jose, Vancouver, Los Angeles, Adelaide, Honolulu, San Francisco, Melbourne, Brisbane, as well as Greater London, are at a remarkable nine or above. Perhaps counterintuitively, higher density development – often seen as the alternative to “sprawl” – does not lower prices, as is sometimes suggested. In fact, U.S. data suggests a positive correlation between greater density and housing costs. Among 53 major metros, those with more single-family housing and larger lot sizes (key indicators of lower density) have substantially better housing affordability. The effects of density-focused policies on people and regions are profound. One study found the median family in San Jose or San Francisco would need 125 years (150 in Los Angeles) to save enough money to afford a down payment on a median-priced home; in Atlanta or Houston, the figure is 12 years. Highly restrictive planning policies also impact renters. A recent RAND study of California found that policy-driven delays, strict architectural standards, green mandates, and the requirement to pay union-level wages have increased the cost of construction of subsidized apartments twice as much as in Texas, while taking almost two years longer to get approved. Portland, Ore., a pioneer in urban containment, embraces high-density housing, but high prices have driven multifamily construction to the lowest level in a decade. Collapse of the Dream Urban containment and other planning policies have devastated middle-class aspirations in every country or region that adopts them, even in countries like Australia, which enjoy a vast land mass and a smallish population. Australian cities once characterized by family-friendly neighborhoods are now dominated by dense apartments and condominiums. Planning regulations now add 55% to the price of a home in Sydney, according to a recent Reserve Bank of Australia study. In greater Sydney, the median home price recently passed A$2 million (approximately US$1.3 million). This is higher relative to incomes than in Los Angeles, London, New York, Singapore, and Washington. Even Adelaide, geographically isolated and far from a dynamic global business locale, has higher prices, based on income, than Seattle, one of the world’s most dynamic tech hubs. According to projections from the Urban Taskforce, apartments will make up half of Sydney’s dwellings mid-century, whereas only one quarter of Sydney dwellings will be family-friendly detached homes. Young people are most impacted by this policy regime. In the U.S., homeownership for people under 35 has fallen fairly steadily since the Great Recession of 2008 and is now half that of people over 45. Similarly, in Australia, the percentage of households aged 25 to 34 owning homes has dropped from more than 60% in 1981 to only 45% in 2016. Similar trends are seen in other high-income countries, including Ireland, where only a third of millennials own a home, compared with almost two-thirds of baby boomers when they were the same age. At least one-third of British millennials are likely to remain renters permanently. Much of the same is occurring in the U.S. Whereas in 1969, the median price of a home cost about five years of a young adult’s income, today it costs nearly nine years. A new Institute for Family Studies report, “Homes For Young Families: A Pro-Family Housing Agenda,” says that since 1970, the share of young adults who own the home they live in has declined from 50% to around 25-30%. Ignoring Preferences In advocating such urban containment and other high-density housing policies, planners, backed by academia and most big media, set themselves against the overwhelming preferences of the public for less density and more spacious housing. Judge Glock, who is now affiliated with the Manhattan Institute, has noted that in Census Bureau data since 1950, the average density of the major continuously built-up urban areas has dropped from 6,000 people per square mile to 3,000. In recent years, smaller metropolitan areas have been growing the fastest, while net domestic migration is away from areas of higher density to areas of lower density. Since 1950, the share of U.S. population in core cities has fallen from 24% to under 15%. Even in California, despite government resistance, virtually all the growth over the last decade has been in farther-flung suburbs. As elsewhere, the preference for single-family homes is “ubiquitous,” according to recent research by Jessica Trounstine at the University of California, Merced. “Across every demographic subgroup analyzed,” she observes, respondents preferred single-family home developments by a wide margin. Relative to single-family homes, apartments are viewed as “decreasing property values, increasing crime rates, lowering school quality, increasing traffic, and decreasing desirability.” Once, it was widely suspected that young people would head to big core cities like New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Denver. But surveys reveal that nearly three in five younger people see homeownership as an essential part of the American dream, while two-thirds favor suburbs as their preferred residence. Three out of four Californians, according to a poll by former Obama campaign pollster David Binder, opposed legislation that banned single-family zoning. A big driver of suburban growth is minorities and immigrants. In the 1950s and 1960s, mass suburbanization was widely associated with “white flight” and discrimination against minorities. But in the past decade, over 90% of all suburban growth in the U.S. came from minorities; currently, more than three-quarters of all African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians in major metropolitan areas in the U.S. live in the suburbs. Similar patterns are also evident in Canada, Australia, and the U.K. Today, most high-income countries are primarily suburban. A Statistics Canada analysis of 2021 census results indicates that more than 75% of the population lives in the suburbs, which absorbed more than 80% of the growth between 2016 and 2021. Even in transit-rich and land-short Japan, residents of Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya are dispersing away from the urban core to suburban and exurban areas after these cities nearly monopolized national population growth over the previous decade. Much the same can be said of Seoul, South Korea, which is even denser than the Japanese megacities. An analysis of the 53 U.S. major metropolitan areas finds that more than 85% of residents live in suburban or exurban neighborhoods and that more than 90% of the population growth since 2010 has been in the suburbs and exurbs. These choices underscore an analysis of Canadian poll results by Sotheby’s, which suggests a “disconnect” between urban planning and consumer preferences: The “picture is of young urban families overwhelmingly preferring detached houses, and decidedly not the condominiums into which planners are driving them.” As Sotheby’s puts it, “The report dispels myths about young, urban families’ housing preferences.” Among Americans under 35 who do buy homes, four-fifths choose single-family detached houses. According to a recent National Homebuilders Association report, over 66%, including those living in cities, prefer a house in the suburbs. Almost two-thirds of U.S. millennials (25 to 44) favor being owners, which is also the case in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. The future vision of the planners has little attraction among the public. Upward Mobility or Neo-Feudalism? Whatever their desires, without an affordable home, millennials and Gen Z will face a formidable challenge in boosting their net worth. Homes today account for roughly two-thirds of the wealth of middle-income Americans; homeowners have a median net worth more than 40 times that of renters. Not surprisingly, most young people still believe in creating wealth through ownership. Yet rather than allowing for greater dispersal of wealth, as was the case in previous decades, the decline of housing affordability is a critical factor driving inequality, notes a recent study by Bank for International Settlements (Berne) economist Gianni La Cava. In more historically feudal Great Britain, land prices have risen dramatically over the past decade, and less than 1% of the population owns half of all the land. On the continent, farmland is increasingly concentrated while urban real estate has fallen into the hands of a small cadre of corporate owners and the mega-wealthy. The left-wing economist Thomas Piketty has identified high housing costs as a driver of increasing inequality even in purported social democracies like Germany and France. This is also the case in the U.S., where about 71% of the increase in housing wealth between 2010 and 2020 was gained by high-income households, according to the National Association of Realtors. Increasingly, home ownership relies on the classic feudal formula – being born into “the funnel of privilege.” In the U.S., millennials are three times as likely as boomers to count on inheritance for their retirement. Among the youngest cohort, those ages 18–22, over 60% see inheritance as their primary source of support as they age. In high-price markets like Los Angeles and Orange County, California, close to 40% of loans rely on family money for qualification, up from 25% in 2011. Threat to Democracy Most democratic or republican societies in history – in Athens, Rome, the Netherlands, Britain, France, North America, Oceania – were created and sustained by a broad property-owning middle class. In the twentieth century, middle-class asset growth was accomplished in large part by the expansion of an urban footprint beyond the city core, allowing many more citizens to buy property in spacious, safe environments offering a measure of privacy. The ideal of broadly dispersed property ownership has long been promoted by politicians, both right and left, in most high-income countries. “A nation of homeowners, of people who own a real share in their land, is unconquerable,” said President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He saw homeownership as critical not only to the economy but to democracy and the very idea of self-government. Today, the trend towards democratization of landownership is being reversed, with more and more people being pushed into living in rented apartments or houses, with little chance of gaining financial independence. An economy where most people rely upon wealth transfers from the more fortunate cannot easily coexist with a tradition of individual initiative and self-governance. At the very least, the drive to create lifetime renters and forced densification sets a stage for a future political conflict and social disruption, particularly for the younger generation. In a Harvard poll of 18- to 29-year-olds this year, housing ranked as the third-most important issue overall, after inflation and health care. In California, almost 70% of residents consider housing costs a major concern, while in Britain, housing rose to be one of the top five issues for voters, well ahead of defense, security, poverty, and crime. The housing affordability crisis impacts a host of life decisions. Studies of the U.S. have found that higher house prices had a direct impact on the decision of couples to have children. Research in Germany and across 18 European and North American nations also found that high housing prices defer family formation, leading to lower fertility as well as marriage rates, particularly among the working class. On the flip side, a new study by the Federal Reserve Board reports that homeowners are not only more affluent than renters, they are also physically and mentally healthier, vote more often, and their children achieve higher levels of education. Many advocates of forced densification and renting justify their views around “green” and “sustainability” concerns. The environmental magazine Grist has envisioned “a hero generation” that will escape the material trap of suburban living and work that engulfed their parents. One magazine editor proudly declared herself a part of the GINK generation (as in “green inclinations, no kids”) that she said meant not only a relatively care-free and low-cost adult life, but also “a lot of green good that comes from bringing fewer beings onto a polluted and crowded planet.” Less motivated by planetary concern, major Wall Street investors are also focusing on crowding people into small spaces and a life of permanent rentership. Britain’s Lloyds Bank and BlackRock have placed multi-billion-dollar bets on buying homes for the rental market. In the first quarter of 2021, investors accounted for roughly one out of every seven homes bought, a marked increase from previous years. A notion embraced by some financial groups as well as greens is one of a rentership society where people remain renters for life, enjoying their video games or attending to their houseplants, never knowing the pleasure of having a real garden or backyard of their own. It might assure a steady profit for the landlord class, but it would destroy the dream of ownership for the average person. The broader effect may resemble a modern form of feudalism, where both inherited wealth and institutional ownership, often the Church, concentrate control over housing. Need for Reform If unchecked, the pattern of declining ownership and rising prices for housing could shape the politics of the future, particularly among young people. Not surprisingly, many renters tend to favor leftist policies such as rent control and housing subsidies. The development of a class of permanent renters seems ideal for fomenting class warfare directed at an ever-shrinking number of owners, by a vast majority with no real assets, and little chance of getting any. Ultimately, the battle over land and property will define our future. We either accommodate hope among those in the next generation or force them to accept a lifetime of rental serfdom and permanent subservience to the state, or big capital, or both. As Conor Dougherty of The New York Times put it, “For all the focus on billionaires and stock prices, it’s home values that are a primary source of wealth inequality and the root of a generational schism between the housing-rich baby boomers and young adults today.” He quotes Edward Glaeser, a premier housing economist at Harvard, who said that the housing crisis has become “a huge hindrance on the quest for well-being and the pursuit of happiness.” We're proud to make our journalism accessible to everyone, but producing high-quality investigative pieces still comes at a cost.

Title: Economic Shifts Are Impacting Opportunities For Self-Directed IRAs

ByEric Satz ByEric Satz, Forbes Councils Member. Eric Satz is Founder and CEO of AltoIRA, which provides investment access with retirement savings to private market assets for all. Self-directed individual retirement accounts (IRAs) allow investors to put their retirement savings in private market assets like real estate, private equity, venture capital and crypto. The demand for self-directed IRAs has steadily grown as it has become easier for retail investors to open these accounts and tap into alternative markets. Anticipated major economic shifts will likely accelerate this trend in investor preferences. Investors must navigate several challenges in 2025 that make private market investment strategies through a self-directed IRA more appealing. Inflation has been stubbornly high since the Covid-19 pandemic. Prices could rise even more throughout 2025 due to tariffs and a global trade war. Consumers expect inflation to rise as high as 6.5% by year-end, according to an April 2025 survey from the University of Michigan. Inflation badly damages the returns of traditional fixed-income investments like bonds. It can also be a drag on stock market returns. On the other hand, physical assets like real estate hold their value during inflationary periods. Market interest rates are still high by recent historical standards, despite Federal Reserve rate cuts at the end of 2024. The Fed may need to keep rates high or even increase them to battle ongoing inflation. That would reduce bond prices and squeeze profit margins for companies, hurting their stock prices. Certain private market assets have more room to navigate high interest rates. Private credit funds may issue floating-rate debt, which allows them to earn more when rates go up, versus fixed-rate bonds that are locked in. Market volatility and uncertainty remain high as investors don’t know what to expect under new government policies. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, is around its highest level since 2022. Diversification across assets and markets remains the best protection against severe losses as it limits exposure to one area. Private market assets have a low correlation to traditional markets and can smooth out performance. For example, a hedge fund following a long-short strategy could still earn money during market declines, balancing out stock losses. Investors are adjusting their behaviors, portfolios and retirement plans in the face of economic changes. Preqin, a financial data analytics company recently acquired by BlackRock, forecasts that the global private asset market will nearly double over the next few years, going from $16.8 trillion in 2023 to $29.2 trillion in 2029. Financial research sheds light on the value of using a different approach. A KKR study at the end of 2022 compared risk and returns from 1927 to 2021 for a portfolio of 40/30/30 stocks, bonds and private market assets, versus a standard 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds. The portfolio with private market assets had higher average annual returns with less volatility, especially during periods of high inflation. Historically, inflation and market uncertainty create fear, pushing investors to more stable physical assets. While gold is a popular choice when investors are scared, other alternatives such as infrastructure and real estate offer similar protection. More importantly, they can generate income, whereas precious metals do not. Investors concerned about the 2025 economic trends could benefit in several ways by opening a self-directed IRA (SDIRA) for their retirement savings. • Tax Advantages: An SDIRA offers the same tax benefits as a traditional IRA: tax-deferred growth and an upfront tax deduction on contributions. Investors can tap into alternative markets while saving on taxes. • Diversification: Investors reduce risk and the chance of significant losses by adding uncorrelated assets to a portfolio. A self-directed IRA with alternative assets does so by not having all eggs in the traditional market basket. • Long-Term Growth: Many alternative investments offer higher growth potential. While these investments require a long-term focus, they can outperform the stock market over time. • Inflation Protection: Alternative assets perform especially well when inflation is high. An SDIRA provides this protection for retirement investors. At Alto, we strive to make investment options easy and cost-effective. For example, investors can now open an SDIRA in minutes thanks to online platforms like AltoIRA. The coming months will force investors to manage inflation, uncertainty and interest rate risk, a painful combination. Fortunately, modern investment strategies and capabilities are up to the task. Through an SDIRA, investors can tap into alternative markets previously only available to high-net-worth individuals. These other assets provide further diversification and are another hedge against economic risks. Investors should consult with their financial professionals to see how to optimize their portfolio for current market conditions and determine what role an SDIRA could play in expanding their retirement plan.

Title: Why the Government is banking on household batteries

Latest Topics The Nightly Topics Households will increasingly be doing the heavy lifting to manage Australia’s energy transition as the cost of building new poles and wires soars. On Friday, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) revealed that for the first time household solar and batteries will play a much more important role in the nation’s energy roadmap. According to AEMO, ‘consumer energy resources’ (CER) will transition from being an input to the grid, i.e., via exported solar in the middle of the day, to becoming an important component of demand management via the networking of household batteries. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters. Get the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox. Australia is increasingly reliant on intermittent renewable resources for its energy mix, with as much as 40 per cent of power contributed from wind and solar, both rooftop and utility scale. 1 in 3 Australian households have rooftop solar, and when added to commercial rooftop solar arrays provide 25 gigawatts of energy. By comparison, Australia’s largest coal fired power plant, Eraring, contributes 2.9gW. But the excess of power created in the middle of the day has meant the economics of power generation has fundamentally changed, sending prices negative for hours and placing a potentially destabilising amount of load on the grid. As part of the Government’s net zero ambitions to get to 82 per cent renewable generation, an additional 11gw of energy will be added to the grid, much of which will also be delivered into the system during the middle of the day. According to Tim Buckley, a director at Climate Energy Finance and a former director at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, too much production could trigger the kind of blackout that shut down Spain’s and Portugal’s grid for a day. “Probably the biggest lesson out of Spain, was they’ve got one of the highest renewable energy penetrations in the developed world, but one of the lowest battery capacities in the world,” Mr Buckley said “We need batteries to time shift demand from when solar is generating to when consumers are demanding it, and that is invaluable for grid stability.” Labor has committed $2.3 billion to subsidise the take-up of 1 million household batteries by 2030, providing up to 30 per cent off the upfront cost of installing eligible small-scale battery systems. While Mr Buckley worried that adding 1 million batteries in such a short time frame could create the kind of scramble for unskilled operators that were the worst part of the Rudd government’s Pink Batts scheme, he said the speed with which batteries could be added to the network made them a far more efficient model than other large scale generation investments. “Building transmission takes 10 years. Building nuclear takes 20 years. Building a utility battery takes 18 months to two and a half years, if you have to include connection. But an electrician can install a solar and battery combo behind the meter in one week,” he said. That could mean the shift to renewable energy could occur at a much faster rate and for less money than originally envisaged. The Government’s Rewiring the Nation project allocates $19b to help build 4,581 km of new transmission lines to connect so called Renewable Energy Zones (REZ) to major capitals. But AEMO’s s Draft 2025 Electricity Network Options Report revealed construction costs on some projects had jumped as much as 55 per cent in the past two years driven by supply chain constraints, workforce shortages, and the sheer scale and complexity of new projects. Sustained community pushback had also meant many projects faced longer delays, and more community consultation before being approved. Mr Buckley said things had changed drastically since Chris Bowen’s clarion call that there was “no transition without transmission,” in Labor’ first term. “AEMO is acknowledging that they have massively underestimated batteries. It is a quantum leap forward in AEMO thinking. The integrated system plan was a brilliant roadmap at a time Australia did not have a roadmap for renewable generation. “What they’ve effectively done this week is said ‘technologies are moving massively, capital costs are moving massively, battery costs have halved, grid transmission costs have doubled, and we need to evaluate the priority,” Mr Buckley said. The push to integrate households into the wider grid may help ease a growing logjam across the network. With rollout of transmission lines delayed by construction restraints and consumer pushback, project developers were increasingly struggling to ensure access to the grid. That was creating economic challenges for financing development, putting some generation projects at jeopardy. Compounding the problem was a hodge-podge of various government agencies that resulted in a complicated approval process. “We’ve now got a situation where we’ve got an alphabet soup of Australian government and state level organisations, and to some degree, rather than having too little resources, we’ve now got the situation where no one’s accountable,” Mr Buckley said. NSW’s 1680 megawatt Waratah battery was a case in point, Mr Buckley said. Funded by global investment giant BlackRock, the battery project was to act as a shock absorber in the system. It’s construction was completed on time, but delayed approvals meant it was missing its revenue targets. “This is the biggest battery in NSW, if even BlackRock can’t get this done, are they going to do it again?” Mr Buckley asked. It is possible the construction of new transmission may not need to be as comprehensive as first envisaged. Increasingly, the providers of household poles and wires, such as Ausgrid, believe they can play a role in connecting renewable projects more efficiently. Ausgrid won the tender to connect Newcastle’s renewable energy zone, meaning wires could be added to existing infrastructure. Distribution networks, such as Ausgrid, are designed for maximum loads, meaning they are underutilised as much as 70 per cent of the time. That could allow them to carry the newly installed capacity rather than it be connected to new, expensive transmission networks. Mr Buckley said poles and wires were already Australia’s largest asset at a value of $105b. “I would rather reassess and actually optimise the grid, rather than spending $20b that will become $40b on new transmission,” he said.

Title: Tether invests $5 billion profit into US companies while holding $120 billion in US debt

Tether's $5 billion profit reinvestment fuels Bitcoin innovation, brain-interface breakthroughs, and decentralized media. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has disclosed that it has reinvested around $5 billion of its profits into US-based companies and infrastructure over the past two years. In a May 26 post on X, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino disclosed that the company has made significant investments across American businesses and emerging technologies, reflecting what many described as a “pro-America” strategy. According to Ardoino, the investments cover a range of sectors, including decentralized media, neuroscience, and Bitcoin mining. Notable recipients include Rumble, a video-sharing platform; Blackrock Neurotech, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup; and several Bitcoin mining firms such as Swan Bitcoin. In one of its most significant moves, Tether acquired over 100 million Class A shares of Rumble for $770 million in January to support decentralized content platforms. Since then, the USDT issuer has collaborated with Rumble to launch a non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet. Another $200 million was funneled into Blackrock Neurotech in April 2024. The funding has reportedly supported medical breakthroughs, including efforts to restore patient communication abilities through brain-implanted devices. The company is also backing Bitcoin infrastructure. It has started allocating current and future hashrate to OCEAN, a mining pool operated by Mummolin Inc., a Wyoming-based firm. However, its relationship with Swan Bitcoin has become strained, with a legal dispute now underway. Beyond these equity investments, Tether has built a prominent position in US Treasuries. The company holds over $120 billion in total exposure through direct purchases, money market funds, and reverse repo agreements. This makes Tether the 19th-largest holder of US Treasury bills globally, surpassing Germany’s $111.4 billion exposure, based on US Treasury Department data. The assets serve as its stablecoin reserves and are critical in maintaining USDT’s dollar peg. Most are reportedly held at Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading US financial institution. Meanwhile, Tether’s aggressive investment strategy follows a record-breaking year. In January, the firm reported over $13 billion in net profits for 2024. These earnings have strengthened its balance sheet and allowed for further expansion in agriculture, sports, and media despite ongoing scrutiny from regulators. While USDT remains the largest stablecoin and the third-biggest crypto asset by market cap, regulatory uncertainty in the US has led Tether to consider issuing a separate stablecoin tailored to comply with forthcoming rules.

Title: Avalanche Active Addresses Hit All-Time High, Will AXAX Price Retest $40?

Avalanche holders expect a bull window that could take assets to levels not reached in months. The network records skyrocketing new users alongside an uptick in trading volume. The surge follows a broader increase in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity and institutional inroads into crypto assets. Avalanche recorded significant gains last week, hitting a new all-time high in active users. According to a Dune report, network addresses soared to 1.95 million after consistently growing in May. This kicks off another bullish trend after the previous attempt in January due to a perceived broader altcoin rally. However, this wave is steered by institutional backing and frenzy in the blockchain gaming ecosystem. The launch of MapleStory Universe, the web3 version of Nexon’s RPG franchise, has boosted network demand, directly impacting sentiments. The game marked over 30 million transactions from 1 million wallets in its test phase, taking it above average in the gaming tier. The platform’s pivot to Avalanche is crucial for performance and scalability and will benefit AVAX holders on a broader scale. Recent activity spikes will drive up demand for staking and gas. While blockchain gaming suffered setbacks in Q1 2025 due to low DeFi activity, industry experts bid a smooth reversal this quarter. Similarly, on-chain data shows non-fungible token (NFT) transactions near the 2 million mark for the first time in two years. This DeFi resurgence has bolstered AVAX holders in the past weeks. When writing, AVAX price trades at $23.15, a 3.5% uptick in 24 hours, while money gains soared above 21%. Following recent network activity, bulls aim to retest the $40 price if it beats the current resistance. The short-term $27 resistance is a key breakout zone for the asset that could lead to a two-phase leap to $34 and $40. Some bulls pitched a parabolic rally to $50, which will rest on huge institutional adoption. Institutional asset manager BlackRock has contributed immensely to Avalanche’s bullish momentum. The $9 trillion asset manager has launched BUIDL, BlackRock’s tokenized US Dollar treasury fund on Avalanche. This allows users to lock up and trade SBUIDL tokens, expanding the ecosystem to wider users. AVA Labs President John Wu lauded the growth in tokenization and BlackRock’s institutional fund. “The financial landscape is undergoing a vast transformation. As more institutions move towards tokenization, we see significant leaps towards transformative digital financial services such as BUIDL that address investor demand and bring to bear blockchain-enabled capabilities and differentiators,” he added.

Title: BlackRock Issues Bitcoin Warning, Says BTC Source Code Could Be Rendered ‘Flawed or Ineffective’ by Quantum Computing

The biggest asset manager in the world has acknowledged the potential of a critical threat that could weigh on Bitcoin (BTC) in the future. In its updated prospectus for its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), BlackRock mentions quantum computing under its “risk factors” section. Quantum computers are considered by many to be a potential threat to Bitcoin due to their theoretical ability to, in the future, override the cryptographic schemes that secure blockchains. While quantum computers have not yet demonstrated an ability to come anywhere close to threatening Bitcoin, BlackRock says it, along with other technological advances, could render the flagship cryptocurrency “flawed and ineffective.” “…In the past, flaws in the source code for digital assets have been exposed and exploited, including flaws that disabled some functionality for users, exposed users’ personal information and/or resulted in the theft of users’ digital assets. The cryptography underlying Bitcoin could prove to be flawed or ineffective, or developments in mathematics and/or technology, including advances in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing, could result in such cryptography becoming ineffective. In any of these circumstances, a malicious actor may be able to compromise the security of the Bitcoin network or take the Trust’s Bitcoin, which would adversely affect the value of the Shares. Moreover, the functionality of the Bitcoin network may be negatively affected such that it is no longer attractive to users, thereby dampening demand for Bitcoin. Even if another digital asset other than bitcoin were affected by similar circumstances, any reduction in confidence in the source code or cryptography underlying digital assets generally could negatively affect the demand for digital assets and therefore adversely affect the value of the Shares. Moreover, because digital assets, including bitcoin, have been in existence for a short period of time and are continuing to develop, there may be additional risks in the future that are impossible to predict as of the date of this prospectus.” BlacRock’s IBIT – which is believed to be the most successful ETF of all time, currently has $70.1 billion worth of Bitcoin backing it.

Title: Indevin sells ex-Villa Maria buildings to BlackRock; wee problem blights rich-lister’s boatshed; garage-dwelling landlord - Property Insider

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Multitrillion-dollar American fund swoops on Māngere vineyard buildings; bladders blight rich-lister’s boatshed; garage-dwelling landlord seeks justice; Fletcher Living on next cladding steps: all in today’s Property Insider column. An entity associated with multitrillion-dollar United States-headquartered BlackRock has bought Auckland’s ex-Villa Maria Estate buildings, previously owned by Marlborough wine business Indevin. On Friday, it was revealed on Markets with Madison that Indevin no longer owned the former winery buildings. Grant Webster, Tourism Holdings’ CEO, talked about his company leasing the property but not from Indevin. He showed off how the premises had been re-purposed for campervan operations and said the tourism business spent $20 million on groundworks alone to create the new giant parking lot. A title search of THL’s new HQ address indicated the owner. Eden Villa Sub Limited Partnership owns 470 Oruarangi Rd, buying from Tomlinson Core Land, owned by Harrogate Trustee, whose directors include Indevin’s Greg Tomlinson. Last August, that limited partnership was formed and the title was transferred, with a mortgage to the Bank of China (New Zealand). When it registered the limited partnership, the email was groupFBGREAFV@blackrock.com. At the first filing in March, the email was changed to BlackRock-NZ@intertrustgroup.com. A BlackRock spokeswoman said from Sydney yesterday that the purchase was a joint venture between that business and Mayfair Group. “Secured off-market via City Logistics Co, the asset offers strategic airport proximity and a significantly underutilised site coverage of 33%. “Improvements were made to the site both before and post- acquisition. Tourism Holdings has consolidated its global headquarters on-site with the signing of a long-term lease – underscoring our confidence in New Zealand’s last-mile logistics sector.” Research from CBRE in March said the transaction was for $63.5m, making it the third largest non-residential New Zealand sale in last year’s second half. Next door on land where grapes once famously grew, Goodman Property Trust plans a $500m+ logistics and warehouse development on the ex-vineyard land. Auckland Council’s rating valuation on the ex-Villa Maria address of 7ha is $39.5m. The THL HQ is not the only BlackRock purchase lately. Last April, a partnership managed and advised by global business BlackRock won consent to buy Auckland land in a $110m deal. The name was not dissimilar to that on the THL HQ title. Eden Puaki Drive Sub Limited Partnership won consent to buy 5.81ha of non-sensitive land at 20 Puaki Dr, Wiri. That partnership is described as “funds managed and advised by entities associated with BlackRock, comprised of entities which are 90% overseas-owned”. Owning one of Auckland’s iconic, historic boatsheds is not without its challenges. Businessman Malcolm Dick wants to demolish one of the 17 all-in-a-row Ngāpipi sheds on the water in Ōrākei and rebuild. His application is up for public input till later next month. Last week, he talked to the Herald from Spain where he had walked part of the Camino with wife Jodie Dick. From there, he told how he paid about $800,000 for the smallest boatshed, which is set back from the water and the street. Due to that property having some land, it attracts those who need to relieve themselves, he said. People urinate around his shed, he complained. “People come along and pee in the corner beside the boatshed, unfortunately.” He wants the new shed to be higher up off the water so it’s not as affected by flooding or coastal inundation. He also wants to build a new boat ramp into the water. Taking up more of the site would perhaps deter those with full bladders, although that was not used to argue in favour of the new scheme. A landlord living in a garage went to the Tenancy Tribunal to get his home out of a fixed-term agreement with a tenant so he could return there. But the tribunal refused him. The unusual circumstances occurred when landlord Graham Mark Shieff tried to get possession of his place back from the tenant. Suppression orders apply to her name, the property address and location. Last August, Shieff told the tenant he needed to sell the property because he was moving to Australia. She has two children who live with her full time and other children who come at weekends. This was a stressful time for her because she then helped with open homes and presenting the property for sale. She felt this was hard on her mental health, the decision said. He got a conditional sale of the house, then suffered health problems resulting in two surgeries, so he had to withdraw the property from the market. He then tried to get back possession to live there. “The landlord cannot now move to Australia and now needs to move back into the premises, which were once his own residential premises. He claims that he is currently living in a garage and it is not suitable for his medical needs,” the April 8 decision said. The tenant has been looking for suitable accommodation elsewhere because she wants to cooperate with the landlord, but has not found anywhere yet. The usual legal position with a fixed-term contract is that the term of the contract will be applied strictly, and it is only in limited circumstances that a court or tribunal will interfere with it. The tribunal dismissed his application, saying the tenant had cooperated with the landlord. Both parties are suffering hardship, whether the fixed term was reduced or not. “They are equally balanced and as such, I am not satisfied that the landlord’s hardship outweighs that of the tenant.” Anne Gibson has been the Herald‘s property editor for 25 years, written books and covered property extensively here and overseas.

Title: Trump may have added 25% iPhone tariff specifically to punish Tim Cook

AAPL: 201.17 ( 0.96 ) Copyright © 2025 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. Tim Cook (left) with Donald Trump in a previous meeting -- image credit: CNBC The extra tariff added to all iPhones imported in the US may not have been about bringing manufacturing back to the US, but specifically to reprimand Tim Cook for skipping a Trump event. On May 23, 2025, Trump announced that Apple would have to pay a 25% tariff on every iPhone imported into the US. AppleInsider noted at the time that it was unusual for Trump to acknowledge that US business would have to pay the fee, instead of inaccurately claiming that foreign countries would. Now according to the New York Times, there appears to have been a reason for Apple being singled out. From May 13 to May 16, Trump was visiting the Middle East and bringing with him representatives of many US companies. Apple was not in attendance. Tump complains about AppleTwo unnamed sources say that Tim Cook declined Trump's invitation to join the trip, and this is said to have irritated the president. What is certain is that Trump repeatedly referred to to Cook's absence during the trip "I mean, Tim Cook isn't here, but you are," Trump commented to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. That was at a Trump event also attended by OpenAI's Sam Altman. Executives from AMD, BlackRock, and Citigroup were also in attendance. It was during the trip when he was in Qatar, that Trump said he "had a little problem with Tim Cook." Then it was following the trip that Trump announced the 25% tariff on iPhones, saying it was because Apple wasn't making the devices in the US. Trump's announcement of the new tariff on his Truth Social platform reportedly surprised his own administration as much as it did Apple. There were of course no details, but subsequently, Trump announced that the tariff would start in June. With the iPhone 17 launch happening in September, Apple will not be able to repeat its previously successful moves to beat tariff deadlines. Ahead of the "reciprocal" tariffs announced in April, Apple accelerated iPhone manufacture and airlifted extra devices into the US. Apple managed to get an exemption from the "reciprocal" tariffs, although Trump later revised that to be a temporary measure. There is also a spurious national security investigation into semiconductors, whose conclusion has been prejudged by the White House and will mean further tariffs. It's not remotely clear whether the new 25% tariff will come entirely on top of whatever other tariffs are introduced or reintroduced. Apple has previously said that it expects to pay out $900 million in tariffs in its current June quarter, but that presupposed there would be no further tariffs. Apple's deteriorating relationship with TrumpApple has not commented on either the tariffs or the New York Times report. Whether or not the tariff was introduced solely as a punishment for Tim Cook, it is part of a significant change in Trump's relationship with Apple. Cook has been both praised and criticized for how he has worked to keep that relationship going and gain Apple exemptions, including donating $1 million of his own money to Trump's inauguration. Recently, however, Cook also declined an invitation to attend a White House technology summit in person, although he did appear in video by satellite.

Title: Aussie Senator Dismisses Bitcoin As A ‘Ponzi Scheme’, Sparks Fierce Community Backlash

Time Published: 2025-05-26T13:02:46Z

Australian Senator Gerard Rennick has attracted the ire of the Bitcoin community following his remarks referring to Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme driven by asset managers like BlackRock, and questioning the top cryptocurrency’s value because it can’t be eaten. Bitcoin (BTC) may be gaining momentum globally, but an Australian politician is still not sold on the asset. “You can’t eat Bitcoin,” Senator Gerard Rennick posited in a recent post, responding to an X user who sarcastically asked for his comments after Bitcoin set a new record high of around $111,800 on May 22. Rennick went on to lambast Bitcoin as a “Ponzi Scheme.” “Bitcoin will ultimately go to a $1 million dollars. Why? Because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply-constrained product,” the Queensland Senator said. He also claimed that Bitcoin and its traders contribute “absolutely nothing” in terms of real-world utility, and that Australia “needs real engineers, not financial engineers.” Yes I do – Bitcoin will ultimately go to a $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby Blackrock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product. What exactly will this product produce? Absolutely nothing and nor will the thousands of people… Bitcoiners and industry commentators were quick to fire back at the Senator’s remarks. The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) noted that Rennick’s comments about Bitcoin “reveal a deep misunderstanding,” warning that misinformed takes from public officials could lead to “bad policy.” “This isn’t about whether Australians can use Bitcoin—we already do,” ABIB postulated. “This is about whether our government is capable of understanding how Bitcoin can enrich the nation… The door is open for ongoing education. The question is: are you willing to walk through it?” Unchained podcast host Laura Shin asked the Senator, “You also can’t eat the internet, so do you oppose that too?” As more X users commented, the Senator slammed critics, saying, “You’re disappointed about what a politician thinks about Bitcoin? Seriously? I thought you wanted less political interference. Why does it matter what I think? Invest as you will.” Bitcoiners often speak out when well-known people adopt an anti-Bitcoin stance. Just a couple of weeks ago, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs was criticized by the Bitcoin community after vetoing a bill that would have allowed the state to hold Bitcoin as part of its official reserves.

The Singapore-based firm will allocate at least 5% of its global headcount to the new U.S. office as it attempts to nab itself a broker-dealer registration and potential FINRA membership. To lead the effort at its U.S. office, Caladan has hired a three-member team led by Gian-Paul Caccia, with experience across both crypto-native and traditional financial institutions, including crypto exchange Coinbase, asset manager BlackRock, investment bank Cowen Digital, and Bank of America. Their mandate includes building institutional partnerships, advancing compliance strategy, and deepening regulatory engagement, according to a statement shared exclusively with Decrypt. Caladan described its U.S. entry as part of a broader strategy to link Asia’s crypto market infrastructure with growing institutional momentum in the United States, seeking to serve as a conduit for liquidity, regulatory dialogue, and cross-border strategy. “It’s not just about operating in the U.S., we want to help shape the rules-based future of crypto markets with full transparency and accountability,” Julia Zhou, COO at Caladan, said in the statement. Caladan’s U.S. entry comes just as President Donald Trump’s administration tears up the rulebook that once kept firms like it at bay. Since taking office in January, Trump has appointed pro-crypto SEC Chair Paul Atkins, dropped multiple lawsuits against digital asset firms, and reversed enforcement-heavy policies upheld by the previous administration. Nexo, the crypto lender that exited the U.S. market in 2022, citing “regulatory dead ends,” also announced its return last month, crediting Trump’s pro-innovation stance for the renewed access. The administration has also hosted a White House crypto summit featuring top industry figures and backed the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin framework that cleared the Senate last week and now heads to the House. Even before his presidential inauguration, Trump launched a meme coin on Solana to tap into crypto culture. Last week’s private gala for top Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin holders turned that gesture into a focal point for political controversy.

On May 23, Senator Gerard Rennick dismissed Bitcoin as a “Ponzi scheme,” sparking immediate backlash from crypto industry groups and users alike. “Bitcoin will ultimately go to a $1 million dollars. Why? Because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply-constrained product,” Rennick tweeted in response to a user who sarcastically asked for his “special comments” on the topic. “You can’t eat Bitcoin,” the Senator added. Yes I do - Bitcoin will ultimately go to a $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby Blackrock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product. What exactly will this product produce? Absolutely nothing and nor will the thousands of people… — Senator Gerard Rennick (@SenatorRennick) May 23, 2025 The Queensland senator, who now leads the populist People First Party after leaving the Liberal National Party in 2024, went on to argue that Bitcoin and its traders contribute "absolutely nothing" in terms of real-world utility. “Australia needs real engineers, not financial engineers,” he said. “We need infrastructure that’s [sic] delivers essential services particularly energy, water and transport.” Bitcoiners and industry advocates fired back immediately to the Senator’s comments. The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) dismissed Rennick’s remarks as “a deep misunderstanding,” warning that "misinformed" takes from public officials could lead to “bad policy.” “This isn’t about whether Australians can use Bitcoin—we already do,” ABIB said in its response. “This is about whether our government is capable of understanding how Bitcoin can enrich the nation… The door is open for ongoing education. The question is: are you willing to walk through it?” As the thread gained traction, the Senator brushed off criticism, saying “You’re disappointed about what a politician thinks about Bitcoin? Seriously? I thought you wanted less political interference. Why does it matter what I think? Invest as you will.” Rennick’s remarks followed Bitcoin’s recent surge to an all-time high above $111,000 and came just two weeks after Andrew Charlton was named Assistant Minister for Science, Technology, and the Digital Economy by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Charlton is expected to lead Australia’s digital asset reform push, including a licensing regime that would bring major exchanges under the Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) framework with draft legislation due later this year. The government also plans to introduce safeguards against debanking and align the framework with global standards like the EU’s MiCA and Singapore’s Payment Services Act.

Title: Joker Geoeconomics and the Fight Over Global Ports

Full Content:
On Wednesday at the company’s annual general meeting Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison reiterated its commitment to obtain multiple regulatory approvals before moving forward with the sale of its 43 global ports outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. Hutchison is facing heavy pressure in China and Panama over the proposed $23 billion deal with US investment firm BlackRock and the Italian tycoon-controlled Mediterranean Shipping Company, leading to questions over whether the deal will proceed at all and if so, in what form? The Trump administration worked closely with BlackRock during the lead up to the proposed sale and helped instigate it with its pressure on Hutchinson, showcasing that this is essentially a hostile takeover attempt spearheaded by Washington. China is now countering with pressure on Hutchison, but it remains unclear if Beijing will opt for the nuclear option that could damage Hong Kong’s financial center standing. More on that below, but first a quick recap of the proposed deal. CK Hutchison Holdings in March announced that it was selling all its overseas ports, including two at the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock in a deal worth $23 billion. It might be a fair price for Hutchison and its founder Li Ka-shing, the ninety-six-year-old billionaire who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2000, but as a recent paper from Global Capital Allocation highlights: A defining feature of the current global system is the willingness of the Great Powers to use their economic and financial strength to achieve geopolitical or economic goals. This rise of geoeconomics is a major departure from the last twenty years of policy making and has the potential to dramatically alter the landscape of the global economic and financial system. And so despite Hutchison’s aims to refocus the debate on legal due process and shareholder interests (it’s now offer roughly $3 per share as a bonus to shareholders if the deal goes through), there’s no escaping the fact that the proposed deal is right in the middle of the geoeconomic war between Washington and Beijing and will have major implications regardless of which way it goes. China in a Bind? Beijing’s alarmed reaction to the Hutchison deal is often depicted in Western media as heavy handed, and it does appear as though the government in China was caught off guard, but it’s important to note that BlackRock in this case is mostly synonymous with the US, and the proposed sale is part of the US effort to kneecap China’s economy through sanctions, bans, tariffs, and setting up roadblocks for Chinese investments and companies around the world. While Team Trump was holding meetings with BlackRock, it was also putting the squeeze on Hutchison. From the WSJ: In the days before finalizing the deal, Fink held calls with Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and national security adviser Michael Waltz, ultimately garnering the administration’s blessing, according to people close to the deal. Behind the scenes, Hutchinson executives had grown uneasy that a hostile Trump administration could make life hard on their sprawling global conglomerate… Hutchinson executives had weighted selling these and dozens more ports before, but the timing wasn’t right. With Trump applying pressure — and Hutchinson shares trading at a substantial discount to the company’s underlying assets — that changed. …executives were surprised by Trump’s decision to revoke special trade privileges for Hong Kong, and Panama authorities had just announced an audit of Hutchinson’s contract. Hutchison was also going to get hit hard by “Liberation Day.” Chief among China’s concerns with the Hutchinson deal is that the new ownership could, under pressure from Washington, raise prices on or refuse Chinese ships or allow the US to militarize the ports and use them to enact a maritime blockade of China. These fears are not unfounded. The US is already actively working towards some of those goals while having discussed the others. And we can see how global chokepoints and the ports in the proposed deal overlap: So criticism of the deal in China was swift. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of China issued a strongly worded comment on the matter yesterday, directly stating that the transaction is not an “ordinary commercial activity,” but rather a hegemonic act in which the United States employs state power—through coercion, pressure, and inducements—to seize the legitimate rights and interests of another country, all masked as “commercial behavior” and essentially representing power politics. Here are some of the legitimate concerns raised by Chinese officials in the commentary: Once the Panama Canal is “Americanized” and “politicized,” the United States will undoubtedly use it for political purposes to advance its own political agenda, and China’s shipping and trade will inevitably be controlled by the US. If the United States were to implement measures such as selective capacity restrictions or imposing “political surcharges,” Chinese companies’ logistics costs and supply chain stability would face great risks. Some netizens also noted that through this deal, BlackRock would control about 10.4% of the world’s container terminal throughput, joining the ranks of the world’s top three port operators, and it is entirely possible that it would work in concert with US policies to suppress China, raising costs for Chinese cargo and squeezing the market share of Chinese shipping companies. Moreover, this transaction creates a major gap in the port network that Chinese companies have built up over the years, thereby allowing American interests to erode their overseas development advantages. Other netizens even point out that the United States might use this transaction as a “template” to spark a wave of port mergers and acquisitions worldwide through political pressure, thereby controlling more critical ports globally and employing “long-arm jurisdiction” to suppress China, leaving Chinese vessels with “no reliable haven.” This is by no means mere fearmongering. According to a draft executive order from the US government, plans are already underway to charge Chinese vessels special docking fees, and the US will urge its allies to take similar measures, otherwise facing retaliation. If all of the United States’ calculated moves succeed, they will undoubtedly impact China’s shipbuilding, shipping, foreign trade, and even the Belt and Road Initiative, and will directly affect Hong Kong’s efforts to consolidate and elevate its position as an international shipping and trade center, while threatening and undermining the normal global order and safety of shipping and trade. Beijing responded by launching a regulatory review of the deal —although the company’s base is in Hong Kong and there aren’t direct Chinese assets involved in the sale — and said the deal shouldn’t be implemented without its approval. That was in response to a WSJ report earlier in the month that said there are discussions to exclude two Panama Canal ports as a way to appease Beijing. Can China Block the Sale? No according to Bloomberg, which claims that Beijing can pressure Hutchison but that “because the deal involves only overseas assets it is unlikely to need Beijing’s sign-off.” It also notes that CK Hutchison and sister company CK Asset Holdings Ltd. are registered in the Cayman Islands. There’s a little more to it than that, though, according to Reuters: The State Administrative Market Regulation Authority could have extra-territorial jurisdiction by applying the anti-monopoly law, if a deal outside mainland China has the effect of eliminating or restricting competition in China’s domestic market. Authorities could also use the Measures for Security Review or Foreign Investments, implemented in 2021, to examine foreign direct investments in important fields relating to national security, including infrastructure. Felix Ng, a partner at law firm Haldanes, said the measures removed the exclusion of acquisitions of interest held by foreign companies, “suggesting that PRC authorities may have the power to review foreign-to-foreign transactions if the target involves PRC-related entities”. There’s also the nuclear option: the 2020 National Security Law, which goes after “terrorism,” subversives, secessionists, and colluders with foreign forces.” Could that come into play? “Given the sensitivities, there would be room for further investigation under the broad sweep of the National Security Law, particularly over collusion or espionage,” said Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong law school. The offence of collusion would have to involve a person or company intending to disrupt the policies of the Chinese or Hong Kong governments to create serious consequences, Young said. But should China go this route to nix the deal, it would involve it taking a much more state-heavy approach in Hong Kong, which could hurt the financial center’s global standing. As of now, it is third in the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City and London. One can imagine Washington is pleased. It’s like an economic Ukraine or Taiwan. If Beijing acts to block the sale, the US will no doubt hit the gas on more economic isolation efforts, painting China as unfriendly to outside business interests. That’s not to say the strategy makes much sense or will work, but that’s the way it looks. Why Could Panama Ports Be Excluded? In April, Panama’s controller general created another headache for the sale when he claimed that CK Hutchison had not properly renewed its contract to operate the ports in 2021 and owed the government $300 million in fees. The allegation could significantly delay the BlackRock deal and, according to the New York Times, could allow more time for Beijing to “meddle” in the proposed deal. In the meantime, the “main investor” of the group seeking to buy the global ports is considering excluding the Panama ports from the rest of the deal. Gianluigi Aponte and his son Diego Aponte, the Italian tycoons who control Mediterranean Shipping Co., are reportedly having discussions about moving ahead with the purchase of 41 ports on five continents, leaving BlackRock and Hutchison to figure out the disputes over the other two. Even at just 41 ports, such a deal could have enormous impact—unless we believe the Aponte family in a US satellite state is willing to stand up to Washington when Uncle Sam comes demanding a crackdown on Chinese ships. Joker Geoeconomics As BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink said in his recent annual letter to investors, ports ‘will define the future’ and are as critical to future infrastructure of the global economy as data centers and power grids. The world’s largest asset manager’s wager that despite the new era of geoeconomics, global trade will continue to rise enough to justify this port investment, might pan out. But it’s also a bet on the safe stewardship of the US empire, and that’s far more risky as the US embraces chaos. Michael Roberts points out in a recent post “Geonomics, nationalism and trade,” the US is attempting to muscle its way out of a profitability crisis: And there are few rules—if any—in pursuit of that goal. The Hutchison-BlackRock ports deal is just one piece of the larger strategy—if one can call it that. It’s more a mash up of kleptocratic short cuts masquerading as one. Here’s Roberts: This hegemonic crude power politics is now being made logical and even advantageous to all Americans by right-wing economists. In a new book called Industrial Policy for the United States, Marc Fasteau and Ian Fletcher, two economists beloved by the Maga crowd. …F&F’s apparently ‘neutral’ industrial strategy is no such thing when it comes to China because as they say, China is “the first combined military and economic threat America has faced in more than 200 years.” They put it bluntly: “An increasing number of Chinese industries are in acute rivalry with high-value American industries, and China’s gains are our losses. The US cannot remain a military superpower without being an industrial superpower.” This sums up the motivation for the switch from neoclassical laisser faire, free trade economics that has dominated the academic ivory towers of economic departments and international economic agencies up to now. America’s (and Europe’s) economic domination has been weakened to the point that there is a significant risk that China will rule globally within a generation. So the gloves are off. But there are at least a few issues. First off, industrial strategy isn’t helped by the destruction of government services, further unleashing parasitic finance, and simply going all in on military and homeland security budgets. Sure, all the ICE brutality might make for a more terrified and exploitable workforce at home that will help further decimate labor, but it doesn’t do much for rebuilding industry. Furthermore, Roberts points out the following: F&F’s industrial strategy will not work. In economies, productivity growth and lower costs depend on increased investment in productivity-enhancing sectors. But in capitalist economies that depends on the willingness of profit-driven companies to invest more. If profitability is low and/or falling, they will not do so. That’s the experience of the last two decades, in particular. F&F want a return to war-time policies and cold war strategy to build domestic industry, science and military forces. But that would only work if there was a massive switch to direct public investment through publicly owned companies with a national industrial plan. F&F don’t want that and neither does Trump. And so we’re left Washington engaging in more shakedowns like the Hutchison deal and tariff threats. As one of China’s most respected international relations scholars, Wang Jisi, said recently: “When the world’s most powerful country abandons its principles and loses any sense of morality, it becomes exceedingly dangerous and may inflict great harm upon the world.” I don’t know of states having a sense of “morality,” but the great harm part sounds spot on. That leads to the unenviable task of confronting an actor with little to no rules without plunging the world into even deeper chaos. I don’t think that the Chinese have a choice here really. They have to hit back and hit back hard like they did in Trump’s recently attempted trade war. If they do not but let it all go, then guaranteed there would be people in Trump’s Cabinet that will take that as a sign of Chinese weakness and then start pushing to introduce harsher measures against China – such as banning all Chinese ships going through the Panama Canal. With a Trump Cabinet, that would sound like a very reasonable thing to do. From what I have seen the past few months, they go for maximum pressure and only haul back when somebody pressures them. We saw that with Yemen and even China itself and I think that they are going to do the same with Russia. But when nations buckle, then for them that is a sign to wring more concessions from them. Another example is that ambush of the South African President with charges of white genocide. Now the Trump regime is demanding easier access for US corporations in South Africa and for them to sell the US their minerals with them to be processed in the US and not in SA. Honestly, I think China is too big for BlackRock to take on, but USA and EU it can already squeeze dry like a lemon. How’s this for a new multipolar world: China, Russia and BlackRock? Local opposition to creating a policy backdoor for Starlink to sneak through to enter the South African market is fierce. As usual, the local agents of Imperialism are in strong support of Starlink’s proposed entry, employing the tired “we need investors to create jobs” narrative to hoodwink the public. As you rightly point out, Trump and his band of anarchists see willingness to offer concessions as a signal to extract not just more concessions, but total capitulation. That fiasco of our president bending the knee in the Oval office last week was all people needed to see to confirm what many have quietly whispered ie that the ANC is estranged from its revolutionary mission and is now fervent ally global capital. I think your right. As for “Can China Block the Sale? No according to Bloomberg […],” ask Jack Ma about what China can and cannot do now that he is walking around now. China will certainly hit back. There will be an escalation around the world, with Chinese-controlled ports rejecting American ships, and American-controlled ports doing the same to Chinese ships. If that should happen, American consumers will be hit very hard. Though this post focuses on china i believe that control of the Panama canal might be used to exert pressure to anyone else. Hemispheric dominance and control of the Atlantic. Hardly squeezes China at all, but over 10% of Panama Canal throughput is Chinese. The Wings of the Eagle / Are Albion and Oz cargofromchina.com/shipping-routes/ ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/container-port-throughput statista.com/topics/9943/shipping-ports-in-china/ Foreign Policy is supposed to be an uneasy dance between interests and moral considerations. The US thinks morals are orthogonal to its interests and thus ditches them entirely in its foreign policy stance (even as it lectures other nations about said morals). I doubt morals come into it at all for any country ever. Even the “Christianizing” missions of the 19th century empires were just thin cover for economics. “Any country ever” is a generalization that nicely illustrate the problem. We have a “televised live demonstration” of Judeo-Christian vs Orthodox Christian ways of war (and diplomacy, and foreign policy, and many other things), and some people still fail to see that “morals come into it at all”. Or, maybe, they don’t want to see. The logical end-point of these moves (see Baltic Sea / EU efforts to seize Russian shipping) is warships accompanying shipping flotillas and demanding port access. Given the disparity in shipbuilding capacity, the West will not win that war. This could rapidly descend into UAVs anonymously targeting shipping, which would isolate the Western Hemisphere from the products it cannot make to maintain its population and lifestyle. Operation Gladio shows the limits (or rather their lack). It also shows the prescience of developing the BRI (when competing with the new thallocratic power – China remembers the century of humiliation led by the UK). My guess is China will stall the sale long enough for US rare earth stockpiles to be depleted, and the US high-tech industry begins screaming as it is unable to fulfill its DOD contracts (and loses any competitiveness with the 17.7-million STEM engineering pool-powered Chinese technology juggernaut). I think I recall Yves writing about the Panama Canal area not having sufficient water to operate the canal at a formerly normal rate. I would be surprised to learn that alternatives are NOT being searched for. Here’s a current article discussing the water shortage. https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2025/05/13/panama-water-scarcity-amid-climate-change-canal-demands/ This part of the link “Geonomics, nationalism and trade”: “Now apparently, geonomics has surfaced to make this hegemonic power politics respectable and ‘realistic’. Liberal democracy and ‘internationalism’ along with liberal economics ie free trade and free markets, is no longer relevant for economists, trained before to promote an economic world of equilibrium, equality, competition and ‘comparative advantage’ for all. That’s out of the window: now economics is about power struggles conducted by states furthering their own national interests.” Mainstream economists could have fooled me that they were “trained” to do anything but focus on equilibrium – attempting to balance situations as neat equations. That said… Power dynamics in economic relations is not something new that needs its own name. The article handled this point of view more diplomatically by using historical context. Overall, there appears to be a batch of mainstream economists who finally notice that power is involved in economics, although it’s state power that is the focus as a manipulator of economic activity. How many decades before they account for the power relations among players all the way down to the relations with customers/clients? Power is a major component of economic relations and, when the powers involved in an economy refuse to be or can’t be held accountable, don’t expect any guiding economic principles that are accountable. In these conditions, politics is not used to produce economic benefits for the masses, but to place blame elsewhere for economic and political rot. Thanks for posting this! I feel like should somehow stick a flag right here with the motto on it of keep an eye on this space. There should be some telling maneuvering here. This feels like the opening play of America, the oligarchic corportocracy, deploying BlackRock to protect it’s vital interests. It will be interesting to see how this goes. But honestly, suddenly being all concerned about Panama, Greenland, and Canada feels like somebody looked in a mirror and finally saw that giant L stuck on their forehead. Dude, when you spend forty years wrecking your own country, the rest going plop and hitting the floor is sort of a forgone conclusion. But whatever. Why wouldn’t Cosco or some other Chinese company simply outbid Blackrock? This sort of behaviour has reliably led to wars ever since the emergence of the European maritime empires at least 500 years ago. Buckle up … Very interesting article. I have paid little attention to global shipping ownership/power plays, this article provides an update for me, for which I’m grateful. I have paid close attention to a lot of other Trump behavior and policy (if. there really is any sound foundational policy). It seems to me their strategy is brute force bludgeoning to achieve submission. I also think, left unchecked for an undetermined period of time, Trump will lead the US to ruin. People are not empowered by his means. Left unsaid in this article: China is pulling away in all areas of green energy AND high speed rail (to name just a couple). Trump wants to return iPhone manufacturing to our shores. And… what else exactly? One doesn’t need Harvard degree in economics to see how this is unfolding. The US needs smart policies of substance, not posturing. One doesn’t need Harvard degree in economics to see how this is unfolding.

Title: Here are the 8 programming languages to know to land a tech job on Wall Street

Time Published: 2025-05-26T08:48:01Z

Big Tech firms like Apple and Amazon have signaled a move away from the complicated coding language C++, but there's still a place for engineers who know it on Wall Street. Apple created Swift to replace its use of C++, the company's primary coding language for its devices. Amazon recently awarded a Stony Brook University professor an approximate $100,000 research grant to continue his work to automate converting existing C++ code to Rust, a coding language created in 2006. Even the White House has joined the conversation around C++, urging software developers to move away from the language due to cybersecurity concerns in a report last year. But the financial space is still "one of the heavy users of C++ that's really doing cutting-edge stuff," one industry executive told Business Insider. High-frequency trading firms and exchanges rely on C++, a notoriously complicated language that can offer more control over the underlying hardware. Citadel Securities, for one, hired a C++ expert Herb Sutter from Microsoft to lead training initiatives on the language and is already embracing a new version of C++ that has yet to be released. Looking at current open technology positions, trading firms Virtu Financial and Hudson River Trading are among the firms also seeking out C++ experience.When asked how prospective hires could demonstrate their C++ skills in a separate interview, Citadel's Sutter said they should talk about what they're looking forward to most in the newer version, C++26, to show their curiosity. "It's important to be able to demonstrate curiosity and knowledge about software advancements — and to show that you understand that there's more than one tool out there and that you know how to use them together," he said. In today's machine-to-machine world, having some experience with programming languages is a must. Coding languages, like Python and Java, are how humans can communicate with computers by providing a set of instructions for a system to execute. As it turns out, not all programming languages are made equal and some are more relevant to certain corners of Wall Street than others. Business Insider has compiled a list of the most-used coding languages through conversations with recruiters, Wall Street tech execs, and industry insiders. We also analyzed job postings to learn about in-demand skill sets. Areas of interest: Applicable across finance firms, job titles, and levels Firms using it: Banks, hedge funds, and investment firms As the fundamental language for engineering work across Wall Street, Python has long been at the top of the skills list for buy- and sell-side firms alike. It has been a favorite at Capital One and Man Group. From visualization to statistical analyses to modeling and machine-learning applications, Python has multiple use cases. It also lends itself to those who don't have deep coding backgrounds because it is flexible and applies to a wide range of users, Ori Ben-Akiva, director of portfolio management at Man Numeric, a quantitative-focused division of the publicly traded hedge fund Man Group, previously told BI. When it comes to data science and machine learning roles, "Python is king of the road," said Stabile, who runs his own recruiting shop called Stabile Search. Areas of interest: Anyone who works with databases, data Firms using it: Almost every financial firm As data becomes more centralized in financial firms' strategies — from marketing to identifying new deal opportunities and analyzing risk — it's helpful to know SQL, which is one of the most common and basic ways to query or pull information from a database. SQL is a relational database language, meaning it's designed to be able to tie different data tables together. For any tasks that have to do with analytics, you'll likely find SQL, Deepali Vyas, global head of fintech, payments, and crypto at Korn Ferry, told BI. Areas of interest: Low-latency applications Firms using it: High-frequency trading players and exchanges For applications and systems where speed (or a fast response time) is the name of the game, experience as a C++ developer is going to come in handy. That's especially true at high-frequency trading firms and exchanges, where companies edge each other out by being microseconds faster than the competition. The coding language has a reputation for being trickier to master than others, and its ability to interact more closely with technical hardware can lead to nasty coding bugs, but it also generally affords the user more control and speed.According to Matt Stabile, a tech recruiter who works with buy-side firms such as Two Sigma and Susquehanna International Group, it's also useful for roles in quantitative finance. Areas of interest: Data visualization, front-office analysts Firms using it: Wealth managers, banks When Wall Street tech execs talk about data, they often divide it into organizing it and finding insights within it. Korn Ferry's Vyas said the latter benefits from tools like Tableau and Power BI, which visualize and contextualize data. These types of graphics are especially useful if you work in wealth management or advisory, where dashboards and data tables are regularly used. Areas of interest: Big banks with more legacy technology Firms using it: Banks and some buy-side firms Like Python, Java is widely used on Wall Street. The coding language secured an early foothold in the world of banking because it was believed to have security features that restricted data access, while also offering portability, or the ability to be transferred between machines. As a result, many big banks are tethered to Java, but other firms like Two Sigma have also relied on the coding language. Areas of interest: App development Firms using it: Fintechs, banks Technically, many of the coding languages on this list — like Python, for example — are open source, or available for developers to use without a proprietary license. But several open-source languages have become more in-demand in recent years, including Go and Rust. When the banking fintech Stash built much of its core banking offering from the ground up in 2022, tech leaders at the company highlighted the use of Go — which they said was picked up quickly by engineers and cut the implementation time for "substantial" new pieces of code to roughly 3.5 days. Fintechs aren't the only financial firms embracing Go and other open source tools. At Blackrock, much of the firm's cloud work was built upon open-source software. Wells Fargo in recent years has embraced Rust and Go as languages the bank is becoming more comfortable with.

Editor Podcasts Jeff Berwick, The Dollar Vigilante Happy Jewish Heritage Month! Brought to you by Jeff Berwickstein, the Mossad/CIA Global Connection Company, and NEOM: Trump & The Techno-rats’ new ‘self-regulated’ fantasy prison. NEOM… a 5-minute city spanning 106 miles, with no cars or streets, and housing 9 million people (because El Salvador will soon be full). It’s what happens when technocrats, Bond villains, and jewish/saudi/zionist billionaires join forces to build a utopia — for themselves — and a sandbox simulation for the rest of us. The acting players are, in no particular order: Elon Musk – visionary of surprise flamethrowers and self-drowning cars, now bringing Neuralink to your prefrontal cortex… whether you like it or not. Larry Fink – the BlackRock warlock who made sure your retirement fund now includes carbon credits and surveillance drones. Jeff Bezos – Amazon overlord who traded warehouse workers for humanoid robots with better bathroom privileges. Sam Altman – the guy who created ChatGPT and now wants to be your digital priest, philosopher, and parole officer. Donald Trump – making NEOM great again, one luxury neural re-education center at a time. Going around doing the same old globalist deals, setting up police states,smart cities, AI surveillance, digital tracking, lethal injections… and more desert Trump Towers. And, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who might or might not be jewish. This makes total sense of course, seeing as The Zon has promised to cut ties with old pal Bibi and Israhell. The Rothschild-owned newsflash said so! Right? It seems right now nothing, not even the gaping chasm that swallowed the Epstein files, can derail maggat NPC loyalty. It’s all just a GIANT COINCIDENCE that this futuristic prison city is almost exactly the size and location of the promised land of “Greater Israel”. Nicely cohen-ciding with Bibi Nethanyahu’s plans for a massive free trade zone with rail service to NEOM. (Who said jews and muslims can’t work together for the greater good?) To the believers: Rest easy knowing the High Council of NEOM — Musk, Fink, Bezos, Altman, and Trump (holographic 2025 version) — meets monthly in a carbon-neutral bunker to discuss your happiness metrics and whether you should be allowed to dream in color. Because you’re free. The TV on your retina says so. The AI says so. Even your dreams are branded with the NEOM logo and soothing slogans like, “Progress is Obedience.” So buckle in, Citizen. NEOM isn’t just the future — it’s the prototype for the world they really want. Because when the elite says the planet needs saving, they mean from you.

With everyone from Wall Street giants like BlackRock to the U.S. government getting involved, the leading cryptocurrency is now more mainstream than ever. You can even buy burgers with it. So it begs the question: Why is it still so hard for some people to understand and accept? With traditional finance heavyweights like investor Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon slamming the asset, it's appears that some people will never be open to Bitcoin. Speaking to Decrypt, Blockstream CEO and well-known early Bitcoiner Adam Back said that this is nothing new—and that even techies struggle to get their head around the cryptocurrency. Calling continued skepticism "confusing," Back used the example of cypherpunks back in the day who seemed uninterested in Bitcoin. He thought it was "crazy" that some of them didn’t get onboard. "You understood all about code, peer-to-peer networks, privacy, public key cryptography, and secure sockets layer," he added. "Like, you have a huge leg up in understanding this, and you're not interested. What gives?" Cypherpunk Back—who had an email exchange with the cryptocurrency's mysterious, pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008—said the fact that so-called digital gold isn't physical might be why some people remain suspicious of Bitcoin after all these years. "Some are skeptical about something that's not physical and yet has a scarcity," he commented, adding that the coin is still backed by physical resources like energy and mining equipment. Bitcoin is a digital payments system and virtual currency, and only 21 million digital coins will ever be minted into existence, thanks to the project's super-secure cryptographic engineering. Still, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed cynicism over the leading crypto's code. In a 2023 interview, Dimon asked: "How do you know it's gonna stop at 21 million? Everyone says that," before adding, "Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud." Of course, the billionaire banker also said his firm used the blockchain—a technology created by Satoshi. “Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud,” says @jpmorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. “Crypto is a decentralized Ponzi scheme…It’s a pet rock.” pic.twitter.com/9KQfckty8f — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) January 19, 2023 The biggest and oldest cryptocurrency was created with global banking failures in mind, with the original white paper released during the 2008 recession. A message referencing a newspaper article covering the situation was even inscribed on the network's genesis block. Now, Bitcoin advocates argue that the cryptocurrency can work as a true inflation hedge due to its scarcity. Back added that "for people who the establishment order is working," they may never understand the potential benefits of Bitcoin, nor may they trust something "more grassroots" in nature than fiat currency and traditional finance. "If they've got a high-paying job, they're working their way up the career ladder, things don't look too expensive for them, and they can afford mortgages," said Back, "then maybe they don't feel it."

Title: VanEck Exec Slams SEC For Delay On Bitcoin ETF Options – Details

Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, has criticized the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over a delayed response on a proposal to list options trading on the firm’s Bitcoin Spot ETF. Notably, the Commission has continued to issue delayed responses to all recent digital asset-related ETF proposals/amendments despite a crypto-friendly policy of the Donald Trump Administration. On April 3, 2025, the Chicago Board of Exchange (Cboe) filed a proposed rule change to list options trading on the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL). For context, options trading grants investors the right to buy and sell an asset at a specific price before a certain date. Following the resounding success of the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs, options trading became a potential mode of market expansion, with several asset managers submitting applications to offer options to their respective ETFs. Notably, the SEC has granted approval for this request for multiple Bitcoin ETFs, including the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), among others. However, following the initial 45-day review, the Commission has delayed a response on Cboe’s proposal to list trading options on the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL). In an X post on May 23, Matthew Sigel strongly criticized this decision, which he described as “frustrating” and offered no transparency to investors. While tagging Hester Pierce, the Head of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, Sigel complained that the Commission had issued a delayed response while offering no comments or feedback along with this decision. The VanEck Exec explained the asset manager’s objection to this development while responding to a user comment. He said. This was the first decision date, so it has not been rejected, just delayed, even though the SEC’s initial comments were addressed. It’s the lack of any feedback that is particularly irksome… It is highly worth noting that delayed responses by the SEC have been quite a common response for digital assets ETF-related proposals. The Commission can choose to wait till the final decision deadline, i.e., 240 days after the application, as seen with the Bitcoin Spot ETFs in 2024. However, Sigel’s concerns stem from an absence of an explanation on this delayed ruling, especially considering that options trading has been approved for certain other Bitcoin Spot ETFs. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $108,349, reflecting gains of 5.23% and 17.71% in the past seven and 30 days, respectively. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Hazel Wallace is just home after a celebratory brunch in London, a warm and glittering event to mark the publication of her fourth book, Not Just a Period. She has shared glimpses of the picturesque gathering on her Instagram feed, the pictures nestled alongside her signature posts: beautifully plated blueberry oats recipes for the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, yoga flows for cramps, and finish-line shots from the London and Paris marathons. Her grid is a blend of evidence-based wellness and digital elegance – but behind the polish is a deeper mission. The 34-year-old is originally from Blackrock, Co Louth, but now lives in London where she has become one of the UK‘s most prominent voices in women’s health, a medical doctor, registered associate nutritionist, personal trainer and bestselling author. But she wasn’t always on this path. In fact, her early career was shaped not by ambition, but by loss. “When I was 14, I lost my dad to a stroke,” she says. “It was really shocking. He had a mini-stroke while we were having dinner. He was in hospital for a few days, and then he passed. It was the first time someone in my family had been seriously unwell, and it changed everything.” The grief, she says, didn’t arrive all at once. “I didn’t fully understand it at the time. I missed a lot of school. I became socially withdrawn. I didn’t take care of myself.” In the aftermath, her interest in medicine grew – slowly at first. “His death was partly preventable, and I think that stuck with me. I became really focused on health in a broader sense – nutrition, stress, movement – things we hardly touched on in medical school.” Wallace didn’t get the points she needed to study medicine in Ireland, but she was determined to pursue her passion so she headed to Wales to do medical sciences, followed by medicine at Cardiff Medical School. In 2012, as a first-year med student, she started a blog called The Food Medic. “Honestly, I started it for myself,” she says. “I wanted to learn more about nutrition, about how lifestyle affects health. It was a way of figuring it out in public.” The blog and her Instagram following rapidly grew as she moved to London in 2016. Her ascent coincided with the rising popularity of wellness influencers, some of whom spread dangerous misinformation. Wallace‘s platform stood out because it was grounded in science. “There was this moment when people started demanding more credible advice,” she says. “And I was one of the first few with both a medical and nutrition background.” A post shared by Dr Hazel Wallace BSc MSc MBBCh (@drhazelwallace) The blog blossomed into several books, media appearances and, now, an online community of more than 1.1 million followers. But that success came at a cost. “For a long time, I had an unhealthy relationship with productivity,” she admits. “I tied my self-worth to academic success and professional output. I think I was also using it as a distraction – if I was busy, I didn’t have to stop and feel.” The pandemic, she says, made the limits of that model painfully clear. “By the second year of Covid, I was working in one of the only long-Covid clinics in the [UK]. There were just four of us. On weekends, I was covering intensive care shifts. I was exhausted and completely burnt out.” She took a step back from work, intending it to be temporary. “But I didn’t go back. It was hard to let go of that identity – I always thought of myself as a doctor in scrubs. But I wasn’t well. And I knew I couldn’t keep going like that.” This shift had come after a health crisis had already given Wallace a reason to slow down. In 2016, she began experiencing symptoms that didn’t quite add up. After two years of pushing for tests and consultations, she was finally diagnosed with PCOS – polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormone condition affecting one in 10 women which can lead to irregular or absent periods, difficulty conceiving, acne, anxiety, weight gain and excess hair. “I was already a qualified doctor, and it still took years and a lot of self-advocacy to get a diagnosis,” she says. “Even then, the advice was basically, ‘Come back when you want to get pregnant.’ That was it.” The experience left her feeling adrift. “I still felt in the dark about what to do. And if I felt that way with a medical background, how must everyone else be feeling?” [ Polycystic ovarian syndrome: ‘There’s more information on outer space than there is on the reproductive system of a female’Opens in new window ] This experience was part of what drove her to write her third book, The Female Factor, which explored how the male body has always been the default body in clinical medicine and research, leaving so much of women’s health unexplored, unacknowledged and unsupported. The Female Factor aimed to be a comprehensive guide to women’s health and included facts and tips on hormones, nutrition, mood, sleep and recipes. Her PCOS diagnosis had also prompted Wallace to think about fertility. She wanted children, but didn’t feel ready for them yet, and decided in 2023 to freeze her eggs – an experience she eventually shared with her followers. “I documented the process but waited until I was through it to decide whether or not to post. Even with all my training, it was intense – emotionally and physically. The daily injections, the hormone swings. It caught me off guard.” What struck her most was how little practical information there was. “It made me realise just how many gaps exist – not just in care, but in what women know about their own bodies. That’s what compelled me to share my experience. I knew if I was surprised by the process, others would be too.” During the pandemic, Wallace had noticed a disturbing trend whereby some women were attributing a disruption in their menstrual cycle – most likely caused by the stress of the pandemic – to the Covid vaccine, reinforcing anti-vax conspiracy theories. Without basic information about how periods can be affected by stress, misinformation and fearmongering grew. “People were convinced the vaccine was disrupting their periods, but the research showed it was temporary and likely stress-related,” she explains. “It really highlighted how little we understand about menstruation – even among people who menstruate.” We‘re taught to ignore hunger, to keep ourselves small. But your metabolic rate increases before your period - that’s why you’re hungrier. That’s not weakness. That’s biology That gap in understanding was one of the catalysts for Not Just a Period, which aims to be a comprehensive, empowering guide to the menstrual cycle. She‘s particularly critical of the way women’s pain and mood are pathologised. The book highlights that women are statistically twice as likely to experience depression, especially around hormonal shifts like puberty, the premenstrual phase, post-partum and menopause – but instead of receiving support, women are dismissed, patronised and laughed at. “Instead of support, we‘re often dismissed. We‘re told we‘re being ‘moody’ or ‘emotional‘. But those mood changes often have physiological roots – and they deserve proper care.” She points to PMDD – premenstrual dysphoric disorder – as a prime example. “People with PMDD can lose years of their life to disability. But they’re frequently misdiagnosed or not taken seriously. It’s not just frustrating – it’s harmful.” In the book Wallace highlights the medical gaslighting that women often experience, and the shame that prevents women from taking paid sick leave off for periods of PMDD, instead suffering in silence and losing money to a health issue that should be treated as such. Wallace‘s book doesn’t shy away from these hard truths. But it also offers practical tools – how to work with your cycle instead of against it, how to recognise shifts in mood or energy, how to support your body nutritionally through each phase. She also encourages cycle tracking, which she sees as a vital tool for body literacy. “It’s not just for fertility,” she says. “It’s about understanding yourself. Noticing patterns. Feeling more in control.” Still, she recognises the complexities around menstrual data and privacy. When I ask about how some American women have stopped using tracking apps due to political changes in reproductive rights, she‘s sympathetic. “I completely understand that concern. In the UK, we’re not facing the same kind of threats, but it’s a reminder that we need to be informed about where our data goes. Transparency matters.” [ What is causing girls to get their period at an earlier age?Opens in new window ] Another key theme in the book is how diet culture intersects with menstruation, noting that many women see an increase in appetite around their period but don’t feel able to fuel themselves because we‘ve been taught to value thinness over our bodies’ needs. “We‘re taught to ignore hunger, to keep ourselves small. But your metabolic rate increases before your period – that’s why you’re hungrier. That’s not weakness. That’s biology.” Wallace sees the consequences of this first hand in her practice. “Women restrict, then binge. Then feel guilty. It’s a cycle that can be avoided if we just listened to our bodies more and judged them less.” Body image also takes a hit premenstrually, she notes. “Even if nothing physically changes, many women feel bigger, bloated, uncomfortable. The way we speak to ourselves becomes harsher. Understanding that it’s hormonal can really help shift the narrative.” Social media complicates the issue of body image further. Wallace recognises the tension between trying to educate women about body image, health difficulties and natural struggles on a platform known for perpetuating rigid beauty standards and toxic comparisons. A post shared by Dr Hazel Wallace BSc MSc MBBCh (@drhazelwallace) Wallace’s own social media matches a lot of the aesthetic standards that can make health education feel alienating to some: she is slim and attractive, her recipes are colourful and prettily presented, and even while training for marathons she manages to look pulled together while jogging and balancing a camera to capture her journey. She‘s aware of the danger of “the highlight reel” vision of life that Instagram can create, and is wary of pages that promote a certain body type rather than education about health and lifestyle choices. “Instagram has been incredible for sharing information, but it also promotes a narrow beauty standard. Even when posts are well intentioned, they often still centre bodies that meet narrow beauty standards,” she says. “I try hard not to put my body at the centre of my content. It’s about the message, not the mirror. It’s not about how I look. But a lot of health influencers still lead with abs, with before-and-after shots. It’s toxic – and it’s confusing. People assume that if they follow the advice, they’ll look like the person giving it. That’s not health – that’s marketing.” [ Endometriosis and me: I hope young women today know they should shout louder than I didOpens in new window ] Still, she admits the pressure to create content that reaches audiences can be exhausting. “There‘s this constant push to make content prettier, punchier, faster,” she says. “And educational content – especially about periods – is not favoured by the algorithm. You have to work extra hard to be seen.” Wallace’s marathon training videos and recipes for the luteal phase might look effortless, but she schedules shoots like shifts. “It’s my job,” she says. “But I’ve also had to protect myself.” She‘s developed rules: no scrolling before 8am or after 6pm. “Even I get caught in the comparison trap. I’d look at other creators and think, ‘I should be doing more.’ And that’s not sustainable.” As she looks ahead, Wallace is preparing for her wedding this autumn in Greece to online fitness coach and Too Hot To Handle star David Birtwistle. But for now, she‘s trying to slow down and give this book the space it deserves. “I’ve been guilty of rushing into the next thing. Not this time. I want Not Just a Period to land, to start conversations, to help people. Menstrual health affects everything – our ability to work, our relationships, our mental health. And yet it’s still whispered about,” she says. “I want Not Just a Period to change that.” Because to Wallace, the menstrual cycle isn’t just a health issue. It’s a lens through which we understand how the world treats women – and how women are taught to treat themselves.

Title: Murder of Irish-American woman shocks wealthy Brussels suburb
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2025/05/25/murder-of-irish-american-woman-shocks-wealthy-brussels-suburb/
Time Published: 2025-05-25T04:30:00Z

The killing initially looked like a burglary gone wrong. Carmel Delaney, an Irish-American woman in her early 60s, had been stabbed to death in her home, in a wealthy Brussels neighbourhood popular with diplomats and business executives. The suspected murder – and the details that would later emerge – have gripped the Belgian public for weeks. Ms Delaney was born in New York, but her mother was originally from Ballyclerihan, Co Tipperary and her father from Dublin, so growing up she spent many childhood summers back visiting Ireland. A mother of four adult children, with two young grandchildren, Ms Delaney was someone who made friends easily. There were hiking and travel companions, and tennis and bridge playing partners, in Brussels and the many other cities she had lived in throughout her life. “She was so social,” an Irish relative of Ms Delaney said. Her husband, Chris Delaney, was a senior executive at US tyre giant Goodyear, overseeing its business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, from Brussels, where the couple had lived for the last seven years. At a little past 8pm on March 17th, St Patrick’s Day, Belgian police received an emergency call. Mr Delaney had opened the door of their apartment in the leafy Brussels suburb of Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, to find his wife dead inside the home. An autopsy later revealed she had been stabbed about four times in the neck and chest, with some type of sharp object. Police investigating the crime scene suspected a possible burglary gone wrong. “The victim’s husband had discovered her body in their home and found that three luxury watches had been stolen,” the Brussels public prosecutor said in a statement. However, there was no obvious signs of someone forcing their way into the apartment. Then three weeks later came an arrest. A female colleague of Mr Delaney was taken in for questioning. The next day she was charged with murder. In a statement, the prosecutor confirmed a suspect who worked with Mr Delaney had been charged with murder and possession of a weapon. One line of investigation Belgian police had pursued was the possibility Mr Delaney and his coworker were involved in a romantic relationship, according to reports in local media. The prosecutor said they could not disclose further details. Some early hearings in the criminal case took place in front of a French-speaking judge, but it has since been transferred to a Flemish judge. A lawyer representing the accused did not respond to requests for comment. In the upmarket suburb where the Delaney couple lived, the killing has shocked locals. “The whole area is one of the best in Brussels,” said a retired EU official who lives nearby. “You would compare it with Blackrock in Dublin.” “We say in French, it’s something that can happen anywhere in the world”, he said of Ms Delaney’s killing. The area is popular with wealthy diplomats and officials who work in the nearby European Union institutions. Luxembourg’s ambassador to the EU lives across the road from the Delaney’s home, and the embassy of Kosovo is only a few buildings down from their apartment block. A team of four gardeners from a private firm were tending to rows of well-kept hedges that run along both sides of the whole street on Thursday afternoon. It’s the sort of place you might expect to see a Porsche drive by – and, while The Irish Times was there, two did so within 20 minutes of each other. The owner of a small local business said she only learned of the tragedy when journalists from the Belgian media began to descend on the leafy street. Another woman on her way to work said Woluwe-Saint-Pierre was a very quiet area. “It’s not that kind of neighbourhood where you would expect ...” she said, before trailing off and stopping. Ms Delaney and her husband had been due to retire to the United States and return to New York, after careers that had seen them both work across the world. She grew up in Horseheads, a small village in upstate New York, before moving to Bardonia, which is closer to the city. Those who knew her said she had fond memories of summer trips back to Ireland as a child. Her parents had met on a blind date. Her mother, Maureen O’Dwyer, was the second eldest of 11 siblings, in a family that had a farm and stables in Ballyclerihan, keeping and breeding racehorses. Her father, Jim Gallagher, was from Dublin. After graduating from Cornell University in 1985, Ms Delaney got a job with consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble (P&G), where she worked for 15 years, across the US, Saudi Arabia, Poland and Ukraine. It was in P&G that she met Mr Delaney. The couple later moved to Sydney, Australia, where they lived for several years. Around that time Ms Delaney set up her own company, International Education Resources, which provided assistance to international students applying to study in the US. They had a holiday home in the Catskills, a mountainous part of New York state, where they spent summers hiking and winters skiing. “They were a force,” one person who knew the couple said. Then in 2017 the pair moved to Brussels, as Mr Delaney was promoted to run Goodyear tyre and rubber company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa office. The company has spent recent weeks firefighting the fallout of media coverage of Ms Delaney’s killing, which often prominently mentions Goodyear. It is understood a team of “crisis communications” consultants have been drafted in to help the firm. Mr Delaney is no longer employed by the US company and has since retired. During her time in the Belgian capital Ms Delaney became heavily involved in a women’s social club, organising hikes and running its website. There she was known for her “unwavering positivity”, the Brussels Women’s Club committee said in a message of condolence posted online after her death. “Her life motto, ‘bloom where you are planted,’ embodied her ability to adapt, grow and thrive wherever life took her,” the group wrote. She made an effort to travel to Ireland at least once a year most of her adult life, one of her Irish relatives said. “Carmel was a wonderful girl ... We loved her”.

Title: Altcoins Lag As Bitcoin Price Breaks $111,000: Why This Bull Market Is Different From 2021

Time Published: 2025-05-25T00:30:04Z

Crypto firm Matrixport has delivered insights into why this bull market is different from the 2021 bull run. Their analysis sheds more light on why altcoins are lagging despite the Bitcoin price rally to a new all-time high (ATH) at $111,900. In an X post, Matrixport stated that many traders are missing out on the current Bitcoin price rally as traditional retail engagement indicators remain low despite the rally to a new ATH. The firm explained that this rally is happening thanks to institutional investors, with retail investors on the sidelines in this bull market. Matrixport noted that this explains why funding rates remain subdued, retail activity is low, and many altcoins continue to lag as the Bitcoin price rallies in this bull market. The firm also revealed that retail traders make the fundamental mistake of not anticipating market corrections, leading to them occasionally closing their positions during sharp drawdowns. This bull market also differs from 2021 in that retail’s share of Bitcoin ownership is no longer expanding. Crypto whales have stepped in and are absorbing most of the flagship crypto’s supply, kicking retail investors to the curb. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas once noted that this could explain why the Bitcoin price has held up well during major corrections. According to Matrixport, understanding how corporate demand influences the Bitcoin price behavior and how long this trend is likely to last is critical as the shift in this bull market progresses. Meanwhile, the absence of retail traders in this cycle explains why funding rates and trading volumes are relatively low, with altcoins lagging. The firm noted that market participants are witnessing a quiet transfer of Bitcoin from early adopters and investors, miners, and exchanges to corporations like Strategy and institutional investors like BlackRock. Matrixport again asserted that the current Bitcoin price rally is driven by spot market accumulation and not derivatives activity, which could explain why altcoins are lagging behind BTC. In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that the next important step is for the Bitcoin price to record a weekly close above $106,800 and then follow through or consolidate next week. He remarked that BTC is really the only thing that matters and urged market participants to take their eyes off altcoins. If the Bitcoin price fails to accomplish that goal, the analyst stated that market participants can then turn their attention to the reverse psychology 2021 fractals. It is worth mentioning that the analyst once predicted that altcoins led by Dogecoin will still have their run once BTC’s dominance cools off in the summer. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $108,258, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

For Ethereum’s proponents, drawing comparisons has been useful—but even then, the analogy is far from perfect. When Vivek Raman introduced Etheralize in January, the former banker and business development firm’s co-founder formalized efforts to onboard Wall Street. Part of that initiative, he recently told Decrypt, has involved “evangelization and education and marketing.” “I always call it digital oil,” Raman said. “We think that as the crypto ecosystem evolves, people not only will want to—but will have to—hold this asset in reserves.” Bitcoin’s proponents often portray the asset as a form of digital gold because of pre-programmed scarcity, with a maximum supply of 21 million. ETH, whether it’s being consumed to send transactions or power smart contracts, fuels Ethereum’s network. The analogy, in that sense, is among the most palatable for today’s crypto newbies. As Raman and 19 others at Etheralize encourage financial institutions to build products on Ethereum, the ways in which the “digital oil” analogy falls short could illustrate challenges Ethereum’s community will face in cementing the network’s dominance on Wall Street, in capturing the asset’s qualities in a snappy, memorable way. “I think it is hard to come up with the right metaphor,” Grayscale Head of Research Zach Pandl told Decrypt. “It will be interesting to see whether investors begin to appreciate the scarcity of ETH, even if they're not yet kind of using the chain from a transactional standpoint.” One key difference: If demand for oil increases, then more is often pumped in response, and its supply is elastic. Ethereum, on the other hand, has a maximum issuance of 1.5% a year, meaning that its supply can only grow a certain amount over a period. On top of that, transaction fees on Ethereum are burned, which can offset that growth in supply. “Rather than having some sort of fixed cap of total supply, there's a fixed cap of issuance per year,” Etheralize co-founder Danny Ryan, a former Ethereum Foundation researcher, told Decrypt. “There's very much predictability.” Another major difference between Ethereum and oil is that the latter commodity does not offer yield. Staked Ethereum, which is devoted to the network for the ability to help process transactions, currently has an estimated yield of 3% annually, according to a dashboard published on the crypto analytics platform Dune. Within the coming years, financial institutions are expected to grow more comfortable with the practice of tokenization, in which real-world assets, such as stocks and bonds, are represented on-chain. Regulatory shifts under U.S. President Donald Trump could be a key driver. Some firms, such as crypto exchange Kraken, are tapping Ethereum competitors like Solana for such offerings. However, several funds have been tokenized on Ethereum by staid financial firms, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. As more assets come on-chain, one aspect of Ethereum’s “digital oil” analogy could become more valid. Much like oil is a neutral asset connecting myriad industries to each other, Ethereum could be seen as a non-sovereign asset for the modern financial system, Raman argued. “In this ecosystem where the world's assets are all tokenized by different counterparties, [...] the only neutral asset that's global, that connects all of these, is ETH,” he said. “It becomes more and more important as a global trading pair, as a strategic asset to hold if you want to stay in neutrality between all of these different tokenized assets.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

ByBecca Bratcher ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. The crypto landscape is becoming more dynamic and accessible. Crypto is in for another wild ride in the second half of 2025. From DeFi projects and stablecoin acceleration to the growing overlap of AI and crypto, there is a lot to watch. This article breaks down the biggest trends set to shape the space and how these developments could transform digital assets. The crypto landscape has transformed dramatically in 2025, driven by regulatory developments, technological advancements, and shifting market dynamics. Donald Trump’s return to office has brought a pro-crypto agenda to the forefront, with the U.S. government establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and signaling plans for clear, industry-friendly regulations. This shift has sparked renewed interest in digital assets, with institutional investors re-entering the market and major financial players expanding their crypto services. Looking ahead, 2025 is about making crypto more useful and easier to understand. Innovations in stablecoins, decentralized finance and tokenization give investors new ways to use digital assets. These changes could make payments faster, give more people access to investment opportunities and simplify transactions. It all points to crypto becoming a bigger part of everyday finance. As digital assets continue to mature, several key trends are gaining momentum. Stablecoins are becoming more mainstream, while new AI-powered crypto applications are pushing the boundaries of automation and data analysis. DeFi is diversifying with more sophisticated protocols, and bitcoin secondary investments, such as ETFs and derivatives, are drawing institutional interest. Meanwhile, tokenizing real-world assets is becoming a game-changer, bringing physical assets like real estate, commodities and fine art onto the blockchain. These developments could reshape how digital assets are used, traded and regulated. This section will explore each trend, offering insights into its potential impact and what it means for investors. Stablecoins have become a critical part of the crypto ecosystem, and their influence will only continue to grow in the second half of 2025. These digital currencies, which are pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, offer the benefits of blockchain technology without the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, is leading the charge, preparing to launch a U.S.-based stablecoin while working closely with U.S. lawmakers to shape crypto regulations. The broader stablecoin market is also evolving. With the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reaffirming that banks can engage in stablecoin activities and new players entering the space, competition is heating up. Stablecoins are no longer just a tool for crypto traders. They are becoming a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy, offering instant settlement, reduced transaction costs and a stable gateway to the world of digital assets. The intersection of cryptocurrency and AI is quickly becoming a major trend in 2025, with decentralized AI networks gaining attention. One notable example is Bittensor, a blockchain-based platform that enables users to create, share and monetize AI tools without relying on centralized tech giants. Bittensor’s model is built around subnets, independent communities focusing on specific AI tasks. This approach allows developers to collaborate and compete while maintaining transparency. This system ensures that high-quality work is recognized, while underperformers are removed. For developers and investors, this creates a more merit-based and sustainable ecosystem. Other projects, like Ambient, are pushing even further by creating blockchain networks that integrate AI directly into their core operations. Ambient, backed by top venture firms like a16z and Delphi Digital, aims to be a decentralized competitor to centralized AI giants like OpenAI. As these crypto-AI hybrids grow, they promise a future where AI tools are open, decentralized and more secure, making this a trend worth watching for the rest of 2025. DeFi has long been one of the most dynamic sectors in the crypto industry, but 2025 is shaping up to be a turning point. For years, DeFi thrived in a largely unregulated space, offering users decentralized lending, borrowing and trading without traditional banks. However, this freedom led to fraud, exploitation and regulatory scrutiny. In 2025, the regulatory landscape for DeFi experienced a seismic shift. The Trump administration adopted a crypto-friendly stance, repealing the IRS's controversial DeFi broker rule and signaling a more supportive approach to digital assets. This decision has created a more favorable environment for DeFi in the U.S., allowing protocols to operate without being treated like traditional brokerages. Because of the newly implemented regulatory clarity, investor interest in DeFi is soaring. EY reported that the number of investors engaging with DeFi is expected to triple over the next two years, rising from 24% to 75%. This growth reflects the sector's appeal as a way to access financial services without traditional intermediaries. As 2025 continues, the real test for DeFi will be how it balances innovation with compliance, ensuring both user protection and continued growth. Secondary bitcoin investments are gaining momentum in 2025 as companies and institutional investors seek new ways to gain indirect exposure to bitcoin. These secondary investments include bitcoin exchange-traded funds, futures and even bitcoin-backed bonds. With regulatory clarity improving, these products offer a more accessible way for investors to tap into Bitcoin’s potential without dealing with self-custody complexities. The trend is fueled by growing interest from corporate treasurers who view bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Companies like Strategy, Block, and Semler Scientific have added bitcoin to their balance sheets, using it as a hedge against inflation and a tool for long-term value preservation. The Financial Accounting Standards Board also updated its guidelines in December 2023, allowing companies to report bitcoin using fair value accounting, making it easier to show bitcoin’s actual value on financial statements. The appeal of secondary bitcoin investments is clear. These products offer exposure to bitcoin’s price growth without the risks of direct ownership. Public companies have already purchased 3.3 times more bitcoin in 2025 than the total new supply mined this year, highlighting the demand. As more firms explore bitcoin as a strategic asset, the market for bitcoin secondary investments is expected to grow rapidly, providing new opportunities for both corporate and retail investors. Tokenization of real world assets (RWA) is already trending in 2025, transforming how traditional assets like real estate, commodities, stocks and bonds are managed and traded. By representing these assets as digital tokens on blockchain networks, tokenization eliminates the need for paperwork, reduces transaction costs and increases accessibility for investors. Assets that were once illiquid, like private real estate, can now be easily bought, sold or fractionally owned by a global audience. This trend is gaining momentum as major financial institutions like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan embrace RWA tokenization. Analysts at VanEck project that the RWA market could exceed $50 billion by the end of 2025, with potential growth to $10 trillion by 2030. As regulatory clarity improves and more investors seek efficient, blockchain-powered ways to access traditional assets, RWA tokenization is set to become a foundational part of the digital economy. Bottom Line The second half of 2025 is set to reshape the crypto industry with key trends like stablecoins, DeFi, secondary Bitcoin investments, AI-powered blockchain and RWA tokenization. As regulatory clarity improves and major players enter the space, these developments transform how digital assets are used, traded and integrated into the financial system. Investors should watch for growing institutional interest, expanding use cases, and evolving regulations that could drive market growth. Whether decentralized finance is adapting to new rules, bitcoin is gaining traction as a treasury asset or tokenized real-world assets are creating new investment opportunities, the crypto landscape is becoming more dynamic and accessible. The biggest trend in crypto for the second half of 2025 is the continued evolution of blockchain technology, with growing adoption in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins and the tokenization of traditional assets. Yes, AI is already impacting crypto trading by providing advanced data analysis, automated trading strategies and predictive market insights. As AI technology improves, it is expected to make trading faster, more accurate and accessible to a wider range of investors. Investors should watch for regulatory changes, the continued rise of RWA tokenization and the impact of AI on blockchain and crypto trading. Keeping an eye on institutional adoption and new Bitcoin investment products will also be crucial. Meme coins are still relevant, but their popularity has shifted toward niche communities and short-term speculation. Most meme coins lack real utility and often do not retain long-term value.
