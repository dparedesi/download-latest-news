Title: The 14 Global Trends That Will Shape the Climate in 2026

The world is now moving into the latter half of a critical decade to fight climate change. Scientists have warned that nations need to cut carbon emissions nearly 50% by 2030 to stave off 1.5C temperature rise. The world is woefully off track to meet those targets and risks further backsliding, even as there are some surprising sources of progress. In the US, those tensions are on full display. The future of the energy transition is being shaped by President Donald Trump’s climate policy rollbacks that favor fossil fuels — but also the life support for renewables and batteries paradoxically coming from data center power demand. Read more: Some Good Climate News to End the Year China’s role as the world’s biggest emitter and hub for green tech are also affecting efforts to curb carbon pollution. This year, the country will set a new plan laying out how climate fits with its economic ambitions, while its booming clean tech sector is expected to help more developing countries adopt renewable energy and electric vehicles. Here are 14 themes Bloomberg News writers are keeping tabs on in 2026. Climate Clues in China’s New Economic Blueprint When Chinese officials gather in March for annual legislative meetings, they will approve the country’s next five-year plan. Climate watchers will be looking to see if the plan does anything to speed up the pace of decarbonization after Beijing set what’s widely seen as a conservative 2035 climate target last year. The key stat to watch for is China’s target for carbon intensity — that is, a measure of how much it emits per unit of GDP. It’s currently off track of its last five-year plan created in 2020. How much policymakers push to close the gap will be a critical litmus test for China’s climate leadership amid global backpedaling. —Lili Pike Can Diplomats Make Headway at COP31? International negotiators will spend much of this year trying to create a bare-bones road map to phase out fossil fuels and another to eliminate deforestation. The two issues were left unresolved at the COP30 climate summit in Brazil last year. But with the nation in control of the COP presidency this year, it has a chance to make progress. The first key milestone will be a conference in Colombia in April focused on phasing out fossil fuels. Negotiators will continue to hash out their differences at the Bonn Climate Change Conference in June, as well as at London and New York’s climate weeks held in June and September, respectively. The world’s efforts will culminate at COP31, which will take place in Antalya, Turkey, in November. —Laura Millan Look to Developing Countries for Climate Progress In recent years, there have been breakout climate success stories in developing countries, largely enabled by cheap Chinese clean tech exports. Bangladesh off-grid home solar installations set a record globally, enabling rapid rural electrification. Pakistan’s huge purchase of solar panels and batteries have led the country to abandon natural gas as a strategic fuel. And Ethiopia’s de facto ban on fossil-fuel car imports has led to a surge in electric vehicle sales. These transitions were largely driven by access to Chinese technology. With the country’s green exports increasing, expect more such stories to emerge in 2026. —Akshat Rathi The Clean Tech Revival Continues Global climate tech investment made a comeback in 2025, largely driven by growing data center energy demand. The surge is likely to continue this year, with both nascent nuclear technologies and proven renewable solutions set to draw investor interest. Upgrading the power grid is likely to see continued investments as well, giving a boost to everything from battery energy storage to power management software. But questions remain about whether the artificial intelligence boom can continue to sustain the climate tech sector, and how to bring growth to companies beyond the energy ecosystem. —Coco Liu Nuclear Energy’s Boom Is Just Over the Horizon Data centers are sucking up electricity as fast as new power plants can get built, and Big Tech is willing to throw big money at nuclear. Dozens of companies are working on the next generation of small reactors, and the Trump administration is pushing to streamline the regulatory process and lining up billions in financing for big ones. More than 60 reactors were under construction worldwide at the end of 2025, though the world’s nuclear capacity contracted a bit. Yet even friendly regulations and fat checks can only do so much to accelerate the notoriously slow-moving industry. That means that while the nuclear sector will start to see momentum in 2026, it’s still a few years away from bringing a wave of new plants online. —Will Wade Will the AI Bubble Burst? Last year began with a crash in AI-related stocks after news of Chinese company DeepSeek’s more efficient models threw a wrench in power demand growth projections. Will there be another “DeepSeek moment” in 2026? That’s a question that’s on investors’ minds, even as money keeps pouring into AI and the energy sector. Even if models don’t become more efficient, the bubble could burst in other ways. Already, clean energy and real estate developers are sounding the alarm that electric grids, permitting and regulations aren’t keeping up with the pace of interconnection. Some regions are seeing years-long queues to hook up power projects to the grid, and there are backlogs for the crucial electric infrastructure. If the friction continues, AI investors could find their ambitions thwarted or that they’ll have to rely more on developing power onsite and behind the meter. —Michelle Ma Everyone Wants a Piece of the Arctic “What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic” is a truism that’s become irrefutable. This past year was the hottest in 125 years of records at the top of the planet, and the spill-over effect of that is beginning to be felt everywhere else, from rising seas to an uptick in atmospheric carbon. Rising temperatures also have the world increasingly looking at how to exploit the region. In 2026, expect previously local or regional Arctic issues — from ports to critical mineral development — to become international priorities. They include how China’s push to transport cargo through the Northern Sea Route will impact fragile ecosystems, and whether Trump’s push for the US to take over Greenland becomes more aggressive. —Danielle Bochove The EV Market Splits The global transition to electric vehicles will fracture in 2026, as EV sales slow in the US and scoot ahead in the rest of the world. BloombergNEF expects drivers to snap up 16.9 million EVs globally through September. That would be an increase of 16% over the year-earlier period. The tide of affordable and well-reviewed Chinese machines from companies like BYD and SAIC Motor will help drive the uptick in sales, building on 2025’s rise in exports. The EV outlook is far cloudier in the US, which still largely bars Chinese cars and trucks. The sunset of federal subsidies on EV purchases in September slammed the brakes on electric car adoption in the US. BNEF expects US sales to essentially stay level in the first half of the year and dip in the third quarter, in comparison to the market’s record run in August, September and October of this year. —Kyle Stock What Will New York City Do About BlackRock? Three of the city’s five pension funds are weighing whether to drop BlackRock’s $42 billion mandate because of the asset manager’s climate policies. Former Comptroller Brad Lander made a recommendation late last year after a formal review of all the fund managers overseeing the city’s retirement money, citing BlackRock’s failure to tackle global warming. Lander tried to pass the resolution to cut out the money manager in December, but he was unable to convince pension board of trustee members to hold a vote before the end of the year. Now, it will be up to new comptroller Mark Levine to hold a vote this year. Mayor Zohran Mamdani will also have a significant amount of influence over the outcome of the vote. It will come as BlackRock faces other headwinds: Late last year, the firm lost a mandate with a Dutch pension fund due in part to climate-related concerns. —Olivia Raimonde Climate Risk Modeling Gains Steam Demand is high and growing for accurate, usable climate information, particularly information that can help assess risk. That’s driving researchers to probe every level of risk and solution, from neighborhoods exposed to more frequent flooding, to whether proposed atmospheric cooling approaches can work safely, if at all. The clamor for actionable information comes as the Trump administration tries to dismantle much of the infrastructure in the US that underpins world-leading science. That includes hiding reports and data; cutting staff and funding; and putting out analyses that cherry-pick data downplaying climate change. The next 12 months are shaping up as a fight for more accurate climate information and an increasingly challenging environment to find it. —Eric Roston US Renewables Face a Bumpy Road The boom days for clean energy in the US are over — for now. Trump’s efforts to halt the buildout of solar and wind have resulted in policy and financial headwinds that will continue to be a big challenge for the industry. Large-scale solar installations, while still expected to make up the bulk of all new power plant additions, are forecast to decline as lucrative federal tax incentives start to fade away by mid-year and tariffs raise costs, according to BloombergNEF. Rooftop solar tax credits for homeowners also got wiped out, though leasing panels will still qualify. Wind developers may be even harder off. Subsidies have disappeared, and the Trump administration has thrown up additional permitting hurdles. The one bright spot? Batteries, which can still qualify for tax breaks if they satisfy new rules restricting the amount of materials that can come from China. Data centers are likely to be a strong source of power demand, which could help the industry. And clean energy developers are hopeful that artificial intelligence’s power needs will convince Trump to ease his assault on the industry. —Mark Chediak The EPA’s Biggest Climate Attack Is Coming A process initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency last summer to unravel the federal government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases is set to conclude this year. The EPA is expected to finalize the controversial rulemaking that would rollback the so-called endangerment finding and immediately remove greenhouse gas regulations for passenger cars and trucks. While the administration has rolled back a number of climate rules, this would be the most consequential yet. Any decision to rescind the endangerment finding will undoubtedly be swiftly challenged in the courts, kicking off an epic legal battle that could determine how much the federal government can do to respond to global warming. —Zahra Hirji FEMA’s Fate Will Be Decided The Trump administration spent 2025 weighing whether or not to abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with the president establishing a review council co-chaired by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The group was tasked with providing recommendations on what to do with the agency, which it’s expected to finalize early this year. Disaster researchers, state and local emergency managers, and FEMA staff are all waiting to see how dramatic the proposed reforms will be. Although the president doesn’t hold the exclusive power to dissolve the agency in its entirety — that power rests in the hands of Congress — there’s a lot Trump can change, or at least try to. —Zahra Hirji Can California Meet its Climate Goals? This new year marks the 20th anniversary of California’s landmark climate law that has transformed the Golden State into a green powerhouse. But it’ll spend 2026 fending off the Trump administration’s campaign to dismantle its authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump tax bill’s elimination of federal renewable energy and electric vehicle incentives is already slowing California’s progress toward reaching net-zero emissions by 2045. With the administration trying to scuttle the state’s cap-and-trade market, expect California to continue to spend more time fighting back in the courts and developing workarounds. Beyond Trump’s reach, local and regional California agencies continue to eliminate fossil fuels. A Bay Area ban on the sale of gas water heaters and furnaces, for instance, begins to take effect in 2027 and will apply to a fifth of the state’s population. —Todd Woody Top photograph: Floating solar panels manufactured by Hanwha Solutions Corp. on the Hapcheon Dam in Hapcheon, Gyeongsangnam-do province, South Korea, on Tuesday, Feb. 8, 2022.

Title: Russia’s little-known $13bn crypto secret set for 2026 takeoff

About us Copy link Russians are warming to crypto, encouraged by the country’s banks and regulators. And they’re using cutting-edge solutions to build an investment ecosystem that can sidestep Western sanctions, past, present, or future. For Moscow, the future of finance is digital — and it lives on a blockchain. But while they’ve turned to traditional digital assets like Bitcoin, analysts expect a Russian take on tokenised securities and commodities, industrial Bitcoin mining, and crypto derivatives to take off in 2026. Digital financial assets, Russia‘s take on the buzzy tokenisation trend also called DFAs, have grown by over a third to become a $13 billion market in 2025, the Russian central bank estimates. But unlike many of the tokenised commodities traded in the West, they’re built on private blockchains and can only be traded on domestic platforms that hold central bank-issued permits. They now sit at the centre of Russia’s blockchain-powered economic expansion plans. DFA issuers have released tokens tied to the value of everything from cocoa beans to St. Petersburg real estate. The total volume of Russian DFA placements in the first nine months of 2025 increased by 33%, Vitaly Plotnikov, the deputy director of the central bank’s financial market infrastructure department, told Russian news agency Interfax in early December. Yields on short-term DFAs this year exceeded short-term bond yields by an average of 1.7%, he added. And it’s set to grow. In early December, Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the State Duma’s commission on the financial markets and the chief architect of Russia’s crypto legislation, said boosting the DFA market will be a key economic priority for Moscow in 2026. Aksakov added that the government aims to achieve tax parity for DFA investors in 2026, placing them on the same tax footing as traditional bondholders. “This will allow the DFA market to grow significantly, attract money for longer periods, and accumulate resources for business and economic development,” Aksakov said. Moscow has granted operating licences to 16 more Russian firms since Atomyze issued its first DFA, according to Russian central bank data. While most of these license-holders are banks, in August, the bank also granted a DFA-issuing license to a startup named Madrigal, which offers DFA issuance-as-a-service products. The Moscow Exchange, or MOEX, and Russian banks are also championing so-called crypto derivatives. As Russians cannot buy shares in popular US-based Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, MOEX and major banks have launched their own funds. ’The central bank has expressed a readiness to introduce new cryptocurrency regulations.‘ Those funds track the prices of popular BlackRock offerings, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. The popularity of these products has ballooned since they launched in the summer. After breaking MOEX trading volume records in September, crypto futures trading volumes on MOEX reached $636 million, a new record for futures contracts, the Russian publication Tsargrad reported. Crypto derivatives look set to grow rapidly in 2026. MOEX, the St. Petersburg Exchange and major banks — such as T-Bank, Alfa-Bank, and Sberbank — have all either launched their own crypto derivatives this year, or plan to do so in early 2026. While the central bank has previously tried to ensure only super-rich, “super-qualified” investors can buy crypto-related products, the government wants to make them more accessible. And the central bank is accommodating. “The central bank has expressed a readiness to introduce new cryptocurrency regulations,” Aksakov said. Major lenders are ready to take a step further and are waiting for permission to let their customers trade Bitcoin directly from their banking apps. Bitcoin mining is another core crypto sector set to grow in Russia in 2026. Dmitry Stupin, Vice President of the Russian Association of Cryptoindustry and Blockchain for Electricity Generation, told the Russian news agency TASS in November that mining volumes in Russia would recover to their 2024 peak of 2.1 to 2.2 GW in 2026 after dropping to around 1.7 GW in 2025. Stupin said that as industrial miners start using their own gas-fired power generation and upgrade their rigs, miners are set to return to their 2024 highs. The prediction does not seem far-fetched. After all, electricity is relatively cheap in energy-abundant Russia, and the cooling costs required to prevent mining rigs from overheating are minimal in famously cold regions like Siberia. Industrial mining was born in Southern Siberia in 2017, with the launch of the mining firm BitRiver. Since then, scores of competitors have emerged. In August 2024, President Vladimir Putin signed a law legalising industrial crypto mining. This paved the way for institutional and private investors to enter industrial crypto mining. In August, mining chiefs told the Russian media outlet RBC that it was only “a matter of time” before a major Russian mining company would seek a listing on MOEX.

Title: Solana enters 2026 with last-minute boost in RWA momentum

Time Published: 2026-01-02T04:49:04Z

Solana finished the year with record tokenized RWA activity and strong inflows into Solana ETFs, which could push SOL toward new highs in 2026. Cointelegraph in your social feed Solana appears poised to expand from its memecoin-focused, retail-dominant network this year, after posting record real-world asset tokenization activity in December. Data from RWA.xyz shows the value of tokenized RWAs on Solana increased nearly 10% over the last month to a record-high $873.3 million, while the number of Solana RWA token holders rose over 18.4% to 126,236 over the same timeframe. The majority of these RWAs back US Treasuries, such as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund and the Ondo US Dollar Yield, which boast market caps of $255.4 million and $175.8 million, respectively. New tokenized stocks like Tesla xStock and Nvidia xStock are also rising, at $48.3 million and $17.6 million, respectively, while institutional funds are also being tokenized on Solana. Solana is poised to become the third blockchain to exceed $1 billion in tokenized RWAs, behind Ethereum at $12.3 billion and BNB Chain, which recently passed $2 billion. Last month, crypto asset manager Bitwise predicted Solana would set a new all-time high should the US pass the market-structure-focused CLARITY Act in 2026. Related: Can Solana shed its memecoin image in 2026? If it passes, Bitwise expects crypto tokenization will take off, with Solana being one of the biggest winners from that upward trend: “We’re bullish on Ethereum and Solana. Really bullish. Primarily because we think stablecoins and tokenization are megatrends, and Ethereum and Solana are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of that growth.” Solana (SOL) enters 2026 at a significantly lower price than it began 2025, trading around $125 versus roughly $190 this time last year. SOL is also over 57% off the $293.3 all-time high it set on Jan. 19, 2025, while Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) set their all-time highs more recently — October and August — and are currently trading much closer to those prices. Solana's legitimacy in the institutional space strengthened in late October when the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first lot of now six spot Solana exchange-traded funds. Those Solana products have combined for $765 million in inflows, Farside Investors data shows. Also in October, international remittance giant Western Union chose Solana to build its stablecoin settlements platform on for its more than 150 million customers, spread across over 200 countries and territories. It is expected to roll out in the first half of 2026. Solana is leading all blockchains in app revenue, proving it can generate high income even when memecoin activity slows. Over the past 30 days, it raked in over $110 million, far ahead of second-place Hyperliquid at $61.1 million and nearly double Ethereum’s $47.2 million, DeFiLlama data shows.

Title: Bitcoin options boom raises fears of capped BTC upside
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-options-under-fire-as-covered-calls-take-center-stage
Time Published: 2026-01-01T20:00:00Z

Bitcoin cash-and-carry trades faded toward the end of the year, leading funds to shift to Bitcoin options for yield. Is the strategy putting a cap on BTC price? Cointelegraph in your social feed Key takeaways: Covered calls gained traction as cash-and-carry returns collapsed, but data shows they are not structurally suppressing Bitcoin’s price. Stable put-to-call ratios and rising put demand suggest hedging and yield strategies coexist with bullish positioning. As Bitcoin (BTC) price entered a downtrend in November, traders began forming theories about why institutional inflows and corporate accumulation failed to sustain price levels above $110,000. One explanation frequently cited is the rising demand for Bitcoin options, particularly those linked to the BlackRock iShares spot Bitcoin (IBIT) exchange-traded fund. The aggregate Bitcoin options open interest climbed to $49 billion in December 2025 from $39 billion in December 2024, putting the covered call strategy under closer scrutiny. Critics argue that by “renting out” their upside for a fee, large investors have unintentionally created a ceiling that prevents Bitcoin from entering its next parabolic phase. To understand this argument, it helps to view a covered call as a trade-off between price appreciation and steady income. In a covered call strategy, an investor who already owns Bitcoin sells a call (buy) option to another party. This gives the buyer the right to purchase that Bitcoin at a fixed price, such as $100,000 by a specified date. In return, the seller receives an upfront cash payment, similar to earning interest on a bond. This options strategy differs from fixed income products because the seller continues to hold a volatile asset, even though their potential upside is capped. If Bitcoin rallies to $120,000, the seller must sell at $100,000, effectively missing the additional gains. Traders argue that this dynamic suppresses price action because professional dealers who purchase these options often sell Bitcoin in the spot market to hedge their exposure, creating a persistent “sell wall” around popular strike prices. This shift toward options-based yield is a direct response to the collapse of the cash and carry trade, which involves selling BTC futures while holding an equivalent position in the spot market. For much of late 2024, traders captured a steady 10% to 15% premium. By February 2025, however, that premium had fallen below 10%, and by November it struggled to remain above 5%. In search of higher returns, funds rotated into covered calls, which offered more attractive annualized yields of 12% to 18%. This transition is evident in IBIT options, where open interest jumped to $40 billion from $12 billion in late 2024. Even so, the put-to-call ratio has stayed stable below 60%. If widespread “suppressive” call selling were truly the dominant force, this ratio would likely have collapsed as the market became saturated with call sellers. Instead, the balance implies that for every yield-focused seller, there is still a buyer positioning for a breakout. The put-to-call ratio suggests that while some participants are selling upside call options, a much larger group is purchasing put (sell) instruments as protection against a potential price decline. The recent defensive stance is reflected in the skew metric. While IBIT put options traded at a 2% discount in late 2024, they now trade at a 5% premium. At the same time, implied volatility, the market’s measure of expected turbulence, declined to 45% or lower from May onward, down from 57% in late 2024. Lower volatility reduces the premiums earned by sellers, meaning the incentive to deploy this so-called “suppressive” strategy has actually weakened, even as total open interest has increased. Arguing that covered calls are holding prices down makes little sense when the sellers of those call options stand to benefit most if prices rise toward their target levels. Rather than acting as a constraint, the options market has become the primary venue where Bitcoin’s volatility is being monetized for yield.

Title: Crypto’s 2026 investment playbook: Bitcoin, stablecoin infrastructure, tokenized assets

After a volatile 2025, investors are rethinking crypto cycles. Here are three investment themes that will shape the market’s next phase in 2026. Cointelegraph in your social feed 2025 didn’t unfold the way many cryptocurrency investors expected. Although Bitcoin (BTC) peaked almost precisely in line with its historical four-year cycle, the long-anticipated blow-off top never materialized. Notably, Bitcoin’s gains failed to cascade into the broader market, leaving hopes for a full-fledged altcoin season largely unfulfilled. As a result, 2026 opens under a cloud of uncertainty. Investor sentiment is extremely negative, marked by caution and skepticism, even as the industry finds itself in an unprecedented position. For the first time in crypto’s 15-year history, institutions, corporations and regulators are largely moving in the same direction, laying the groundwork for broader adoption rather than actively resisting it. After a year defined by unexpected outcomes, identifying the most compelling investment opportunities for 2026 is no simple task. Still, a persuasive case can be made for focusing on assets and sectors with durable, long-term relevance, rather than relying solely on the predictability of four-year market cycles tied to the Bitcoin halving. There is also growing evidence that Bitcoin’s market structure has evolved. Institutional capital, with longer time horizons and stricter mandates, is increasingly influencing price action and liquidity dynamics. In doing so, these participants may be reshaping crypto market behavior, gradually shifting the narrative away from traditional drivers such as miners, long-term holders and Bitcoin whales. Against this backdrop, the following are three cryptocurrency investment themes worth watching in 2026. Related: VC Roundup: Big money, few deals as crypto venture funding dries up Bitcoin is now deep into its fourth halving epoch, and historically, the period following each halving has coincided with the most aggressive phase of the bull market. In prior cycles, Bitcoin typically reached its peak roughly 12 to 18 months after the halving, a pattern that has long shaped investor expectations. If history were to follow a familiar script, Bitcoin may have already marked its cycle high in October 2025, after climbing more than 600% from the 2022 lows. While such a move would be consistent with previous post-bear-market recoveries, it would still represent a comparatively modest gain relative to Bitcoin’s explosive early-cycle rallies, and would reinforce the notion of diminishing returns as the asset matures. However, not everyone is convinced that past cycles still apply. According to Bitwise analysts Matt Hougan and Ryan Rasmussen, Bitcoin may be on the cusp of breaking free from its long-standing four-year rhythm altogether. In 2026, “Bitcoin will break the four-year cycle and set new all-time highs,” they argued, pointing to structural shifts that are reshaping the market. In their view, traditional cycle drivers, such as halving-induced supply shocks, interest-rate volatility and highly leveraged speculative excess, carry less influence than they once did. While leverage remains a feature of crypto markets, its impact has diminished following a sharp deleveraging phase in late 2025, when a cascade of liquidations wiped out billions in open interest in October. That reset, they suggest, has reduced the probability of a classic blow-off top driven by excess speculation. More importantly, Hougan and Rasmussen see institutional capital as the defining variable of the next phase. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024 marked the opening salvo, but broader adoption may still lie ahead. “The wave of institutional capital that began entering the space in 2024 is likely to accelerate in 2026,” they said, as major wealth platforms such as Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch expand access and begin allocating on behalf of clients. A more accommodative monetary backdrop could reinforce that trend. Expected interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve would improve liquidity conditions, historically a favorable environment for risk assets, including Bitcoin. This view aligns with the research of Julien Bittel, a Chartered Financial Analyst at Global Macro Investor, who argues that Bitcoin is more closely tied to business and liquidity cycles than to halving schedules alone. “Based on our work on the business cycle, financial conditions and overall liquidity, the balance of probabilities suggests this cycle extends well into 2026,” Bittel wrote. “In that world, the four-year cycle is effectively dead.” Related: Bitcoin’s volatility below Nvidia in 2025 as investor base grew: Bitwise Beyond Bitcoin, few blockchain applications have demonstrated clearer real-world utility than stablecoins, digital tokens designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to fiat currencies such as the US dollar. Over the past 18 months, the stablecoin market has expanded rapidly, surpassing $300 billion in total circulation, led by dollar-backed tokens such as USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC). What began as a tool for crypto traders has increasingly evolved into a foundational layer for payments, settlement and onchain liquidity. Regulation has played a central role in that transition. In mid-2025, US lawmakers advanced the GENIUS Act, comprehensive stablecoin legislation aimed at establishing clear rules for issuance, reserves and oversight. The framework, widely regarded as a turning point for the sector, aims to bring stablecoin issuers under a regulated regime while preserving their role in driving financial innovation. In parallel, US regulators have begun laying the groundwork for broader participation by the banking sector. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has proposed rule-making pathways that would allow regulated banks to issue payment stablecoins through approved subsidiaries, potentially integrating stablecoins directly into the traditional financial system. Within this evolving environment, stablecoins are increasingly viewed as a multi-purpose financial tool, enabling faster cross-border payments, facilitating onchain settlement and serving as the foundation for yield-bearing treasury instruments backed by short-term government debt. Policymakers have also framed stablecoins as a mechanism for reinforcing the global role of the US dollar, particularly in regions where access to dollar-denominated banking remains limited. That trend is not confined to the United States. Stablecoins pegged to other fiat currencies, including the euro and various emerging-market currencies, are gaining traction, underscoring their potential role as a global settlement layer rather than a purely dollar-centric product. From an investment standpoint, dollar-pegged stablecoins themselves offer virtually no upside. By design, they are not meant to appreciate, and ideally should never deviate from their peg. The real opportunity lies in the infrastructure that supports them. That infrastructure spans a growing ecosystem of issuers, custodians, compliance providers, blockchain networks and payment rails responsible for minting, redeeming, settling and safeguarding stablecoins at scale. As adoption expands, so too does the value of the platforms enabling these functions behind the scenes. Exposure to this theme has also begun spilling into traditional capital markets. Circle, the issuer of USDC, made a high-profile public debut. At the same time, PayPal Holdings launched its own dollar-backed stablecoin, signaling that legacy fintech firms see stablecoins not as a niche crypto product, but as a core component of future payment infrastructure. Related: Bank lobby is 'panicking' about yield-bearing stablecoins — NYU professor When BlackRock’s Larry Fink, the chief executive of one of the world’s most influential asset managers, says the “tokenization of all assets” is beginning, markets tend to pay attention. For long-term investors, it also signals that a once-theoretical blockchain use case is moving decisively into the mainstream of finance. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has evolved rapidly from a niche experiment into one of the most institutionally driven sectors in crypto. Major financial players, including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Goldman Sachs, have already launched or participated in tokenized funds, bonds and settlement platforms, placing traditional assets directly onto blockchain rails. Industry data indicate that the tokenized RWA market reached over $30 billion in onchain value by 2025, with private credit and US Treasury–backed products emerging as early leaders. These instruments appealed to institutions seeking yield and faster settlement without abandoning familiar asset classes. More recently, the scope of tokenization has expanded. Tokenized stocks and equity-like instruments are gaining traction, particularly outside the United States, as exchanges and fintech platforms explore blockchain-based representations of stocks and exchange-traded products. Kraken’s rollout of tokenized equities for select international markets has highlighted growing demand for 24/7, programmable access to traditional assets. At the same time, crypto-native companies are positioning themselves for a future where tokenization is no longer peripheral. After Coinbase signaled its push into stock trading, Brian Huang, CEO of Coinbase-backed portfolio manager Glider, said the move could serve as a strategic on-ramp to the tokenized asset market. “Coinbase will have a huge leg up when assets truly begin to become tokenized,” Huang said, citing the exchange’s regulatory positioning and custody infrastructure. For investors, the appeal of RWAs lies less in short-term speculation and more in structural adoption. Tokenization promises faster settlement, reduced counterparty risk and global accessibility. As regulatory frameworks mature and financial incumbents expand their onchain offerings, RWAs could emerge as one of the most durable crypto investment themes heading into 2026.

Welcome to the New Year’s issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. We’re glad you’re here. Heraclitus, the famously elusive Greek philosopher, reminded his students that you cannot step into the same river twice. Both we and the river will have changed. According to legend, one of those students – snarky little barstid – replied: “I don’t think you can step into the same river once.” Even as we step, the river flows and changes. As do we. Heraclitus was speaking of a physical river. Centuries later, we have extended his insights to allow us to consider the River of Time itself: the continuous flow in which change happens, meaning accumulates, and our lives—and markets—actually unfold. January has that fluid quality. We think of ourselves standing on the bank of the River, looking backward and forward at once—convinced that the past can be measured and the future mapped, even as the present slips by almost unnoticed. The river does not pause for our resolutions. In reality, we don’t just get to watch time rush past; we are not on the bank, we are in the river. We may think we resolutely face the future, eyes upstream, scrying risk and opportunity. We may turn our back to the torrent, knowing that we can only know what has already passed and contemplating the dark sea into which it must eventually empty. We might be still and resolute, like a stone, or moving along with the flow. The young might experience a mere ankle-deep flow while some of us experience … the deeper currents pulling toward that wine-dark sea. Perspective matters. And metaphors matter because they teach us what to look for. From the riverbank, all motion feels alarming. From within the river, we begin to notice that not all movement means change, not all froth is consequential, and not all change arrives with noise. Some of what most shapes our lives—technological shifts, medical progress, environmental repair—moves steadily, almost invisibly, beneath the surface. This January issue of the Observer lingers over a stretch of the river that many hurried past. Amid the noise and anxiety of 2025, extraordinary things went quietly right: a vast expansion of green energy in China, meaningful progress against several endemic diseases, and other developments that rarely commanded headlines but may shape lives for decades to come. Uncertain times require clear thinking, and clear thinking requires … well, a functioning brain. In “New Year’s Resolution #1: Avoid lobotomies” we look at the threat that AI seductively poses to brains … yours, your alma mater’s, and your investment advisor’s. A short sidebar piece, “What Five AI Told Me About Investing in 2026, and what their answers tell you,” highlights the problematic patterns in AI’s response to an (admittedly unfair) question about what’s going to win in the year ahead. Our colleague Lynn Bolin contributes two complementary pieces exploring income-focused investing for the uncertain years ahead. In “My 2026 Investment Plan,” Lynn walks through the construction of his conservative Core TIRA portfolio – a traditional IRA designed to generate a steady income of at least 4% while limiting drawdowns to -15% during severe bear markets. He demonstrates how different funds yield differently depending on whether they’re responding to interest rate cycles or stock market cycles, and evaluates adding Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to improve diversification. Particularly valuable: Lynn’s analysis of how his portfolio performed through both the COVID bear market and the Great Normalization’s rising rates, and his discussion of why he’s moved from a 65% stock allocation to 50% as forecasts from the OECD, Federal Reserve, and Conference Board all point to slowing growth ahead. Vanguard’s own time-varying model now recommends a 40/60 stocks-to-bonds allocation – a near-revolutionary flip from the traditional 60/40. In “A Closer Look at Income Strategy,” Lynn drills deeper into the mechanics of generating steady income in an environment where short and intermediate Treasury yields are falling while long-term rates rise. Working from 30,000 feet (which Lipper categories produce income in low-yield environments) down to ground level (specific fund recommendations), he identifies funds that maintained consistent yields through multiple market cycles. His analysis reveals that some funds distribute more when stock market opportunities appear limited, while others fluctuate with interest rates – and a select few provide genuinely steady income regardless of market conditions. The payoff: an example portfolio that achieved 7.7% annual returns with a maximum drawdown of just -9.8% over the past six years while yielding 5.2%. The Shadow, as ever, surveys the month’s most consequential changes in the fund and ETF world in “Briefly Noted.” We also pause, briefly and with gratitude, to acknowledge those who have sustained the Observer—financially, intellectually, and through simple acts of encouragement. And then, before the current carries us onward, we raise a glass to what has been, to what is, and to what may yet emerge from upstream. Pessimism is easy. Way too easy, frankly. If I were to construct the Pessimism Industrial Complex, it would have three pillars: The federal government is controlled by toddlers, a bunch famous for tantrums when their irrational, I-am-the-universe demands are not met. And so we get the Trump Kennedy Center, chaired by Donald J. Trump and the Donald J. Trump US Institute for Peace. The Trump-class battleships that will populate The Golden Fleet. The Trump dollar coin. The Trump accounts for infants. The decision to make access to the national parks free on Trump’s birthday, which, I think, is somewhere in the month of Trumpruary. There are no adults left in the room. Interviews with three departing US senators made two points: (1) every member of the US Senate is appalled and (2) they’re all waiting “for the right time” to, you know, develop a spine, remember their oath of office, or something (“Why Won’t Senators Stand Up to Trump? We Asked 3 Who Called It Quits,” New York Times, 12/13/2025). Until then, the federal response to a global climate crisis is “don’t wanna and you can’t make me!” When you’re dealing with a creature named “The Doomsday Glacier,” it’s easy to foresee Bad Things Aplenty. The media loves reporting bad news. We don’t know where the newsroom adage “if it bleeds, it leads” originated – the confident online assertions about Hearst in the 1890s is unattributed and a random New York Magazine article in 1989 is laughably wrong – but it does express a well-documented truth. Bad news sells, terrible news sells more. A 20-year study of German media found a “significant, positive correlations between explicitly negative cover pages and the magazines’ sales” (Arango-Kure and Marcel Garz, “Bad News Sells,” Journal of Media Economics, 2014). Globally, every additional negative word added to a story’s title increases readership (Robertson, et al, “Negativity drives online news consumption,” Nature: Human Behavior, 2023; btw, their study of 105,000 online news stories also found that positive words in titles drove down readership) and the more negative a story is, the more frequently and widely it’s shared on social media (Watson, et al, “Negative online news articles are shared more to social media,” Scientific Reports, 2024). You love to doom-scroll. Doom‑scrolling, for the three of you who didn’t know, is the practiced art of dragging your thumb down an endless feed of bad news long after you have stopped learning anything new. It is not just “reading the news online”; it is staying locked in the loop of crisis headlines, live‑updated horrors, and algorithm-driven outrage until your mood and sense of the world are thoroughly saturated. Some psychologists speculate that it’s a hard-wired behavior; within evolutionary time-frames, our survival depends on obsessively locating and assessing all potential threats in our neighborhood (“is that a nice kitty or a creature whose nickname for me is ‘niblet’?”), and doom-scrolling is just the latest iteration of the impulse. Surveys and behavioral studies suggest that a substantial minority of adults, and a flat‑out majority of younger users, now report doom‑scrolling regularly (“Gen Z has a doomscrolling problem,” Newsweek, 5/11/2025). In those same studies, heavier doom‑scrolling is consistently associated with higher levels of stress, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and even secondary trauma symptoms, a joy of witnessing wave after wave of misery through a four‑inch screen (Satici, et al, “Doomscrolling Scale: its Association with Personality Traits, Psychological Distress, Social Media Use, and Wellbeing,” Applied Research in the Quality of Life, 2022). And, boy howdy, is there a fair number of regrettable developments in the world. Andrew Winston’s curiously optimistic essay in Forbes (“2025: the year sustainability didn’t die,” 12/21/2025) began with a fairly bracing list of negatives: … the harsh reality is the world’s greatest challenges [are] getting worse. Inequality grew, especially at the very top, where individuals amassed unfathomable wealth (hundreds of billions of dollars) and some corporate valuations hit unreal heights ($4 trillion to $5 trillion). Meanwhile, climate impacts escalated; political winds don’t change actual winds. For example, part of Los Angeles burned to the ground (at an estimated cost of up to $250 billion) during unprecedented wildfires, historic heat baked India, Pakistan, and the EU, and devastating floods in Texas killed dozens of children. Scientists told us that climate change is “beyond scientific dispute,” at “tipping points,” and “extremely dangerous” (and that the world will blow past the 1.5C warming target). Insurer Allianz issued an eye-popping report that climate change could “destroy capitalism.” In addition, the world got less democratic and pulled to the right and generally away from the sustainability agenda, making collective action even harder. This puts more pressure on businesses. And even facing headwinds, sustainability didn’t die. That’s the top story of the year. Let’s look at that and some other big themes. Well … yeah. But if pessimism feels effortless at the end of 2025, that is not just because the news is bad; it is because you are mainlining it, in real time, on an interface designed never to run out. Much of our success as a species is driven by two factors: a good plan and resilience in executing it. The media’s business model tends to emphasize doom because, well, doom sells. But 2025 offered remarkable evidence that when we commit to sustained action—plugging ozone holes, protecting beaches, installing solar panels, developing breakthrough medicines, restoring ecosystems—we can achieve transformations that once seemed impossible. In our draft letter, what follows are eleven pages of incredibly consequential, positive developments. Chip’s anguished plea, “have mercy on their eyes!” led us to share the news in two forms: a dozen bullet points here and a dozen pages of detail in a sidebar story entitled, “The Big Box of Delights.” So here’s what happened while doom was scrolling: In November, a liquor store employee in Virginia discovered broken bottles and an apparently intoxicated raccoon sleeping on the store’s bathroom floor. An animal control officer noted that he fell through a ceiling tile, “went on a rampage, drinking everything,” with a special fondness for … umm, whisky. The animal showed no signs of injury, according to local animal protection services, though they guessed the raccoon might be grappling with “a hangover” and regret over “poor life choices.” Figure 1: Raccoon regretting its poor life choices. Source: NBC News. The story delighted readers across the political spectrum—a rare moment of shared laughter in a divided time. But it became more than a viral moment when merchandise commemorating the raccoon’s night of debauchery raised a quarter of a million dollars for the local animal shelter that housed him. The Hanover County animal protection service teamed up with apparel maker Bonfire to create shirts, sweatshirts, cups, and stickers featuring the now-infamous image of a raccoon spreadeagled next to a spilled booze bottle, along with the words “Trashed Panda.” Through 12/22, they’ve sold 19,764 against a goal of 20,000. The drunk raccoon reminds us that hope sometimes arrives in unexpected forms: in a hungover raccoon that brings people together, in merchandise that funds animal care, in our capacity to find joy and meaning in the absurd. On Christmas Day, Pope Leo made his traditional papal “Urbi et Orbi” address, Latin for “To the City and to the World,” which summarizes the bad news (see above, plus your danged doomscroll) and prescribes a response: put aside indifference, stop scrolling and start acting, stand with the oppressed rather than the oppressive. “There will be peace when our monologues are interrupted and, enriched by listening, we fall to our knees before the humanity of the other.” Stop wasting our time demonizing one another? Dreamer. Progress is rarely dramatic. It’s built day by day through the determined efforts of scientists, healthcare workers, conservationists, educators, and ordinary citizens working to solve problems both great and small. While 2025’s headlines often focused on conflict and crisis, millions of people worldwide continued humanity’s long tradition of quietly building a better world. They dreamt of better, and acted. The answer to “what’s there to be optimistic about?” is the same as it was in 2025, and will be in 2027: enormous things happened because millions of good people rejected the counsel of despair, and that you probably didn’t hear about because doom sells better than progress. The choice isn’t between naive optimism and realistic despair. It’s between staying informed about what’s actually happening—the turtle populations recovering, the emissions curves bending, the diseases being eliminated, the hungover raccoons raising money for animal shelters—and letting a curated feed of catastrophe convince you that nothing good is possible. Step away from the mediated world and step into the immediate one. Put your phones away. Hug someone today. Smile at a stranger. Do a good deed. Read a book. We recommend Always Remember (2025), a singularly beautiful little 30-minute read that reminds you of important things you already know but need to hear. Subscribe to Nautilus, a site (and magazine) that reminds you that science is cool … and important. Consider joining The Conversation, a site that has actual researchers write clear articles about important topics (“Deepfakes leveled up in 2025. Here’s what’s coming next.”) Be like Jimmy the President. Be like Leo the Pope. Be like the Drunken Raccoon. Make a difference where you are. (Want cool pictures, more detail, and a couple more stories? Open “The Big Box o’ Delights.” Or, if you’re in the long-scroll version, just keep scrolling!) The question’s not hypothetical, at least for investors. In truth, you have no idea of what’s coming. If you knew, you’d be richer than Croesus. Two things are true when we stand in the river of time: we can see neither the river’s bottom nor what’s coming at us from just around the bend. The bottom might fall out. The torrent might be nearly upon us. We cannot know, but we’ve still got to act. In general, the guides that professionals use are called “capital market assumptions” – data-driven estimates of the range of likely outcomes given current inputs. “Given a CAPE of 40 and capex spending of X, the likeliest range of US equity returns over the next 3-5 years falls between…” The recommendations that flow from those assumptions are called “strategic asset allocations,” statements that say broadly “a prudent investor with an intermediate time horizon should plan on holding X% in equities, with the possibility of some adjustments as markets evolve.” The problem is that there are a million factors weighing on markets, but not all million – birth rates in Nigeria? thawing permafrost in Siberia? financial nihilism in Gen Z? – can be incorporated into the models. Different trillion-dollar advisors reach very different trillion-dollar conclusions about what course to chart. Two of the largest firms – BlackRock and Vanguard – seem to have reached starkly different conclusions about prudent investor behavior. Given Vanguard’s intrinsic conservativeness, their new recommendation seems particularly tectonic. Vanguard’s call: For investors with a medium-term outlook (3-5 years), flip the traditional 60% stocks/40% bonds allocation to 40/60. Same expected returns as 60/40, but with substantially less risk. Why? The S&P 500’s CAPE ratio sits at 40.40 – rivaling the dot-com bubble peak. Vanguard projects US equities will return just 3.5% to 5.5% annually over the next decade, while growth stocks (including the Magnificent Seven) may deliver only 2.3% to 4.3%. Meanwhile, bonds now offer 3.8% to 4.8% with far less volatility. Roger Aliaga-Díaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction: “We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity.” This isn’t panic or market timing. In a December podcast, Vanguard’s chief economists explained that “stay the course” never meant “never adjust your allocation.” It meant stay invested, avoid emotional decisions, but use evidence-based risk management. Their Time-Varying Asset Allocation model – driven by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model that processes decades of data on risk factors and returns – now suggests this is a moment for conservative asset allocation. They estimate a 25-30% probability that AI disappoints and fails to deliver on current expectations. Goldman Sachs concurs on muted US prospects, forecasting just 6.5% annual S&P 500 returns through 2035 – driven by earnings, not the multiple expansion that powered the last decade. They see better opportunities elsewhere: Emerging Markets (+10.9%), Asia ex-Japan (+10.3%), Japan (+8.2%). The “multiple expansion era” is over, they argue. Profit margins already jumped from 5% in 1990 to 13% today and can’t expand further. BlackRock takes the opposite view: Stay pro-risk, overweight US stocks on the AI theme. Yes, valuations are stretched, and concentration is concerning, but AI capital spending is transforming the economy at an unprecedented scale. The challenge isn’t whether to reduce equity exposure – it’s identifying which companies beyond the current winners will capture AI revenues as they spread across sectors. Their 2026 outlook emphasizes “the diversification mirage” – that traditional diversifiers like long-term Treasuries now offer diminished cushion, so seek idiosyncratic returns in private markets and active strategies instead. T. Rowe Price splits the difference: Neutral on equities overall but underweight US large-cap (-2.0%) while overweight small-cap, international, and emerging markets. They’re concerned about “the narrowness of AI trends” and prefer to position for market broadening. Like Vanguard, they’re underweight long-term bonds, worried about fiscal deficits keeping upward pressure on rates. What’s an investor to make of this? The honest answer is that nobody knows what’s upstream. Vanguard’s systematic approach says: when you can’t see around the bend, measure what you can – valuations, yields, historical risk/return relationships – and position defensively. BlackRock’s view: the AI build-out is real, the momentum is powerful, stay engaged but stay nimble. Both might be right over different time horizons. The shift isn’t just theoretical. Our colleague Lynn Bolin has reduced his overall stock allocation from 65% to 50% over the past year, positioning his conservative Core TIRA portfolio to weather what he expects will be a more turbulent second half of the decade. My own long-term allocation, which we discuss each February along with my portfolio, is 50/50. Research Affiliates, whose long-term asset allocation system has been broadly validated, offers striking support for the defensive shift. Their models project that a global 60/40 portfolio will deliver just 2.5% real returns over the next decade with a Sharpe ratio of 0.16. Their conservative model portfolio – shifting to 40% equity/60% bonds with commodities and inflation-linked assets – projects 3.5% real returns with a Sharpe ratio of 0.44. The more defensive portfolio projects higher returns with better risk-adjusted performance. Their analysis also reinforces Goldman’s geographic thesis: looking across asset classes globally, US large-cap growth shows near-zero risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio of -0.01), while developed ex-US large-cap value, emerging markets, and smaller international stocks all show meaningfully better prospects. The message is consistent: lighten on US growth, reduce overall equity exposure, look globally. The takeaway isn’t that one firm has discovered the answer. It’s that even trillion-dollar asset managers using sophisticated models reach honestly different conclusions from the same data. Vanguard says reduce equity risk because valuations are stretched and bonds are finally paying again. BlackRock says stay engaged because AI momentum is real and traditional diversifiers don’t work like they used to. Goldman says look elsewhere entirely – emerging markets and Asia offer better prospects than US equities. Research Affiliates’ models strongly favor the defensive positioning. Which suggests that broad diversification driven by your needs – not by greed or fear or the confident pronouncements of any single adviser – remains the most prudent course when standing in a river whose depths and currents we cannot fully know. The evidence from multiple independent sources supports a more conservative stance than the traditional 60/40 for those with intermediate time horizons. Whether that means 50/50, 40/60, or some other mix depends on your own circumstances, goals, and capacity to weather volatility. But the days of assuming that 60/40 will automatically deliver double-digit returns through multiple expansion and tech dominance? Those have already flowed past us.

Title: My 2026 Investment Plan

Time Published: 2026-01-01T15:50:00Z

I recently automated withdrawals from one conservative Traditional IRA (Core TIRA) into my short-term investment bucket for basic spending needs and emergencies. Previously, I automated withdrawals from a more aggressive Traditional IRA for longer-term discretionary spending needs. This exercise increased my focus on income. I just added Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) to my Core TIRA sub-portfolio as a lower-risk income fund rather than to pursue higher returns. The Core TIRA is conservate Traditional IRA, within the Intermediate Investment Bucket, that is intended to have long-term returns of 7% or more on average, have maximum drawdowns of -15% or less during a severe bear market, and provide steady income of at least 4%. This sub-portfolio has an allocation to stocks of 25%, but utilizes six funds classified as “flexible portfolio” or “alternative”. Now that I have completed the Core TIRA portfolio, I am preparing for a mid-2026 review when a bond matures and needs to be reinvested. In this article, I review historical distribution yields and look at the life-of-fund drawdowns and correlations. I evaluate the performance of the Core TIRA over the past five years with and without Standpoint Multi-Asset as a potential purchase, and compare the results against Vanguard Global Wellesley. I conclude with long-term views of the economy by the OECD, the Federal Reserve survey of professional forecasters, and a look at Vanguard’s time-varying portfolio. I wanted to understand the potential for the funds in my Core TIRA to produce a steady income of 4% per year. Some funds in the Core TIRA have yields, including capital gains, that fluctuate with the interest rate cycle, others that fluctuate according to the stock market cycle, and still others that provide a steady stream of income. I calculated the total distribution since 2019 by year from historical prices at the NASDAQ website and distribution history from Seeking Alpha. Yields for 2025 will change with end-of-year distributions. Table #1 shows the yields per year for each of the funds in my Core TIRA, with red shading indicating the lowest yield and blue shading the highest. All of the funds yielded at least 3.2% over the past six years, with PAIMX yielding 6.0%. Those whose inception date is after 2019 have the symbol highlighted in yellow. Three funds (FPFIX, JAAA, PVCMX) have higher yields when interest rates are high, and may have downward pressure on yields as interest rates fall. Those whose yield fluctuates more with the stock market cycle (PCBAX, AVALX, CTFAX) appear to have larger distributions when opportunities in the stock market appear to be low. PMAIX and PONAX have the most consistent distributions, with PMAIX having the potential for a higher total return. Of the two funds that I am considering adding in my mid-2026 review, EAGMX has high steady yields, while REMIX has a low correlation to the S&P 500 and bonds, and a higher potential for total return. Table #1: Historical Distribution Yield Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset, Seeking Alpha, NASDAQ. The objective of the Core TIRA portfolio, including the bond ladder, is to provide steady returns and cash flow that grow with inflation into my Investment Bucket #1 for spending even through a secular bear market. Table #2 shows how funds in my Core TIRA have performed over their lives, sorted from lowest risk to highest. All of the funds had an APR of almost 4% or higher during their lives. “APR Min 10-yr Roll” shows the return for the worst ten-year rolling period within the life of the fund. The purpose of finding uncorrelated funds is to ensure that funds are not moving down at the same time. For long-term stability, I like CTFAX and PMAIX, which had “APR Min 10-yr Roll” of 4.7% or more. Table #2: Author’s Core TIRA Portfolio – Life of Fund Metrics Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I used Portfolio Visualizer to further analyze the Core TIRA portfolio for the past five years, including adding REMIX as shown in Table #3. I compare it to Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX), which I also own elsewhere. The link to Portfolio Visualizer Portfolio Backtesting is provided here. Table #3: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Figure #1 shows the growth of $10,000 invested in the Core TIRA with and without REMIX, and Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX). I like how REMIX fits into the Core TIRA portfolio, and it increases income. I own Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts for its professional management and simplicity. Figure #1: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer The funds can be loosely divided into three groups based on the past six years: 1) those that had low drawdowns (PVCMX, FPFIX, PCBAX, EAGMX), 2) those that had their maximum drawdown during The Great Normalization with rising rates (PONAX, PZRMX, CTFAX, and IAU), and 3) those that had their maximum drawdown during the COVID bear market (PMAIX, AVALX). Table #4 is the correlation matrix for the funds. They have low correlation with each other; however, PONAX, PZRMX, PMAIX, and CTFAX are moderately correlated. Table #4: Correlation Matrix Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer My conservative Core TIRA sub-portfolio consists of three funds classified as “alternatives”, three mixed asset funds in the “Flexible Portfolio” Lipper Category, and two in the “Multi-Sector Income” Category. I try to capture the objective and strategy of the funds below: Alternative Global Macro: Lipper Definition: Funds that, by prospectus language, invest around the world using economic theory to justify the decision-making process. The strategy is typically based on forecasts and analysis about interest rate trends, the general flow of funds, political changes, government policies, intergovernmental relations, and other broad systemic factors. These funds generally trade a wide range of markets and geographic regions, employing a broad range of trading ideas and instruments. Morningstar classifies PCBAX as “Macro Trading”, but EAGMX as “Nontraditional Bond”. Absolute Return: Lipper Definition: Funds that aim for positive returns in all market conditions. The funds are not benchmarked against a traditional long-only market index but rather have the aim of outperforming a cash or risk-free benchmark. David Snowball wrote Standpoint Multi-Asset Fund: Forcing Me to Reconsider in the November 2021 MFO Newsletter: “The fund provides exposure to equities (which help in times of economic growth or inflation), fixed income (which buffers deflationary periods and stock market declines), and commodities (which are uncorrelated with the first two, making it possible to minimize the effects of both sustained price changes and of an equity market decline). Half of the portfolio is invested in low-cost ETFs to give exposure to the global equity market. The argument is simple: over time, equities make serious money, especially if you don’t overpay for them. The fund holds eight equity ETFs charging between 3 and 7 basis points. The other half of the portfolio is managed futures positions. The positions can be in stocks and fixed income, as well as currencies and commodities. ‘Once a year we pull down the information on all the future contracts in the world, arrayed from most liquid to least liquid. We exclude the untradeable, then select the 75 most liquid in six sectors which includes equity index futures, bond futures, currencies, metals, energy, and agricultural commodities.’ Using a market following strategy, the futures contracts allow the portfolio’s exposure to equity markets to be increased beyond its 50% base (it was at 65% in mid-summer) or decreased to near zero.” Flexible Portfolio: Lipper Definition: Funds that allocate their investments to both domestic and foreign securities across traditional asset classes with a focus on total return. The traditional asset classes utilized are common stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. Morningstar classifies PZRMX as “Global Conservative Allocation”, PMAIX as “Global Moderate Allocation”, and CTFAX as “Tactical Allocation”. In Figure #2, I compare Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) and Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) to PCBAX, PMAIX, and CTFAX. Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) has a smooth, low-risk profile and yields 5.6%. EAGMX had a maximum drawdown of -3% during the Great Financial Crisis, while PCBAX had a drawdown of -29%. I bought PCBAX because it has returned 4.9% annualized since 2010, while EAGMX returned 3.4%. I favor REMIX for its low correlation to other funds in the Core TIRA. Figure #2: Comparison of Funds in Watch List to Core Funds in Portfolio Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. During the first half of this decade, the investment environment has experienced a lot of turbulence. I expect the second half to be more turbulent and have reduced risk accordingly. I recently attended the Economy Watch webinar by The Conference Board. They estimate that global growth will moderate over the next 15 years, and long-term growth in the U.S. will slow to less than 2.0%. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its OECD Economic Outlook, Volume 2025 Issue 2, which shows its estimates of real GDP growth in the U.S. to be below 2.0% in 2026 and 2027. The Fourth Quarter 2025 Survey of Professional Forecasters by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia estimates that real GDP will be 1.8% in 2026, 2.1% in 2027, and 1.8% in 2028. In my opinion, the U.S. economy is experiencing slowing growth in the late stage of the business cycle. Vanguard updated its time-varying portfolio in Bonds Remain In Favor In Time-Varying Model Portfolio. They describe it as, “The TVAA strategy is built on the framework of the Vanguard Asset Allocation Model (VAAM), driven by forecasts generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model (VCMM).” Their TVAA model results in a globally diversified 40/60 portfolio tilted toward value, as shown in Figure #3. The TVAA has an expected annualized 10-year return of 5.7%. Figure #3: Vanguard TVAA Model Source: Vanguard calculations, as of October 31, 2025 I use financial advisors at Vanguard to manage a portion of my portfolio using both index and actively managed funds. The time-varying strategy is not one of the options available. Over the past year, I have lowered my overall stock-to-bond allocation from 65% to 50% with a below-average allocation to technology because I expect stocks to have below-average returns. I invest in Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts, which has a 40/60 allocation, but also in Vanguard Global Wellington, which has a 60/40 allocation. I can sleep at night with the Bucket Approach and my Core TIRA account to meet essential spending needs and emergencies even in a secular bear market. During my mid-2026 review, I will ensure that sufficient funds are in place to meet 2027 withdrawals and confirm if I want to: 1) extend a rung in the bond ladder with iShares iBonds Dec 2034 Term Corporate ETF (IBDZ), 2) add Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to the Core TIRA, 3) increase the allocation to Victory Pioneer Multi-Asset Income (PMAIX) because of its focus on steady and high income, and 4) reduce investments in non-core bond funds. I don’t plan to sell any of the ten core funds in the Core TIRA. I wish everyone a happy and prosperous 2026. Lynn Bolin retired in June 2022 and is immensely enjoying the more relaxed lifestyle.

Title: Bitcoin “died” four times in 2025, but a hidden infrastructure boom proves the skeptics completely wrong

Crypto "died" again in 2025. Yet ETFs pulled $46B, stablecoin laws passed, and Vanguard reversed its crypto ban. Price collapsed; infrastructure won. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. 2025 delivered at least four distinct “crypto is dead” episodes: a January AI-induced flash crash, the October tariff liquidation that erased $19 billion in leveraged positions, months of altcoin carnage, and a fourth quarter slump that wiped out the year's price gains. Mainstream outlets dusted off “crypto winter” language each time. Bitcoin logged more obituaries by mid-year than in all of 2024, bringing the all-time tally past 470 since 2010. Yet, beneath the violent drawdowns and Twitter eulogies, the infrastructure kept building. Stablecoin legislation passed. Spot ETFs pulled in tens of billions. Major jurisdictions published actual rulebooks rather than issuing enforcement threats. The result is a year where crypto “died” repeatedly on price charts but quietly became more entrenched in global financial plumbing than ever before. The latest data from Bitcoin Is Dead show Bitcoin has ‘died’ 431 times, with gold bug Peter Schiff topping the Bitcoin obituary list. The first “crypto is dead” chorus arrived in late January, courtesy of Chinese AI model DeepSeek. On Jan. 27, a cross-asset sell-off hit tech stocks and bled into digital assets. A single session erased roughly $269 billion from the total crypto market cap and wiped out about $850 million in leveraged positions. Bitcoin dropped by more than 10%, from around $105,000 to below $98,000 in a matter of hours. AI-linked tokens fell up to 70% in a day. Analysts suggested that DeepSeek had punctured not just the AI bubble but the entire “risk-on” trade, with Bitcoin singled out as the bellwether whose rally suddenly looked fragile. The timing, barely a month into the year, gave the sell-off extra weight. The crash took Bitcoin only back to late-December levels, not into a bear market regime. Prices later set new all-time highs above $124,000 by July, then another peak in October. Market microstructure analyses framed it as the first major stress test of a more institutionally plugged-in crypto market rather than an existential failure, since the crash was driven by macro and AI repricing. The January episode looked scary in real time, but in hindsight, it played out like a violent shakeout inside a still-bullish tape. The biggest “crypto is dead” moment came on Oct. 10. President Donald Trump's surprise announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports during the thin weekend liquidity triggered what CoinGlass calls the largest liquidation event in crypto history. Estimates cluster around $20 billion of leveraged positions erased in under 24 hours, with more than 1.6 million accounts liquidated. Bitcoin fell from $121,000 to near $107,000 within hours, Ethereum plunged below $4,000, and many altcoins printed near-zero wicks as market makers pulled orders. The episode proved that crypto leverage and market structure were still dangerously fragile, despite the new ETF era. Policymakers explicitly used the event to argue that pending US market structure bills underestimated the systemic risk posed by crypto. JPMorgan identifies crypto-native leverage unwinding as the primary driver of the Bitcoin and Ethereum market downturn. The scale of the liquidations was larger than anything seen in prior cycles, including Terra/Luna or FTX, which made it easy to frame as a reckoning. Yet, prices didn't collapse to prior-cycle levels. Even after the rout and subsequent fourth-quarter slide, Bitcoin mostly traded in a $80,000-$100,000 band into year-end, well above the 2022-23 lows. Structure changed, not vanished. Derivatives open interest dropped by roughly 25% in a single day, but spot ETFs, custodians, and on-chain markets continued to function. Inflows into regulated products remained positive year to date, even after October. CoinShares tallies around $46.2 billion entering crypto ETFs in 2025, and BlackRock alone reports $74.8 billion in inflows to its digital asset ETFs as of Dec. 31. The October liquidation was the largest in history, but the institutional rails passed a stress test. Custodians didn't blow up. Exchanges stayed online. ETFs continued to process creation and redemption baskets. The plumbing worked, even as the speculative superstructure got demolished. Another thread in the “crypto is dead” narrative is the destruction in higher-beta sectors. AI tokens and memecoins took repeated beatings throughout 2025. During the January DeepSeek episode, many AI-linked coins fell 20% or more in 24 hours, with some recording intraday losses of up to 70%. Later coverage turned to “2025 meme and AI altcoin crash” angles, describing how sectors that led the early-year euphoria had given back most of their gains and, in some cases, round-tripped to pre-cycle prices. Trump-themed and election-related meme tokens saw heavy drawdowns as the year wore on. The memecoin wreckage was real and brutal, with hundreds of tokens that had spiked 10-fold or more in early 2025 finishing the year down over 90% from their peaks. This is the perennial story of speculative layers getting decimated while underlying rails consolidate. Chainalysis noted that DeFi TVL recovered significantly from 2023 lows even as hack losses and protocol blow-ups stayed below prior peak levels. The altcoin carnage was a feature, not a bug, consisting of a violent sorting mechanism that punished purely speculative bets while leaving infrastructure plays relatively intact. From mid-November into December, mainstream outlets wrote Bitcoin's obituary again. By mid-November, Bitcoin had fallen about 30% from its October record and given back its year-to-date gains. Mainstream finance publications framed it as erasing 2025 gains and asked whether Trump-driven optimism had run its course. Additionally, the term “crypto winter” was back in usage, which is the richest vein of “crypto is dead” language. 99Bitcoins data show Bitcoin had already logged more “obituaries” in 2025 by mid-year than in all of 2024, with at least 11 separate death declarations tracked by summer. The fourth-quarter slump gave critics ammunition. If the year started with euphoria over Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve and ended with prices lower than where they began, what was the point? Yet, the counterpoints are strong. Bitcoin ETFs are still $22 billion in inflows this year, and the historically hostile Vanguard reversed course in December, allowing clients to trade third-party crypto ETFs, citing market maturation. With $9.3 trillion under management, Vanguard’s entry into crypto ETFs could usher tens of billions in new demand despite modest initial allocations. Besides, Wall Street moved as generic SEC listing standards opened the door to multi-asset crypto ETFs, including products holding XRP, Solana, and even Dogecoin. For price context, Bitcoin's sub-$90,000 prints in November-December 2025 still leave it multiples above its 2022-23 lows and above its previous cycle top of roughly $69,000. That makes the “dead” label look more like exhaustion after a huge run than genuine collapse. To understand why crypto wasn't actually dead, it is necessary to zoom out from price. Elliptic's Global Crypto Regulation Review 2025 says governments shifted “away from enforcement-led approaches” toward comprehensive frameworks that prioritize innovation, highlighting moves like the US GENIUS Act stablecoin law and broader global alignment. Yellow's “Crypto Regulation Heatmap” tracks how MiCA in Europe, Hong Kong's licensing regime, the UK's reopening to exchange-traded crypto products, and a friendlier US stance collectively made 2025 the first year in which major markets had actual rulebooks rather than pure uncertainty. The SEC's generic listing standards, issued in September, streamlined the launch of new crypto ETFs across Nasdaq, Cboe, and NYSE Arca, allowing multi-asset products like Grayscale's GLDC to clear more quickly. Crypto ETFs registered billions in net inflows into crypto ETFs globally in 2025, even though late-year performance was poor. Away from trading, payment, and settlement rails, work continued to move forward. Visa and other large processors expanded stablecoin pilots on USDC rails for cross-border settlement, while stablecoins captured a growing slice of cross-border flows, particularly in emerging markets. The tension at the heart of 2025: the year produced more Bitcoin “deaths” on paper, record liquidations, and a sickly fourth quarter tape. However, it also established the first genuinely global regulatory frameworks, turned crypto ETFs and stablecoins into mainstream plumbing, and kept usage metrics well above those of any prior cycle. Crypto died four times in 2025, and each time it came back more embedded in the financial system than before.

Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. The "cuts are coming" narrative is failing to lift prices as high real yields and a cash crunch quietly suffocate the rally. As liabilities swell to record highs, this aggressive allocation strategy transforms the stablecoin from a passive dollar proxy into a massive, risk-on hedge fund. While retail fears volatility, this wallet is paying massive carry costs to hold a multi-asset book that requires a specific correlation to survive.

Title: Crypto ETFs Defy The Pullback With $32 Billion In Fresh Investor Cash

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to Farside Investors data, US investors put close to $32 billion into US crypto exchange-traded funds in 2025 even as markets lost steam late in the year. Spot Bitcoin ETFs drew the biggest share, with $21.4 billion in net inflows. That is smaller than the $35 billion that poured into Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, IBIT, accounted for most of the activity. Reports show IBIT took in about $24.7 billion. That makes its inflows roughly five times larger than the nearest rival, Fidelity’s FBTC. Market watchers noted IBIT ranked near the top among all ETF flows, placing behind only a few broad index funds and a big treasury bond fund. If IBIT’s number is removed, the wider spot Bitcoin ETF group actually finished the year with about $3 billion in combined outflows. Grayscale’s Bitcoin product lost nearly $4 billion on the year. Bitcoin’s price was lower than at the start of 2025; it began the year around $93,500. Based on reports, interest in Ethereum ETFs was real, but the momentum looks uneven. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, ETHA, sits at nearly $12.6 billion in inflows. Fidelity’s FETH follows at $2.6 billion, while Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust ETF holds about $1.5 billion. Still, public on-chain data showed little renewed demand for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the last month of the year, suggesting flows may slow into 2026. Ether ETFs benefited from being new and giving investors a regulated way to own ETH, but recent days have seen quieter buying. Spot Ether ETFs, which only became widely tradable after their July 2024 launch, gathered $9.6 billion in their first full year. Spot Solana ETFs, launched in late October, added $765 million through year end. Litecoin and XRP ETFs also began trading in the latter half of the year, giving investors more choices for regulated altcoin exposure. The sums are small compared with Bitcoin and Ether. Solana’s $765 million is an example of early interest that has not yet turned into a large, steady stream of assets. These products are being tested by the market. Industry trackers reported that crypto ETFs listed worldwide experienced $2.95 billion in net outflows in November, and there was about $179 billion invested in crypto ETFs globally at the end of that month. Regulators and exchanges moved faster this year under new SEC leadership that was more open to approvals, which in turn helped institutional adoption in the US.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock's head of talent has 4 pieces of advice for college students who want to work at the firm

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last year, BlackRock accepted less than 3% of the people who applied for its early-career programs. Nigel Williams, the firm's head of talent acquisition, has a few pieces of advice for those hoping to nab one of the coveted acceptance letters. Williams said that college students interested in working at the asset management behemoth should do four things before preparing for an interview: research the firm, have a personal elevator pitch, brainstorm specific examples of success, and reach out to an employee beforehand. With their "elevator pitch," Williams said, applicants should explain what's important to them, where they excel, and how they've overcome difficulties or solved problems. "Why would you be great for the company? Being able to give an example, be specific," Williams said, adding that general statements don't tend to land as well. Researching the firm will help applicants anchor their chosen examples in what BlackRock in particular is looking for. Part of what defines the firm, Williams said, is relationship-building. Many applicants know or reach out to someone who works at BlackRock before the interview to learn about the company culture, he said. Last year, more than 60,000 people applied for the early-career programs, and BlackRock offered some 1,500 jobs globally for its internship and program analyst positions. Every applicant completes a one-way HireVue interview. For those who do make it further into the application process, Williams said he's always interested in learning about "what makes people tick," whether by having them talk through what they've learned from solving a challenging situation, or asking about what they would have done differently. As BlackRock continues to accelerate its technological prowess, Williams also said that AI has transformed his hiring process. Strong applicants can demonstrate both their fluency with AI tools and prompting, and their interpersonal skills. When it comes to younger talent, Williams said he's not just looking for a certain GPA or major, but also those who are engaged in their school communities. BlackRock has, for example, had a lot of success when hiring student athletes. Of those who do make it into the summer intern program, around 75% receive offers to return as analysts after graduating from college, which may be especially helpful in a brutal job market for young talent.

Title: Investors funnel $32B into US crypto ETFs despite year-end pullback

Time Published: 2026-01-01T06:25:53Z

BlackRock further separated itself from competitors in the crypto ETF market in 2025, with its Bitcoin and Ether funds, IBIT and ETHA, accounting for the majority of net inflows. Cointelegraph in your social feed US investors poured over $31.77 billion into US crypto exchange-traded funds in 2025 despite the crypto markets stumbling towards the final months of the year. US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs took the lion’s share of investor interest, accumulating $21.4 billion in net inflows in 2025, according to Farside Investors data. However, it marks a fall from the $35.2 billion net inflows seen in 2024. Spot Ether (ETH) ETFs saw a fourfold increase in inflows from 2024, attracting $9.6 billion of investor money in the year. Ether ETFs launched in July 2024, meaning 2025 was the first full year the ETFs could be traded. Spot Solana (SOL) ETFs were among the new crypto products to hit the US market in 2025, which have tallied $765 million since launching in late October. Institutional adoption has been supported by a more crypto-friendly administration this year, including new Securities and Exchange Commission leadership, which accelerated approvals for new crypto products. BlackRock strengthened its dominance in the crypto ETF market in 2025, with its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) seeing a staggering $24.7 billion worth in inflows to end the year. IBIT’s flow tally is now five times larger than the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), its nearest competitor. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in mid-December that IBIT ranked sixth in net inflows among all ETFs, trailing only broad index funds and a treasury bond ETF. “If you can do $25b in [a] bad year imagine the flow potential in [a] good year,” he said, noting Bitcoin’s slight fall from $93,500 at the start of 2025. Removing IBIT from the equation, the nine other spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined $3.1 billion in outflows for the year. Most other spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a marginal increase in net inflows, while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF bled around $3.9 billion. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) continues to dominate the Ethereum ETF market despite failing to record an inflow over the last 12 trading days. ETHA’s inflows currently sit at almost $12.6 billion, while The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) round out the top three at $2.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. Glassnode data shows that spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have shown little to no renewed demand over the past month, suggesting these crypto products may see a slow start in 2026. Litecoin (LTC), Solana and XRP (XRP) ETFs also launched in the back half of the year, giving investors greater access to major altcoins through regulated investment vehicles. Industry analysts expect an explosion in the number of crypto ETPs approved in 2026 under the SEC’s new generic listing standards, which no longer require that each application be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Related: 2026 will be red for Bitcoin, but payment tech will improve: BTC OGs Crypto asset manager Bitwise tipped that more than 100 crypto ETFs would launch in 2026, a prediction Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart agreed with but said many wouldn’t last beyond 2027 due to a lack of demand. “We’re going to see a lot of liquidations in crypto ETP products. Might happen at [the] tail end of 2026 but likely by the end of 2027,” Seyffart said in December.

Title: December 2025 in Review

Time Published: 2025-12-31T22:45:01Z

Here we are at the last post of 2025. I am always tempted to turn this month in review into something of a year in review… but then I realize I will probably end up with half a dozen such posts in various forms both before and after the new year. And I also do an anniversary post as well. How much more wrap up do you need? And yet, there are a few tidbits that don’t get covered elsewhere and which seem to fit into both the month and review and year in review categories. So, for example, I can bring out the chart that shows my post distribution over the year. Once again, I posted every day of the year. The dark squares are where I posted twice in a day. TAGN 2025 Posting Activity I did not post three times in a single day this year. That happens on a rare occasion… usually due to a couple of timely news items landing during a week where I have a post already set for every day… but not in 2025. That last square will actually turn into a double post day once this goes live. I had that No Man’s Sky post this morning. That will make this the 393rd post for 2025 and the 2,104th consecutive days of publishing a post on the site, a record that has been running since Covid had us all at home. And then there is the full year traffic. 2025 was an up year. TAGN Page Views by Year 2025 Edition (final numbers update) I am trying to decide if the pattern of my blog traffic matches any real world dynamic… does traffic go up when the economy is bad or when there are more hurricanes… or does it follow a certain game, like EVE Online, or is it related to the games I wrote about (2025 saw me write a lot about No Man’s Sky for example), or is it just a game of “Google Loves Me. Google Loves Me Not?” All web traffic is a lie, so I suppose it depends on which lie I find most comforting. One Year Ago In end of year wrap ups I reviewed my 2024 predictions, recounted my Twitch time, parsed my Reddit Recap, recited my Steam Replay, read out my books of 2025, and looked at highs of 2024. Then there was the Steam Winter Sale. Path of Exile II arrived in early access. But to play this eventual free title you had to buy your way in. I decided I could wait. Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen also went into early access. You had to pay for that too… and I declined… but it wasn’t going to be free later on. And then there was Balatro on the iPad, which seemed to me to be it’s perfect platform. At Daybreak EverQuest launched The Outer Brood expansion. In Enshrouded we had made it to Pikemead’s Reach, the largest settlement in the game and full of hazards. We also setup an outpost in the Far Away Fray Tavern. Then we were on a hunt for music. In EVE Online CCP was reworking AIR Daily Goals again. They also killed off the Activity Tracker, which had been broken for a few months. Another neglected feature. There was also the launch of the Winter Nexus event, which I did twice. After that it kind of wears out its welcome. I also took a look at the impact of the Revenant expansion in the MER, with a special side trip into shuttles once the Utria issue was shut down. We were also out hunting Skyhooks in The Spire. Meanwhile, CCP was looking for suckers to buy into their blockchain scam title, EVE Frontier. In the Stars Reach pre-alpha we were not required to make some of our tools.and gave us a bunch to do with civil engineering. I tried to embrace the homestead aspect of it, but that really isn’t my thing. In Pokemon Go I was stuck on the requirements to get to level 47. I was a bit on about game studios embracing AI. Elon Musk figured he would use his AI to make games great again or some BS. I kicked off Fantasy Critic League for 2025. How did that work out? Finally, we arrived at the end of my Telephone Tales series, with me working for the state… but I had one follow on post to mark a significant telephone event and perhaps the real end of the story. Five Years Ago Pandemic binge watching was still under way, which led me to summarize how it felt. Somewhere in all that binging I found time to read, so had five books to talk about. I was also promoting the ability to read the blog via FlipBoard. Then there were predictions to be reviewed, though 2020 was beyond predicting really. The Steam Winter Sale kicked off yet again. I played Among Us for an evening. I have yet to to play it since. We got the news that Daybreak was set to be purchased by a Swedish company called Enad Global 7. As part of that we got a look into Daybreak’s financials. We learned that DC Universe Online had the most players and highest gross revenue of all their titles, yet EverQuest still managed to eke out the highest net profit. The deal closed before the month was done. EverQuest also launched the Claws of Veeshan expansion, the 27th for the title, while its younger sibling, EverQuest II, released the Reign of Shadows expansion, its 17th since launch. In Pokemon Go, the update had arrived that raised the level cap from 40 to 50, so I was sizing up what it was going to take to get to level 41. In WoW Shadowlands I hit the level cap… which was back to level 60 after the big squish… after which I had to choose my covenant. We got a look at how Shadowlands stacked up against past launches. SuperData, in what would be one of its final reports, said WoW subscribers were up with the expansion. In WoW Classic the instance group was wandering Blackrock Depths and Stormwind with Marshal Windsor, then went back in to go after a couple more of the bosses in that dungeon. That done, we made it through the bar only get get stopped cold in the lyceum. But I was working on my blacksmithing skills as well, though I couldn’t tell you why now. While CCP was still fruitlessly trying to work out how to create an FPS based in New Eden, in EVE Online, their one and only successful ongoing title, World War Bee was raging, and would soon lead to yet another Guinness world record setting battle. News from EVE Online summed up: Finally, I tried to sum up 2020 by shooting only for the high points. It wasn’t easy. Ten Years Ago Thanks to The Force Awakens coming out, George Lucas was in the news and rationalizing his “Han didn’t shoot first” change. I wasn’t buying it. There were certainly other things he could have changed. It was December, so I had to go over the usual posts, scoring predictions, looking back at the highs and lows of the year gone past, looking forward to what I might play 2016, and something about the inevitable Steam holiday sale. I also made a chart to show what MMOs I was playing in 2015 because everybody else was doing it. I totally forgot to make that chart again this year. There was the Operation: Frostline expansion in EVE Online. In New Eden I got blow up trying to slip a Caracal out of Fountain. It happens. On the other hand, I did get my first kill mark on another solo op. I also hit 150 million skill points, an achievement soon to be made trivial by skill injectors. The much reviled Fountain War Kickstarter was finally cancelled, as it was clearly not going to get anywhere close to its $150K target. But was that going to bank the flames of the brightly burning Goon hate? (hint: no) The recently rebranded Imperium was taking its plans to low sec, either to generate content or display its arrogance depending on who was describing it. We were also waging a war in Cloud Ring. Turbine finally got their head screwed on right when it came to insta-levels in Lord of the Rings Online. I was stomping around in the Mirkwood expansion trying to see in the dark. In Minecraft I was building a prismarine outpost along the great northern road. Aaron and I also killed the End Dragon. On the EverQuest front, the Phinigel “true box” server opened, a retro progression server that was supposed to keep people from multi-boxing groups. I summed up five years of Raptr tracking my game play with my top 20 played games. There was LEGO’s somewhat nonsensical online name policy. And I was playing Monument Valley on the iPad. Fifteen Years Ago That December I had one of my all-time most popular posts, Talking Cats Playing Pattycake! You can thank me for not taking the hint and going all talking cats, all the time. Or hate me for not doing that. Take your pick. And We Didn’t Start the Fire? Nothing. But I still had kitty pictures. Awww. I still think that if you label a window “Currency” it ought to show all your currency, not just the odd-ball stuff. I was still feeling the sting of ThinkGeek teasing us with the iCade at April Fools, all the more so because some pretenders were on the scene. Turbine was giving away 10,000 Turbine Points, which comes out to real, and possibly taxable, value in real world dollars. The comments on the post were obviously not from tax professionals. I visited EverQuest for long enough to find a house. And then I was out of money. In EverQuest II they were starting the run up to vampires. And I summed up what we knew about The Agency to that point… which was bupkiss. In World of Warcraft, Cataclysm launched. If you weren’t in the beta, there were still scams promising to get you in. There was the digital pre-order, which worked for me. And one final hardware upgrade we needed at our house before the expansion launched. And then there was picking a new character for the re-rolled instance group in Azeroth. The U.S. release date for Pokemon Black and White was announced at last. Finally, I wrote something that looked sort of like a review of Ben “Yahtzee” Croshaw’s book Mogworld. And then there was something about zombies vs. werewolves vs. vampires vs. unicorns. Twenty Years Ago CCP dropped the Red Moon Rising expansion on EVE Online, introducing a host of new ships including titans and motherships. They also introduced a new tutorial and new player experience, so some things never change. Asherons Call 2: Fallen Kings, the sequel to Asheron’s Call, was shut down by Turbine. Revived again some years later, it and its predecessor were both shut down when Jeffrey Epstein, Columbus Nova, and/or Daybreak Game Company acquired the MMO portion of Turbine and created Standing Stone Games. That left the open question as to who might own the AC/AC2 IP at this point. Warner? Daybreak? EG7? Jeffrey Epstein? The Russians? Massively OP said at one point that WB still owned it. Does that mean Netflix might own it soon? Of course, if you don’t use an IP ownership ends, so maybe you could own it next! Twenty-Five Years Ago The second EverQuest expansion, The Scars of Velious, launched. The icy continent of Velious brought frost giants, Coldain Dwarves, and more dragons to Norrath. It also introduced The Sleeper, a once per server event.

That said, it did so for a couple of reasons. The first was that there was some serious competition for play time on the PC. That advantage also played to its advantage because the holidays sent us on the road a few times, and when away from my PC there is only time for Pokemon Go really, since I do not play anything else on my phone. This has led me to wonder if the iOS time tracking experiment is really worthwhile, as games there compete for a different time slice than PC games. But more on that when I review my 2025 games played. EVE Online After the tumult of the scouring of the Drone regions, I figured December would be a nice quiet month when I would mind my PI and maybe go on an op or two. And then the Winter Nexus showed up and I spent a lot of time on that. But that was pretty chill all the same. I finished up the rewards track on two characters, when on a couple of ops, and kind of took a break. Forza Horizon 5 This was going to be my holiday game. I grabbed the base game on sale for $20, a price I do not regret, and for a couple of days I had my game pad out and was racing all over the map. Then, Guild Wars Reforged showed up and THAT became the holiday game and I didn’t log into Forza again. Still a good game and I will likely play some more, but it fell off this holiday season. Guild Wars Reforged This was the surprise of the season, both in the fact that ArenaNet even did it and that our group decided to pick it up. We’ll see if it lasts. When we tried it back in the day, we fell out of it pretty quickly. This time for sure I guess! No Man’s Sky I thought I was done with the expeditions after doing the first three for the holidays… and then I did the corvette expedition and had a good time. A better time, arguably, than I did with the first three. In between I log in, jump my freighter to a new system, explore a planet or two, send my frigates out on missions, and make my way slowly to the center of the galaxy. Palia All my chickens… or whatever they are… are hungry and depressed and too old to breed or produce eggs. I wasn’t expecting Palia to punish you quite that hard for not playing for a couple of weeks. I mean, my plants will sit there waiting to be watered and weeded literally forever, but the chickens age out while you’re away. Lesson learned I guess. Pokemon Go My wife and I made it to level 72 earlier this month, so the focus has been on the four tasks required for the next level. The most difficult one, for me at least, is getting three more Pokemon to max CP. I have managed two so far, but I need a good 40 XL candies to get either of my two prime candidates there… and those candies are not coming easy. Coming Up Well, tomorrow is 2026, which means a New Years prediction post. What dumb things will I predict this time? Find out soon enough! There is also some final 2025 wrapping up to do. There will be the end of the Steam Winter Sale, the Steam Awards, and their annual stats update. In addition, there will also be my game time wrap up of 2025. I don’t do that early. As mentioned earlier, today also kicks off the final holiday expedition in No Man’s Sky. Will I do that one as well? There is more to do in Guild Wars Reforged. the unleashing of a new Imperium fleet doctrine in EVE Online, and maybe I’ll do something about those chickens in Palia. We shall see. I remember your World War Bee chronicles; it was fascinating stuff for someone who only knew of EVE Online as “that spreadsheet MMO that it’s fans were fanatical about”.

Title: Every fusion startup that has raised over $100M | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Over the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes — always a decade away! — to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines. The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion. CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output. CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others. Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. In December 2025, TAE announced that it would merge with President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion. TAE would receive $200 million plus another $100 million upon filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEO of the combined company alongside Devin Nunes, who had been sole CEO of Trump Media. The fusion startup had previously raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. Before the merger, TAE had raised a total of $1.79 billion, according to PitchBook. Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target. The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech. Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes. The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Now its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. In August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in a pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Then in November, securities filings in Canada revealed that the company had raised $51.1 million in SAFE notes from nearly 70 investors, the Globe and Mail reported. Altogether, General Fusion has raised $492 million, according to PitchBook. Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business. In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany. Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures. Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions. With all the startups pursuing fusion power, it was perhaps inevitable that another would pop up to develop components that round out a power plant. The so-called balance of plant, or the parts that sit outside the reactor, range from gyrotrons that heat plasma to heat extraction systems to harvest power from fusion reactions to turn it into electricity. Kyoto Fusioneering has made an early bet that if even one fusion startup succeeds in generating enough power to sell to the grid, that the industry will need a supplier for the balance of plant and the expertise to integrate it into whichever fusion technologies win out. Venture capitalists appear to agree, having invested $191 million in Kyoto Fusioneering. Investors include 31Ventures, In-Q-Tel, JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Investment. Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $162 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, and HV Capital with Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. Unlike many other fusion startups, First Light Fusion doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. But even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a groundbreaking experiment in 2022. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition. In March 2025, First Light announced that it would not pursue building its own power plant, instead offering its core technologies to other companies to build one. A spokesperson for First Light said that it is planning to build “pulsed power capability that would act as our demonstrator plant but would have other science and defense applications.” In other words, the company was dropping its plans for a power plan in a quest for revenue. Based in Oxfordshire, UK, First Light has raised $108 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent, according to PitchBook. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $100 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Title: Solana Wraps Up A Stellar 2025 As SOL Price Makes A Last Minute Surge
URL: https://zycrypto.com/solana-wraps-up-a-stellar-2025-as-sol-price-makes-a-last-minute-surge/
Time Published: 2025-12-31T14:45:10Z
Full Content:
As the year comes to a close, the Solana (SOL) ecosystem has recapped the key milestones reached in 2025. Meanwhile, SOL price is staging a late recovery, gaining nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. Solana’s official X account has described “2025 as a banger” in a year that saw the network attract major institutional interest. The team shared a three-minute video on X, chronicling the high points of 2025, including key partnerships with global financial service providers and network upgrades. Right off the bat, the video highlighted Western Union’s partnership with Solana to launch a stablecoin for global payments. Amid the flurry of institutional partnerships, the team underscored CME Group’s decision to launch spot-quoted SOL futures. Back in May, enterprise blockchain firm R3 announced a collaboration with the Solana Foundation to link its permissioned Corda platform with the permissionless Solana blockchain. In one market-moving announcement, BlackRock confirmed the expansion of its tokenized money market fund BUIDL to Solana, a watershed moment for the fledgling blockchain. Continuing the streak of institutional interest, JPMorgan arranged for US commercial paper issuance on Solana to wrap up a stellar year for the network. All year long, an avalanche of corporate treasuries jostled to scoop sizable amounts of SOL with DeFi Development Corp and Upexi leading the way. On the regulatory front, the Solana Policy Institute notched impressive milestones throughout 2025. The year marked the expansion of the Solana Economic Zone to Kazakhstan, the first in Central Asia, with the team seeking out new frontiers. In line with the expansionist policy, the team hosted several Solana Apex events in 2025 to onboard new users. A wildly successful Accelerate event and the launch of Solana Spaces on Wall Street added steam to its aggressive expansionist goals. Amid the recap, SOL price has indicated flashes of brilliance over the last day. CoinMarketCap data indicates that SOL is trading at $126.17, up nearly 3% from an intra-day low of $123. SOL ETF inflows on December 30 spiked to $5.2 million after a lengthy decline. While it pales in comparison to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the surge suggests that institutional investors are rotating into undervalued altcoins. Last week, an analyst described SOL as oversold, hinting at a near-term rally for the asset. Despite the uptick in SOL price, the asset has fallen by 57.13% from its all-time high of $294 that it set in early 2025.

Title: Strategy accumulates over 22,000 Bitcoin, RWAs top $19 billion: December in Charts

The Bitcoin price slump at the end of the year hasn’t discouraged Michael Saylor’s Strategy from buying over 22,000 BTC in December alone. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin’s price continued to fall as 2025 neared its end, declining 4% in December. Despite a slump in markets, Strategy capped off the year with massive Bitcoin buys. In December alone, the software company turned Bitcoin investment vehicle picked up over 22,000 Bitcoin (BTC). In the US, prediction markets are inking deals with major media outlets and scoring approvals from major federal agencies. However, in 11 states, gambling and gaming regulators are taking legal action against platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket. Watchdogs state that such markets constitute a form of gambling, a claim the companies themselves dispute. As crypto grows more mainstream, hackers and scammers are increasingly targeting investors and protocols. In December, crypto exploits topped $22.5 million. Chainalysis also released its annual scam report, stating that crypto thefts hit $3.4 billion in 2025. Here’s December by the numbers: Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin investment vehicle, Strategy, picked up another stack of Bitcoin in December. The publicly traded company bought 22,628 BTC this month, according to Strategy’s Bitcoin purchase disclosures. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 672,497 BTC, or roughly 3.3% of the 19.9 million Bitcoin currently in circulation. The purchases in December capped off a year of aggressive accumulation by Strategy. The company disclosed Bitcoin purchases in 41 separate weeks of 2025. That’s a marked increase from 18 weeks in 2024 and just eight in 2023. Related: Strategy’s latest 2025 Bitcoin purchase caps active year of accumulation Strategy’s success in offering debt to fund new Bitcoin purchases has inspired other companies to become “Bitcoin treasury firms” — i.e., companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, 192 public companies hold almost 1.1 million BTC in their treasuries. Bitcoin’s price fell over 4% this month and is trading at $88,000 at publishing time. The asset is slated to end the year down below where it started, around $94,000, and well below its all-time high of $126,000 set in October. Some traders say that Bitcoin is set for further losses, possibly down to $40,000; that is, if the traditionally understood four-year boom-and-bust cycle is still intact. Not everyone is convinced, though. Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research, previously told Cointelegraph that institutional demand through things like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries has softened the blow. “While the bull market may face near-term consolidation amid macroeconomic pressures, we anticipate it will extend into 2026 with support from ongoing structural inflows and evolving market dynamics,” he said. Betting markets are making headway in the US. On Dec. 4, CNBC signed a contract with Kalshi to integrate real-time forecasting data from the betting market on CNBC’s TV, digital and subscription platforms. But state regulators are not pleased. That same week, Connecticut’s Department of Consumer Protection sent letters to Kalshi, Crypto.com and Robinhood, ordering them to cease operations in the state. There are now 11 states in which prediction markets are facing legal action from regulators. Kalshi similarly received cease-and-desist letters in Ohio, Illinois, Arizona, Montana and New York. Regulators in those states cited that the market was offering unlicensed gambling, a claim that Kalshi rejects. In Massachusetts, state prosecutors claim that Kalshi has disguised sports betting as “event contracts.” Kalshi said the state is “trying to block Kalshi’s innovations by relying on outdated laws and ideas.” A spokesperson for the company previously told Cointelegraph, “It’s very different from what state-regulated sportsbooks and casinos offer their customers. We are confident in our legal arguments and have filed suit in federal court.” In December, hackers made away with $22.5 million across 10 incidents, according to data from DefiLlama, a drop in the bucket compared with other months this year. In February, hackers stole $1.4 billion in assets from the crypto exchange Bybit. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said in its annual crypto hack report that this year’s crypto thefts totaled $3.4 billion. It added that personal wallet attacks have “grown substantially, increasing from just 7.3% of total stolen value in 2022 to 44% in 2024. In 2025, the share would have been 37% if it weren’t for the outsized impact of the Bybit attack.” Sophisticated attacks from state-sponsored actors have been a particular problem for large, centralized organizations like crypto exchanges. Cybercriminals associated with the government of North Korea reportedly stole $2.02 billion in cryptocurrency this year. The total distributed asset value of real-world assets (RWAs) rose 3% in December, surpassing $19 billion. The largest section of these assets is tokenized US Treasurys at $8.7 billion, followed by commodities at $3.5 billion. This places RWAs as the fifth-largest asset category in decentralized finance by total value locked, according to DefiLlama, overtaking decentralized exchanges (DEXs). “At the start of this year, they weren’t even in the top 10 categories,” DeFiLlama noted. A number of tokenized fund products like the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Circle’s USYC, Franklin Templeton’s BENJI and Ondo’s OUSG are driving increased valuation with tokenized Treasurys. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of Kronos Research, previously told Cointelegraph that for further growth in RWAs, “the constraint is no longer tokenization itself, but liquidity and integration into TradFi.” Magazine: Big questions: Would Bitcoin survive a 10-year power outage?

I joined the Prospect as a writing fellow in Spring 2025, just months before President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law. Much of my reporting out of the gate chronicled how our social safety net and constitutional democracy have been falling apart at the seams since Trump returned to the White House. While the focus of my coverage has varied over the past several months, a common thread that can be found throughout is arguably regulation. I’ve written about the implications of rolling back key guardrails designed to protect consumers, workers, and the environment. Many of those same stories highlighted the Trump administration’s attacks on federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as the extent of regulatory capture taking hold at both the state and federal levels. Speaking of regulatory capture, a fair amount of my recent reporting has centered on the role of state-level public utility commissions in regulating investor-owned utilities. As compelling as it is to lay the blame on data centers for driving up electricity prices, utility commissions are responsible for setting rates. They also have the final say on whether regulated utilities can merge or be acquired by another company. In both instances, these commissions have largely refrained from challenging investor-owned utilities, instead opting to rubber-stamp rate increases and fold in the face of private utility takeovers. And with that, I’d like to reflect on a few stories I had the pleasure of writing for the Prospect in 2025. As the year comes to a close, our staff, contributors, and partners have reflected on the Prospect stories that epitomized 2025. Read the full Best of 2025 collection. In April, the Department of Transportation declared open season on “burdensome” regulations to implement executive orders issued by President Trump in the early days and weeks of his second term. The freight rail industry, whose largest members are represented by the Association of American Railroads, made quick work of the opportunity to write its own rules and roll back regulations that impede extreme cost-cutting measures. At the time, I wrote about the industry’s push to reduce already threadbare crews with remotely operated or entirely autonomous trains, and replace visual safety inspections with Automated Track Inspection machines. Unions representing rail workers sounded the alarm on these safety-averse proposals. Organizers told me carriers’ efforts to automate the rail industry not only undermine labor, but endanger employees and trackside communities alike. Read the story. For this story, I teamed up with Prospect staff writer Whitney Curry Wimbish to dispel the allure of including private equity and cryptocurrency investments in personal retirement plans. Our reporting found that exposing the nation’s multitrillion-dollar defined contribution market to high-risk asset classes not only threatens to worsen the looming retirement crisis, but functionally provides a bailout to cash-strapped, underperforming private equity firms. Rather than democratizing access to a wider set of financial instruments, the Trump administration has signaled its willingness to soften existing regulatory guidance to give plan sponsors more cover for making these investments available to retail investors. Read the story. I went to the Twin Cities in October to attend the final Minnesota Public Utilities Commission hearing on BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners’ $6.2 billion proposal to acquire Minnesota Power and its parent company, ALLETE. The commission unanimously approved the deal, and we brought you inside the room where it all went down. My post-hearing dispatch was a follow-up to a previous story I had written about pushback against the acquisition and the Minnesota Department of Commerce’s role in drumming up support for the takeover. Read the story. Concurrently, I had been chipping away at what would become my first-ever long-form feature for the Prospect. The piece offers a comprehensive look at the root causes of soaring electricity prices, influence-peddling by investor-owned utilities, and efforts by public power advocates to trigger a paradigm shift in the fundamental design of the utility system. My reporting also took me to Milwaukee, where I shadowed organizers with Milwaukee Democratic Socialists of America’s Power to the People campaign. As one public power advocate told me, the energy system “connects all of us to one another in the country, no matter who you are or where you live, which makes it an incredible site for building back our relationships and our social fabric.” Read the story. Thanks to you, we hit our December fundraising goal! Independent journalism takes resources, and your support makes it possible for us to keep exposing corporate power and defending democracy. We’re so grateful to everyone who chipped in. If you missed the campaign, it’s never too late to sustain this work — your support matters year-round.

Greetings. Today we are starting the last Dark Room of 2025, with wishes for health and happiness in the salvific new year 2026, until we speak again, God willing, on Monday, January 5. Until then, and with the permission of our good farmers who are slightly relaxing the roadblocks, we will be able to go on holiday or at least move around the Greek countryside, probably with somewhat more wintry weather. Perhaps even with a little snow—don’t imagine anything dramatic. Otherwise, it seems that there must have been a lot of backlash in society against the tactics and behavior of the farmers who block the roads (something… more than what fell on the government), and that’s why they decided to step a bit aside and open the roads somewhat so people can go on their holidays or return to their homes. An era of frenzy… The truth is that in all the years I’ve been working, I don’t remember a single time, under any government, when the prime minister called a professional group—farmers or anyone else—to dialogue and they refused to go and instead sent an ultimatum. You might say, here we saw a soldier—indeed from the Special Forces—speaking at a protest rally about the budget, and the KKE and SYRIZA issuing statements because he was removed from the Special Forces and even received a prison sentence in the Army. Incredible things, right? Really, what would happen in Russia or China or Cuba if a conscript went to demonstrations—don’t the KKE or SYRIZA tell us? Of course, this is not allowed even in normal Western democracies, nor does the Greek Constitution allow it. Carols and coffees In any case, the government and parties are slowing down these days and until the beginning of next week things will be relaxed. Tasoulas, Mitsotakis, and the political leaders will listen to the customary carols today, and then each will take the road for the last gifts they need to buy and for the New Year’s Eve dinner. Mitsotakis was supposed to give an interview on SKAI radio, but it was postponed. In any case, he will stay within the city walls, and on New Year’s Day he will honor the… customs, that is, service at the Metropolis and then coffee with Tasoulas at Da Capo in Kolonaki Square, despite the biting cold that morning. And after that, off with the yoke, since after many years the rather outdated custom of New Year’s greetings at the Presidential Mansion was “cut.” ATHEX: “For reasons of transparency and legal certainty” The Capital Market Commission asked ATHEX—for reasons of clarity—to inform the investing public what happened with the previous General Meeting, the invitation to shareholders, whether anything was approved or not, etc. After the intervention, ATHEX issued an announcement that it is convening again the extraordinary General Meeting on 20/1/26, because “it was deemed necessary due to procedural issues of convening the GM of the 22nd, during which in any case no relevant decisions were taken.” The announcement concludes that the Meeting must be repeated “for reasons of transparency and legal certainty.” The first plans of Euronext: Streamlining ATHEX operations Meanwhile, the future president of ATHEX, who is now awaiting January 20 to assume his duties, Camil Beutin, is an Euronext executive specializing in energy and has worked for more than three decades at Euronext Oslo and Nord Pool (an energy platform owned by Euronext). He is coming to Athens with a specific agenda that he will immediately put into action. He will start with the introduction of new exchange products (e.g. ETFs, which are particularly popular in Amsterdam) and at the same time will try to include Greek mid-cap listed companies (from €200 to €500 million) on other Euronext platforms, in countries where they already have export activity and are known. His goal is to broaden the reach of listed companies with shareholder-investors from countries where Euronext operates. It also appears, however, that the (necessarily) president-in-waiting Camil Beutin intends to “dig into” some files with issues that fall within the logic of rationalization and streamlining of ATHEX’s operations. Bank of Epirus received signals for January On December 15, the Executive Act of the Governor (EPATh) of the Bank of Greece was issued regarding the conditions for converting cooperative banks into public limited companies. Essentially, the BoG gave the green light to the four cooperative banks (Karditsa, Chania, Epirus, Thessaly) to obtain a nationwide license provided they have minimum share capital of €18 million. The Bank of Epirus held an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders on December 29 to convert into a public limited company, in order to open the way for the entry of strategic investor Peter Nomikos, who has expressed his intention to invest €30 million. Information suggests that the management of the Bank of Epirus now has clear indications that the fit & proper approval of P. Nomikos will come from the SSM within January, and therefore it is preparing the ground for a €30 million share capital increase. It is important that the capital increase will take place without dilution, but at the book value of the Bank of Epirus—though we will see this. All cooperative banks are seeking a strategic investor Based on the EPATh of the Bank of Greece, the former Cooperative Banks must adjust their own funds no later than March 31, 2026, and of course must have completed the process of converting into public limited companies in order to attract investors. Information indicates that Cooperative Bank of Thessaly is one step closer to the entry of a strategic investor; Karditsa has already expanded into neighboring prefectures but has not yet announced a broadening of its shareholder base; while in Chania, Ioannis Michos, coming from London, has joined as Executive Member of the Board with the goal of capital strengthening. The issue of capital is extremely important, since banking is now a very expensive business. Whether a bank has 1 branch or 100 branches, the very costly IT systems must be installed, supervisory capital must be available, and auditing procedures must be complete and operational. The game has started, and the efforts to capture market shares will be of exceptional interest. Teachers, police officers, and firefighters in Intralot A significant number of domestic mutual funds have taken positions in Intralot. As shown by the company’s shareholder register at the recent General Meeting, the largest positions are held by Alpha Bank and Optima mutual funds (Optima Greek Balanced, Optima Greek Equity) with approximately 6.6 million shares each; the National Asset Management mutual funds with approximately 5.6 million shares; while a significant position continues to be held by K. Antonopoulos, former CEO of the company, with approximately 9.2 million shares. Beyond that, there are smaller positions held by pension funds such as the Teachers Retirement System of Texas, funds for police officers and firefighters of New Jersey, mutual funds of Vanguard, Aviva, BlackRock, MorningStar, etc. Swiss franc: Who will ultimately say “yes” to the restructuring Banks have already started running their models for Swiss franc loans, as the new year brings developments. In about two months, borrowers will be called upon to decide whether they will join the restructuring, making a decision that will determine the course of their loan from now on. Banks are trying to determine the acceptance mix of the restructuring, since this is what will lead them to accurately calculate their provisions. According to banks’ estimates, those who can join the restructuring are borrowers without income criteria, and they will do so if their loan is not particularly mature. If, however, it is mature, given that their interest rate increases from 0% plus a 1% spread to 2.90%, they have no reason to do so. On the other hand, banks estimate that the greatest interest in the restructuring will come from those entitled to higher haircuts, based on income criteria. For this group, joining the restructuring may prove to be more attractive and a substantial relief, since the haircut reaches 50% and the interest rate 2.30%. However, a significant issue arises here: to what extent these particular borrowers can service the restructuring. It is worth highlighting an important advantage for many borrowers with a long repayment horizon: by converting the loan into euros, they essentially start from a point of departure where from then on they will see the outstanding balance of their loan gradually decrease—something that until now did not happen, due to the continuous appreciation of the Swiss franc. 25 listed companies have closed 280 meetings in Paris On January 29, 2026, a Thursday, the Piraeus Bank roadshow with companies listed on the Athens Exchange will finally take place at the famous Espace Cléry in Paris. Participation has already been locked in for 21 listed companies, and an impressively large number of one-on-one meetings with investors—more than 280—has been recorded. There is particular activity and interest for the “newcomers” to this institution, smaller-cap companies such as Profile, Alumil, AVAX, and Alter Ego. On the banking side, participation has already been confirmed (also with many meetings) by Alpha Bank, Piraeus Bank, and Bank of Cyprus, followed by Metlen, Motor Oil, TITAN, OPAP, GEK TERNA, PPC, Athens International Airport, Cenergy, ELVALHALCOR, Aegean, HelleniQ Energy, Lamda Development, AVAX, KRI-KRI. Information indicates that the final number of participants will certainly reach 25, provided a sufficient number of one-on-one meetings is secured. Espace Cléry is an imposing, historic building in Paris’s 2nd arrondissement, in the heart of Sentier, and was once the residence of the famous painter Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun. There, the 25 listed companies will paint the future of the Athens Stock Exchange… The background behind the shipping deals of the Greeks Greek shipowners continue to work quietly and methodically, letting their moves speak for themselves. During the festive period, the “hits” were many. On the newbuilding front, Aegean Bulk Co. Inc. closed four 82,000 dwt bulkers at Hengli Shipbuilding (Dalian), with deliveries in 2027–2028—a move read as a steady investment in capacity, without haste but with a clear horizon. At the same time, Cape Shipping shows it is not moving away from crude: one firm and one optional VLCC 319,000 dwt at Qingdao Beihai Shipyard, for 2028, with scrubbers and a price around $119 million. Details matter here. In tankers, Capital Ship Management added two orders and two optional LR2/Aframax 114,000 dwt at Hengli, for delivery in 2028, discreetly strengthening its portfolio. V Group, on the other hand, opted for containers: two feeder 1,930 TEU at Guangzhou Wenchong Shipyard, LNG dual-fuel, with deliveries 2028–2029. Those who follow the trends take notes. And in LPG, Benelux Overseas proceeded with two VLACs 93,000 cbm at HD Hyundai in South Korea, also dual-fuel, with delivery in 2028—a move showing persistence in a specific strategic path. In second-hand tonnage, the Greeks were not absent. The capesize ANTONIS ANGELICOUSSIS (177,855 dwt, 2007, Shanghai Waigaoqiao) changed hands at $20.5 million to Greek interests, while Oceanstar Management Inc. acquired the Ultramax IVS WINDSOR (60,279 dwt, 2016, Oshima) with cranes, for $26 million. At the same time, Greek-controlled vessels were also on the sellers’ side: the Handysize APHRODITE M (36,000 dwt, 2011, SPP) at $12.5 million, as well as the pair of Post-Panamax PORTO KAGIO and PORTO GERMENO (5,908 / 5,570 TEU, 2002, Koyo Dockyard), linked to Costamare, at $17 million each. The background shows that these are not spasmodic moves. Over the last twelve months, Greek interests count 132 new orders, 158 second-hand purchases, and 14 sales for recycling. As 2025 reached its end, the picture is clear: fleet renewal, careful choices, and a game played without noise but with clear targeting. Navios: Premium now, but with timing risk The three-year charter of Navios Destiny of Navios, interests of Angeliki Frangou, at $34,000 per day from Cosco shows that the company is selling market strength in the present, securing premium revenues for a vessel whose age under other conditions would pressure rates. From analysts’ perspective, this is clearly accretive for upcoming results and improves the short-term cash flow picture. However, timing matters. The question is not whether the deal is good today—because it is. It is whether, in 18 or 24 months, the market will be higher or lower than these levels. Navios appears to be choosing certainty over optionality. For Wall Street, this is neither right nor wrong. It is simply a clear stance on how it currently reads the container shipping cycle. Petros Panagiotidis’ reverse split In the language of Wall Street analysts, Robin Energy’s move constitutes an act of compliance. The 1:5 reverse split was not carried out to change the narrative, but to close a technical risk: the loss of the Nasdaq’s $1 minimum price requirement. With the stock at $0.71, the management of Petros Panagiotidis chose the most direct and institutionally acceptable path. The result—a price of $3.58—restores the relationship with the market without creating expectations that cannot be supported. The $1 million buyback that preceded it is read by funds as a signal of stabilization, not as an aggressive positioning. At the same time, the data from the LPG carriers provide what managers are looking for: cash-flow visibility. Contracts with well-known counterparties, locked-in revenues of more than $5.5 million, and coverage of 59% of days for 2026 are not impressive, but they reduce risk. That is exactly what is reflected in the models. Robin, a spin-off of Toro Corp, is not attempting a high-profile repositioning. It demonstrates discipline with market rules and a focus on operational performance, with the MR tanker following the seasonal improvement in charter rates. For institutional investors, the message is clear: no promises of capital gains, predictability, and remaining on the board. The first victim of 2026 will be the yen Hedge funds are very much like sharks. Once they smell blood, they rush to devour whatever is still alive. At this time, many hedge funds have taken positions against the Japanese yen at levels that strongly resemble the crisis of July 2024. More than 85,000 contracts of net short positions were recorded on December 14, betting on further weakening of the Japanese currency. It all starts with the interest-rate differential between the dollar and the yen, which today reaches as much as 3 percentage points. The Bank of Japan, despite the recent rate hikes it deemed necessary, is moving cautiously so as not to choke growth. The problem, however, lies in Japan’s real interest rates. They remain negative, since inflation is running faster than the BoJ’s rates. Those who hold yen-denominated accounts see their purchasing power eroding and are seeking more profitable deposit options. This is a classic déjà vu. Around this time last year, the dollar–yen exchange rate had exceeded 160, forcing the Ministry of Finance to proceed with immediate intervention to support the national currency. Some believe the same will happen this year. That is why they are taking short positions, expecting intervention. The U.S. stock market is flying. But not all of it… Everyone admires the U.S. stock indices, their resilience and momentum. But indices do not tell the whole truth. The 10 largest companies on Wall Street now account for 22% of global stock market capitalization. This is the highest level of the past 50 years. The top five alone reach 15%. It is a historic record. Goldman Sachs processed a chart of funding spreads that reveals the other side of the story. Professional investors are moving with extreme caution. Funding spreads are dropping sharply despite the upward course of the S&P 500. This divergence is a classic warning: when large institutional investors reduce their leverage even as the market rises, they are usually pricing in major turbulence. Concentration in a few stocks—the famous “Magnificent Seven” and a few more technology giants—creates the illusion of diversification. All investment advisors urge diversification: don’t put all your eggs in one basket, diversify your investment choices. An investor who thinks that by holding a global index ETF they are diversified, in reality has 22% of their exposure in just 10 companies. In roughly the same sector. Obviously, these 10 companies stand out today for their size and prospects. But if there is a sudden change of scenery, if something changes in laws and regulations, what will happen? Already today, investors in Artificial Intelligence companies are no longer satisfied with potential; they want concrete results after three years of gigantic investments. But what if those investments do not deliver as expected? What if something unforeseen happens? Explore related questions

Title: My 2026 Investment Plan

I recently automated withdrawals from one conservative Traditional IRA (Core TIRA) into my short-term investment bucket for basic spending needs and emergencies. Previously, I automated withdrawals from a more aggressive Traditional IRA for longer-term discretionary spending needs. This exercise increased my focus on income. I just added Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) to my Core TIRA sub-portfolio as a lower-risk income fund rather than to pursue higher returns. The Core TIRA is conservate Traditional IRA, within the Intermediate Investment Bucket, that is intended to have long-term returns of 7% or more on average, have maximum drawdowns of -15% or less during a severe bear market, and provide steady income of at least 4%. This sub-portfolio has an allocation to stocks of 25%, but utilizes six funds classified as “flexible portfolio” or “alternative”. Now that I have completed the Core TIRA portfolio, I am preparing for a mid-2026 review when a bond matures and needs to be reinvested. In this article, I review historical distribution yields and look at the life-of-fund drawdowns and correlations. I evaluate the performance of the Core TIRA over the past five years with and without Standpoint Multi-Asset as a potential purchase, and compare the results against Vanguard Global Wellesley. I conclude with long-term views of the economy by the OECD, the Federal Reserve survey of professional forecasters, and a look at Vanguard’s time-varying portfolio. I wanted to understand the potential for the funds in my Core TIRA to produce a steady income of 4% per year. Some funds in the Core TIRA have yields, including capital gains, that fluctuate with the interest rate cycle, others that fluctuate according to the stock market cycle, and still others that provide a steady stream of income. I calculated the total distribution since 2019 by year from historical prices at the NASDAQ website and distribution history from Seeking Alpha. Yields for 2025 will change with end-of-year distributions. Table #1 shows the yields per year for each of the funds in my Core TIRA, with red shading indicating the lowest yield and blue shading the highest. All of the funds yielded at least 3.2% over the past six years, with PAIMX yielding 6.0%. Those whose inception date is after 2019 have the symbol highlighted in yellow. Three funds (FPFIX, JAAA, PVCMX) have higher yields when interest rates are high, and may have downward pressure on yields as interest rates fall. Those whose yield fluctuates more with the stock market cycle (PCBAX, AVALX, CTFAX) appear to have larger distributions when opportunities in the stock market appear to be low. PMAIX and PONAX have the most consistent distributions, with PMAIX having the potential for a higher total return. Of the two funds that I am considering adding in my mid-2026 review, EAGMX has high steady yields, while REMIX has a low correlation to the S&P 500 and bonds, and a higher potential for total return. Table #1: Historical Distribution Yield Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset, Seeking Alpha, NASDAQ. The objective of the Core TIRA portfolio, including the bond ladder, is to provide steady returns and cash flow that grow with inflation into my Investment Bucket #1 for spending even through a secular bear market. Table #2 shows how funds in my Core TIRA have performed over their lives, sorted from lowest risk to highest. All of the funds had an APR of almost 4% or higher during their lives. “APR Min 10-yr Roll” shows the return for the worst ten-year rolling period within the life of the fund. The purpose of finding uncorrelated funds is to ensure that funds are not moving down at the same time. For long-term stability, I like CTFAX and PMAIX, which had “APR Min 10-yr Roll” of 4.7% or more. Table #2: Author’s Core TIRA Portfolio – Life of Fund Metrics Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I used Portfolio Visualizer to further analyze the Core TIRA portfolio for the past five years, including adding REMIX as shown in Table #3. I compare it to Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX), which I also own elsewhere. The link to Portfolio Visualizer Portfolio Backtesting is provided here. Table #3: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Figure #1 shows the growth of $10,000 invested in the Core TIRA with and without REMIX, and Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX). I like how REMIX fits into the Core TIRA portfolio, and it increases income. I own Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts for its professional management and simplicity. Figure #1: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer The funds can be loosely divided into three groups based on the past six years: 1) those that had low drawdowns (PVCMX, FPFIX, PCBAX, EAGMX), 2) those that had their maximum drawdown during The Great Normalization with rising rates (PONAX, PZRMX, CTFAX, and IAU), and 3) those that had their maximum drawdown during the COVID bear market (PMAIX, AVALX). Table #4 is the correlation matrix for the funds. They have low correlation with each other; however, PONAX, PZRMX, PMAIX, and CTFAX are moderately correlated. Table #4: Correlation Matrix Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer My conservative Core TIRA sub-portfolio consists of three funds classified as “alternatives”, three mixed asset funds in the “Flexible Portfolio” Lipper Category, and two in the “Multi-Sector Income” Category. I try to capture the objective and strategy of the funds below: Alternative Global Macro: Lipper Definition: Funds that, by prospectus language, invest around the world using economic theory to justify the decision-making process. The strategy is typically based on forecasts and analysis about interest rate trends, the general flow of funds, political changes, government policies, intergovernmental relations, and other broad systemic factors. These funds generally trade a wide range of markets and geographic regions, employing a broad range of trading ideas and instruments. Morningstar classifies PCBAX as “Macro Trading”, but EAGMX as “Nontraditional Bond”. Absolute Return: Lipper Definition: Funds that aim for positive returns in all market conditions. The funds are not benchmarked against a traditional long-only market index but rather have the aim of outperforming a cash or risk-free benchmark. David Snowball wrote Standpoint Multi-Asset Fund: Forcing Me to Reconsider in the November 2021 MFO Newsletter: “The fund provides exposure to equities (which help in times of economic growth or inflation), fixed income (which buffers deflationary periods and stock market declines), and commodities (which are uncorrelated with the first two, making it possible to minimize the effects of both sustained price changes and of an equity market decline). Half of the portfolio is invested in low-cost ETFs to give exposure to the global equity market. The argument is simple: over time, equities make serious money, especially if you don’t overpay for them. The fund holds eight equity ETFs charging between 3 and 7 basis points. The other half of the portfolio is managed futures positions. The positions can be in stocks and fixed income, as well as currencies and commodities. ‘Once a year we pull down the information on all the future contracts in the world, arrayed from most liquid to least liquid. We exclude the untradeable, then select the 75 most liquid in six sectors which includes equity index futures, bond futures, currencies, metals, energy, and agricultural commodities.’ Using a market following strategy, the futures contracts allow the portfolio’s exposure to equity markets to be increased beyond its 50% base (it was at 65% in mid-summer) or decreased to near zero.” Flexible Portfolio: Lipper Definition: Funds that allocate their investments to both domestic and foreign securities across traditional asset classes with a focus on total return. The traditional asset classes utilized are common stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. Morningstar classifies PZRMX as “Global Conservative Allocation”, PMAIX as “Global Moderate Allocation”, and CTFAX as “Tactical Allocation”. In Figure #2, I compare Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) and Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) to PCBAX, PMAIX, and CTFAX. Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) has a smooth, low-risk profile and yields 5.6%. EAGMX had a maximum drawdown of -3% during the Great Financial Crisis, while PCBAX had a drawdown of -29%. I bought PCBAX because it has returned 4.9% annualized since 2010, while EAGMX returned 3.4%. I favor REMIX for its low correlation to other funds in the Core TIRA. Figure #2: Comparison of Funds in Watch List to Core Funds in Portfolio Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. During the first half of this decade, the investment environment has experienced a lot of turbulence. I expect the second half to be more turbulent and have reduced risk accordingly. I recently attended the Economy Watch webinar by The Conference Board. They estimate that global growth will moderate over the next 15 years, and long-term growth in the U.S. will slow to less than 2.0%. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its OECD Economic Outlook, Volume 2025 Issue 2, which shows its estimates of real GDP growth in the U.S. to be below 2.0% in 2026 and 2027. The Fourth Quarter 2025 Survey of Professional Forecasters by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia estimates that real GDP will be 1.8% in 2026, 2.1% in 2027, and 1.8% in 2028. In my opinion, the U.S. economy is experiencing slowing growth in the late stage of the business cycle. Vanguard updated its time-varying portfolio in Bonds Remain In Favor In Time-Varying Model Portfolio. They describe it as, “The TVAA strategy is built on the framework of the Vanguard Asset Allocation Model (VAAM), driven by forecasts generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model (VCMM).” Their TVAA model results in a globally diversified 40/60 portfolio tilted toward value, as shown in Figure #3. The TVAA has an expected annualized 10-year return of 5.7%. Figure #3: Vanguard TVAA Model Source: Vanguard calculations, as of October 31, 2025 I use financial advisors at Vanguard to manage a portion of my portfolio using both index and actively managed funds. The time-varying strategy is not one of the options available. Over the past year, I have lowered my overall stock-to-bond allocation from 65% to 50% with a below-average allocation to technology because I expect stocks to have below-average returns. I invest in Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts, which has a 40/60 allocation, but also in Vanguard Global Wellington, which has a 60/40 allocation. I can sleep at night with the Bucket Approach and my Core TIRA account to meet essential spending needs and emergencies even in a secular bear market. During my mid-2026 review, I will ensure that sufficient funds are in place to meet 2027 withdrawals and confirm if I want to: 1) extend a rung in the bond ladder with iShares iBonds Dec 2034 Term Corporate ETF (IBDZ), 2) add Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to the Core TIRA, 3) increase the allocation to Victory Pioneer Multi-Asset Income (PMAIX) because of its focus on steady and high income, and 4) reduce investments in non-core bond funds. I don’t plan to sell any of the ten core funds in the Core TIRA. I wish everyone a happy and prosperous 2026. Lynn Bolin retired in June 2022 and is immensely enjoying the more relaxed lifestyle.

Title: January 1, 2026

Welcome to the New Year’s issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. We’re glad you’re here. Heraclitus, the famously elusive Greek philosopher, reminded his students that you cannot step into the same river twice. Both we and the river will have changed. According to legend, one of those students – snarky little barstid – replied: “I don’t think you can step into the same river once.” Even as we step, the river flows and changes. As do we. Heraclitus was speaking of a physical river. Centuries later, we have extended his insights to allow us to consider the River of Time itself: the continuous flow in which change happens, meaning accumulates, and our lives—and markets—actually unfold. January has that fluid quality. We think of ourselves standing on the bank of the River, looking backward and forward at once—convinced that the past can be measured and the future mapped, even as the present slips by almost unnoticed. The river does not pause for our resolutions. In reality, we don’t just get to watch time rush past; we are not on the bank, we are in the river. We may think we resolutely face the future, eyes upstream, scrying risk and opportunity. We may turn our back to the torrent, knowing that we can only know what has already passed and contemplating the dark sea into which it must eventually empty. We might be still and resolute, like a stone, or moving along with the flow. The young might experience a mere ankle-deep flow while some of us experience … the deeper currents pulling toward that wine-dark sea. Perspective matters. And metaphors matter because they teach us what to look for. From the riverbank, all motion feels alarming. From within the river, we begin to notice that not all movement means change, not all froth is consequential, and not all change arrives with noise. Some of what most shapes our lives—technological shifts, medical progress, environmental repair—moves steadily, almost invisibly, beneath the surface. This January issue of the Observer lingers over a stretch of the river that many hurried past. Amid the noise and anxiety of 2025, extraordinary things went quietly right: a vast expansion of green energy in China, meaningful progress against several endemic diseases, and other developments that rarely commanded headlines but may shape lives for decades to come. Uncertain times require clear thinking, and clear thinking requires … well, a functioning brain. In “New Year’s Resolution #1: Avoid lobotomies” we look at the threat that AI seductively poses to brains … yours, your alma mater’s, and your investment advisor’s. A short sidebar piece, “What Five AI Told Me About Investing in 2026, and what their answers tell you,” highlights the problematic patterns in AI’s response to an (admittedly unfair) question about what’s going to win in the year ahead. Our colleague Lynn Bolin contributes two complementary pieces exploring income-focused investing for the uncertain years ahead. In “My 2026 Investment Plan,” Lynn walks through the construction of his conservative Core TIRA portfolio – a traditional IRA designed to generate a steady income of at least 4% while limiting drawdowns to -15% during severe bear markets. He demonstrates how different funds yield differently depending on whether they’re responding to interest rate cycles or stock market cycles, and evaluates adding Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to improve diversification. Particularly valuable: Lynn’s analysis of how his portfolio performed through both the COVID bear market and the Great Normalization’s rising rates, and his discussion of why he’s moved from a 65% stock allocation to 50% as forecasts from the OECD, Federal Reserve, and Conference Board all point to slowing growth ahead. Vanguard’s own time-varying model now recommends a 40/60 stocks-to-bonds allocation – a near-revolutionary flip from the traditional 60/40. In “A Closer Look at Income Strategy,” Lynn drills deeper into the mechanics of generating steady income in an environment where short and intermediate Treasury yields are falling while long-term rates rise. Working from 30,000 feet (which Lipper categories produce income in low-yield environments) down to ground level (specific fund recommendations), he identifies funds that maintained consistent yields through multiple market cycles. His analysis reveals that some funds distribute more when stock market opportunities appear limited, while others fluctuate with interest rates – and a select few provide genuinely steady income regardless of market conditions. The payoff: an example portfolio that achieved 7.7% annual returns with a maximum drawdown of just -9.8% over the past six years while yielding 5.2%. The Shadow, as ever, surveys the month’s most consequential changes in the fund and ETF world in “Briefly Noted.” We also pause, briefly and with gratitude, to acknowledge those who have sustained the Observer—financially, intellectually, and through simple acts of encouragement. And then, before the current carries us onward, we raise a glass to what has been, to what is, and to what may yet emerge from upstream. Pessimism is easy. Way too easy, frankly. If I were to construct the Pessimism Industrial Complex, it would have three pillars: The federal government is controlled by toddlers, a bunch famous for tantrums when their irrational, I-am-the-universe demands are not met. And so we get the Trump Kennedy Center, chaired by Donald J. Trump and the Donald J. Trump US Institute for Peace. The Trump-class battleships that will populate The Golden Fleet. The Trump dollar coin. The Trump accounts for infants. The decision to make access to the national parks free on Trump’s birthday, which, I think, is somewhere in the month of Trumpruary. There are no adults left in the room. Interviews with three departing US senators made two points: (1) every member of the US Senate is appalled and (2) they’re all waiting “for the right time” to, you know, develop a spine, remember their oath of office, or something (“Why Won’t Senators Stand Up to Trump? We Asked 3 Who Called It Quits,” New York Times, 12/13/2025). Until then, the federal response to a global climate crisis is “don’t wanna and you can’t make me!” When you’re dealing with a creature named “The Doomsday Glacier,” it’s easy to foresee Bad Things Aplenty. The media loves reporting bad news. We don’t know where the newsroom adage “if it bleeds, it leads” originated – the confident online assertions about Hearst in the 1890s is unattributed and a random New York Magazine article in 1989 is laughably wrong – but it does express a well-documented truth. Bad news sells, terrible news sells more. A 20-year study of German media found a “significant, positive correlations between explicitly negative cover pages and the magazines’ sales” (Arango-Kure and Marcel Garz, “Bad News Sells,” Journal of Media Economics, 2014). Globally, every additional negative word added to a story’s title increases readership (Robertson, et al, “Negativity drives online news consumption,” Nature: Human Behavior, 2023; btw, their study of 105,000 online news stories also found that positive words in titles drove down readership) and the more negative a story is, the more frequently and widely it’s shared on social media (Watson, et al, “Negative online news articles are shared more to social media,” Scientific Reports, 2024). You love to doom-scroll. Doom‑scrolling, for the three of you who didn’t know, is the practiced art of dragging your thumb down an endless feed of bad news long after you have stopped learning anything new. It is not just “reading the news online”; it is staying locked in the loop of crisis headlines, live‑updated horrors, and algorithm-driven outrage until your mood and sense of the world are thoroughly saturated. Some psychologists speculate that it’s a hard-wired behavior; within evolutionary time-frames, our survival depends on obsessively locating and assessing all potential threats in our neighborhood (“is that a nice kitty or a creature whose nickname for me is ‘niblet’?”), and doom-scrolling is just the latest iteration of the impulse. Surveys and behavioral studies suggest that a substantial minority of adults, and a flat‑out majority of younger users, now report doom‑scrolling regularly (“Gen Z has a doomscrolling problem,” Newsweek, 5/11/2025). In those same studies, heavier doom‑scrolling is consistently associated with higher levels of stress, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and even secondary trauma symptoms, a joy of witnessing wave after wave of misery through a four‑inch screen (Satici, et al, “Doomscrolling Scale: its Association with Personality Traits, Psychological Distress, Social Media Use, and Wellbeing,” Applied Research in the Quality of Life, 2022). And, boy howdy, is there a fair number of regrettable developments in the world. Andrew Winston’s curiously optimistic essay in Forbes (“2025: the year sustainability didn’t die,” 12/21/2025) began with a fairly bracing list of negatives: … the harsh reality is the world’s greatest challenges [are] getting worse. Inequality grew, especially at the very top, where individuals amassed unfathomable wealth (hundreds of billions of dollars) and some corporate valuations hit unreal heights ($4 trillion to $5 trillion). Meanwhile, climate impacts escalated; political winds don’t change actual winds. For example, part of Los Angeles burned to the ground (at an estimated cost of up to $250 billion) during unprecedented wildfires, historic heat baked India, Pakistan, and the EU, and devastating floods in Texas killed dozens of children. Scientists told us that climate change is “beyond scientific dispute,” at “tipping points,” and “extremely dangerous” (and that the world will blow past the 1.5C warming target). Insurer Allianz issued an eye-popping report that climate change could “destroy capitalism.” In addition, the world got less democratic and pulled to the right and generally away from the sustainability agenda, making collective action even harder. This puts more pressure on businesses. And even facing headwinds, sustainability didn’t die. That’s the top story of the year. Let’s look at that and some other big themes. Well … yeah. But if pessimism feels effortless at the end of 2025, that is not just because the news is bad; it is because you are mainlining it, in real time, on an interface designed never to run out. Much of our success as a species is driven by two factors: a good plan and resilience in executing it. The media’s business model tends to emphasize doom because, well, doom sells. But 2025 offered remarkable evidence that when we commit to sustained action—plugging ozone holes, protecting beaches, installing solar panels, developing breakthrough medicines, restoring ecosystems—we can achieve transformations that once seemed impossible. In our draft letter, what follows are eleven pages of incredibly consequential, positive developments. Chip’s anguished plea, “have mercy on their eyes!” led us to share the news in two forms: a dozen bullet points here and a dozen pages of detail in a sidebar story entitled, “The Big Box of Delights.” So here’s what happened while doom was scrolling: In November, a liquor store employee in Virginia discovered broken bottles and an apparently intoxicated raccoon sleeping on the store’s bathroom floor. An animal control officer noted that he fell through a ceiling tile, “went on a rampage, drinking everything,” with a special fondness for … umm, whisky. The animal showed no signs of injury, according to local animal protection services, though they guessed the raccoon might be grappling with “a hangover” and regret over “poor life choices.” Figure 1: Raccoon regretting its poor life choices. Source: NBC News. The story delighted readers across the political spectrum—a rare moment of shared laughter in a divided time. But it became more than a viral moment when merchandise commemorating the raccoon’s night of debauchery raised a quarter of a million dollars for the local animal shelter that housed him. The Hanover County animal protection service teamed up with apparel maker Bonfire to create shirts, sweatshirts, cups, and stickers featuring the now-infamous image of a raccoon spreadeagled next to a spilled booze bottle, along with the words “Trashed Panda.” Through 12/22, they’ve sold 19,764 against a goal of 20,000. The drunk raccoon reminds us that hope sometimes arrives in unexpected forms: in a hungover raccoon that brings people together, in merchandise that funds animal care, in our capacity to find joy and meaning in the absurd. On Christmas Day, Pope Leo made his traditional papal “Urbi et Orbi” address, Latin for “To the City and to the World,” which summarizes the bad news (see above, plus your danged doomscroll) and prescribes a response: put aside indifference, stop scrolling and start acting, stand with the oppressed rather than the oppressive. “There will be peace when our monologues are interrupted and, enriched by listening, we fall to our knees before the humanity of the other.” Stop wasting our time demonizing one another? Dreamer. Progress is rarely dramatic. It’s built day by day through the determined efforts of scientists, healthcare workers, conservationists, educators, and ordinary citizens working to solve problems both great and small. While 2025’s headlines often focused on conflict and crisis, millions of people worldwide continued humanity’s long tradition of quietly building a better world. They dreamt of better, and acted. The answer to “what’s there to be optimistic about?” is the same as it was in 2025, and will be in 2027: enormous things happened because millions of good people rejected the counsel of despair, and that you probably didn’t hear about because doom sells better than progress. The choice isn’t between naive optimism and realistic despair. It’s between staying informed about what’s actually happening—the turtle populations recovering, the emissions curves bending, the diseases being eliminated, the hungover raccoons raising money for animal shelters—and letting a curated feed of catastrophe convince you that nothing good is possible. Step away from the mediated world and step into the immediate one. Put your phones away. Hug someone today. Smile at a stranger. Do a good deed. Read a book. We recommend Always Remember (2025), a singularly beautiful little 30-minute read that reminds you of important things you already know but need to hear. Subscribe to Nautilus, a site (and magazine) that reminds you that science is cool … and important.

(Want cool pictures, more detail, and a couple more stories? Open “The Big Box o’ Delights.” Or, if you’re in the long-scroll version, just keep scrolling!) The question’s not hypothetical, at least for investors. In truth, you have no idea of what’s coming. If you knew, you’d be richer than Croesus. Two things are true when we stand in the river of time: we can see neither the river’s bottom nor what’s coming at us from just around the bend. The bottom might fall out. The torrent might be nearly upon us. We cannot know, but we’ve still got to act. In general, the guides that professionals use are called “capital market assumptions” – data-driven estimates of the range of likely outcomes given current inputs. “Given a CAPE of 40 and capex spending of X, the likeliest range of US equity returns over the next 3-5 years falls between…” The recommendations that flow from those assumptions are called “strategic asset allocations,” statements that say broadly “a prudent investor with an intermediate time horizon should plan on holding X% in equities, with the possibility of some adjustments as markets evolve.” The problem is that there are a million factors weighing on markets, but not all million – birth rates in Nigeria? thawing permafrost in Siberia? financial nihilism in Gen Z? – can be incorporated into the models. Different trillion-dollar advisors reach very different trillion-dollar conclusions about what course to chart. Two of the largest firms – BlackRock and Vanguard – seem to have reached starkly different conclusions about prudent investor behavior. Given Vanguard’s intrinsic conservativeness, their new recommendation seems particularly tectonic. Vanguard’s call: For investors with a medium-term outlook (3-5 years), flip the traditional 60% stocks/40% bonds allocation to 40/60. Same expected returns as 60/40, but with substantially less risk. Why? The S&P 500’s CAPE ratio sits at 40.40 – rivaling the dot-com bubble peak. Vanguard projects US equities will return just 3.5% to 5.5% annually over the next decade, while growth stocks (including the Magnificent Seven) may deliver only 2.3% to 4.3%. Meanwhile, bonds now offer 3.8% to 4.8% with far less volatility. Roger Aliaga-Díaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction: “We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity.” This isn’t panic or market timing. In a December podcast, Vanguard’s chief economists explained that “stay the course” never meant “never adjust your allocation.” It meant stay invested, avoid emotional decisions, but use evidence-based risk management. Their Time-Varying Asset Allocation model – driven by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model that processes decades of data on risk factors and returns – now suggests this is a moment for conservative asset allocation. They estimate a 25-30% probability that AI disappoints and fails to deliver on current expectations. Goldman Sachs concurs on muted US prospects, forecasting just 6.5% annual S&P 500 returns through 2035 – driven by earnings, not the multiple expansion that powered the last decade. They see better opportunities elsewhere: Emerging Markets (+10.9%), Asia ex-Japan (+10.3%), Japan (+8.2%). The “multiple expansion era” is over, they argue. Profit margins already jumped from 5% in 1990 to 13% today and can’t expand further. BlackRock takes the opposite view: Stay pro-risk, overweight US stocks on the AI theme. Yes, valuations are stretched, and concentration is concerning, but AI capital spending is transforming the economy at an unprecedented scale. The challenge isn’t whether to reduce equity exposure – it’s identifying which companies beyond the current winners will capture AI revenues as they spread across sectors. Their 2026 outlook emphasizes “the diversification mirage” – that traditional diversifiers like long-term Treasuries now offer diminished cushion, so seek idiosyncratic returns in private markets and active strategies instead. T. Rowe Price splits the difference: Neutral on equities overall but underweight US large-cap (-2.0%) while overweight small-cap, international, and emerging markets. They’re concerned about “the narrowness of AI trends” and prefer to position for market broadening. Like Vanguard, they’re underweight long-term bonds, worried about fiscal deficits keeping upward pressure on rates. What’s an investor to make of this? The honest answer is that nobody knows what’s upstream. Vanguard’s systematic approach says: when you can’t see around the bend, measure what you can – valuations, yields, historical risk/return relationships – and position defensively. BlackRock’s view: the AI build-out is real, the momentum is powerful, stay engaged but stay nimble. Both might be right over different time horizons. The shift isn’t just theoretical. Our colleague Lynn Bolin has reduced his overall stock allocation from 65% to 50% over the past year, positioning his conservative Core TIRA portfolio to weather what he expects will be a more turbulent second half of the decade. My own long-term allocation, which we discuss each February along with my portfolio, is 50/50. Research Affiliates, whose long-term asset allocation system has been broadly validated, offers striking support for the defensive shift. Their models project that a global 60/40 portfolio will deliver just 2.5% real returns over the next decade with a Sharpe ratio of 0.16. Their conservative model portfolio – shifting to 40% equity/60% bonds with commodities and inflation-linked assets – projects 3.5% real returns with a Sharpe ratio of 0.44. The more defensive portfolio projects higher returns with better risk-adjusted performance. Their analysis also reinforces Goldman’s geographic thesis: looking across asset classes globally, US large-cap growth shows near-zero risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio of -0.01), while developed ex-US large-cap value, emerging markets, and smaller international stocks all show meaningfully better prospects. The message is consistent: lighten on US growth, reduce overall equity exposure, look globally. The takeaway isn’t that one firm has discovered the answer. It’s that even trillion-dollar asset managers using sophisticated models reach honestly different conclusions from the same data. Vanguard says reduce equity risk because valuations are stretched and bonds are finally paying again. BlackRock says stay engaged because AI momentum is real and traditional diversifiers don’t work like they used to. Goldman says look elsewhere entirely – emerging markets and Asia offer better prospects than US equities. Research Affiliates’ models strongly favor the defensive positioning. Which suggests that broad diversification driven by your needs – not by greed or fear or the confident pronouncements of any single adviser – remains the most prudent course when standing in a river whose depths and currents we cannot fully know. The evidence from multiple independent sources supports a more conservative stance than the traditional 60/40 for those with intermediate time horizons. Whether that means 50/50, 40/60, or some other mix depends on your own circumstances, goals, and capacity to weather volatility. But the days of assuming that 60/40 will automatically deliver double-digit returns through multiple expansion and tech dominance? Those have already flowed past us.

Title: BlackRock dumps, Saylor buys: Holiday chaos erupts as crypto market ends 2025

Together, they show two very different institutional approaches to Bitcoin exposure. While many regular investors were relaxing during the holidays, the world’s biggest asset manager was making major moves. BlackRock quietly transferred $214 million worth of Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] to Coinbase Prime in a series of year-end transactions, as reported by Arkham. These transfers come at a key moment for the company’s crypto ETFs, as both IBIT and ETHA are seeing falling investor interest. The on-chain activity suggests BlackRock is no longer just holding crypto; it’s actively managing liquidity to handle a wave of investor redemptions. The $214 million shift appears to be a direct response to cooling demand for U.S. crypto ETFs. Since 18th December, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has faced steady outflows, with $7.9 million leaving the fund on the 29th of December alone. That same day, all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs together saw $19.3 million in withdrawals. Ethereum ETFs are facing similar pressure, with BlackRock’s ETHA losing $13.3 million on the 29th of December, nearly doubling the entire day’s net outflow for Ethereum ETFs. This pattern shows that many institutional investors are pulling back, likely because of year-end tax-loss harvesting and profit-taking after a volatile final quarter. While ETF investors are stepping back, Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is doing the opposite. On the same day, BlackRock saw redemptions, Strategy bought another 1,229 BTC for $108.85 million as per Lookonchain data. The company paid an average of $88,568 per Bitcoin, raising its total holdings to an incredible 672,497 BTC. Despite recent market swings, Strategy is currently sitting on an unrealized profit of about $8.31 billion, a 16% gain overall. This creates an interesting contrast in the crypto market, wherein BlackRock is acting as a liquidity provider, moving BTC and ETH onto exchanges to help ETF investors cash out. Meanwhile, Strategy is acting as a liquidity sink, buying Bitcoin and holding it long-term, taking supply out of the market. Yet, despite all this movement, prices have barely reacted. Bitcoin at press time was changing hands at $87,900, up only 0.24% in 24 hours. On the other hand, Ethereum was trading at $2,974, with a small 0.45% gain. This price-flow divergence, with big movements of money without big moves in price, shows that the market likely expected these end-of-year withdrawals. Therefore, as we move into January, attention will shift from these withdrawals to the new year’s sentiment. Now, whether Saylor can pull retail investors back into the market is still unclear, but one thing is obvious from the on-chain data: the weak hands are exiting, and the biggest players are simply repositioning for 2026.

Title: ROOKE: The Somali Fraud Scandal Gave Trump A Kill Switch. What Happens If He Doesn’t Use It

Americans are demanding action. Anything less will lead to political chaos. “Long Live The King,” The New York Times wrote in February when President Donald Trump posted a picture of himself as Napoleon Bonaparte alongside a quote attributed to the French emperor, “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” It was this level of boldness to do the right thing for our country, no matter the costs, that led millions of Americans to vote for Trump’s second term. The Trump administration started strong. Americans wanted deportations, a rollback on every left-wing ideological policy implemented during the Biden years, and an all-out assault on government fraud and bloat that had become all too common in D.C. He took immediate action on the most critical issues voters mandated in the 2024 election. For a brief moment, it felt like the power we had given Trump and Republicans was paying off in Americans’ favor. Some even dared to say that we had finally gotten our country back. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!) But something happened over the summer. As left-wing judges blocked the Trump administration at every turn, refusing to let deportations continue, and Republicans in Congress failed to codify most of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts that were made, the momentum had shifted back to the bureaucratic blob. This is not to say that the Trump administration has stopped working on these issues, but the rapid-fire successes Americans saw in the first 100 days seemed to have come to an abrupt halt. Congressional Republicans resumed their backdoor dealing, ensuring that important voter wishes were dropped from legislation before it even reached the floor. Americans couldn’t afford to take their eye off of Congress even for a moment lest their elected representatives would secretly be selling their birthright off to BlackRock and Vanguard behind their backs. We don’t need to sell federal land and turn our wilderness into housing developments. If we need more housing, let’s round up all the illegals who don’t belong in this country and evict them. That’ll free up millions of housing units in one fell swoop. Leave the federal land… — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 20, 2025 Then Trump came out and called the face of government corruption – The Epstein List – a hoax. We saw that Democrats were trying to weaponize the human trafficker to own Trump. Still, there was an understanding that Trump would save this country no matter the cost. But Americans were told not to look at it. Attorney General Pam Bondi paraded influencers out with binders of useless pages that did nothing to bring any of the bad actors to justice. Still, we were told to trust the plan. The economic strains on Americans persisted as the summer months passed. Trump flew all around the world settling foreign wars for countries that wouldn’t hesitate to ignore our calls should something kick off here at home. While some of these trips were crucial to ensuring our national economic security, the optics of them, while Americans suffered back home, were less than helpful to his mission. And unless you were clued into the political world, it’s unlikely you saw these trips as anything but an administration focused more abroad than on its citizens. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s polling trended downwards. Americans wanted more relief, action, signs of life. Regardless of what it was, they expected to see more from this administration, which had promised an end to D.C. corruption. Instead, they got a government shutdown, brought on by the same slimy officials who have never hidden their contempt for their constituents. If there was ever a black pill forced down the throats of voters, watching this circus play out live was the ultimate one. Gallup poll | 11/3-11/25 President Trump approval Disapprove 60% (+6) Approve 36% (-5)https://t.co/RFvzrLjT6Z https://t.co/treMZzeKK9 pic.twitter.com/PsH6z5Im0p — Politics & Poll Tracker 📡 (@PollTracker2024) November 28, 2025 When the November elections came and Republican voters who had turned out in droves just one year before sat home, the GOP should have had a wake-up call. Instead, they complained about low-propensity voters and harped about New York City being a hotbed for socialism. However, the writing on the wall is clear: if Republicans don’t act now, there is nothing that will stop a midterm bloodbath, which will return their power to Democrats. However, hope has come in the most unlikely of places. Like Gandalf arriving at Helm’s Deep at first light on the fifth day, emerging from the east with Erkenbrand, rescuing the Rohirrim soldiers and turning the tide of the battle against Saruman’s forces, Somalis in Minnesota were caught defrauding billions in federal funds. Trump has been given the chance to turn back the last eleven months. The anger that even everyday Americans not clued into the political system feel toward the massive fraud uncovered in Minnesota provides almost unlimited leeway to get back to work. But real action has to be taken. MINNESOTA FRAUD: @NickShirleyyy’s work has helped show Americans the scale of fraud in Tim Walz’s Minnesota. @TheJusticeDept has been investigating this for months. So far, we have charged 98 individuals – 85 of Somali descent – and more than 60 have been found guilty in… — Attorney General Pamela Bondi (@AGPamBondi) December 29, 2025 It’s not enough for Bondi and other agencies and officials to post their supposed arrest and conviction stats as proof they are working when more and more fraud is being uncovered, not by them but by citizen journalists. Nothing less than massive arrests and deportations in every state will satisfy Americans looking for action. The focus shouldn’t just be on Somalis or other immigrant groups gaming the corrupt system. Elected officials and their bureaucratic allies need to be taken down with them. Trump needs to use the bully pulpit voters have given him. If Republicans are standing in the way of enacting the will of the people, call them out. Let the voters help take the obstinate D.C. swamp rats out with the trash. Americans want their country back. Kill the fraud. If the Trump administration and GOP Congressmen do not produce adequate results, why would voters ever give them power again? The Democrats will come in and ruin Trump’s legacy. Whatever work he has completed will be torn down, as if this past year never even happened. (A Reckoning In Waiting? — Countries All Around World Fed Up With Their Leaders) It’s not every day you get the chance to turn the tide in a battle for the greatest country ever created.

Title: XRP ETFs Pull In $1.3B in 50 Days—What the Data Suggests if Flows Reach $5B

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © CL STOCK / Shutterstock.com In just 50 days since launch, XRP ETFs pulled in $1.3 billion with 43 consecutive trading days of positive inflows—the first and only zero-inflow day occurred on December 26, 2025. That pace ranks XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) among the fastest institutional adoption curves outside Bitcoin. Institutional capital entered steadily even while XRP’s price fell 50% from its July 2025 peak of $3.56, and the broader crypto markets struggled through December’s volatility. With inflows averaging $27.7 million daily and 746 million XRP now locked in ETF custody, the question becomes structural: What happens to supply, liquidity, and market depth if XRP ETF flows reach $5 billion? FAMILY STOCK / Shutterstock.com In 50 days, XRP ETFs absorbed $1.3 billion while locking 746 million XRP—roughly 1.14% of the 65.5 billion circulating supply—with virtually zero redemptions through late December. The pace shows how quickly institutional capital can tighten supply before prices respond. Here’s how issuers performed. Canary Capital defined the market early. XRPC launched on November 13 and pulled in $250 million on day one. The fund now holds approximately $384 million, roughly 30% of total XRP ETF assets. That share stayed stable despite cheaper competitors entering the market, showing institutions favored liquidity and early access over low fees. Daily inflows often exceeded $100 million outside headline events, signaling durable allocation rather than event-driven trading. Canary’s book reflects committed institutional demand building positions over weeks. Grayscale’s strength came from existing relationships. Assets from its XRP Trust rolled directly into GXRP at launch, creating instant scale without requiring new capital commitments. The fund now manages more than $220 million, and that capital has proven sticky—investors didn’t rotate out after launch-week excitement faded. The conversion structure reduced friction for allocators who wanted regulated exposure without operational changes to custody arrangements. GXRP’s steady flows demonstrate how institutional familiarity still matters in ETF adoption, even when competitors offer lower fees. Franklin took a different approach. XRPZ launched with a 0.19% expense ratio—the lowest in the category—and raised over $190 million. Adoption has been measured rather than explosive, which fits its target audience. As annual portfolio reviews roll through advisory practices in Q1 2026, Franklin’s market share may rise as cost-conscious allocators shift from higher-fee competitors. These quieter flows still contribute meaningfully to tightening available XRP supply, even if they don’t generate daily headline volume. Bitwise attracts active trading desks that rebalance frequently, resulting in uneven but persistent inflows as institutions adjust crypto exposure tactically. 21Shares extends reach through international distribution channels, particularly in Europe where cross-border ETF access matters for multi-jurisdiction allocators. Joyseulay / Shutterstock.com At the current pace, XRP ETF inflows show steady institutional commitment rather than speculative bursts. With roughly $27.7 million entering daily on average over 50 days, assets continue climbing on a predictable trajectory driven by consistent allocation rather than momentum trading. Maintaining this velocity places the $5 billion milestone approximately 130 days away from current levels, pointing to mid-May 2026. Hitting that threshold would lock an estimated 2.6 billion XRP into ETF custody—representing roughly 4% of the 65.5 billion circulating supply. That’s a fourfold increase from current 1.14% lockup levels. That accumulation compounds existing supply removal happening outside ETFs. Exchange balances fell dramatically throughout 2025, dropping from approximately 4 billion XRP at year-start to just 1.6-1.7 billion by late December—a 58% decline. While ETFs absorbed 746 million of that withdrawal, the remaining 1.5+ billion XRP moved into private custody wallets, institutional cold storage, and long-term holder addresses, showing accumulation extending well beyond regulated products. XRP’s supply is fixed at 65.5 billion in circulation, so tokens placed in regulated custody don’t return to active trading unless investors redeem ETF shares. If institutional positions remain in place for quarters rather than weeks, liquidity tightens through structure rather than sentiment, fundamentally reshaping market depth and available float over time regardless of short-term price moves. TopMicrobialStock / Shutterstock.com ETF inflows rarely move in straight lines. Three forces could push XRP funds past the $5 billion mark faster than the current 130-day projection. BlackRock’s absence remains the largest variable in XRP’s ETF growth trajectory. The firm’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) attracted over $40 billion in assets within its first year, demonstrating BlackRock’s unmatched ability to mobilize institutional capital at scale through its Aladdin platform connections and relationships with thousands of wealth advisors. The firm tends to wait for regulatory clarity rather than chase first-mover advantage. Once confident in the legal framework, BlackRock moves decisively. A late XRP ETF filing from BlackRock would carry enormous weight with allocators—many institutions wait for BlackRock’s entry as implicit validation. Based on IBIT’s trajectory, a BlackRock XRP ETF could potentially bring $1-2 billion in launch-month inflows alone, compressing timelines dramatically. As Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin expands across blockchains and into lending markets—currently at approximately $1.3 billion market cap—XRP gains functional relevance beyond passive custody. RLUSD settlement on XRP Ledger creates organic demand for XRP as a bridge currency and fee-payment mechanism. Utility-backed flows tend to be stickier than speculative positioning. If RLUSD scales to $5-10 billion and begins facilitating significant cross-border settlement volume through ODL corridors, the narrative around XRP shifts from “crypto asset” to “payments infrastructure token.” XRP ETF inflows held remarkably steady despite Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs facing significant outflows during the same November-December period. If Bitcoin reclaims $100,000+ and sustains that level through Q1 2026, ETFs across all crypto assets often see second-wave institutional demand. A healthier macro backdrop could lift daily XRP ETF subscriptions well above the current $27.7 million average. XRP ETF inflows have fundamentally shifted the conversation from price speculation to structural market changes. Sustained allocations totaling $1.3 billion over 50 days, 746 million XRP locked away from trading circulation, and disciplined institutional behavior through volatile December conditions all point to a market changing quietly beneath range-bound price action. The path to $5 billion isn’t guaranteed—macro shocks, prolonged underperformance, or capital fragmentation could derail the current trajectory. But the path is measurable and predictable if current conditions hold. At $27.7 million daily, XRP ETFs reach $5 billion by mid-May 2026, locking 4% of circulating supply into regulated custody. From a technical standpoint, XRP consolidating between $1.85-$2.00 while ETF accumulation continues supports the supply squeeze thesis building over months. A decisive breakout above $2.20 with expanding volume would signal the structural changes are beginning to impact price discovery. If $5 billion hits with XRP trading above $2.50, the combination of reduced available float and improving sentiment could accelerate moves toward $3-4 as patient institutional positioning meets returning retail demand.

Title: New York City Pensions Shelve Recommendation to Rebid BlackRock Mandate, Terminate Fidelity

City Comptroller Brad Lander had proposed the moves, alleging the firms have failed to meet the funds’ net zero plans. The trustees of New York City’s five pension funds have shelved recommendations from outgoing New York City Comptroller Brad Lander to rebid BlackRock’s U.S. public equities index mandate and to terminate agreements with Fidelity due to allegedly “inadequate” decarbonization plans. “While I am disappointed in the decision of NYCERS’ trustees to table my recommendation to rebid BlackRock’s mandate today, I hope the trustees will vote to adopt it in the new year, as Comptroller-Elect Mark Levine takes office,” Lander said in a statement issued on December 17. Lander noted that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote in a 2020 letter to CEOs that “climate risk is investment risk” and that the firm was shifting its investment strategy to focus on climate-related investing. “Unfortunately, BlackRock in 2025 is failing to act like it,” Lander said regarding Fink’s position. “BlackRock has chosen to backtrack on their commitments and they now refuse to conduct proxy engagement with companies where they own a significant share of the stock.” Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  Lander, whose term as comptroller will end on January 1, 2026, made his recommendation—after updating the city’s Net Zero Implementation Plan—for three of the five pension funds: the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, the Teachers’ Retirement System of the City of New York and the New York City Board of Education Retirement System. Lander said the recommendations were based on a “rigorous evaluation.” BlackRock’s mandate is set to expire at the end of 2026. When Lander made his recommendation in November, he included agreements with PanAgora Asset Management as ones to be reconsidered. According to his latest announcement, he considers those agreements appropriate to continue, after PanAgora submitted an amended net zero plan that included additional information about its engagement with portfolio companies to encourage them to adopt net zero plans. In response to Lander’s accusations, BlackRock’s Head of the Americas Institutional Business Armando Senra published a letter to Lander accusing him of politicizing the city’s pension funds and stating that altering any of the funds’ portfolios would have to undergo a review process involving the plans’ board and the New York City Bureau of Asset Management investment team. The Bureau of Asset Management, part of the comptroller’s office, is responsible for overseeing the investment portfolios of the city’s public pension systems. According to Senra’s letter, the world’s largest asset manager has had multiple conversations with the bureau’s investment team concerning investment and decarbonization plans over the past several months and met with the funds’ investment team in November to provide an update on BlackRock’s climate and decarbonization stewardship program. “During that meeting, we informed the investment team that a version of this program is now available to each of the five pension plans,” Senra wrote. Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a nonpartisan business advocacy group, said in a statement that Lander’s recommendation is “unilateral and incomprehensible.” “[BlackRock] is a key member of the Partnership for New York City and is well known for its global leadership on sustainability and environmental issue,” Wylde said in the statement. “It is our hope that the pragmatic interests of the city and our public pension funds will prevail over political theater under incoming Comptroller[-Elect] Mark Levine.” Fidelity did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Title: Galaxy Digital: 2026 Too Volatile to Call, but $250K Bitcoin by 2027 Remains Plausible

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © aleks333 / Shutterstock.com Galaxy Digital is taking an unusually candid stance on Bitcoin’s (CRYPTO: BTC) next phase. According to Alex Thorn, the firm’s head of research, Galaxy sees Bitcoin’s 2026 price too chaotic to forecast confidently, even as longer-term conviction remains intact. Galaxy’s comments reflect a market shaped by macro policy swings, political risk, and shifting institutional behavior rather than the clean four-year cycle patterns that defined previous bull runs. Here’s the problem: the Federal Reserve might cut rates 2-3 times or hold steady depending on inflation. Trump administration pro-crypto policies might execute quickly or stall in Congress. Bitcoin’s correlation with stocks means macro data—jobs reports, GDP prints, inflation readings—now drives price more than crypto-specific news. That creates genuine uncertainty where Bitcoin could reasonably land anywhere from $70,000 to $130,000 by mid-2026. Yet beneath that near-term chaos, Galaxy argues that structural adoption continues building. ETFs, corporate balance sheets, and pension frameworks are permanently reshaping institutional capital engagement. That divide explains why short-term forecasts look chaotic while Galaxy’s Bitcoin $250K 2027 target remains firmly on the table. RoseLife_Family / Shutterstock.com Galaxy sees three factors making Bitcoin 2026 unpredictable: Fed rate cuts colliding with stubborn inflation, policy execution risk with midterms approaching, and Bitcoin’s equity correlation tying price to macro data rather than crypto fundamentals. Macro uncertainty sits at the center of Galaxy’s 2026 forecasting problem. The Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts—the market expects 2-3 cuts bringing rates from 4.5% toward 3.5-4%—yet inflation hovering near 3% limits flexibility. The Fed’s 2% target remains out of reach, creating tension between easing policy and controlling prices. Labor data and recession odds remain fluid, keeping policy expectations unstable. Strong jobs reports could delay cuts, while weak GDP prints could accelerate them. This makes it impossible to confidently project where Bitcoin lands because its performance has become increasingly tied to broader financial conditions. The Trump administration’s pro-crypto direction has improved sentiment—Paul Atkins at the SEC, Michael Selig at the CFTC, the GENIUS Act signed in July—but execution risk remains high. Legislation like the Clarity Act could pass the Senate in Q1 2026 or stall for months in committee debates. Trade policy, fiscal spending, and election dynamics—midterms hit in November 2026—could shift liquidity faster than markets can price in. When policy timelines are uncertain and political outcomes unclear, forecasting asset prices 12 months out becomes guesswork. Bitcoin’s correlation with equities climbed sharply over 2024-2025. Bitcoin now often moves in sync with the Nasdaq and S&P 500, tying performance to broad risk appetite rather than the original “digital gold” scarcity narrative. When stocks fall on recession fears, Bitcoin typically falls harder, and when stocks rally on Fed dovishness, Bitcoin follows—a strong jobs report can send Bitcoin up 5% in a day, while a weak GDP print can drop it by 8% as investors flee to bonds and cash. Mer_Studio / Shutterstock.com Galaxy’s long-term case separates short-term noise from structural change. While 2026 remains too chaotic to forecast, durable adoption trends still support a $250,000 scenario by the end of 2027. Spot Bitcoin ETFs created a standing institutional bid that didn’t exist in prior cycles. BlackRock’s IBIT alone gathered over $71 billion, proving regulated access unlocked deep pools of capital. Even during weeks with $497 million in outflows, the infrastructure stayed open. Vanguard’s expansion of ETF access to its 50 million clients in December 2025 reinforces these are permanent channels. Corporate adoption has moved beyond experimental allocations. Strategy’s holdings of over 670,000 BTC—worth roughly $59 billion at $88,000—reshaped how public company balance sheets treat Bitcoin. More than 160 public companies now follow similar frameworks. With projected corporate holdings potentially nearing one million BTC by late 2026, supply dynamics tighten. FASB’s fair-value accounting shift in late 2024 removed a key barrier—companies can now mark Bitcoin to market value each quarter. Pension exposure remains small—most allocations are 0.5-2% of portfolio value—but direction matters more than magnitude. Wisconsin, Michigan, and UK pension allocations signal acceptance within conservative mandates. Even 1% positions matter when portfolios are measured in trillions. A 1% allocation from a $500 billion pension fund is $5 billion—more than most retail waves. These decisions take years to reverse once governance boards approve them. Galaxy frames $250,000 as conditional, not guaranteed. Bitcoin’s role alongside gold as a hedge against currency debasement—protection against deficit spending and money printing—strengthens the case. If rates trend toward 3% by 2027 and institutions keep accumulating through ETFs and treasuries, supply-demand math shifts quickly. With 19.8 million Bitcoin in circulation and potentially 2-3 million locked in long-term institutional custody (ETFs, corporate treasuries, lost coins), the available supply for sale shrinks. That asymmetry—growing demand meeting shrinking supply—creates upside potential that compounds over time. Galaxy’s framework is straightforward: 2026 is a coin flip between conflicting forces, but 2027’s direction is clearer. Whether Bitcoin reaches $130,000 or retests $70,000 in 2026 depends entirely on variables no one controls—Fed rate decisions responding to inflation data that hasn’t printed yet, Clarity Act timing in a Senate facing midterm pressures, and whether recession fears materialize or fade. But here’s what doesn’t change regardless of 2026’s path: BlackRock’s $71 billion IBIT isn’t disappearing. Strategy’s 670,000 BTC isn’t getting sold. Pension boards in Wisconsin and Michigan that approved allocations aren’t reversing decisions. These structural shifts create a floor that wasn’t there in previous cycles. That’s why Galaxy maintains $250K by 2027 despite calling 2026 too chaotic to forecast. When demand keeps growing from permanent institutional infrastructure while available supply keeps shrinking, the direction becomes clear even if the timing stays messy. Galaxy’s betting that 18 months is enough time for macro conditions to resolve while structural forces compound. The 2026 range might be wide, but the 2027 trajectory is narrowing.

Title: Something Big Is Coming — Investor Hints At XRP ETF Breakthrough This Week

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Investor Paul Barron’s hint at “big news” has reignited attention on XRP exchange-traded funds this week, sending the community into speculation over possible upcoming announcements or launches. Traders and holders reacted fast on social channels, pushing chatter and price focus higher even as specifics remain unclear. According to data shared by Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominated year-to-date inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF led with $25 billion in inflows. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF followed at $1.11 billion. Fidelity and VanEck posted $477 million and $305 million respectively. On the Ethereum side, BlackRock’s offerings recorded about $9.12 billion. A Solana staking ETF from Bitwise pulled in $839 million. These numbers show where most large investors are putting money right now. Expect some big news this week $XRP ETFs https://t.co/3BY5XJosPx — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) December 29, 2025 Barron’s remark has been read by many as a hint at another XRP-related announcement. Some expect a new ETF launch; others are watching for updates from issuers already in the market. That talk has helped push attention — and inflows — to XRP products that only debuted late in the year. Based on reports from rwa.xyz, on-chain data indicates tokenized real-world assets on the XRP Ledger rose by 2,200% in 2025. The network saw about 23x growth in the value of native real-world assets, including stablecoins, and crossed the $500 million threshold. Themes around RWA tokenization were widely discussed this year by figures such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and former SEC Chair Paul Atkins, and the XRPL appears to be drawing benefit from that interest. Canary’s XRP ETF (XRPC) registered $384 million in year-to-date inflows after launching in November. Other XRP spot funds have built sizable holdings too: 21Shares holds about $250 million, Bitwise roughly $227 million, Grayscale around $244 million, and Franklin about $206 million. Based on reports, all of these XRP spot ETFs launched in November and December and now tally roughly $1.24 billion in total assets under management with cumulative inflows near $1.14 billion. For a new category, that level of money moving in over a short span is notable; some industry voices point out the total might have been higher if market mood had not cooled recently. Reports also say XRP ETFs pulled in over $1 billion through 21 days of steady inflows. WisdomTree’s XRP ETF is among the pending offerings that market watchers expect to arrive next. At the same time, talk about a BlackRock XRP ETF has circulated widely. There is currently no public filing tied to a BlackRock XRP product, and reports caution that such expectations are premature without official filings or approvals. Current flows note that XRP’s ETF debut has shifted part of investor focus from pure crypto bets to spot ETF allocations and tokenization themes. Whether Barron’s hinted “big news” becomes a concrete catalyst will depend on filings and formal product launches. For now, the mix of solid early inflows and rapid XRPL tokenization growth has put XRP squarely in the conversation among ETF-focused investors and network adopters.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

The stock market has treated US investors well this year, with the benchmark S&P 500 up about 17%. But the Financial Times reports something of a surprise: World markets have done significantly better. The MSCI ex-US index, which excludes American companies from its basket of international stocks, is up 29%—the biggest performance gap since 2009. A number of factors appear to be at play, including sky-high US tech valuations, related fears of an AI bubble, and concerns over President Trump's tariff wars, explains Axios. "US equities are more expensive than lots of other equities, the growth trajectory is likely to be challenged, and everyone's got lots of them," Matthew Beesley of Jupiter Asset Management explains. His current diversification mantra on stocks is "anything but America." Investors have instead piled into long-neglected markets in China, Japan, Europe, and emerging economies, helped by a weaker dollar. China's main index has climbed 29% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng almost 28%. South Korea's Kospi has jumped more than 75%, driven by sharp rallies in tech firms Samsung and SK Hynix. Another factor is a fear that the Chinese start-up AI DeepSeek—which unveiled a large language model seen as a credible, cheaper rival to leading US AI systems—will challenge American dominance in the field. "The reason we lost that exuberance [about US stocks] was really … 'DeepSeek day,'" says Helen Jewell of BlackRock, referring to the day of the product's launch. "You had that sudden realization that 'too overweight the US' was not the way to build a portfolio."

Title: Standard Chartered Models XRP at $8 by 2026—Breaking Down the 315% Upside Case

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com Standard Chartered’s crypto research team, led by Geoffrey Kendrick, recently predicted XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) could hit $8 by 2026—implying a substantial 325% increase from its current $1.88 price. This high-profile Standard Chartered XRP prediction is anchored on easing regulatory uncertainty and the launch of new spot XRP ETFs, which they argue will unleash pent-up demand. Skeptics note that XRP has underperformed despite this positive forecast. The token is trading around $1.88 today, down about 13% year-to-date, even after the SEC withdrew its appeal in Ripple’s lawsuit and multiple XRP ETFs crossed $1 billion in inflows. While institutional endorsement is noteworthy, reaching XRP $8 2026 will require near-perfect execution across multiple bullish factors. Travis Wolfe / Shutterstock.com Standard Chartered’s model specifically targets XRP at $8 by late 2026. Below are the catalysts behind the Geoffrey Kendrick XRP forecast. The cornerstone of the Standard Chartered XRP prediction is institutional ETF demand. In 2025, U.S. regulators approved several spot XRP ETFs from firms such as Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, Grayscale, and Canary. These products reduce the friction of buying XRP—pension funds and asset managers can now allocate through regulated wrappers. Standard Chartered predicts spot ETF launches would attract $4-8 billion into XRP throughout 2026. If such inflows materialize, the additional demand against XRP’s relatively fixed supply could drive prices sharply higher. Kendrick laid out a roadmap: $5.50 in 2025, then $8.00 in 2026, eventually reaching $12.50 by 2028. For comparison, XRP’s current circulating supply is about 57 billion coins. Even a few billion dollars of new buying would be a meaningful supply shock. If $5-10 billion flows into XRP ETFs over 12 months—similar to early Bitcoin ETF momentum—that sustained demand could push prices toward the $8 target. Another key assumption is that regulatory clouds will clear globally. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs dominated XRP’s narrative for years. In August 2025, the SEC withdrew its appeal, leaving Ripple to pay a $125 million settlement with the court affirming that XRP sales on secondary markets are not securities transactions. That resolution removes a major legal overhang. Standard Chartered cites this clarity as a catalyst for adoption. When legal uncertainty disappears, capital that was sitting on the sidelines can finally allocate. The XRP Ledger’s real-world use is also rising. Over 300 banks and financial institutions across 45+ countries now partner with RippleNet. Some partners already use XRP for liquidity through ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) corridors. Ripple has launched the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin on XRPL. In just one year, RLUSD’s market cap climbed to about $1.3 billion, making it one of the top U.S.-regulated stablecoins. If XRPL processes $10-20 billion in cross-border payments annually by 2026, the demand for XRP as a bridge currency could multiply. XRP has a capped supply of 100 billion maximum with about 57 billion circulating. Standard Chartered points out that, unlike Bitcoin where new coins are mined daily, new XRP issuance from mining is zero—the supply is fixed. When more tokens move into ETF custody and long-term holders lock up supply, the available tokens for sale on exchanges shrink dramatically. leksiv / Shutterstock.com Skeptics have given several reasons why the XRP $8 prediction might be too aggressive. In 2025, XRP’s price action doesn’t fit the rosy picture. In late December, XRP is about 13% down year-to-date at $1.88, even after the SEC cleared Ripple and XRP ETFs launched. After some XRP ETF approvals in November 2025, the token actually dipped—XRP fell 4% on the day of one ETF launch, a classic example of how it underperforms despite good news. XRP has decades of banking partnerships that have failed to reliably push its price up. Even Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s claim that Ripple could capture 14% of SWIFT’s market share has never translated into meaningful price appreciation. Banks use RippleNet’s messaging without holding XRP tokens, meaning adoption doesn’t automatically equal token demand. XRP’s role as a bridge currency faces stiff competition. Ethereum Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, Solana with sub-second settlement, and Stellar’s similar payment focus are also advancing. Banks exploring blockchain payments have options beyond XRP. A concrete math check is sobering. An $8-per-XRP price would imply a market capitalization of about $456 billion (57 billion tokens × $8). Today, XRP’s market cap is only about $107 billion at $1.88. So hitting XRP $8 2026 means roughly quadrupling the market cap—adding approximately $349 billion in value. By comparison, $456 billion would make XRP larger than almost every crypto except Bitcoin. For context, Ethereum currently sits around $356 billion. Achieving $456 billion would require massive capital inflows, far beyond the roughly $1.25 billion the XRP ETF complex has raised so far. Finally, broader conditions could spoil the run-up. Any global recession, stock market crash, or crypto winter would make speculative gains unlikely. During the 2022 crypto winter, Bitcoin fell 75% despite improving fundamentals, showing macro conditions matter more than narratives when capital is fleeing risk. Uuganbayar / Shutterstock.com To turn the Standard Chartered XRP prediction into reality, a perfect storm of factors must align. To turbocharge flows, a heavyweight like BlackRock needs to launch an XRP ETF. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracted over $40 billion within a year. A BlackRock-backed XRP fund could legitimize XRP in a way smaller issuers can’t. When the world’s largest asset manager—managing over $10 trillion—endorses an asset, it would spark investors’ confidence, and could help XRP to reach $8 quickly. RLUSD could become a major on-ramp for institutions. RLUSD’s market cap has grown swiftly to $1.3 billion, but it remains small relative to competitors like USDC ($40+ billion). For the XRP $8 prediction to become reality, RLUSD needs to become a mainstream payment hub—perhaps reaching $10-20 billion in market cap. RippleNet needs to win real traffic. Garlinghouse’s claim of targeting 14% of SWIFT’s market share would imply over $20 trillion in annual payment flows. If Ripple can capture even 5-10% of global bank transfers using XRPL liquidity, that could create hefty XRP demand. In practice, this means many more financial institutions actively using XRP for cross-currency flows—not merely experimenting with RippleNet messaging. Concrete announcements like “Bank X now processes $500 million monthly through ODL using XRP” would validate the thesis. The Geoffrey Kendrick XRP scenario requires continued significant inflows. Kendrick’s model implied $4–8 billion in year one, but that would need to sustain or grow. So far, XRP ETFs accumulated about $1.25 billion. To reach $8, imagine annual ETF flows hit the $5–10 billion range—similar to the early Bitcoin ETF frenzy. Finally, markets must remain bullish or at least stable. To achieve XRP $8 2026, we’d likely need low interest rates, risk-on investor sentiment, and a stable global economy. If macro headwinds intensify, funds will avoid altcoins.

Title: In 2025, bitcoin showed how spectacularly wrong price forecasts can be

2025 is drawing to an end with few crypto market stories more dramatic than the Oct. 10 “flash crash," when bitcoin BTC$89,493.41 plunged $12,000, or nearly 10%, in minutes. The meltdown triggered more than $19 billion in liquidations in just 24 hours, followed by a trader-circulated “cascade warning” and a staggering $500 billion wiped from total crypto market capitalization. That set the scene for an extended slide that's seen the largest cryptocurrency drop to more than 30% below the peak $126,223 value it set just six days earlier. This painful drop is likely to leave it posting the first full-year loss since the crypto winter of 2022. The year began on a more optimistic note, with bitcoin price predictions ranging from dream-like fantasies to more conservative targets that, at times, seemed within reach. Then it all changed after the Oct. 10 crash. Many predictions, from seasoned analysts to outspoken evangelists, shared one thing in common: They didn’t age well. Let's leave aside the long-term forecasts that soared as high as $1 billion by 2038 from Jurrien Timmer, Fidelity's global head of macro, or the undated $700,000 if institutional adoption reached scale from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Even the more restrained estimates now seem somewhat overblown. Some forecasts weren’t just bullish; they were explosive. Samson Mow, CEO of bitcoin technology company Jan3, predicted in February that bitcoin would reach $1 million by the end of 2025 in a “violent” upward move fueled by the collapse of fiat currencies. He received support from Blockstream CEO and founder Adam Back, arguably one of the most respected personalities in bitcoin, who, in April, also reportedly said he believed BTC could reach $500,000 to $1 million by end-2025. His bullish thesis was driven by ETF inflows, institutional buying and limited supply. He wasn't the only one. Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya also forecast $500,000 by October. Even some of the more conservative estimates for the year-end price target surpassed the all-time high. Among them were JPMorgan analysts, who in early October, before the crash, raised their year-end forecast to $165,000, basing it on a growing embrace of the "debasement trade," a rise in investor demand for alternative stores of value. Even after the crash, Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR), helped keep bulls' hopes alive with his Oct. 28 “expectation” that BTC would be “about $150,000 by the end of this year”. Strategy, the holder of the most bitcoin among publicly traded companies, bought another $1 billion of BTC on Dec. 15, increasing its total holdings to 671,268. Of course, they weren’t alone. Throughout 2025, a flood of price predictions poured in from across the crypto landscape, most of which serve only as reminders of just how hard forecasting can be. There was the forecast for a first-quarter peak of $180,000 from VanEck’s digital asset research team, more than $50,000 above the actual high. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan had said BTC would reach $200,000 in 2025, backed by what he called “the most bullish setup in years.” Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors repeated his $200,000–$250,000 forecast well into October. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, said he was “sticking with” a similar range as late as November. Only a handful adjusted their expectations downward in time. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, once a $500,000 prophet, was one of the few to publicly dial it back, saying in October that BTC would likely end the year between $120,000 and $125,000. Standard Chartered followed suit in December, slashing its target to $100,000 from $200,000. In the end, 2025 reminded the market of an old truth: Bitcoin humbles everyone. It shrugs off models, breaks charts, and ignores even the boldest calls. Some missed by inches. Others missed by miles. But nearly all missed. As the dust settles, the industry is once again left with charts to redraw, narratives to rewrite, and a single, undeniable takeaway: in crypto, predictions are easy to make. Being right is rare.

Title: AI boom to supercharge European banks' rally
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1230/1550903-ai-boom-to-supercharge-european-banks-rally/
Time Published: 2025-12-30T11:05:38Z

After a stellar 2025, investors expect shares in European banks to keep heading higher in 2026, supported by strong earnings and, crucially, cost savings stemming from artificial intelligence. As fears of a recession and interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank have subsided, investors have turned even more positive towards European banks, revising up their expectations for the sector, despite a complicated backdrop. Meanwhile, AI has emerged as a new force drawing investors to European lenders' shares, partly because a dearth of technology companies in the region has forced many to hunt for AI beneficiaries in old-economy markets. Banks have started to use AI to improve operational efficiency and fraud detection, as well as to reduce staff costs. "European banks could be a real beneficiary of AI," said Helen Jewell, chief investment officer for fundamental equities at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, with about $12 trillion under management. "A lot of the AI story has been focused on the revenue winners, but we also know that when it comes to AI, there is a beneficiary from the cost winners," she said at a press event. UBS said in a note to investors they see AI as a key source of potential upside to banks' near-term valuations and longer- term earnings. But that comes with risks. Warnings over AI-related exuberance and the risks of a dot-com style bust have come from various sides, including the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England. And risks are not only AI-related. The ECB said euro zone banks face "unprecedentedly high" risk of shocks including geopolitical tensions, shifting trade policies, climate-related crises and even a dollar squeeze for banks exposed to the volatile US currency. Yet investors have snapped up bank stocks in earnest. Societe Generale shares have rallied 140% this year, Commerzbank 125% and those in Barclays rose almost 70%. An index of European bank stocks is up more than 60%, on top of the 25% gain in 2024 and more than four times better than the pan European index. Investors also view them as relatively cheap, particularly when compared with US banking shares. European bank stocks currently trade around 1.17 times their price-to-book value, some 40% below their 2007 peak and below the 1.7 times of their US rivals, according to LSEG data. In terms of costs, Goldman Sachs said in a note that costs would grow at a compound annual rate of only 1% between 2025 and 2027. The US bank also sees efficiency continuing well into 2026, with banks' cost/income ratios improving by 130 basis points year on year, meaning companies are expected to spend less to generate income. Consulting firm McKinsey estimated last year that AI could bring the global banking industry as much as $340 billion a year in additional value, with a drop in operational costs of 20%. Even if AI implementation savings take years to fully emerge, it will be a big enough shift to drive greater expansion in valuations, UBS said. Last month, analysts raised their net revisions for the sector by the most since May 2023, and 12-month forward earnings growth expectations jumped to the highest since 2023, according to IBES data. Growth in bank lending to euro zone firms is still running near its highest since mid-2023, according to the most recent ECB data. Credit growth to businesses was unchanged at 2.9% in October - just below August's 3%, the most since May 2023 - compared to the previous month, while loan growth to households accelerated to a two and a half year high of 2.8% from 2.6%. BlackRock's Jewell expects European banks to return 20-25% of market value to shareholders over the next three years via dividends and share buybacks. "If you put together valuation and the shareholder remuneration, you still have an asset class that is quite attractive," Equita co-head of research Domenico Ghilotti said, adding that merger activity is another driver underpinning the sector. The takeover of Mediobanca by state-backed Monte dei Paschi di Siena was one of the biggest in the sector this year, transforming Italian banking. Other deals could be on the way. "What we are seeing is economic resilience within Europe, and that means that even if we do see more rate cuts, that economic resilience will be good for European banks," BlackRock's Jewell said.

Title: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Today? BlackRock’s BTC Moves Shakes Market

BlackRock has transferred a significant amount of BTC to the crypto exchange Coinbase, sparking concerns about a sell-off. This comes as the Bitcoin price continues to struggle to break above $90,000 successfully. Arkham data shows that Blackrock deposited 2,201 BTC ($192.13 million) into Coinbase, putting the Bitcoin price at risk of further decline amid increasing selling pressure. The move followed the outflow recorded by BlackRock’s BTC ETF on December 26, with Bitcoin funds as a group seeing a net outflow of $275.88 million. These Bitcoin ETFs are currently on a seven-day outflow streak, which also prompted BlackRock to deposit 6,174.39 BTC last week, likely to offload these coins and redeem shares of its BTC fund. The Bitcoin price has struggled to break above $90,000 amid these outflows from the BTC funds. Notably, the Bitcoin price had broken above $90,000 on December 28 but quickly lost those gains yesterday as BlackRock moved the coins to Coinbase. Crypto pundit Martini claimed that BlackRock wasn’t the only one putting significant selling pressure on the flagship crypto. He alleged that Binance, Wintermute, Coinbase, and Fidelity also sold a significant amount of BTC, collectively dumping $3.5 billion yesterday. Crypto pundit Bull Theory claimed that there was a weekend manipulation as the Bitcoin price pumped $3,000 and broke $90,000, liquidating $103 million worth of shorts this Sunday. He then noted that on Monday morning, BTC dumped $2,700 and liquidated $40 million worth of longs, erasing its entire pump in the process. With the current price action, BTC is heading for a red yearly close, as it is currently down over 6% year-to-date (YTD). In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that most of the data continues to become more favorable for the Bitcoin price, putting in a bottom against the equity markets and gold in the coming weeks. He added that the data also points to the flagship crypto outperforming these assets. The analyst stated that this was based on just factual data and not emotions. The Bitcoin price had notably outperformed these major assets at the start of the year but has since fallen behind, following the October 10 crypto crash. Gold is up 66% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 17% since the start of the year. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows also predicted that BTC could soon rally, noting that the long-term holders have stopped selling for the first time since July 2025. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,300, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
