Title: 1 in 3 young investors switched advisers over crypto access: Survey

Time Published: 2025-11-20T05:30:20Z

Young and rich investors want wealth advisers to offer crypto, and some have moved their money from those who don’t, according to a survey by Zerohash. Money managers may need to rethink their approach to digital assets, with over a third of young, wealthy investors in a recent US survey indicating they had moved on from advisers who don’t offer crypto exposure. Crypto payments provider Zerohash’s survey of 500 US investors aged 18 to 40, released on Wednesday, found that 35% had moved money away from advisers who didn’t offer access to crypto. Those surveyed had incomes between $100,000 and $1 million, and more than half of those who moved money due to an advisers lack of crypto offerings said they had moved between $250,000 and $1 million. Crypto has only recently enjoyed an ultra-friendly policy environment in the US, and some wealth advisers are still playing catch-up as younger investors are less risk-averse compared to past generations. Zerohash said that over four-fifths of those surveyed said their confidence in crypto was boosted due to its adoption by major finance institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Morgan Stanley. Zerohash found that respondents with incomes of $500,000 and up were “leading the exodus,” with half having moved from advisers over crypto access. The survey also found 84% of all respondents planned to increase their crypto holdings in the next year, with nearly half saying they would “increase their allocations significantly.” Zerohash said the findings show that crypto “has become essential to modern portfolio strategy” and many wealthy investors “are not waiting for their private wealth managers to catch up.” “Advisers who adapt early can strengthen client loyalty and capture new growth, while those who delay risk falling behind,” they said. Related: US government reopening may unleash crypto ETF floodgates: Analyst They added that investors were clear with their expectations and wanted “insured, compliant crypto access.” Zerohash said based on its survey results, its playbook for advisers to win investors is to offer crypto on “the same dashboard as traditional assets” with insured custody. “Investors expect more than Bitcoin and Ethereum,” it added. “Ninety-two percent say access to a broader range of digital assets is important.” Meanwhile, asset managers have begun offering exchange-traded products with exposure to a wide range of cryptocurrencies, with products tied to altcoins including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE). More novel products have featured staking, which rewards users for locking up tokens to secure a blockchain. Major issuer BlackRock is also seemingly set to offer staking exposure, filing for a staked Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund in Delaware on Wednesday.

Title: Abu Dhabi Investment Council triples stake in Bitcoin ETF in Q3: Report

Time Published: 2025-11-20T01:50:12Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF share price is down almost 23% since the end of the third quarter. The Abu Dhabi Investment Council nearly tripled its exposure to Bitcoin during the third quarter through BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin fund, according to a recent report. Several market participants saw it as a signal that institutional interest in crypto is still gaining momentum in the United Arab Emirates. ADIC, an investment arm of Mubala Investment Company, told Bloomberg on Wednesday it sees Bitcoin (BTC) as the digital equivalent of gold. ADIC’s IBIT increase came during a volatile period for Bitcoin. The quarter ended just days before BTC surged to an all-time high of $125,100 on Oct. 5, before dropping back below $90,000 on Wednesday. Bloomberg reported that ADIC increased its IBIT holdings from 2.4 million shares at the start of Q3 to almost 8 million by Sept. 30, valuing the position at around $520 million. IBIT closed the quarter at $65 per share and rose to $71 on Oct. 6, the day after Bitcoin hit its all-time high. However, Bitcoin’s recent plunge below $100,000 has also dragged IBIT lower. The ETF closed Wednesday at $50.71, down around 23% since the end of the third quarter. Despite the Bitcoin price decline, the ADIC stock increase was widely read as a sign of broader institutional adoption. Crypto investment platform M2 treasury manager, Zayed Aleem, said in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that it is “fantastic to see such institutional conviction and another strong signal that the UAE is securing its place as a global hub for digital assets.” Echoing a similar sentiment, crypto commentator MartyParty said that “the position reflects a strategic bet on BTC’s role as a store of value.” The news comes just one day after IBIT experienced its most significant daily outflows since its January 2024 launch, totaling $523.2 million, according to Farside, amid Bitcoin briefly falling to $88,000. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $92,089, according to CoinMarketCap. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on Wednesday that the IBIT ETF was having an “ugly stretch.” Related: Crypto exchange Kraken submits confidential US IPO filing “Although YTD flows are still at an astronomical +$25b (6th overall). All told $3.3b in total outflows past month from BTC ETFs, which is 3.5% of AUM,” Balchunas said. Since the IBIT launched in January 2024, it has posted around $63.12 million in net inflows, according to Farside. Analysts are divided on where Bitcoin will go for the remainder of the year. Bitcoin analyst VICTOR recently said that the current drawdown is “the close your eyes and bid type of range.” Magazine: Ethereum’s Fusaka fork explained for dummies: What the hell is PeerDAS?

Delaware Division of Corporations records show that the trust was formed on November 19. The listing does not include product documentation, but the public entity record can be viewed directly through the state’s search portal. Forming a Delaware statutory trust is a common early step for ETF issuers, particularly for commodity and crypto products. The next stage typically involves filing a registration statement with the SEC, which can be an S-1 or another form depending on the fund structure. The preparatory move, however, does not indicate that a filing is imminent. Decrypt has reached out to BlackRock and its registered agent for further information. The registration comes as Ethereum staking ETFs have begun trading in the U.S., including the REX Osprey ETH + Staking ETF, which launched the first combined spot and staking-enabled Ethereum ETF in late September. Grayscale, meanwhile, became the first U.S. issuer to add staking to an exchange-listed Ethereum product in October, following the SEC’s approval of generic crypto ETP listing standards, which enabled the firm to incorporate native staking into its Ethereum ETFs. The move gave the market its earliest regulated benchmark for how staking yield could be passed through to shareholders. Still, dedicated staking-focused Ethereum ETFs remain small. The REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF, for example, reported about $2.4 million in assets as of mid-November, with trading activity remaining light since its launch. Earlier in July, BlackRock filed a rules-change request to allow additional staking functionality in its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). New language in the proposed changes stated the trust would “receive all or a portion of the staking rewards” generated by the staking provider, adding that such rewards may be “treated as income to the Trust.” In Ethereum, staking means locking up Ethereum while staked so the network can choose users to validate transactions, in return for earned rewards. It also affects the circulating supply, as staked Ethereum is not freely tradeable until it is withdrawn. Staking remains a point of regulatory caution because it involves active participation in network validation and introduces operational, slashing, and custody risks that differ from simple asset holding. Issuers seeking to stake inside a registered product have had to detail validator selection, liquidity management, custody segregation, and how rewards will be accounted for under securities rules.

Title: BlackRock signals it is working on a new staked Ethereum trust ETF
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-registers-trust-staked-eth-etf
Time Published: 2025-11-20T01:05:50Z
Full Content:
BlackRock is now pursuing a new staked Ethereum ETF, offering more lucrative returns, approximately 15 months after launching its flagship ETH fund, ETHA. BlackRock has registered for a new staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund in Delaware, signalling that the $13.5 trillion asset manager is now ready to expand beyond its flagship Ethereum ETF product. A Delaware name registration is one of the first steps that a fund issuer needs to take to file for a new ETF. BlackRock, however, still needs to file other relevant documents to put the proposed product on track for regulatory approval. It would also complement BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which has attracted $13.1 billion worth of inflows since launching in July 2024. BlackRock did not add staking to its spot Ethereum product, stating on its website: However, in July, they proposed a rule change with the SEC to incorporate staking into ETHA, along with other issuers. The US Securities and Exchange Commission under the Trump administration has been more open to new crypto exchange-traded products, and recently introduced a generic listing standard enabling faster approvals, as each application no longer needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that BlackRock’s staked ETH ETF product is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which requires strong transparency and investor protection measures, as well as full disclosure before shares can be publicly sold. There are currently around 70 crypto products awaiting regulatory approval, which were held up by the US government shutdown across October and November. Related: Stablecoins strengthen the dollar and empower the developing world BlackRock’s filing comes as REX-Osprey and Grayscale launched staked ETH ETF products in September and October. Incorporating staking into an Ethereum ETF could enhance returns by adding a steady yield component on top of price exposure, thereby transforming the fund into a total-return product. It could therefore broaden the product’s appeal to yield-focused investors who may have avoided Ethereum ETF products due to their lack of income. The average annual return on ETH staking is approximately 3.95%, according to Blocknative data. While other issuers have filed for a multitude of altcoin-focused ETFs in recent months, BlackRock appears to be abstaining, having only recently filed a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF in September as a sequel to its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. The Bitcoin Premium Income ETF also aims to generate yield by selling covered call options and collecting premiums. Magazine: Ethereum’s Fusaka fork explained for dummies: What the hell is PeerDAS?

Title: Letters to the Editor, November 20th: On Paschal Donohoe, the President’s new clothes and nefarious neologisms

Time Published: 2025-11-20T01:00:00Z
Full Content:
Sir, – It is often only in hindsight that we realise how good we had it. Paschal Donohoe was a safe pair of hands in the finance brief, and I predict we will realise that soon. As my late mother would regularly say with a big smile on her face any time he came on TV, “Paschal is just great, isn’t he.” And she was right. He worked harder than any of the rest of us back in our Trinity College Dublin days and he has worked hard since too. Apart from that, he is a good guy. Wishing him continued success. Thank you for your service. – Yours, etc, ANNE MCCORMACK, Rush, Co Dublin. Sir, – I’m surprised that you didn’t publish any more positive letters about Paschal Donohoe (“Resignation of Paschal Donohoe,” Letters, November 19th). Are all your readers supporters of the Opposition and blind to what the rest of Europe and the world value. I think I may be reading the wrong paper. – Yours, etc, OWEN McKEON, Skerries, Co Dublin. Sir, – During the early days of Covid-19, I could not grasp the potential or clandestine medical issues involved, nor could I grasp the medium- to long-term consequences the epidemic might have on human society. I could, however, anticipate that the State’s financial and economic structures and status could well come under severe stress. I was thankful that Paschal Donohoe was our minister for finance. – Yours, etc, MICHAEL GANNON, St Thomas Sq, Kilkenny. Sir, – It can hardly come as a surprise that one of the most senior members of our Government has decided to jump ship (“Donohoe in line for hefty remuneration package at World Bank,” Irish Times, November 18th). The feeling is that many of the doyens now walking the corridors of power are just hanging around until the right job comes along. Self-interest is as good an explanation as any for their long-running failures to address serious social issues. Similarly there can be no surprise that Paschal Donohoe would opt to join an institution such as the World Bank. He will have little difficulty fitting in. The World Bank has been criticised for allowing its policy to be dictated by a select group of multilateral agencies. Indeed, it can be concluded that the bank’s “Harmony and Coherence” policy is little more than a vehicle to allow the most powerful pass off their own self-interest as the common good. Sound familiar? Think of the numerous “plans” to “solve” the housing crisis here. – Yours, etc, JIM O’SULLIVAN, Rathedmond, Co Sligo. Sir, – Paschal Donohoe was a very conservative minister who preserved the status quo for the old monied cabal with a minimal social conscience. His parting legacy will be of a minister for finance who will be remembered for doing nothing for older people, workers, or vulnerable cohorts such as children and the disabled in his final budget, yet who caved into lobbying from the hospitality sector for their commercial demands on the pretext of preserving jobs. Mr Donohoe may have been an effectively prudent fiscal management accountant. This trait will probably suit the World Bank, whose primary objective is to preserve the traditional status quo of the first world nations and ruling established liberal democracies. The former minister was totally risk averse when it came to stimulating creativity, didn’t show an ability to think “outside the box”, and seemed to lack the “vision thing”. He was, therefore, not the statesman needed by us in these unprecedented and challenging times, both nationally and internationally. By all accounts, a very nice man, though. – Yours, etc, STEVE PETHERBRIDGE, Swords, Co Dublin, Sir, – Sincere best wishes to Paschal Donohoe on his move to the World Bank. Hopefully he can help many poor countries escape from debt and develop into fair and successful economies that can trade on an equal footing with the rest of the world. Wishing him every success in this new and demanding role. – Yours, etc, PAUL CONNOLLY, Main St, Cavan. Sir, – Last Friday our national broadcaster RTÉ aired a radio item on its Drivetime show in which the current President’s appearance – her hair and clothes – were parsed and discussed in detail with a guest. I have emailed RTÉ with the following question: in the 14 years of Michael D Higgins’s presidency, did RTÉ ever air a similar news item about his clothes and hair? I’m still waiting for an answer. – Yours, etc, ROSEMARY LAFFERTY, Lucan, Co Dublin. Sir, – The recent correspondence on these pages regarding catering faux pas reminded me of the story told by the late playwright Hugh Leonard. On checking in after midnight to a midlands hotel, he asked: “Any chance of a nightcap?”. The porter replied: “Certainly sir, would you like a drink while you’re waiting?”. – Yours, etc, PETER McCARTHY, Salthill, Galway. Sir, – I admire The Irish Times’s journalistic integrity in reporting exactly what is said, but couldn’t you relax your standards just a little bit to avoid embarrassment to your subjects? I don’t doubt that it’s exactly what she uttered (“Joanne McNally: ‘I was like, I’ll absolutely fly to Ireland and play golf with Bill Murray’,” People, November 19th), but it takes only a minor fib to spare her blushes at being caught out using such a nefarious neologism as the quotative “like”. – Yours, etc, SEAN BOYLE, Warner Rd, London. Sir, – Michael McDowell hits the nail on the head as usual in his column (“Britain’s asylum shake-up creates an Irish problem,” Opinion. November 19th) on the possible fallout for Ireland from proposed changes to asylum procedures and processing in the UK. Speaking from his own experience as minister for justice, he is well aware Ireland has always had to track UK policy given the numbers that travel via (or from) the UK to claim international protection here. Quite apart from a marked increase in numbers claiming asylum in the State since 2022, it is often overlooked that there are in the region of 1,000,000 people illegally in the UK. It is obvious that as the UK cracks down on people living illegally there, Ireland will be an increasingly attractive location for many to claim asylum, especially if people are paid to voluntarily leave if and when their asylum claims fail. A final thought is that the former minister (the only one with a sense of humour I came across in my Civil Service career) is correct when calling out the likely judicial review onslaught if we implement the EU Migration Pact next year. There is next to zero possibility of the 90-day limit for interview and possible appeal to be met, with a consequent lawyers’ bonanza at taxpayers’ expense highly likely. – Yours, etc, MICHAEL FLYNN, Bayside, Dublin 13, Sir, – Dr Eoin Drea’s recent opinion piece (“The EU presidency will show how out of touch Ireland is”, Opinion, November 13th) doesn’t quite tell the full story of Ireland’s relationship with the European Union and our upcoming EU presidency next year. Having just returned from one of my routine trips to Brussels, I met politicians and officials from across different EU countries and institutions, and I can confirm that next year’s Irish presidency of the Council of the EU is highly anticipated. Ireland has a strong track record of delivering on its EU presidencies, with some notable achievements. It may be easy to forget them but in 2013, when emerging from the financial crash, Ireland steered the EU ably through its presidency and secured the Youth Guarantee at a time of massive youth unemployment. In 2004, we welcomed 10 new EU countries in what has been the largest ever EU enlargement. Dr Eoin Drea’s observations on security and defence certainly do have merit. However, Ireland is responding. Ireland continues to stand with Ukraine. We became home to over 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and have provided significant financial aid. Ireland has demonstrated strong moral leadership on the conflict in Palestine, which is desperately needed at this time. Our economic success is not rooted in “dubious facilitation”, but in political stability, an educated workforce and access to the EU single market. These factors make us the second largest net contributor per capita to the EU budget; not an insignificant contribution from a country supposedly “out of touch”. – Yours, etc, NOELLE O’CONNELL, European Movement Ireland, Dublin 2. Sir, – As suggestions are sought by Una Mullally regarding the future of Baggot St Hospital, I have one that might be consistent with Dublin’s architectural history, provide a valuable educational resource and solve a potential problem in healthcare all at a minimal cost. In her article she observes that the current dilapidated structure was designed by William George Murray, architect of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, whose father had designed the College of Surgeons building. There is a great deal to recommend that the Government restructure his Baggot St design as a modern College of Anaesthesiologists of Ireland (CAI). The CAI currently operates from a house on Merion Square. With considerable ingenuity, from there it endeavours to oversee the training of more than 250 doctors in specialist training. – Yours, etc, BRIAN O’BRIEN, Kinsale, Co Cork. Sir, – Like Colm O’Brien (Letters, November 19th) I too cannot understand why Oliver Callan’s programme has been moved to accommodate David McCullagh’s Today programme. Yesterday morning Paschal Donohoe’s departure from Government was headline news on Morning Ireland. It was followed by David McCullagh’s first item – an interview with Paschal Donohoe. We now have constant talking until Louise Duffy’s show at 3pm. Please bring Louise back at noon, we need some light relief – and a female presenter! – Yours, etc, PAMELA McDONALD, Blackrock Village, Cork. Sir, – I note that we have a new Minister for Education. Last Thursday I attended the only training day I will have for the new Leaving Certificate geography course I am to begin teaching next September. There are, as yet, no sample papers. There will be no marking scheme to guide us in teaching our students when those papers do finally appear. And individual questions may not have marks attached to them, à la the reformed Junior Certificate, just to confuse students even more. They will be forced to guess how many marks for each question and how long they should spend on it. In other words, I learned nothing of value on this day. It seems futile to ask a third minister in a little over a year to review all of this urgently before the catastrophe that this reform unquestionably is begins to unfold in front of us. Especially as the previous two ministers simply stuck their fingers in their ears and refused to listen to the ideas and opinions of those of us charged with implementing this reform. But I have no choice. Someone has to at least be able to say I told you so. Plus ca change, Minister. – Yours, etc, ALAN O’CONNOR, Donnycarney, Dublin 9. Sir, – There are many elements of possible defence against aggression and invasion which are nothing to do with killing or being prepared to kill other people (Letters, November 19th). These include scuttling (destruction) of facilities, which would be of use to an invader, and “nonviolent civilian defence” which is about preparing the population for resistance and non-cooperation with an invader – or internal oppression – including hidden disobedience. Publicising these would be a deterrence to invasion. Gene Sharp’s 198 varieties of nonviolent resistance give just a small taste of what is possible. It is clear from the interrogation of Nazi generals after the second World War that they knew exactly how to deal with violence but they were at a loss when it came to non-violent resistance. Obviously it was violence which won that war for the Allies but it illustrates the power of non-violence. The 2023, State-organised Consultative Forum on International Security Policy refused to look at non-offensive defence and non-violent civilian defence which was just a part of why that was a propaganda exercise. But the wider question is how to prevent war, including nuclear war which would be the end of civilisation as we know it, and throwing us back to far worse than the stone age if we survived at all. The Irish Government seems content to add fuel to the flickering flames in Europe. We are currently looking in the wrong direction. – Yours, etc, ROB FAIRMICHAEL, Ballynafeigh, Belfast. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trump urges Treasury Secretary Bessent to take Federal Reserve job

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER and JOSH BOAK WASHINGTON (AP) — For the second time in two days, President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would like to appoint Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to chair the Federal Reserve. Yet Bessent keeps saying he doesn’t want the job, Trump added, in comments to the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum. “We’re thinking about him for the Fed, but he wants no part of it, he likes being secretary of the Treasury,” Trump said. “I think we’ll leave him — so let’s cross your name off right, officially, right?” Trump has been sharply critical of the current Fed chair, Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May, for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. Trump’s pick as a replacement will almost certainly push for rapid interest rate cuts and likely institute wide-ranging changes in how the Fed operates. Bessent earlier this year published extensive criticisms of the Fed’s groundbreaking efforts to shore up financial markets and the economy after the 2008-2009 Great Recession and during the pandemic. Bessent is heading up the Trump administration’s search for a new Fed chair. Yet despite his protestations, he is also widely seen as a leading potential replacement for Powell. “He’s a top-tier candidate right now,” Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser to Trump in his first term, said. Trump “wants to shake things up, so I think he wants an outsider.” Two of the five candidates Bessent has named are current Fed officials: Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. The other three would fit the outsider criteria: Kevin Hassett, currently a top White House economic official; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who has been highly critical of the Fed; and Rick Rieder, a senior managing director at asset manager BlackRock. Late Tuesday, in an interview on Fox News with Bret Baier, Bessent said the administration is continuing to interview potential nominees for Fed chair. By mid-December, “the president will meet the final three candidates and hopefully have an answer before Christmas,” Bessent said. Associated Press Writer Fatima Hussein contributed to this report.

Title: BlackRock registers iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF in Delaware

Share this article BlackRock has registered a new statutory trust in Delaware under the name iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, according to records from the Delaware Division of Corporations. Delaware registrations have typically preceded formal ETF applications to the SEC in recent crypto developments. The registration comes after Nasdaq filed Form 19b-4 with the SEC to enable staking for BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), allowing the ETF to stake its Ether through approved providers and classify rewards as income. However, the SEC has recently removed the requirement for 19b-4 filings for crypto exchange-traded products. Under the new generic listing standards, exchanges can now list qualifying crypto-commodity ETPs without submitting a product-specific 19b-4 rule change each time. BlackRock joins 21Shares, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale, all seeking to add staking to their Ethereum ETFs. Before spot ETH ETFs were approved, firms removed stakes from their applications amid concerns staking services could be treated as unregistered securities. The REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF is the first US Ethereum staking ETF, which offers exposure to ETH while also distributing native staking rewards to investors.

(NYSE: BLK), today announced the estimated 2025 annual reinvested capital gains distributions for the iShares ETFs listed on the TSX or Cboe Canada. Please note that these are estimated capital gains amounts only, as of October 31, 2025. As these are estimated amounts, the final capital gains distributions may change by the Funds' December 15, 2025 or December 31, 2025, in the case of iShares Premium Money Market ETF (“CMR”), tax year-ends. These estimates are for the annual non-cash capital gains distributions, which are typically reinvested in additional units of the respective funds at the year-end, and do not include estimates of ongoing periodic (e.g., monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual) cash distribution amounts. The additional units will be immediately consolidated with the previously outstanding units such that the number of outstanding units following the distribution will equal the number of units outstanding prior to the distribution. We expect to announce the final annual reinvested distribution amounts, as well as the ongoing cash distribution amounts, as applicable, for 2025, on or about December 29, 2025. The record date for the 2025 annual distributions will be December 30, 2025, payable on January 5, 2026. The actual taxable amounts of reinvested and cash distributions for 2025, including the tax characteristics of the distributions, will be reported to brokers (through CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. or “CDS”) in early 2026. Details regarding the estimated distribution amounts are as follows: (1) Distribution per unit amounts are in U.S. dollars for IBIT.U, XAGG.U, XAW.U, XCBU.U, XDG.U, XDU.U, XEC.U, XEF.U, XFLI.U, XMC.U, XMU.U, XQQU.U, XSHU.U, XSTP.U, XTLT.U, XTOT.U, XUS.U, XUSC.U, and XUU.U.

Bitcoin is down to around $88,000, falling more than 20% over the last 30 days. The crypto market as a whole today fell to $3.04 trillion—down 4.82% in 24 hours—with 95% of all coins bleeding red. The Fear and Greed Index just hit 16, the lowest reading since April, firmly in extreme fear territory. To put this in perspective: Zcash is the only coin in the top 50 by market cap managing to stay green today, squeezing out a 4% gain. And the macro picture? It's not helping. Expectations for a December Federal Reserve rate cut are decreasing, Bitcoin ETFs just posted their fifth consecutive day of outflows (a record $523 million from BlackRock alone just yesterday), and traders seem to be looking for a hedge as the possibility of a crypto winter in 2026 gets more serious. Meanwhile, on Myriad—the prediction market built by Decrypt's parent company Dastan—traders are positioning for more carnage. A whopping 73.3% of the money on Myriad is betting Bitcoin dumps to $85K, as opposed to pumping to $115K. As for Ethereum, Myriad users place the odds at 62% that ETH, currently trading for around $2,800, slides to $2.5K over a rally to $4K. Are they right? Here's what the charts say. Bitcoin opened today at $92,911 and promptly fell off a cliff, sliding more than 4% to its current price of $88,605. That's a $4K slip in a single day that once again pushed BTC below the psychologically critical $90K level and marked a fresh seven-month low. The technical setup is starting to look ugly. Exponential Moving Averages, or EMAs, help traders identify trend direction by tracking the average price of an asset over the short, medium, and long term. When the short-term 50-day EMA falls below the long-term 200-day EMA, it typically means sellers are dominating the market structure. For Bitcoin, the 50-day EMA just crossed below the 200-day EMA, forming the dreaded "death cross" pattern that signals longer-term bearish momentum. Bitcoin is now trading well below both moving averages, which creates nasty overhead resistance that bulls need to reclaim before any meaningful recovery can begin. Here's where it gets worse: The Average Directional Index—which measures trend strength regardless of direction—is sitting at a robust 38.25. ADX readings above 25 indicate a strong trend is in place, and above 35 signals a very strong trend. This tells us the current downtrend isn't some weak, directionless chop; there's real momentum behind this selloff, as reflected in the “extreme fear” reading on the Crypto Fear and Green Index. Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index, or RSI, has cratered to 27.12, firmly in oversold territory below 30. RSI measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold based on recent price movements, and at 27, Bitcoin is stretched like a rubber band. This doesn't mean the selling stops immediately, but it does suggest we're approaching exhaustion levels where a violent bounce becomes more likely. That may mean prices soon testing the support (now resistance) level that has been in place since June, visible in the chart above in the dotted white line. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator, which shows the market phase of prices and helps identify when trends are about to shift, is flashing bearish impulse signals, confirming the compression is releasing downward. So are Myriad predictors right in setting that $85K target? The wisdom of the crowd might be onto something. The chart shows a Fibonacci support around $84,451, with stronger support near $71,486. If Bitcoin loses the $88K-$89K zone it's currently testing, there's not much stopping a move toward $85K and below. However, that oversold RSI suggests any drop to $85K would likely be a quick wick rather than a sustained breakdown. Capitulation moves tend to reverse violently once they flush out the last of the leveraged long positions—those futures contracts betting on the price of Bitcoin to go up using borrowed capital. The upside case to $115K would require Bitcoin to reclaim the death cross and break above the descending trendline around $100,492—a tall order that explains why only 26.7% of traders are betting on it. Key levels: Resistance: Support: And if Bitcoin is in bad shape, then Ethereum has it even worse. ETH today dumped 6.73% from an opening price of $3,121.7 to close at $2,911.8, with an intraday low of $2,895.8. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum's 50-day EMA is still trading above its 200-day EMA—a "golden cross" that's supposed to be bullish. So why is ETH getting destroyed? The golden cross tells you the longer-term trend structure is intact, but it doesn't protect you from brutal corrections within that trend. Ethereum is trading below both moving averages despite the golden cross, which means the bullish structure is being tested hard. Also, the setup is very likely to turn bearish soon: The two EMAs are just about to cross, so if ETH dips for a few days, you’ll have another death cross here too. And get this: Ethereum's ADX is even more extreme than Bitcoin's at 42.4. Traders would view this as a very strong trend, and right now that trend is firmly bearish. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator for ETH is likewise showing bearish impulse signals What might make this particularly painful for ETH holders is that Ethereum has stronger downward momentum (higher ADX) but is also barely above oversold territory with an RSI of 30.92—just kissing the 30 threshold. This creates a knife-edge situation where the strong downtrend could push RSI deeper into oversold before reversing. The ETH chart shows support around $2,796 and stronger support near $2,300. Myriad users are again strongly favoring the downside at the moment, with nearly 67% odds that Ethereum falls to $2.5K or below, which aligns with the technical analysis. Ethereum needs to hold the $2,700-$2,800 zone (shown in the Fibonacci levels) to keep the 200-day EMA intact. If that breaks, the next meaningful support is indeed around $2,300-$2,500—exactly where most Myriad users are looking. For the 33% betting on $4K? That would require ETH to reclaim the $3,100-$3,200 zone, hold it as support, and grind through multiple resistance levels. It’s possible if macro conditions improve, but the technicals right now don't support it. Keep praying, bulls. This is crypto after all. Crazier things have happened.

BlackRock Bitcoin ETF outflow today: BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF saw its largest single-day outflow of $523 million as Bitcoin plunged to a seven-month low. This significant withdrawal signals investor unease and a potential shift towards safer assets like gold, amid a broader market retreat and concerns over stretched valuations. Profit-taking and a 'crypto hangover' are also cited as contributing factors.

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recorded its largest single-day outflow of $523 million on Nov. 18, extending a five-day streak of redemptions totaling $1.425 billion as Bitcoin tests levels below $90,000. Investors pulled approximately $523 million from BlackRock‘s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) on Nov. 18, marking the fund’s largest outflow since its debut in January 2024, according to data from Farside Investors. This significant withdrawal comes amid a broader decline in Bitcoin BTC $85 758 24h volatility: 7.2% Market cap: $1.71 T Vol. 24h: $102.00 B prices, which recently reached a seven-month low. The ETF price rose slightly at the beginning of Nov. 19, but at the time of publication, it was down by more than 3%. IBIT price | Source: Yahoo! Finance The record outflow continued a trend of sustained withdrawals from Bitcoin ETFs, representing the fifth consecutive day of net redemptions. In total, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has shed $1.425 billion in capital over this period. November is shaping up to be the worst month for Bitcoin ETFs, with cumulative outflows surpassing previous monthly records. While BlackRock’s IBIT experienced record outflows, other Bitcoin ETFs, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and Franklin Templeton’s ETF (EZBC), recorded inflows of $139.6 million and $10.8 million, respectively, on Nov. 18. According to Reuters, this divergence suggests that some investors may be shifting to alternative Bitcoin investment vehicles even as broad risk aversion persists. Bitcoin’s price decline to less than $90,000, down approximately 30% from its October high above $126,000, has coincided with increased selling pressure in ETFs. On Nov. 19, the Bitcoin price is testing again levels below $90,000, with 24-hour trading volume 42% lower. At $89,620 per BTC, it represents another 4.30% dip in a day. Bitcoin price | Source: TradingView Analysts note that the average purchase price for spot Bitcoin ETF buyers is around $90,146, suggesting many investors are either breaking even or incurring losses at current levels, possibly prompting redemptions. Despite this week’s heavy withdrawals, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust remains the leading Bitcoin ETF by assets under management, with $87.63 billion as of Nov. 19. The fund had seen strong inflows in the months before this sell-off, accumulating nearly $25 billion from March through October 2025.

Institutional clients dumped Bitcoin exposure through IBIT as BTC failed to reclaim $100K, triggering the largest net negative flow in the fund’s history. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF just suffered its worst day ever. IBIT hemorrhaged $523 million on 18 November, shattering all previous outflow records as institutional investors abandoned Bitcoin positions below $90,000. Arkham Intelligence data reveals the magnitude of the exodus. BlackRock buys or sells Bitcoin to settle outstanding IBIT shares on a T+1 basis. This means today’s $523M BTC sale reflects actual client trading activity from yesterday. The outflow represents the largest net negative flow in IBIT’s entire existence. No other day comes close. IBIT’s selling pressure overwhelmed the broader spot Bitcoin ETF landscape, according to Soso Value data. Total market outflows hit -$372.77M on 18 November, with BlackRock’s fund accounting for 140% of total negative flows. Source: SoSoValue Other major ETFs showed minimal activity. Fidelity’s FBTC, Grayscale’s GBTC, Ark’s ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL all recorded zero or near-zero flows. Only Grayscale’s smaller BTC fund posted meaningful inflows at $139.63M, but this couldn’t offset IBIT’s historic dump. The data showed that institutional money fled Bitcoin through the industry’s largest and most liquid ETF. Bitcoin crashed 3.15% to $89,989.82 as the institutional selling wave hit. The breakdown confirmed technical weakness that’s been building since BTC failed to hold $100K in mid-November. Source: TradingView The MACD indicator is currently at -3,755.91, indicating deeply bearish momentum. Bitcoin has shed nearly $10,000 from recent highs near $100K, erasing weeks of gains in a matter of days. IBIT still holds $72.76 billion in total net assets, representing 3.93% of Bitcoin’s market cap. The fund has maintained cumulative net inflows of $58.22 billion since its launch. However, yesterday’s record outflow signals a potential shift in institutional sentiment. The timing suggests institutional clients lost confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim six figures. After multiple rejections at $100K, large allocators pulled the trigger on redemptions. BlackRock must sell the underlying Bitcoin when clients redeem IBIT shares. The $523M figure represents actual BTC that hit the market, not just paper selling. This real supply pressure accelerated Bitcoin’s descent below key support levels. Is this a temporary pause in the institutional Bitcoin adoption story, or the start of a deeper correction?

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/19/2025 8:04:54 AM PST by Red Badger The endowment dramatically increased its holdings of a spot bitcoin ETF since its previous such report. According to a new SEC filing, the Harvard University endowment’s largest publicly-traded investment is now in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which is a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) operated by Blackrock. The filing indicates the endowment increased its holdings of IBIT from 1,906,000 shares to 6,813,612 shares since its previous such report. At current prices, the value of those IBIT holdings sits at around $364 million. This is already down rather heavily from the roughly $443 million valuation included in the filing, as bitcoin’s price has recently been struggling and now appears stuck under the $100,000 mark. As pointed out by MacroScope on X, another notable, and perhaps related, aspect of this recent filing is the 99% increase in gold ETF SPDR Gold Shares as well. In addition to their notable bitcoin and gold holdings, the Harvard University endowment also reported large investments in tech giants like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet (Google’s parent company). Again, it should be noted that this SEC filing only covers the endowment’s holdings in the public markets. According to a recent report by Reuters, the total size of the Harvard University endowment sits at roughly $57 billion, with only 14% of that being held in public equities. That valuation would indicate the endowment’s holdings in IBIT represent less than 1% of its overall portfolio. However, it’s definitely possible that the endowment also has bitcoin exposure in some of its privately-held investments. According to Forbes, Harvard has the largest endowment among all universities. Growing Trust in Bitcoin as a Store of Value Of course, Harvard is not going out on a limb on their own in terms of their bitcoin holdings. In terms of university endowments with bitcoin exposure, there have been reports pointing to fellow Ivy leaguers Brown and Yale, in addition to many others.

Title: CMBS Expert Mike Strug Leaves BlackRock to Join Stephen Muller’s Vanadium Group
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/11/cmbs-expert-mike-strug-join-vanadium-group/
Time Published: 2025-11-19T14:56:06Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy One of the great connectors in commercial real estate has jumped from BlackRock to a lesser-known advisory shop that specializes in equity deals and major mixed-use projects. Mike Strug, founder of the Young Real Estate Professionals of New York (YREPNY), an informal networking group that has connected thousands of industry players since 2001, has left BlackRock after 14 years as a vice president of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) analytics to join Vanadium Group. Vanadium Group is a six-person advisory firm founded in 2019 by Stephen Muller, formerly chief investment officer at Arris Properties Group and managing director at Greenwich Group International. The firm specializes primarily in equity — and some debt — brokerage, where it connects middle-market capital markets owner-operators and developers to the debt and equity needed to finish CRE projects or finance new ones. Strug, who began his 28-year CRE career in lending, told CO that as much as he loved working at BlackRock’s analytics arm, he wanted to get back into the nitty-gritty of deal flow. “I wanted to get back on the deal side,” he said. “We’re nimble, there’s only six of us here, I’ve known Steve Muller for 23 years … so it was the perfect fit for me to come over.” Before joining BlackRock, Strug spent several years as a loan officer at IDB Bank, as an investment officer at Assurant, and as a senior originations associate at TIAA-CREF. Strug also said that the move over the Vanadium aids the position he holds as founder of YREPNY, which has met once a month in New York City for the past 24 years. That volunteer job has turned Strug into an in-demand guest speaker at colleges and “a pseudo-mentor for thousands of young professionals,” as he humbly describes himself. “It’s helped me expand my network over the years and give back,” he said. “And here, now, I’m able to leverage my network and help drive business for Vanadium Group.” Muller began his career 25 years ago underwriting deals at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and has directed and overseen real estate investments worth exceeding $20 billion across different asset classes in multiple C-suite capacities. He told CO he was thrilled to find someone like Strug who can aid Vanadium’s underwriting through his decades of private equity CMBS analysis and his deep list of contacts forged from his monthly mentorship meetings. “We do a huge amount of the work, and to be able to find someone who has the kind of network like Mike’s, but who also has the intellectual horsepower, is not easy at all,” said Muller. “What I said to Mike was, ‘It’s not just your Rolodex that I view as an opportunity, but you were doing CMBS surveillance and writing private equity quality research materials.’ That’s not teachable.” Muller is the first to admit that many in the industry might not have heard of Vanadium, which specializes in making markets for preferred equity pieces of limited partner equity, as well as advising large-scale mixed-use projects. Muller listed The Wharf is Washington, D.C. and Miami Worldcenter as among the biggest mixed-use projects he’s advised and underwritten. But it’s the equity space, rather than the burgeoning world of private credit, that Muller and Strug believe offers them the greatest opportunity to bring investors together, either directly or through syndication. “Probably 80 percent of our business is equity, as opposed to debt, and that in and of itself is very unique — most of the advisory firms are the other way around,” explained Muller. “There are very few true equity shops left in the industry.” Moreover, Muller emphasized that Strug will help his firm build and grow its relationships with institutional equity groups like small to medium-size life insurance companies, pension funds and endowments, which often don’t have the ability to either syndicate equity originations in-house or create liquidity for their existing investments through the secondary market. “There are very few people like Mike who can truly speak the institutional language, have an incredible institutional Rolodex, but can also bring the entrepreneurial spirit that he brings,” said Muller. “He’s a natural-born entrepreneur and networker.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

Title: $372M outflows hit Bitcoin ETFs – What’s driving the panic?

Time Published: 2025-11-19T14:00:17Z

What’s driving this unexpected reshuffling across crypto funds? Bitcoin ETFs saw $372.8 million in net outflows, led by BlackRock’s IBIT with $523.2 million in withdrawals. No, Grayscale and Franklin Templeton recorded inflows, while others remained flat. Global crypto investment products are facing a sharp pullback as rising macroeconomic uncertainty shakes investor confidence. Exchange-traded products saw a massive wave of outflows, with withdrawals crossing $2 billion worldwide. According to data from Farside Investors, spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs have been hit the hardest, recording continuous outflows since the 12th of November, signaling a shift in market sentiment just as volatility begins to climb. On the 18th of November, Bitcoin ETFs extended their losing streak, posting $372.8 million in net outflows. BlackRock’s IBIT led the downturn with $523.2 million in withdrawals, making it the only product with negative flows on that day. In contrast, other major issuers recorded modest inflows. Grayscale’s BTC added $139.6 million, while Franklin Templeton’s EZBC saw $10.8 million. The remaining issuers recorded flat, zero flows, according to Farside Investors. These market moves came as Bitcoin slipped below the $90,000 mark, reflecting broader risk aversion. However, the asset showed early signs of recovery at press time, trading at $91,796.18, up 0.82% in 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap. Yet, despite the slight bounce, sentiment remains cautious. Bitcoin’s RSI stayed below the neutral line and continued trending downward, suggesting bearish momentum. Meanwhile, price volatility spiked, signaling unstable price action and highlighting that bulls may struggle to regain control in the short term. Source: Santiment A recent report by 21Shares noted that Bitcoin’s drop below $100K, now 27% off its peak, signals a short-term correction rather than a full-blown bear market. The decline has been driven by several factors: institutional unwinding of basis trades, falling yields, long-term holders offloading around 42,000 BTC, and continued ETF outflows. Broader macroeconomic pressures, including delayed interest rate cuts and weakness in tech markets, have added to the strain. Despite this pullback, the report emphasizes that Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain strong. Selling pressure is easing, liquidity is improving post-shutdown, and long-term demand is growing, fueled by institutional interest and anticipated regulatory clarity. Key technical levels to watch are resistance at $98K–$100K and support at $85K. If Bitcoin can hold the $85K–$90K range and reclaim $98K–$102K, a move toward $110K+ is likely. However, a break below $85K could lead to extended consolidation in the $75K–$80K zone. Overall, the current move appears to be a healthy reset, not a trend reversal. If looked carefully, the largest chunk of ETF outflows, particularly from BlackRock, appears to be tied to institutional trading strategies rather than retail panic selling. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes noted that hedge funds, including firms like Goldman Sachs, were driving the withdrawals. These funds previously used Bitcoin ETFs to execute basis trades, a strategy where traders buy spot ETF positions while shorting Bitcoin Futures on CME to profit from the spread. When yields were high, the trade was lucrative, offering returns of around 14% in October. As spreads narrowed to below 5%, the trade lost its appeal, leading hedge funds to unwind their positions. According to Hayes, this wave of liquidations sparked institutional outflows, which in turn unsettled retail investors, intensifying the overall wave of withdrawals. Now, while Bitcoin ETFs bore the brunt of the recent market pullback, the trend wasn’t uniform across all assets. At press time, Spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs saw outflows of $74.2 million, reflecting broader caution toward major crypto assets. Investor sentiment toward alternative assets remained more positive, with Spot Solana [SOL] ETFs drawing $26.2 million in inflows during the same period. These mixed flows indicate that investors aren’t exiting digital assets altogether; they’re reallocating capital, reassessing risk, and exploring opportunities beyond dominant market leaders amid rising volatility.

Title: Property prices surge by 7.6%, but Taoiseach says government is 'making progress' in housing

THE GOVERNMENT’S NEW housing plan was today defended by the Taoiseach who claimed that the government is making progress on housing. Micheál Martin said the cost and affordability “continues to be an issue with a growing population”. His comments come after the release of the latest report from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) finds that house prices jumped by 7.6% in the year to September. This is up from the 7.5% rise recorded in the year to August. Dublin saw prices rise by 5.3%, but they were up by 9.4% outside the capital in the year to September. The highest median price for a dwelling in the 12 months to September 2025 was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €190,000 in Donegal. Advertisement The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to September 2025 was Blackrock in Dublin, with a median price of €808,000, while Castlerea, Roscommon had the least expensive price of €148,000. Speaking during Leaders’ Questions, Labour leader Ivana Bacik described the new housing plan as “old milk in new bottles”. “Nothing new on affordable home ownership, no clarity on what new powers the Land Development Agency will have, and no ambition on social housing,” she added. She accused the government of abandoning annual targets for new home building. Martin hit back saying Bacik “told an untruth” when she said “the government had no social housing targets”. The government plans to deliver 12,000 new social homes “every year over the lifetime of the plan”, he said. Martin said needs the government needs to deliver upward of 50,000 houses a year, stating that €20 billion needs to be spent every year. “The state will not be able to do €20 billion every year. The private sector has to be involved,” he said, accusing Labour of consistently being hostile to any private sector dimension to housing. Related Reads Why Ireland's most toothless housing crisis measure is finally getting an overhaul Gaeltacht agency welcomes housing plan - but uncertainty remains over planning guidelines Here's what experts think of the government's housing plan Bacik also criticised a plan to reduce minimum apartment standards, which she said the government: “backed down in the courts on Monday”. In the High Court this week, the government’s legal representation said it would now carry out a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) to see whether the reduced apartment sizes are in line with existing regulations. They maintain the standard designs launched during the summer will not be modified. The Taoiseach responded, saying the new design standards had been put forward because the government wanted to “narrow the viability gap when it came to building apartments”. The Social Democrats Holly Cairns asked the Taoiseach why annual house building targets were not included in the government’s plans and why the overall target “goes beyond the lifetime of this government”. Martin claimed that under the previous plan, Housing for All, the Government “exceeded” its targets, describing it as an “inconvenient truth for the opposition”.

Share this article BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, deposited 6,735 Bitcoin worth around $616 million and 64,706 Ethereum worth approximately $200 million into Coinbase today. The transfers were made to Coinbase Prime, which provides custody and trading services for institutional clients. The deposits continue a pattern of institutional transfers BlackRock has conducted in recent weeks as part of routine custodial adjustments tied to its crypto ETF operations. BlackRock operates spot ETFs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, facilitating institutional investment in digital assets. Such large crypto movements by BlackRock often spark market discussions about potential selling pressure amid ETF outflows, though the transfers align with standard liquidity management practices for asset managers handling crypto ETF operations.

Singapore The proposal is still subject to the completion of relevant regulatory processes. If successful, companies interested in an IPO can use a single set of offering documents to list on both exchanges concurrently.

(File photos: AFP/Roslan Rahman, Reuters/Brendan McDermid) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Companies may soon be able to concurrently list on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and Nasdaq, enabling companies to access capital across Asia and North America, announced the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Wednesday (Nov 19). While the proposal for a dual listing bridge is subject to the completion of relevant regulatory processes, MAS will work with SGX to consult on the regulatory framework for a set of prospectus disclosure requirements comparable to that in the US, it said. This means companies that are interested in an initial public offering (IPO) can use a single set of offering documents to list on both exchanges concurrently, cutting down on regulatory friction and cost, MAS said. The cross-border listing framework will allow companies with a market capitalisation of S$2 billion (US$1.5 billion) and above to access global capital, investors and liquidity, said SGX and Nasdaq in a joint press release on Wednesday. With the bridge in place, companies will be able to simultaneously list on SGX and the US exchange, and dual-listed shares registered in the US can be settled on SGX and vice versa. This is one of the measures announced by the Equities Market Review Group, which was set up to give recommendations on how to strengthen the development of Singapore's stock market. MAS set up the review group in 2024 after SGX had its worst year for listings in 2023. The review group is led by Minister for National Development Chee Hong Tat, who was Second Minister for Finance at the time. He is also the deputy chairman of MAS. At a press conference on Wednesday concluding the review, Mr Chee said: "We are still very keen to attract companies to list on the SGX mainboard, just as Nasdaq will still be very keen to attract companies to list on Nasdaq. "But we both see this as an additional option that some companies could find attractive, could find useful, and so this will help us to be able to enlarge the pie for both Nasdaq and SGX." For example, a company may be considered large by Singapore or Asian standards, but may end up "becoming smaller fish in a much bigger pond" if they were to list on Nasdaq on its own, he added. With the draw of both US and Singapore liquidity pools, the new board will support efforts to attract more Asian issuers into the Singapore ecosystem, said Mr Chee. The new board is envisaged to go live around mid-2026, he added. The announcements come amid growing interest in new SGX listings from corporates while MAS rolled out the review group's previous recommendations. The third quarter of 2025 saw more IPOs than in the whole of 2024. The Straits Times Index closed last week at 4,546.07 after hitting a new all-time high of 4,575.91, delivering a 25.8 per cent total return for the year to Nov 14. MAS also announced a "value unlock" programme to help listed companies "strengthen investor engagement and sharpen their focus on shareholder value creation". This includes S$30 million (US$23 million) allocated to two grants to build competencies in corporate strategy, capital optimisation and investor relations, MAS said. MAS added that it had appointed a second batch of six more asset managers to the S$5 billion Equity Market Development Programme – one of the several measures proposed by the review group to boost Singapore's stock market. From the remaining sum, S$2.85 billion has been allocated to Amova Asset Management, AR Capital, BlackRock, Eastspring Investments (Singapore), Lion Global Investors and Manulife Investment Management (Singapore). MAS appointed the first three asset managers in July to manage S$1.1 billion under the programme, which involves putting money with fund managers focused on investing in Singapore stocks. At the time, more than 100 global, regional and local firms had expressed interest in the programme. A total of S$3.95 billion has been allocated to nine asset managers. The central bank will continue to review the remaining submissions and the next phase of appointments is expected in the second quarter of 2026. The review group also announced other trading and market structure enhancements: To oversee the implementation of these measures, MAS will establish an Equity Market Implementation Committee, co-chaired by its managing director Chia Der Jiun and SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye. Adding that there has been "some encouraging development" since the review began in August 2024, Mr Chee said Singapore's equities market has performed well overall. "Building a stronger equities market, we know it cannot be done by any single organisation. There's no silver bullet to battle this set of challenges that we used to face," he added. The government wants to continue collaborating with industry partners going forward, to continue finding new growth areas for Singapore's financial services industry, especially in a more turbulent environment, said the minister. "But we must, while we're doing this, also remind ourselves that we've got to be prepared to take some risks, calculated risks," said Mr Chee. "We want to enhance the competitiveness of our ecosystem, we want to increase our chances of being able to implement transformative change. We may not always succeed." Mr David Gerald, president and CEO of the Securities Investors Association Singapore (SIAS) lauded the "value unlock" initiatives, adding that listed companies are typically "very shy" about communicating with retail investors. He said the grants would help firms better train their officers to market their business growth journeys as well as their valuations and plans. This would encourage investors to look at how the company's stock is performing, he added. "Singapore companies are not having enough liquidity. If you can spur the local investors to do more for you, and if more companies come out and do these things and not hide behind annual reports ... they need to communicate more regularly." CEO of the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID), Mr Terence Quek, said the moves by MAS will function as "a shot in the arm" for the local equities market and spark more interest in local-listed firms. The latest announcements show that the review group took a deep dive into the issue while listening to feedback from key stakeholders, including directors of listed entities, he added. "Boards and directors will also need to step up. SID will continue to play a key role in supporting boards with the capabilities, professionalism and governance standards they need to operate in this new landscape," said Mr Quek. To support the "value unlock" programme, SID will launch a series of programmes to help directors develop competencies in the area of corporate strategy, capital optimisation and investor relations and stakeholder engagement, he added. The dual listing bridge makes it clear that Singapore is “going all out” to attract listings of large high-quality companies, said joint managing partner of TSMP Law Corporation Stefanie Yuen-Thio, who is a member of the Corporate Governance Advisory Committee. “With geopolitical tensions still running high, it makes sense for companies to develop an investor base on both sides of the world,” she added. An SGX and Nasdaq dual listing would provide 24-hour coverage and trading of stocks and “not make the listed company look too US-focused”, she said. The S$5 billion allocated to asset managers pumps “much needed” liquidity into lesser known but good quality stocks, said Ms Yuen-Thio. “It’s a good start but you cannot lift a market just by pumping in capital. You also need to equip companies, which is what the ‘value unlock’ program seeks to do.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app

Title: What Dimensional’s Dual-Share-Class Approval Means for Advisors

This week’s SEC decision may be one of the most significant since the ETF Rule in 2019. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com The SEC approved the first dual share classes of ETFs and mutual funds this week, meaning advisors won’t have to choose between the two wrappers, effectively letting them order the surf and turf. Dimensional Fund Advisors on Tuesday received the long-awaited exemption, which could become one of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s most significant decisions since the ETF Rule in 2019. Almost 80 other companies, including major asset managers like BlackRock, State Street and JP Morgan, are still waiting in line for the green light. While the eventual benefits of the decision may take years to develop, experts agree it’s a major milestone for the industry that could reshape how financial advisors use the funds inside client portfolios. Plus, nobody likes choosing between the steak or the lobster. “We anticipate Dimensional will be the first firm to offer an actively managed ETF share class of an existing mutual fund,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research and editorial at TMX VettaFi. “Demand for actively managed ETFs has never been stronger.” For advisors, new products that utilize dual share classes will likely blend the advantages of the ETF wrapper with the scale and reach of traditional mutual funds. They could also help ETFs enter the 401(k) landscape. Dimensional, one of the country’s largest active ETF issuers, can now extend key ETF features to existing mutual funds, like the creation and redemption mechanism that can help boost tax efficiencies. Dimensional had applied to add exchange-traded fund share classes to 13 of its US equity funds, according to a release. Some of them include: Managers still have their work cut out for them, however. The challenges will be navigating the significant back-office reporting issues and ensuring investors fully understand the structure, Rosenbluth added. “Gaining approval for an ETF share class and successfully launching one are two different things,” he said. Dimensional said the first batch of selected funds were the least operationally complex to transition, but additional candidates are expected to follow. “We expect many other asset managers will observe this rollout carefully before adopting a similar approach,” Rosenbluth said. I’ll Take Two: There will certainly be winners and losers. Historically, the easing of regulations has tended to favor the biggest brand names, said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF Research & Analytics at CFRA Research. For example, after the ETF Rule went into effect, almost 60% of active ETFs assets went to just five issuers, though it could also benefit boutique managers with strong track records. “Mutual fund managers who lack both strong brand recognition and a track record of past performance will likely face a twin threat: downward fee pressure and difficulty in attracting ETF inflows,” he said. Janus Henderson and Reckoner Capital Management both filed to launch new collateralized debt obligations strategies this month. Trading fractional shares for whole shares will require some communication and help, according to one firm that offers shareholder services. More people are planning to buy ETFs, and their biggest demands are exposure to stocks and digital assets, per BlackRock. No state income taxes and pro-business policies have attracted hundreds of companies to the Lone Star State. Some of the biggest companies in the ETF business haven’t been in the game for very long but are quickly gathering assets. About 900 ETFs launched this year, and dozens of highly leveraged and spot crypto products await approval. Not all of them will catch on. Fundstrat is back at the free throw line, this time with a small- and mid-cap ETF and another focused on income. Issuers are betting that advisors could benefit from exposure to a narrow slice of the aerospace defense industry. Roughly the same number of ETFs closed in the first half of 2024 and 2025, even as new product launches pick up speed. The company, which is planning to add mutual fund share classes to some of its ETFs, recently rebranded and put the State Street name on many ETFs while taking SPDR off of some. More than half of millennial ETF investors told Schwab that they can and will outperform boring old index funds. While far from the biggest ETFs on the market, spaced-themed funds are skyrocketing in 2025. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Why CLO ETFs Are Picking Up Steam

Janus Henderson and Reckoner Capital Management both filed to launch new collateralized debt obligations strategies this month. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Collateralized debt obligations got a bad rap from movies like “The Big Short.” But the story could be different for their cousin, collateralized loan obligations. Issuers are diving into the world of exchange-traded funds that invest in CLOs. Janus Henderson recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch another CLO strategy, while Reckoner Capital Management proposed four such ETFs earlier this month. The appeal stems from their high yields relative to other bond funds and the recent period of high interest rates. The new funds also reflect investors’ appetite for risk-on strategies as more of these products enter the arena. “During that rising rate period … [CLO ETFs] just happened to stand out as an asset class that people thought was interesting,” said Paul Olmsted, senior analyst of fixed income strategies at Morningstar. “It’s a yield play.” The new Janus fund will invest in AA- and A-rated CLOs, which are higher risk than AAA bonds (that have never defaulted) but could also potentially yield higher returns. Janus Henderson was the first to offer CLOs in an ETF wrapper, launching JAAA in 2020 and giving investors access to a broad array of collateralized loan obligations, or investments in companies that make loan payments; investors see yield when the corporations pay off their debts. Other funds from BlackRock (CLOA) and VanEck (CLOI) hit the market in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The three largest CLO ETFs available today include: Go With the CLO: The recent surge of CLO strategies may also stem from a growing interest in private credit, and the expansion of institutional-grade investments to retail investors. Still, there is always some risk involved in CLO investments, particularly lower-grade loans (like BBB or BB loans), even if corporations are the ones paying the loans. Olmsted advises to “stick with the bigger ones.” “It’s so important that people are doing their due diligence,” Olmsted said. “If you look at some of the smaller names out there, just be aware and make sure that they have a reasonable track record.” This week’s SEC decision may be one of the most significant since the ETF Rule in 2019. Trading fractional shares for whole shares will require some communication and help, according to one firm that offers shareholder services. More people are planning to buy ETFs, and their biggest demands are exposure to stocks and digital assets, per BlackRock.

US Bitcoin ETFs are nearing $3 billion in November outflows as a fresh death cross, fading Fed rate cut odds, and smart money shorts weigh on sentiment. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are closing in on $3 billion in net outflows for November, putting the products on track for their worst month yet after BlackRock’s fund logged its biggest day of redemptions on record. US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs extended their five-day losing streak Tuesday, logging another $372 million in net negative outflows, according to Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF recorded $523 million in outflows, marking its largest day of outflows since its debut in January 2024. The latest outflows bring November’s total to $2.96 billion, already making it the second-worst month for spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock alone accounted for $2.1 billion of those outflows. Another week of selling could push redemptions past the $3.56 billion seen in February, which would mark the weakest month for ETF flows despite the historical tendency for November to be one of Bitcoin’s strongest periods. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows were the primary driver of Bitcoin’s momentum in 2025, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, told Cointelegraph recently. Related: Bitcoin ETFs bleed $866M in second-worst day on record, but some analysts still bullish The ETF outflows have continued to mount despite investors expecting a month of upside for Bitcoin, based on historical data. November is the best month for Bitcoin’s historic returns, with BTC averaging a 41.22% rally during the month, according to CoinGlass data. Looking at other crypto funds, the Ether (ETH) ETFs recorded $74.2 million in outflows on Tuesday, while the Solana (SOL) ETFs attracted $26.2 million in inflows, surpassing $421 million in total investments since launch, according to Farside Investors. Related: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin gains fall 39% as October crash pressures corporate treasuries Bitcoin printed this cycle’s fourth “death cross” last week, a technical chart pattern that emerges when an asset’s short-term price momentum indicators fall below the long-term trend. While it is historically considered a “bearish technical signal,” the death cross can also signal a macro bottom ahead of a strong reversal, depending on the wider economic context, Lacie Zhang, research analyst at Bitget Wallet, told Cointelegraph. Some of the crypto-specific concerns included a warning from Bitmine Immersion’s chairman, Tom Lee, who stated that two major market makers are facing financial deficits, explained the analyst. Meanwhile, markets are pricing in a 46% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut during the Federal Reserve meeting on Dec. 10, down from 93.7% a month ago, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. The development inspired a repositioning among the industry’s most successful traders, who are tracked as “smart money” traders on Nansen’s blockchain intelligence platform, for a more short-term downside. Smart money traders have added $5.7 million worth of cumulative short positions in the past 24 hours, signaling downside expectations, as this cohort was net short on Bitcoin for $275 million, according to Nansen.

Title: The AI Bubble Is Bigger Than You Think

Time Published: 2025-11-19T10:15:00Z

One thing I’ve been tracking this year is the areas where Wall Street and Silicon Valley are going to war. Tech firms clearly want to become banking apps and receive special charters, private equity and crypto are jostling for position in worker 401(k) plans, and the tech right in general wants to supplant big banks as the go-to director of conservative business policy. That’s all still going on. But in one area, Silicon Valley and Wall Street are in sync: conjuring up sketchy credit deals that are pointing us toward another financial crash. More from David Dayen Last month, the big focus was “round-tripping,” the way that sundry AI and tech companies were investing in their own customers—with Nvidia giving AI companies the investment necessary to buy their graphics processing units (GPUs), and so on. But there’s a lot more to this story, tangled up with yet another rebrand by the former masters of the universe, from “shadow banks” without proper regulation into something boring and neutral-sounding: private credit. Ever since the advent of financial regulation, there have been companies that have attempted to evade the rules with creative branding. Private credit companies are non-banks that are trying to rebrand into a name that doesn’t tell everyone they are unregulated lending vehicles. The speculative financing of the artificial intelligence buildout is happening mostly in private credit, where assets under management hit $1.6 trillion in February and are likely higher today. The deals being made are perverse and irrational; there are huge mismatches between the life cycle of the assets being funded and the amount of time it will take to pay them off. Experts have been doing everything but picketing the stock exchange with signs that say “BUBBLE IN PROGRESS,” yet the country has so much sunk cost in the AI boom that the pathway feels inevitable. “We have sealed the deal on another financial crisis—the question is size,” said one former congressional staffer. I WILL TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS as simply as I can. The build-out of computing power for AI needs about $2 trillion in annual revenue by the end of the decade to justify the current and planned investment. It’s an insane amount of money, nobody has it—nobody may ever have it—and so everything being constructed now, from the GPUs needed to train AI models to the data centers housing them to the energy supplying those data centers, needs some creative financing. Big Tech companies have large cash flows, but the trillions needed are too steep even for them. Venture capital isn’t that interested in funding infrastructure either; while the God in the machine that may result from the AI build-out has potential for supercharged returns, data centers and power plants, by themselves, won’t get you there. Related: The AI ouroboros But investors are dying for this kind of investment opportunity, believing that a Big Tech–directed industrial policy will endure for years. Big Tech firms have historically not borrowed much, however, and though companies have issued twice as many bonds this year than at any time in the recent past, they would like to maintain strong credit ratings by limiting debt exposure. Smaller AI companies, meanwhile, don’t have the confidence of the markets to borrow hundreds of billions in capital. Enter the “special purpose vehicle” (SPV). A company pops up to build a data center, and they get an “anchor tenant” that’s a Big Tech firm. (Data centers rent their space to tenants; they are infrastructure, but they’re also like apartment buildings.) It finances the data center through debt sales, implicitly (or explicitly) promising that Big Tech firm payments will pass through to investors. This is the case with an SPV for Meta’s $30 billion Hyperion data center in Louisiana. Blue Owl, a private credit fund, owns the majority stake in the SPV; it put in a small amount of equity, and the SPV carries the debt. Meta has another 20 percent, which gives investors the confidence that they’ll get repaid without Meta having to put debt on its balance sheet. This has a side effect of highly rating these debt instruments, with “specialized” rating agencies doing much of the work, in ways that are more than suspicious. Blue Owl is a private credit fund, which again is an end run around financial regulations. These companies suck up money from investors, well over a trillion dollars according to The Wall Street Journal. Blue Owl has $295 billion on its own. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. It’s pitched as a bulletproof trade; Big Tech firms are locked into leases, and their payments will pay back the debt. But if that’s the case, why is Blue Owl, in the aftermath of a merger of two of its private credit funds, blocking redemptions in a way that will automatically give those investors 20 percent losses? As a traditional bank, that move would be akin to a bank run; this is just pissing off rich people who got into an arrangement with limited rights. But the warning signs are unmistakable. And it’s not limited to Blue Owl; covenants on corporate debt are gradually being rewritten to protect private credit in the event of a fallout. A great paper from the Center for Public Enterprise lays out additional alarms. Data centers are not lasting infrastructure, or at least the guts inside them aren’t. If the GPUs are working overtime to compute AI models, they may not last more than two years, and high-end AI firms will always want to upgrade to the latest version anyway. (By the way, our friends at Blue Owl are lending money to Elon Musk’s xAI to buy Nvidia GPUs.) But AI firms are extending their depreciation schedules for the GPUs; they’re saying they will last much longer than they likely will. That means overstated revenues, as companies have to purchase far more GPUs than they are admitting publicly, and thence possible financial disaster. Indeed, some of the smaller companies are using loans backed by their GPUs to purchase other GPUs. It also means that these hulking buildings, and the dedicated power plants some of them are constructing in the vicinity, are likely to become stranded assets when the site outlives its usefulness. Everyone’s all in on data centers now; we’re in bubble inflation territory, and it’s unclear when it will pop. Did I mention the securitization? Data centers roll over from construction loans into asset-backed securities, where investors can pick a tranche based on their risk comfort. The CPE report says that 61 percent of the applicable securitizations in this market are coming from data centers. But again, these securitizations happen years into a rapidly depreciating asset. Everyone’s all in on data centers now; we’re in bubble inflation territory, and it’s unclear when it will pop. Of course, the big problem at the end of this road is that there just isn’t enough expected cash flow to pay any of this off. OpenAI lost more than $11.5 billion last quarter, and wants to spend far more in future years. The potential revenue to make up the gap is not anywhere on the horizon. If the Chinese AI models that are more efficient at training—in part because it is possible to reconstruct LLM datasets by purchasing their output—break ahead of the U.S. counterparts, there’s not going to be any way to finance the growing pile of infrastructure and real estate assets being built. But the big AI firms have no interest in efficiency here. The same companies making the models are the ones who own the cloud computing firms that are pushing more compute to everyone. In fact, the money made from cloud compute is subsidizing the model training at Amazon and Microsoft and Google. Everyone is financing the expansion of everyone else. That’s a classic description of a bubble. There’s a whole middleman aspect to this as well, the “neoclouds” that build data centers on spec and rent them out. (CoreWeave is a terrifying debt-ridden entry in this genre.) But I think you get the picture. We have a 2000s housing bubble level of financial engineering on top of a 1920s level of private unregulated lending on top of something bigger than a 1990s internet (or 1870s railroad) level of technology and infrastructure build-out. It’s one bubble to rule them all. WHILE THIS PILE MAY BE CENTERED IN PRIVATE CREDIT, private equity funds, real estate investment trusts, and other vehicles have pieces of it. A Moody’s report last month said that banks have at least $300 billion in loans to private credit. Blue Owl has BlackRock, Invesco, and PIMCO selling the bonds financing the Hyperion data center. Because this is the only thing moving in this economy, everyone on Wall Street wants some of the action, even those who are wary of it. Deutsche Bank, for example, is talking about reducing its exposure to data center risks, including by shorting AI stocks. But within that, the bank has acknowledged that some of its traders had “gone heavy” on financing for data centers. That puts the effort by Trump’s financial regulators to deregulate traditional banking, including the Federal Reserve slashing bank supervision, in a different light. It may be hard for a private credit firm to get bailed out by the government; for the banks, it’s easier. If banks soak up and carry over the debt from the Blue Owls of the world, they have better opportunities to have it effectively extinguished. So while the biggest names swap money back and forth to buy each other’s stuff, these special purpose vehicles and their investors could be left holding the bag. That increasingly could be ordinary retail investors with 401(k) plans. Financial policymakers I’ve talked to are perhaps most alarmed by this part. There are enough people in the know, like Peter Thiel, quietly sidling away from this investment/fiasco that nerves should be pretty frayed if you have any concern about the U.S. economy. Blue Owl’s stock is way down this year, as skepticism with private credit abounds; it fell 6 percent just on Monday. It’s not exactly comforting when Google’s CEO says “no company is going to be immune, including us” if the AI bubble bursts. First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.

Title: BlackRock clients pull $523m out of Bitcoin positions. Here’s what to expect next for the price

About us Copy link BlackRock investors are offloading their Bitcoin holdings. On Tuesday, the asset management behemoth saw clients pull $523 million out of its flagship iShares Bitcoin Trust. It’s not alone: US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have shed $3 billion so far in November, and are closing in on the $3.5 billion purge levels seen in February, DefiLlama data shows. The broad selloffs come as Bitcoin’s price is still wobbling around the $90,000 mark on the back of a $1.2 trillion selloff of all cryptocurrencies over the past month. “This kind of drift usually means the downtrend is likely to continue,” Georgii Verbitskii, founder of crypto investing app TYMIO, told DL News. “There is a real possibility that we’re entering a prolonged bearish period, with either continued downside or extended choppy trading around $100,000 or lower.” It’s not just crypto-specific factors driving the downward price action, Nicholas Roberts-Huntley, CEO and co-founder of Blueprint Finance told DL News. “Tightening liquidity, higher interest rates, and slower economic growth are all creating economic headwinds and market worry,” Roberts-Huntley said. The selloff reflects a broader deterioration in global risk sentiment as equity markets wobble. Investors are bracing for Nvidia’s earnings report on Wednesday, delayed US jobs data and a divided US Federal Reserve that remains unsure whether interest rate cuts should proceed this year. In the US, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq logged further losses as investor positioning flips defensive ahead of Nvidia’s third-quarter report and the delayed September jobs data. Nvidia is once again at the centre of a market storm. The $4.4 trillion chipmaker will report earnings on Wednesday, and although analysts expect blockbuster numbers, trader sentiment has turned fragile after weeks of questions over artificial intelligence companies’ valuations. The market is now divided on whether AI stocks are entering a valuation reset. Hedge funds have traded exposure to Nvidia in near-perfect balance. According to Bloomberg, 161 funds increased their positions while 160 reduced them in Q3. Peter Thiel’s Thiel Macro fund fully dumped Nvidia during the same period, selling 537,742 shares. At the same time, SoftBank confirmed it had liquidated its Nvidia stake for $5.83 billion, reallocating capital to other AI ventures. Michael Burry, the legendary investor who shorted the 2008 crash, disclosed that his Scion Asset Management bought put options on Nvidia and Palantir, positions that would benefit from declines in the stock prices. On Tuesday, Sundar Pichai, the head of Google’s parent firm Alphabet, told the BBC that AI investments have elements of “irrationality.” Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson added to market unease earlier this week, saying he sees “increased downside risks to employment” and stressed policymakers must “proceed slowly” as rates approach neutral. That uncertainty has hamstrung rate-cut expectations. The CME FedWatch tool now assigns roughly 49% odds to a December cut, while Polymarket bettors put the probability at 54%.

November 19, 2025 05:00 ET | Source: Binaryx Bali Asset 1 DAO LLC Binaryx Bali Asset 1 DAO LLC Binaryx Platform reaches 2,400+ active co-owners and $320,000 in distributed passive income as institutional giants like BlackRock validate trillion-dollar tokenization opportunity PARIS, France, Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global investment landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation as Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization moves from experimental technology to mainstream financial infrastructure. With institutional projections estimating the tokenized asset market could reach $16 trillion by the 2030s, platforms like Binaryx are demonstrating how blockchain-enabled fractional ownership is making previously inaccessible real estate investments available to a broader investor base. According to Deloitte research 'Tokenization of Real Estate: Unlocking New Opportunities (2024)', tokenized private real estate funds alone could achieve $1 trillion in value by 2035, while industry analysis suggests the broader tokenized asset market may reach $16 trillion or more within the decade. This shift has attracted major institutional players, with BlackRock targeting $10 trillion in tokenized assets and launching its BUIDL Fund on the Ethereum blockchain. "Tokenization isn't hype — it's infrastructure,". "When BlackRock talks trillions and launches products, this is no longer a pilot program. This represents a fundamental shift in how ownership, liquidity, and investment function in the 21st century." Binaryx: From Startup to 34 Tokenized Properties in Three Years Binaryx, a tokenized real estate platform, exemplifies this transformation in practice. In just three years, the platform has grown from five properties to 34 tokenized real estate assets across Indonesia, Turkey, and Montenegro, with: The platform has optimized its operational processes more than 10 times over three years, addressing traditional barriers to real estate co-ownership. Where conventional fractional ownership involves thousands of dollars in notarial and legal fees plus operational bureaucracy, Binaryx's DAO-LLC model significantly reduces these barriers. Liquidity: The Game-Changing Advantage Perhaps most significantly, Binaryx enables property share liquidity in approximately 40 minutes to one month — compared to the traditional 2-8 month timeline for real estate transactions. This liquidity advantage addresses one of the fundamental challenges of real estate investment while maintaining exposure to physical asset performance. "Real estate asset tokenization can allow institutional investors to create custom portfolios with tokens that match their investment thesis." by Deloitte. Institutional Validation Accelerates Market Maturity The entrance of institutional capital providers signals market maturity. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has publicly identified tokenization as a key strategic direction, noting that private markets and digital assets are becoming entry points for new investor demographics. JPMorgan and Citi have similarly launched tokenization initiatives, integrating these instruments into their platforms. Market projections indicate compound annual growth rates (CAGR) of 20-27% or higher for the tokenized asset sector, driven by: Addressing Risk and Regulatory Considerations Binaryx acknowledges the evolving regulatory landscape, noting that tokenized real estate often falls under securities regulations with jurisdiction-specific requirements⁹. The platform addresses these considerations through: "Technology enables new possibilities, but proper governance, transparent operations, and regulatory compliance remain essential," Oleg Kurchenko, CEO at Binaryx noted. "We've built infrastructure designed for long-term sustainability, not short-term hype." The Democratization of Real Estate Investment For investors, tokenization represents a hybrid instrument combining digital fractional ownership with real income potential — neither pure cryptocurrency speculation nor traditional real estate's capital intensity and illiquidity. "This is the democratization of finance we've discussed for years — actually happening," Oleg concluded. "Platforms like Binaryx prove this isn't theoretical. Properties are operational, income is flowing, and investors are participating in markets that would have been closed to them five years ago." About Binaryx Binaryx is a tokenized real estate investment platform enabling fractional ownership of international properties through blockchain technology. With 34 tokenized properties across Indonesia, Turkey, and Montenegro, Binaryx provides over 2,400 active investors access to real estate co-ownership with enhanced liquidity and reduced barriers to entry. Accessible via mobile app (iOS/Android) and web platform, Binaryx enables investors to browse properties, execute fractional investments, track rental income in real-time, and trade property shares with unprecedented ease and transparency. The platform utilizes DAO-LLC legal structures combined with blockchain tokenization to create accessible, transparent real estate investment opportunities for the global investor community.

Title: Solana Reclaims $140 As Second Wave Of SOL ETFs Debut – Is A Rebound Coming?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Amid the second wave of crypto-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Solana (SOL)-based investment products have been leading the charge, fueled by strong demand despite the recent market volatility. As a new group of investment products based on the altcoin hits the market and SOL’s price starts to recover, some suggest that a rebound could be underway. The second wave of Solana ETFs has arrived in the market after the successful launch of SOL-based investment products. On Monday, VanEck debuted its Solana ETF (VSOL) on Nasdaq, becoming the third investment product based on the altcoin to launch over the past month. According to the announcement, the firm is waiving its 0.30% fee on the first $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) or until February 17, 2026. Meanwhile, its third-party staking provider will also waive its fee for staking services under the same conditions. Adding to the momentum, Fidelity and Canary Capital launched their FSOL and SOLC ETFs on Tuesday, after recently filing 8-A forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that Fidelity is “easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out,” adding that it is “Game on” with the other launches. Meanwhile, Nate Geraci also highlighted the new launch, but expressed surprise that BlackRock is “sitting this one out” as many anticipate a successful performance. Notably, Bitwise and Grayscale debuted their BSOL and GSOL ETFs at the end of October, registering a record-breaking performance since their launch. Farside Invest data shows that SOL-based investment products have recorded over $390 million in inflows, with 15 consecutive trading days of positive net flows, signaling strong institutional demand for the products. In a Tuesday X post, Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley, noted BSOL’s positive performance despite the market correction, affirming that “prices are in the eye of the beholder.” “ETF investors continue to buy the dip. Grateful for the trust in Bitwise to steward investor assets,” he added. Amid the Tuesday launches, SOL’s price bounced 8.4% from its five-month low of $128, recorded on Monday. The cryptocurrency has declined 12% over the past month, losing crucial levels during the market correction. However, Bybit recently suggested that the newly launched investment products could reshape “its price trajectory and market structure for years to come.” In a recent report, the crypto exchange’s analysts noted that the altcoin joined Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as one of the few digital assets with regulated brokerage access in the US. This “represents a structural shift in how SOL is accessed, traded and perceived,” significantly expanding SOL’s investor base and confidence. “If historical patterns hold, Solana could be on the cusp of a multi-quarter rally that redefines its position in the crypto hierarchy,” the exchange affirmed. Analyst Ted Pillows pointed out SOL’s price action, calling it “one of the worst-performing large caps recently.” However, he argued that, because of this, most of its downside liquidity has already been taken out, with “decent liquidity clusters around the $170-$200 level.” To analysts, if the market starts to recover and stabilizes, Solana could rally 20%-40% to retest this area. Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades affirmed that SOL is “putting in quite the reversal relative to its BTC pair,” as the cryptocurrency has broken out of a three-week downtrend against Bitcoin after some failed attempts. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $141, a 25.3% decline in the monthly timeframe. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years.

Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation.

Title: Bitcoin Builds Strength for $120K, but Zero Knowledge Proof Becomes the New 100x Presale Everyone’s Rushing Into

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. The cryptocurrency market is entering a defining moment. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to assert its dominance, supported by institutional accumulation and global ETF adoption. At the same time, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is drawing extraordinary attention as its whitelist is now live, introducing a privacy-first vision that could redefine blockchain infrastructure. Together, these two assets, one proven, one emerging, are shaping the narrative of 2025: stability and innovation. Bitcoin represents crypto’s established store of value; ZKP represents the new frontier of private computation and verifiable AI. BTC and ZKP sit on opposite ends of the maturity spectrum but share a common thread, sustained demand driven by utility and institutional interest. Bitcoin’s price performance in late 2025 reflects strong resilience. With macroeconomic uncertainty, fiat inflation, and record ETF inflows, BTC has reclaimed a leading position in risk markets. Analysts cite that Bitcoin is forming a base around $65,000–$70,000, with resistance near $74,000–$80,000, setting the stage for the next potential leg higher. Institutional interest remains the cornerstone of Bitcoin’s growth. Major entities, from BlackRock to Fidelity, have increased exposure through spot ETFs, driving demand that continually absorbs available supply. The 2024 halving has also compressed issuance, reducing daily mining output and pushing BTC closer to a structural supply crunch. Historically, each halving cycle has seen exponential returns within 12–18 months, and analysts at multiple research houses suggest that the Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 could realistically target $100,000–$120,000 if demand continues to rise and ETF participation deepens. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s 200-day moving average remains upward-sloping, a hallmark of bullish continuation. In the near term, BTC may face consolidation between $65,000–$75,000, but the macro structure favors expansion. A decisive breakout above $80,000 could trigger a new cycle phase, with momentum pushing toward six-figure territory. On the downside, the $58,000–$60,000 zone acts as major support, underpinned by whale accumulation and long-term holder conviction. Even in corrective phases, the structural supply scarcity and institutional demand floor keep downside risk relatively constrained. While Bitcoin dominates headlines for institutional adoption, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is defining the next-generation narrative, privacy, AI, and decentralized computation. The ZKP whitelist is live now, and early engagement has been explosive, surpassing 200,000 registrations within the first 24 hours. ZKP’s framework revolves around zero-knowledge cryptography, enabling transactions and computations to be verified without exposing sensitive information. This architecture promises to bridge blockchain, artificial intelligence, and real-world data in a privacy-compliant manner, a theme increasingly sought after by enterprises and regulators alike. What makes ZKP exceptional is its foundation. The project was built with over $100 million in pre-launch, long before a single token was sold. It introduces an Initial Coin Auction (ICA) model, a fair and transparent alternative to conventional presales. Participants contribute daily and receive proportional allocations, ensuring inclusivity and eliminating insider advantages. This combination of real infrastructure, cryptographic rigor, and fair-access mechanics is why analysts are already calling Zero Knowledge Proof the next 100x crypto. The upcoming months could see ZKP become one of the best cryptos for 2025, as privacy and AI narratives converge into mainstream adoption. Analysts believe ZKP’s mix of real infrastructure, transparent tokenomics, and cryptographic innovation could make it the next viral blockchain trend, just as DeFi and layer-2s were in previous cycles. With its whitelist already oversubscribed, ZKP stands out as the most anticipated project in the emerging proof-based AI economy, where privacy and computation integrity become the ultimate currency of trust. Bitcoin and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) symbolize two complementary sides of the crypto revolution. Bitcoin is digital gold, a scarce, decentralized monetary asset recognized globally. ZKP, on the other hand, is a digital infrastructure, a system designed to preserve privacy while powering decentralized computation and AI verification. The combination of the two represents diversification between maturity and innovation. Bitcoin offers long-term store-of-value strength; ZKP provides high-growth exposure to next-gen blockchain technologies. While Bitcoin’s upside may appear steady and predictable, ZKP’s potential lies in early positioning. As its whitelist remains open, early contributors are effectively gaining front-row access to a project that could define how blockchains interact with AI, compliance, and confidential data in the years ahead. Together, they reflect where crypto is heading: one asset securing wealth, the other securing data. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 remains structurally bullish. With ETF inflows, halving-driven scarcity, and growing corporate adoption, BTC’s path toward $100,000–$120,000 appears plausible over the next year. Macro conditions, especially declining interest rates or renewed fiat devaluation, could serve as major accelerators. Simultaneously, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is positioning itself, fueled by its open whitelist, $100M infrastructure foundation, and a vision of verifiable, privacy-preserving computation. As ZKP prepares to go viral, it encapsulates the forward edge of blockchain evolution, one where privacy, proof, and AI converge into the next trillion-dollar narrative. Pairing Bitcoin’s resilience with ZKP’s innovation could represent the ultimate dual strategy: exposure to both proven value and the next major leap in blockchain utility.

Title: Prime Blackrock site zoned for residential development guiding €6m

Agent Vincent Finnegan is offering a high-profile residential site in the south Dublin suburb of Blackrock for sale by tender at a guide price of €6 million. Located on Newtownpark Avenue and just 50m from the N11 quality bus corridor, the subject property, which extends to 0.65 hectares (1.6 acres), comprises two houses – Selandia and the Paddock – and an afterschool centre known as the Willow House Afterschool. The subject site is zoned Objective A under the terms of the Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council Development Plan 2022-2028. This objective supports residential development and residential amenities. A comprehensive planning appraisal of the site has been prepared by Hughes Planning and Development Consultants, and this provides specific advice on the prospect of securing planning permission for residential development, with an emphasis on apartment development. The report notes that a density of “up to 250 dwellings per hectare (162 units) could be considered where it [a planning proposal] meets the outlined development standards and safeguards the residential amenity of neighbouring properties”. It adds that “precedents in the area suggest a density closer to 165 dwellings per hectare (107 units) may be more in keeping with the established context”. The report further notes that the development plan “expresses a preference for retrofit and reuse [of existing properties] in the first instance”. It adds, however, that “there is a planning gain associated with increasing residential density on this site, and this would form a key part of the justification for demolition” notwithstanding the council’s focus on climate action. Any proposal for demolition would need to be robustly justified from an engineering, energy and planning perspective, the report concludes. The subject site is for sale by tender with the final date for receipt of tenders set for Friday, January 30th, 2026.

Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee says Ethereum is nearing a cyclical low, arguing that on-chain fundamentals and relative valuation versus Bitcoin indicate that ETH is “pretty close to bottoming this week.” “Personally, I think that we’re pretty close to bottoming this week,” Lee told CNBC, linking the current drawdown to a broader crypto correction that began after a sharp liquidation event on October 10. Despite that shock, he insisted that Ethereum’s core investment story remains intact. For Lee, that story centers on Ethereum as neutral infrastructure for tokenization and stablecoins, increasingly relevant as Wall Street intensifies its on-chain ambitions. “There are stablecoin creations. Larry Fink and BlackRock and Wall Street want to tokenize assets, bring stocks, bonds, real estate onto the blockchain. And they have to find a neutral 100% uptime blockchain. That’s Ethereum. And that’s the fundamental story,” he said. Lee framed crypto’s extreme volatility as structurally tied to how the market values long-term innovation rather than as a sign of fundamental weakness. “The price, of course, for Ethereum will fluctuate because crypto is hyper volatile. In fact, it’s kind of a… it’s sort of a feature of the blockchain itself,” he noted. “Crypto suffered from that liquidation event on October 10th, but because the fundamental story is intact and crypto discounts the future, that’s why it’s volatile, but it still looks pretty attractive here.” He placed the current move in the context of a broader risk-off environment and a continuing correction across digital assets. According to Lee, macro data remains a crucial driver of crypto cycles, particularly for Bitcoin. “The most correlated factor to Bitcoin prices when you see it… at a peak actually is the ISM,” he said, referring to US activity surveys. “So I think we’re still in a correction phase of crypto.” Asked specifically what underpins his bullish view on Ethereum now, Lee pointed to two structural “floor” mechanisms. First, he cited the value of assets locked on the Ethereum blockchain. “Ethereum kind of has several ways that it establishes a floor. One is the value of all the assets locked onto the blockchain, and that number is growing,” he said. “Historically, Ethereum bottoms when that ratio is about 50%. So I’d say we’re pretty close to that level. That’s why I think Ethereum is probably bottoming this week.” Second, he highlighted Ethereum’s valuation relative to Bitcoin, using both price and network value. “The other way to look at Ethereum is really its price ratio or even its network value ratio to Bitcoin. It currently sits at 0.032,” Lee said. “The long-term average, like the eight-year average, if we were just to trade to that eight-year average, would put Ethereum at around $12,000.” On that basis, Lee characterized Ethereum as undervalued versus its historical relationship with Bitcoin. “So I think Ethereum is undervalued because number one, the story is gaining relative to Bitcoin this year. But two, we’re getting this sort of intrinsic floor because of the value that the assets locked onto the Ethereum blockchain,” he argued. Summarizing Lee’s stance, the CNBC host concluded: “Tom Lee saying that Ethereum is bottoming this week.” Lee did not offer a specific price target or an exact day, but his message was clear: in his view, Ethereum is close to completing its correction as on-chain value and relative valuation metrics converge toward levels that have historically marked major bottoms. At press time, ETH traded at $3,018. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Title: Wondering Why The XRP Price Is Still Lagging Despite Record ETF Launch? Read This

The debut of Canary Capital’s spot-XRP ETF was one of the standout moments for the XRP community this year, bringing the token into the US ETF arena with strong opening volume and heavy attention from traders. Many holders went into launch week expecting that kind of headline event to push XRP into a sharp rally, especially after waiting years for regulated access in the United States. Instead, price action has stayed relatively muted, leaving a gap between expectations and reality. In a new 26-minute video shared on X, finance coach Coach JV tried to close that gap, breaking down why XRP has not exploded higher yet and what he believes holders should actually focus on. XRP’s Spot ETF has undoubtedly been a success, considering the amount of inflows it has had in its first two trading days. However, this has yet to translate into a surge in the price of XRP, as many traders had predicted and expected. Instead, XRP’s price action has been highlighted by a downtrend in recent days. A large part of this price downtrend is due to the wider decline in the crypto market. In his breakdown, Coach JV approached the XRP situation from a macroeconomic perspective. Rather than treating the ETF launch as an isolated trigger, he contextualized XRP’s current price behavior within the larger environment that financial markets are dealing with. A major theme of his outlook was the way people respond to hype. Coach JV stated plainly that the only way is to have discipline and a consistent plan. He did not build his message around chasing short-term excitement or reacting emotionally to price moves. His focus was on having a structure that an individual can stick to, regardless of whether XRP moves fast after the ETF launch or takes longer than many were expecting. Coach JV also addressed one of the most common questions circulating in the community: whether $5 is the next big target for XRP now that an ETF is live. “Is $5 next? I don’t know; I’m not banking on that, I’m not waiting for it, I believe it’s going to happen at some point, and I have my exit strategy set up,” he said. That tone is now being echoed by others in the community who are pushing back against unrealistic targets. Zach Rector recently reminded his audience that XRP is not heading toward triple-digit prices this year, despite widespread speculation. Another commentator, known as Xoom on X, made a similar remark, saying XRP will not reach $100 or even $10 on ETF momentum alone. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.18, down by 3.5% in the past 24 hours. It is still too early to conclude how much long-term influence Spot XRP ETFs will have on price, especially with major issuers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale yet to launch their own offerings.

Title: Why Adam Backs thinks Bitcoin’s 20-year quantum runway matters more than today’s headlines

Bitcoin faces "probably not" any vulnerability to a cryptographically relevant quantum computer for roughly 20 to 40 years. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. For years, quantum computing has served as cryptocurrency’s favorite doomsday scenario, a distant but existential threat that periodically resurfaces whenever a lab announces a qubit milestone. The narrative follows a predictable arc where researchers achieve some incremental breakthrough, social media erupts with “Bitcoin is dead” predictions, and the news cycle moves on. But Adam Back’s November 15 remarks on X cut through that noise with something the discourse desperately lacks: a timeline grounded in physics rather than panic. Back, the Blockstream CEO, whose Hashcash proof-of-work system predates Bitcoin itself, responded to a question about accelerating quantum research with a blunt assessment. Bitcoin faces “probably not” any vulnerability to a cryptographically relevant quantum computer for roughly 20 to 40 years. More importantly, he stressed that Bitcoin doesn’t have to wait passively for that day. NIST has already standardized quantum-secure signature schemes, such as SLH-DSA, and Bitcoin can adopt these tools through soft-fork upgrades long before any quantum machine poses a genuine threat. His comment reframes quantum risk from an unsolvable catastrophe into a solvable engineering problem with a multi-decade runway. That distinction matters because Bitcoin’s actual vulnerability isn’t where most people think, as the threat doesn’t come from SHA-256, the hash function that secures the mining process. It comes from ECDSA and Schnorr signatures on the secp256k1 elliptic curve, the cryptography that proves ownership. A quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could solve the discrete logarithm problem on secp256k1, deriving a private key from a public key and invalidating the entire ownership model. In pure mathematics, Shor’s algorithm renders elliptic curve cryptography obsolete. But mathematics and engineering exist in different universes. Breaking a 256-bit elliptic curve requires somewhere between 1,600 and 2,500 logical, error-corrected qubits. Each logical qubit demands thousands of physical qubits to maintain coherence and correct errors. One analysis, based on the work of Martin Roetteler and three other researchers, calculates that breaking a 256-bit EC key within the narrow time window relevant to a Bitcoin transaction would require approximately 317 million physical qubits under realistic error rates. It is essential to consider where quantum hardware actually stands. Caltech’s neutral-atom system operates around 6,100 physical qubits, but these are noisy and lack error correction. More mature gate-based systems from Quantinuum and IBM operate in the tens to low hundreds of logical-quality qubits. The gap between current capability and cryptographic relevance spans several orders of magnitude, not a small incremental step, but a chasm that requires fundamental breakthroughs in qubit quality, error correction, and scalability. NIST’s own post-quantum cryptography explainer states this plainly: no cryptographically relevant quantum computer exists today, and expert estimates for its arrival vary so widely that some specialists think “less than 10 years” remains a possibility. In contrast, others place it firmly past 2040. The median view clusters around the mid-to-late 2030s, making Back’s 20-to-40-year window conservative rather than reckless. Back’s “Bitcoin can add over time” comment points toward concrete proposals already circulating among developers. BIP-360, titled “Pay to Quantum Resistant Hash,” defines new output types where spending conditions include both classical signatures and post-quantum signatures. A single UTXO becomes spendable under either scheme, allowing for a gradual migration rather than a hard cutoff. Jameson Lopp and other developers have built on BIP-360 with a multi-year migration plan. First, add PQ-capable address types via soft fork. Then gradually encourage or subsidize moving coins from vulnerable outputs into PQ-protected ones, reserving some block space each block specifically for these “rescue” moves. Academic work dating back to 2017 has already recommended similar transitions. A 2025 preprint from Robert Campbell proposes hybrid post-quantum signatures, where transactions carry both ECDSA and PQ signatures during an extended transition period. The user-side picture reveals why this matters. Roughly 25% of all Bitcoin, between four and six million BTC, sits in address types where public keys are already exposed on-chain. Early pay-to-public-key outputs from Bitcoin’s first years, reused P2PKH addresses, and some Taproot outputs all fall into this category. These coins become immediate targets once Shor on secp256k1 becomes practical. Modern best practice already provides substantial protection. Users who employ fresh P2PKH, SegWit, or Taproot addresses without reusing them benefit from a critical timing advantage. For these outputs, the public key remains hidden behind a hash until the first spend, compressing the attacker’s window to run Shor within the mempool confirmation period, measured in minutes rather than years. The migration job isn’t starting from scratch, it’s building upon existing good practices and transitioning legacy coins into safer structures. Back’s mention of SLH-DSA wasn’t casual name-dropping. In August 2024, NIST finalized the first wave of post-quantum standards: FIPS 203 ML-KEM for key encapsulation, FIPS 204 ML-DSA for lattice-based digital signatures, and FIPS 205 SLH-DSA for stateless hash-based digital signatures. NIST also standardized XMSS and LMS as stateful hash-based schemes, with the lattice-based Falcon scheme in the pipeline. Bitcoin developers now have a menu of NIST-approved algorithms, along with reference implementations and libraries. Bitcoin-focused implementations already support BIP-360, indicating that the post-quantum toolbox exists and continues to mature. The protocol doesn’t need to invent brand-new mathematics, it can adopt established standards that have undergone years of cryptanalysis. That doesn’t mean implementation comes without challenges. A 2025 paper examining SLH-DSA found susceptibility to Rowhammer-style fault attacks, emphasizing that while security rests on ordinary hash functions, implementations still require hardening. Post-quantum signatures also consume more resources than their classical counterparts, raising questions about transaction sizes and the economics of fees. But these represent engineering problems with known parameters, not unsolved mathematical mysteries. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) amended its prospectus in May 2025 to include extensive disclosures about quantum computing risk, warning that a sufficiently advanced quantum computer could compromise Bitcoin’s cryptography. Analysts immediately recognized this as standard risk-factor disclosure, boilerplate language alongside generic technology and regulatory risks, rather than a signal that BlackRock expects imminent quantum attacks. The near-term threat is investor sentiment, rather than the technology of quantum computing itself. A 2025 SSRN study found that news related to quantum computing triggers some rotation into explicitly quantum-resistant coins. Still, conventional cryptocurrencies exhibit only modest negative returns and volume spikes around such news, rather than structural repricing. When examining what actually drove Bitcoin’s movement throughout 2024 and 2025, going through ETF flows, macroeconomic data, regulation, and liquidity cycles, quantum computing rarely appears as a proximate cause. CPI prints, ETF outflow days, and regulatory shocks drive price action, while quantum computing generates headlines. Even articles sounding the loudest alarms about “25% of Bitcoin at risk” frame the threat as years away while emphasizing the need to start upgrading now. The framing consistently lands on “governance and engineering problem” rather than “sell immediately.” Bitcoin’s quantum story isn’t really about whether a cryptographically relevant quantum computer arrives in 2035 or 2045. It’s about whether the protocol’s governance can coordinate upgrades before that date becomes relevant. Every serious analysis converges on the same conclusion that the time to prepare is now, precisely because migration takes a decade, not because the threat is imminent. The question that will determine Bitcoin’s quantum resilience is whether developers can build consensus around BIP-360 or similar proposals, whether the community can incentivize migration of legacy coins without fracturing, and whether communication can stay grounded enough to prevent panic from outrunning physics. In 2025, quantum computing poses a governance challenge that necessitates a 10- to 20-year roadmap, rather than a catalyst that will dictate this cycle’s price action. Physics advances slowly, and a roadmap is visible. Bitcoin’s role is to adopt PQ-ready tools well before the hardware arrives, and to do so without the governance gridlock that can turn a solvable problem into a self-inflicted crisis.

Title: Bitcoin recovery expected as liquidity conditions change, but US macro remains a threat

Time Published: 2025-11-18T23:00:00Z

Bitcoin’s recent weakness reflects broader economic stress, but improving liquidity and investors’ positive outlook for 2026 could set the stage for a strong rebound. Key takeaways: Federal Reserve balance-sheet limits and possible repo operations point to improving liquidity conditions that could boost Bitcoin and other risk assets. Fiscal strain and sector weakness currently weigh on markets, but easing tariffs and a targeted stimulus plan may support a recovery in crypto demand. Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market could remain under pressure ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Dec. 10. Expectations for the direction of monetary policy remain highly split, with concerns over inflation clashing against signs of slowing economic activity. Traders are divided between a 0.25% cut and keeping rates steady at 4%, based on implied odds on government bond markets. The more cautious Fed members argue that US President Donald Trump’s tariffs have added inflation pressure, reducing the room to ease rates and support growth. At the same time, the US job market shows clear signs of cooling, according to reports from BlackRock. Concerns with sticky inflation have been regularly cited by Fed officials. “I worry that restrictive monetary policy is weighing on the economy, especially about how it is affecting lower-and middle-income consumers,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Monday. Waller dismissed rumors that the missing official data, resulting from the government shutdown, has hurt the Fed’s visibility. Still, blaming Bitcoin’s weakness only on the Fed seems inaccurate, given that the downtrend started in early October. US import tariffs helped narrow the monthly government deficit, and the Fed’s balance sheet continued to shrink, causing the US dollar to strengthen against a basket of major currencies. Historically, Bitcoin holds an inverse correlation to the dollar index (DXY). Pinpointing the exact trigger behind Bitcoin’s weakness since the Oct. 6 all-time high is nearly impossible. Financial conditions worsened as freight activity slowed, housing markets softened and companies faced tighter cash flows, according to a Savvy Wealth report. As a result, Bitcoin’s decline may stem more from broad risk aversion than from dollar strength alone. The Fed has signaled that it will no longer allow its assets under management to fall below the current $6.5 trillion, starting in December. This move could be offset by the launch of repurchase agreement (repo) operations. In practice, the Fed’s balance sheet stays unchanged while cash is injected into financial markets, easing liquidity concerns by adding reserves to banks. Meanwhile, Trump has directed US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to prepare a stimulus campaign aimed at lower-income households for early 2026, and import tariffs may be gradually reduced to lower inflation risks. Still, fiscal conditions worsen in 2026 as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act takes effect. By the start of the year, there should be far less uncertainty in the economic outlook, for better or worse. Currently, weaknesses are evident in the real estate and auto sectors, both of which are placing significant pressure on regional banks.
