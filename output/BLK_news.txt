Some elections are hard to fathom. Amid a wave migrant attacks, greenie energy devastation costing the country its global competitiveness, and a surge of populist conservative victories from political upstarts elsewhere -- in Italy, Netherlands, and other parts of Europe, as well as the U.S., El Salvador, and Argentina, Germany opted for the same-old stale conservatives who brought them to the state of where they are. According to NBC News: BERLIN — Germany woke Monday to the aftermath of a bruising election in which the center-right conservatives won the most votes and far-right nationalists surged to huge gains, causing dismay in a country deeply wary of its Nazi past. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is under surveillance by German intelligence over suspected far-right extremism, experienced its largest-ever share of the vote, garnering the support of Elon Musk and others in the Trump administration. Merz is very much a globalist: GERMANY - The Globalists win again. New chancellor Friedrich Merz is their perfect pick. âªï¸Ex Chairman of Blackrock Germany âªï¸Dedicated to deeper EU integration âªï¸member of the WEF’s Board of Trustees âªï¸ regular atendee WEF in Davos âªï¸attended Bilderberg Group meetings… pic.twitter.com/kkG3hPwTfw — Bernie (@Artemisfornow) February 24, 2025 Sure, they threw a nest of leftist vipers out, which I suppose is an improvement. The far-left SPD trashed Germany's energy production in the name of going green, mismanaged the country's economy, spent up a storm, left Germany a military weakling, and opened the country's borders to the absolute bottom of the barrel in illegal immigrants, enforcing no laws against them, which has led to a string of terror attacks and a sea of crimes. presumably, the CDU/CSU, led by the inexperienced and unfortunately named Friedrich Merz (can we call you 'Fred'?), will hopefully clean up at least some of that. And on the bright side, NBC News described the results as "causing dismay," forgetting that every election has a winner and a loser and one of them is going to be unhappy. But the upstart AfD should have won, not the stodgy CDU/CSU, if Germany were ride the world's populist trend. Call me impatient, but they should have won. They could have joined the Trump-like nations, brought back law and order, thrown the illegals out, ended green nonsense, and restored their nation's greatness. Their moment seemed to be now, but they didn't win. Sure, they made gains, but they didn't win. How many times have we heard this kind of story in Europe? Germany just held their election. They require photo ID and use paper ballots. They hand-count the votes of each station one by one. No electronic voting machines due to security concerns. 50 million votes. It was all done in 8 hours. pic.twitter.com/542MgrGVXX — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) February 24, 2025 Worse still, Merz has stated that he plans to form a coalition with the outgoing SPD leftists, the third-place finishers who took 18% of the vote, their worst result in decades, bypassing the AfD because he considers them basically Nazis, ignoring that Nazis carried 'socialism' right there in their name as well as game. That pretty well means the socialists will be calling the shots, given the experience we know here in the states of RINOs aligning with leftists. They all go leftist when that happens. The AfD will be completely shut out of power, much as France's upstart party led by Marine Le Pen got that number pulled on them a couple years earlier. For us, the Germans will probably be a pain in the keister, with Merz stating he will distance himself from the U.S. If that means Germany pays its NATO bills and adopts a responsible energy policy, we can salute them anyway. If that means Germany gets rid of its open immigration and at least repatriates criminals, even better. But more likely, they will just obstruct the U.S. in the name of consensus or what the U.N. wants, making themselves a drag on the alliance. Elon Musk, who loudly supported AfD, noted that it was young people, particularly in the battered east, who supported AfD in the greatest numbers, meaning, the picture isn't entirely bleak -- the young people will continue to build strength for this party as the older, more cautious, generation dies off. As Rich Baehr has noted, movements take time to build strength and compared to the last election, this was impressive. The layered building of this party is continuing, much as has been seen elsewhere, because up until now, they were nowhere on the map. If the momentum continues, they will eventually win. But oh, it's so disappointing to see that, as Thomas Lifson once told us, the Germans "just want to be nice people." That seems to be the dynamic here, and one can only hope that for Germany, it's not too late to change course and become the dynamic nation they ought to be.

Projects Images Products Folders AD Plus Benefits Archive Content Maps Audio Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) is a comprehensive urban planning strategy aimed at creating dense, walkable, and vibrant neighborhoods centered around public transportation hubs. By seamlessly integrating residential, commercial, and recreational facilities within close proximity to transit nodes, TODs seek to reduce automobile dependency, increase public transit ridership, and stimulate local economic development. Government agencies play a pivotal role in supporting these developments through zoning reforms, easing floor area ratios (FARs), selling air rights, and facilitating public-private partnerships to secure capital for public infrastructure. While TODs have gained global traction, East Asia boasts some of the most successful examples. Conversely, efforts to replicate these models in different contexts—such as New York City—highlight the importance of adapting TOD principles to local conditions, geographical characteristics, and community needs.

High population density ensures steady transit ridership and foot traffic for new developments, making significant investments in public transportation and related developments economically viable. The region's commitment to modern technology and continuous infrastructure upgrades contributes to reliable, efficient transit systems, further reinforcing public reliance. In cities like Hong Kong and Singapore, policies also actively discourage private car ownership: Hong Kong imposes automobile taxes for new vehicles typically exceeding 80%, while Singapore requires a Certificate of Entitlement (COE) that can surpass USD 70,000 just to own a car. These measures make public transportation the practical choice for the majority of residents.

Authorities often spearhead the planning and financing of these projects to ensure alignment with long-term urban strategies. Mixed-use developments—combining residential, retail, office, hotel, and recreational functions—are a common feature, fostering neighborhoods that remain active throughout the day and night. Climate considerations also play a vital role; given the region's frequent hot and humid weather, TODs are designed to offer comfortable, climate-controlled environments, sometimes at the cost of unsustainable practices such as large-scale continuous air-conditioning. Far from being just transit points, these hubs serve as essential community spaces where people gather, shop, and socialize, thus embedding themselves into the fabric of daily urban life.

Related Article Twenty Years of Transforming Transportation: Where Are We Now? The Case of Hong Kong: Transit as Both Infrastructure and Refuge Hong Kong's TOD model is globally renowned for its efficiency and seamless integration of transit infrastructure with commercial and residential spaces. Major transit nodes such as Admiralty, Hong Kong Station, and Kowloon Station have evolved into vibrant, multifunctional hubs that serve both commuters and local residents. Admiralty Station, which opened in 1982, exemplifies this approach. Originally established as a key interchange between multiple subway lines and bus routes, the development encompassed multitude of economic activities and services. It encompasses large-scale shopping malls, world-class hotels, modern office towers, and access to essential public facilities, including courthouses and parks. Admiralty's continual evolution has reinforced its status as a critical transit nexus; today, the area hosts over four luxury hotels, serviced apartments, high-end retail spaces, and extensive office complexes, including one built by Paul Rudolph as well as Zaha Hadid's latest addition, all interconnected with an ever-expanding subway network.

Beyond commercially driven TODs, Hong Kong also demonstrates the effectiveness of residential-focused developments strategically positioned near transit hubs. Tai Koo Shing, completed in 1985, is a notable example. Adjacent to its namesake subway station, the development comprises 61 residential towers with more than 12,500 apartment units. This close proximity to reliable public transportation has significantly enhanced property values and improved the overall quality of urban living for residents. The success of Tai Koo Shing underscores a core principle of Hong Kong's TOD strategy: fostering convenient, high-density living environments that prioritize accessibility, economic vitality, and long-term urban sustainability.

The success of Tai Koo Shing underscores a core principle of Hong Kong's TOD strategy: fostering convenient, high-density living environments that prioritize accessibility, economic vitality, and long-term urban sustainability. One of the defining features of Hong Kong's TODs is their active climatic control as a response to the city's weather conditions. With summer temperatures often exceeding 33°C (91°F) and humidity levels nearing 90%, air-conditioned transit hubs provide essential relief for commuters. These conditioned indoor spaces become informal extensions of public life, offering places to meet friends, relax, or simply escape the sweltering heat while waiting for a train. These hubs double as vital communal areas in a city with scarce outdoor public space.

These hubs double as vital communal areas in a city with scarce outdoor public space. Hong Kong's success with TOD is largely driven by the "Rail + Property" model pioneered by the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Corporation. By leveraging land development rights around transit stations, the MTR finances the expansion and upkeep of its rail network through co-developments or the sale of air rights for property projects. This approach ensures the functionality of TODs and fosters the creation of dense, mixed-use neighborhoods. The synergy between transit infrastructure and real estate development creates a sustainable, self-financing urban ecosystem where transit accessibility, commercial vitality, and residential convenience reinforce one another.

The Case of Japan: Connectivity, Convenience, and Community Japan's TODs are distinguished by their exceptional focus on connectivity and user convenience. Major transportation hubs such as Tokyo, Shinjuku, and Shibuya stations exemplify how transit nodes can evolve into vibrant, multifaceted urban centers. Tokyo Station, a key national gateway, successfully leveraged the sale of its air rights to neighboring developments, generating the capital necessary to fund an extensive rehabilitation and modernization project. This initiative revitalized its aging infrastructure while enhancing its role as a central transportation hub. Shinjuku Station—renowned as one of the world's busiest—attracted significant private investment through zoning incentives that allowed for increased floor area ratios (FAR). This policy enabled the integration of public amenities, cultural venues, and commercial enterprises within the station's complex, transforming it into a dynamic urban nexus. Meanwhile, Shibuya Station prioritizes pedestrian connectivity, employing multi-level walkways and carefully designed circulation routes to navigate its densely built surroundings, thus improving ease of movement for thousands of daily users.

Rail commuting is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, with many residents regularly traveling significant distances for work. For instance, the approximately 55-kilometer journey between Kyoto and Osaka takes a mere 25 minutes on conventional trains (not high-speed trains), making long-distance daily commutes both practical and common. This efficiency surpasses even that of other well-regarded transit systems like Hong Kong. Recognizing these commuting patterns, Japanese TODs are designed as comprehensive service hubs where commuters can shop, dine, and complete errands without deviating from their transit routes. These station complexes have become essential social spaces, frequently serving as meeting points for friends and family. The country's extensive high-speed rail network further reinforces this role. A trip from Tokyo to Hiroshima—spanning over 800 kilometers—takes just over four hours by train without the need for time-consuming security checks or prolonged boarding procedures. To put this in perspective, a similarly timed journey in the United States, such as the train ride from New York to Boston, covers less than half that distance at approximately only 350 kilometers. This stark contrast underscores Japan's exceptional integration of local and long-distance rail systems, positioning TODs as indispensable elements of the nation's urban and social fabric.

A Case Study in New York: When TOD Ambitions Meet Local Realities New York City's Hudson Yards project was envisioned as a flagship TOD, anchored by the extension of the No. 7 subway line. The development aimed to create a modern, mixed-use neighborhood featuring luxury residences, upscale retail, and expansive office spaces. While Hudson Yards has primarily succeeded in attracting major corporations such as BlackRock and Pfizer, other aspects have underperformed. Residential sales have lagged behind initial projections, and the high-end shopping mall—anchored initially by Neiman Marcus—has struggled with declining foot traffic, leading to the conversion of several retail spaces into office use.

Residential sales have lagged behind initial projections, and the high-end shopping mall—anchored initially by Neiman Marcus—has struggled with declining foot traffic, leading to the conversion of several retail spaces into office use. The shortcomings of Hudson Yards underscore the importance of contextual sensitivity in TOD planning. Unlike the integrated transit hubs of Hong Kong and Tokyo—where major TODs function as central nodes within a larger, interconnected network—Hudson Yards operates as the last stop of Manhattan's transit system. Despite being geographically central, its location on the west side lacks the seamless connectivity that characterizes successful TODs in East Asia. For example, in Hong Kong, the journey from the international airport to Kowloon Station takes less than 30 minutes, delivering passengers directly into a mixed-use district with offices, hotels, and residential towers above the transit hub. This convenience facilitates door-to-door international business travel and contributes to the area's vibrancy and commercial success. In contrast, Hudson Yards' comparatively limited transit connections and absence of efficient airport access hinder its appeal as a truly integrated transit destination.

The development's focus on luxury experiences has also narrowed its user base. Whereas East Asian TODs typically incorporate essential services, affordable retail, and accessible public spaces to attract a broad demographic, Hudson Yards emphasizes high-end retail and upscale dining, making it less relevant to everyday New Yorkers. This exclusivity undermines the broader community engagement that TODs strive to foster. Hudson Yards illustrates that the replication of TOD principles without careful adaptation to the local urban fabric, commuter habits, and socioeconomic diversity can limit a project's potential to become a positive, inclusive urban hub.

Context Matters: From Transit Nodes to Urban Ecosystems The success of TODs in Hong Kong and Japan demonstrates that effective transit-oriented developments do far more than simply erecting buildings near train stations. They seamlessly integrate transportation with residential, commercial, and social infrastructure while responding to local climate conditions, cultural commuting habits, and community needs. In contrast, Hudson Yards reveals how TODs have its flaws when architectural spectacle is prioritized over everyday functionality or when developments fail to embed themselves within existing urban systems and ridership patterns. Even in East Asia, TODs are not without shortcomings; mega-development proliferation risks displacing local communities and replacing rich urban fabric with homogenized retail environments and standardized residential towers. Such outcomes highlight the importance of balancing large-scale planning with sensitivity to existing neighborhoods and cultural heritage.

Transit-oriented development holds significant promise for fostering sustainable, vibrant cities but is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Each city's unique conditions—population density, governance structures, economic realities, and cultural expectations—must shape the design and implementation of TOD projects. TODs should be considered more than mere transit nodes; they should serve as integral parts of the urban ecosystem, enhancing quality of life, promoting inclusivity, and ensuring long-term resilience for diverse urban communities.

Title: An action plan for net-zero compatible with budget constraints

VLRS - stock.adobe.com When it comes to IT sustainability, the present economic uncertainty and political swings from diametrically opposite policies regarding climate change present a significant challenge to IT leaders. They require a technology roadmap to navigate these turbulent times robust enough to adapt to economic and political volatility. Sujata Kukreja, general counsel and chief compliance officer at network management platform Expereo, urges tech leaders to manage sustainability with innovation and take into consideration the running costs of inefficient datacentres. “We have to invest money and we are very conscious of datacentre energy consumption,” she says. Expereo therefore continues to prioritise emissions reduction, even if it’s costly. The procurement team increasingly seeks renewables-based arrangements. It’s about having a longer-term focus, especially with artificial intelligence (AI) tools coming in, says Kukreja. “But our investors are not going to continue if we’re not a business with purpose.” Another company that expects to continue to focus on emissions reduction and science-based targets despite economic pressures worsening in the past year is Crown Worldwide. Chris Davis-Pipe, chief information officer at the global logistics firm, commands a 70-strong enterprise IT team with 3,000 staff across business units in some 50 countries. “We’re working to get more visibility of the carbon we’re using and how to turn things off when we don’t want to use them,” says Davis-Pipe. “We stick solar on warehouses, we’re looking at using more renewable electricity, then we’re also moving from our own datacentres to more cloud-based services.” Customers increasingly demand information on emissions reduction, including a plan with science-based goals and demonstrable progress. Crown’s carbon-accounting platform has been calculating its carbon footprint, with 66% of estimated emissions accounted for by the end of 2023. It doesn’t plan to roll back the strategy, but it is buying more software and services off the shelf. In the past, it would have built its own. In-house IT skills have refocused on integration and data analytics, he says. Crown has also given countries and branches more leeway to improve IT environments locally – for instance, to achieve agility or efficiency within a governance framework. “We have core systems – main service delivery and financial systems – globally, but we’re much more open now for people to solve local issues locally,” Davis-Pipe explains. Automation and AI – beyond Copilot content in marketing – are also areas where the company is alert to future use cases that support the business and its net-zero goals, he says. Many firms may be in a similar position. Sarwar Khan, sustainability director at BT Group, reports that the company – and many of its partners and customers – are doubling down on net zero despite various pressures. “I sit in the business arm, with support for SMB [small and mid-sized business] customers, public sector, wholesale including channel partners. And the pressure to reduce [environmental] impact is not going away,” Khan confirms. “It’s a key priority.” While smaller businesses have “serious concerns” in terms of how they’re going to be sustainable and comply with net zero by 2050, they’re not backing off despite increasingly realising it’s an enormous task. Meanwhile, more specific key performance indicators (KPIs) on carbon, often revised quarterly, are appearing in the public sector. “SMBs are looking to big organisations, like us, to lead and support them,” says Khan. “In corporates, too, many are probably in that disillusionment phase, realising that they have to figure out how to operationalise it.” BT this year brought forward its annually reviewed net-zero target for the business to 2031, and for the customer and supply chain to 2041 – from 2050. How? “First, we looked at how we accelerate our plan on EV [electric vehicle] transition, as one of the largest fleet operators in the UK. Second, we looked closely at what we could reduce across our supply chain.” About 70% of BT emissions are Scope 3, so supply chain efficiencies are crucial. Tier 1 contracts are coming in for specific attention, he adds, and must have a science-based net-zero target against which they disclose performance. “If you don’t move the dial in that [Scope 3] space, getting to target is very difficult,” says Khan. BT is doing more advocacy – including alongside competitors – as well as looking at the make-up of its renewables certificates and power purchase agreements. Multiple innovations and efficiencies are crucial as datacentre power demand rises, Khan points out. Jon Healy, chief operating officer (COO) at datacentre solutions provider Keysource, reiterates that customers are shifting their net-zero strategies, including increasingly pushing suppliers to do more and reveal more rather than pulling back. Previously, some net-zero plans weren’t viable. “In our world, they’re not going to get more customers if they’re not addressing their own emissions. Of course, what’s difficult is to get there despite the pressures, including speed to market, constrained supply chains and demand for compute,” Healy maintains. “This has an impact right back to the drawing board, to strategic decision-making about where an organisation goes and which projects are fundamental.” Consequent designs have to underlie and underpin sustainability and carbon intensity, as well as support datacentre sector growth. Entire ecosystems are being evaluated. Upcoming infrastructure refreshes look likely to reap the benefits of currently evolving data, frameworks and metrics. “Companies must understand where their carbon emissions sit and what’s causing impacts or generating those emissions, and really pinpoint the detail to realise savings,” says Healy. Mary Jacques, director of global environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and regulatory compliance at Lenovo, agrees. It is continuing to focus on full carbon accounting, increasingly homing in on Scope 3 supplier emissions, partly in response to customer requirements across its portfolio. It’s not about taking your foot off the pedal temporarily in response to unfavourable economics, she says. With AI particularly, there’s demand to understand full impacts and help customers build up AI investments and infrastructure “in the right way”, Jacques adds. “These are long-term commitments by their nature,” she points out. “Ours, including the net-zero targets, remain the same.” Progress towards lower emissions continues under the surface of reports, commentators suggest. For example, bidirectional information flows between Lenovo, customers and suppliers are still developing, but ultimately, organisations will better quantify and reveal progress on emissions. Michael O’Hara, founder of not-for-profit support group Techies Go Green, is aware of economic pressures affecting organisational emissions reduction plans. That said, he believes what’s going on is more a readjustment of expectations and deflation of greenwash, even overhyped “green growth”. “It’s like in the 1990s – the internet was going to change how we did business, and there was huge investment, and then the dot com crash. But slowly, surely, the ‘enlightenment’ period happened, maybe 10 years later,” says O’Hara. “The sustainability hype kicked in after the 2016 Paris Agreement and Biden took office, and when BlackRock said they’d prioritise sustainability investments in 2020.” If he’s right, going green looks about halfway along. O’Hara says we can still see longer-term sustainability and profitability. Short-term thinking can be the enemy in business, as much as in politics with leaders only looking to their next election. “Among our members, there’s still positive sentiment, but there is a slowness in moving forward and putting in the investment. To be honest, a lot of [previous] net-zero goals have been too high,” O’Hara says. Over time, though, he expects emissions reduction to embed into company cultures, not least as data and transparency improve, with teams increasingly buying into the requirements. Until now, this has proven difficult in many companies, with sustainability sometimes tasked to the marketing person or receptionist, rather than someone with physical levers to pull. A lot of education and information communication still remains to be done as well. O’Hara points out that people are still joining Techies Go Green – it now has 650-plus members and targets 1,000. That suggests many still take emissions reduction seriously. Ben Brial, founder of green platform engineering company Cycloid, agrees there’s progress, especially on carbon accounting. Yet “short-cut” generative AI (GenAI) projects, such as China’s DeepSeek, should remind industry that alternative paths to innovation can exist beyond brute-force financial scaleup. “Prior to AI, many had this mindset about ‘we grow at any cost’. The goal was to go faster, regardless of resource use,” says Brial. But organisations can develop new, more economical, more sustainable methods and strategies, including in emissions reduction. “Cheaper is not new, but the idea of pushing to use less resources is kind of a new game-changer,” says Brial. “We can think our way to different solutions and ways of achieving our priorities, goals and objectives.”

Title: Who Is Friedrich Merz, Poised to Be Germany's Next Chancellor
URL: https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-friedrich-merz-poised-to-be-germanys-next-chancellor-7780312
Time Published: 2025-02-24T02:24:13Z
Full Content:
Friedrich Merz, a man who has never held a government role, is preparing to take the reins in Germany just as the country faces its biggest economic and diplomatic crises in decades and Europe looks urgently for a new generation of leaders for an era of transatlantic tension. Merz's conservatives came first in Germany's national election on Sunday, according to projected results, well ahead of their closest rival, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), giving him a mandate to form a coalition government. "Germany will once more be governed reliably," he told supporters on Sunday evening. The results spell an unlikely third-act triumph for the 69-year-old, who just seven years ago was seen as a failed politician fully reconciled to ending his career as a wealthy lobbyist and member of numerous company boards. A protege of the late Wolfgang Schaeuble, finance minister and icon of German fiscal conservatism, Merz enjoyed a meteoric rise through his Christian Democrats, becoming the party's parliamentary leader in the 2000s. Tall and with a sonorous voice, the arch-conservative Merz was a perfect figure for the party in 1989 - when he first won elected office for the European Parliament. Hailing from the Sauerland, a Catholic upland region in far western Germany known for its social conservatism and close-knit village communities, he embodied many of the virtues of West Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall - transatlanticist, business-oriented and socially conservative. However, reunification in 1990 allowed Angela Merkel, the East German daughter of a protestant pastor, to enter politics and elbow both Schaeuble and Merz aside on her rise to become chancellor. The east continues to be Merz's weak spot. A Forsa poll on Friday showed that unlike his Social Democrat and Green rivals, this distinctly Rhineland figure is still far less trusted in the east than the west. It is also the east that gave rise to the greatest challenge to Merz's authority in the guise of the far-right AfD, which took first place in one eastern regional election last year and could yet greatly constrain his ability to govern after the elections. Never the favourite of his party's professional advisers, Merz was twice rejected as Merkel's successor as party leader, in 2018 and 2021, before his doggedness won out in 2022. He took office pledging to kill off the nativist AfD by breaking with Merkel's centrism and moving the party rightwards. The AfD, on 10% when he took office, won some 20% in Sunday's election, according to projected results. "I want to do politics so that a party like the AfD is no longer needed in Germany," he told a congress of his conservatives in January, blaming the Social Democrat Scholz and his Green partners for creating the conditions that nurtured the AfD. In January, responding to two high-profile killings in which immigrants were the main suspects, he manoeuvred to get a resolution demanding a clampdown on migration through parliament, knowing that it would only pass with AfD support. Critics, even in his own ranks, saw this as an unforgivable breach of a political quarantine designed to keep the AfD out of power. For some, it was a case of Merz's strategic sense not matching the acute tactical skills that enabled him to repeatedly pin down Scholz, first with a 2022 visit to Kyiv that exposed the chancellor's hesitancy on supporting Ukraine, and then by getting a court to strike down a budget, setting in motion the chain of events that collapsed Scholz's government. The migration vote created a lingering sense of distrust, and fueled concerns that he may struggle to persuade other parties to govern with him, a necessity in Germany's proportional electoral system. "I don't want to suggest Merz plans (a coalition with the AfD), but I have to say my personal confidence that he won't do it after the election if that's his only way of becoming Chancellor - that's gone," said Ulf Buermeyer, host of the popular and influential podcast State of the Nation. Some internal critics grudgingly sense his Atlanticism, excellent spoken English and negotiating skills honed in the boardrooms in which he served during his political hiatus make him a good candidate for the Trump era. An early and outspoken backer of supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia, he has said he would under some circumstances send Kyiv the high-end Taurus missiles that Scholz has always blocked. On fiscal policy, his policies are equally ill-defined, but he has suggested he is open to reforming constitutionally-enshrined debt limits that doomed Scholz's government and have hampered attempts to boost military spending. For all that, he is in many ways an old-fashioned figure from the time before he left politics for a lucrative second career at Blackrock that made the hobby pilot wealthy enough to own an aeroplane. Parts of his policy agenda are reactive: he has pledged to scrap an unemployment benefit and easier citizenship rules introduced by Scholz's coalition, and to introduce tougher border controls. He once told an interviewer that he would leave politics if it ever placed his 40-year-marriage, to Charlotte, a judge, under strain. "For me that price would be too high," he said. If he takes office, he will be the first chancellor with children, and the first not previously divorced, since Helmut Kohl left office in 1998. He has been assiduous about building contacts with the European leaders who would be his peers, with some welcoming the prospect of an end to Scholz's divided and indecisive government. "Almost undiplomatic," was how one European diplomat described the enthusiasm with which Paris was awaiting Merz's arrival. Last weekend's Munich Security Conference saw him doing the rounds of European leaders and holding meetings with U.S. Vice-President JD Vance and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. But world leaders may have to wait: with polls showing a real chance of a parliament with as many as seven parties, Germany could be in for many months of fractious coalition talks before Merz walks into Berlin's riverside chancellery.

Title: GOP rep (PA) calls US-Ukraine resource deal ‘victim extortion’

Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) said Sunday that forcing Ukraine to agree to a resource deal with the U.S. in exchange for the possibility of support against Russia is akin to “victim extortion.” The moderate Republican said Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the invasion of Ukraine three years ago, should be the one forced to pay. “Putin, and Putin alone, should bear the economic costs of Putin’s illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,” Fitzpatrick said in a post on the social platform X. “To force Ukraine to pay these costs is the epitome of victim-blaming and victim extortion.” (Excerpt) Read more at thehill.com ...

Title: Ambulances, helicopters and medical advice: Behind the scenes at one of Ireland's 999 call centres

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. CHANCES ARE THAT if you’ve dialled 999 or 112, it has been a worrying time in your life. But for over 230 staff at the National Ambulance Service, your call was just one of around 1,000 emergencies that are processed at their command and control centres every day. The National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), where calls are taken, is split across two sites: one is based in Tallaght in Dublin; and a smaller site is based in Ballyshannon in Co Donegal. In Tallaght, Martha Loorem can see the Dublin Mountains from her desk as she answers the phone to people in need from a centre that’s five storeys up. “It can be very varied; you know it pretty much covers everything,” she tells The Journal when asked to describe her work. “It can range from somebody with a cough or a cold [who doesn’t] know where to go for help or [who doesn't] have a GP, right up to… very tragic, very traumatic cases, and everything in between really.” Although no two emergencies are the same, Loorem says that there are some common features in the calls – and common types of caller – that they get. Every call-taker follows a script and inputs the caller’s answers about the situation they’re ringing about in order to determine the seriousness of the incident. Call-takers work 12-hour shifts, some during the day and some at night, but everyone alternates on a shift pattern. “I like the mix, so I wouldn’t want to do either full-time; I actually like switching between the two,” Loorem says. “I think it just suits me, I don’t really think I have a body clock any more. I suppose in terms of why I chose the job, I wanted to do something that I thought I would find rewarding. “There are calls where people are very, very sick, and they’re genuinely panicked, and they really don’t know what to do or where they’ve just seen something tragic; they need that reassurance on the other end of the phone as well, not only that the help is coming, but [that they can be told] what to do.” “When you have those calls where you know you made a difference, that is quite rewarding, and it is quite satisfying to bring somebody from being panicked to quite panicked, and then the ambulance gets there, and paramedics take over.” Martha Loorem, an Emergency call-taker with the National Ambulance Service Alex Rowley Alex Rowley As The Journal walks through the control room, it feels surprisingly calm given the number of people in it and the work they’re doing. However, Duty Control Supervisor John Larkin assures us that things can get hectic during peak hours. “Everybody is trained as an emergency call taker,” he explains. “Technically, everyone is classed as an emergency medical controller… Generally, the journey is call taking, and then some will decide they want to take on dispatch.” There are rows of desks on either side of the room, with supervisors in a back corner who oversee everything. Screens hang from the ceiling which show how many call-takers are active across both call centres in Dublin and Donegal, as well as how many calls are coming in and the number of response vehicles that are in active use at a given time. At a dispatcher’s desk, Amy Curtis sends crews in the southwest of the country out to calls. She joined the NEOC after completing a PLC in the Pre-Paramedic Fire and Ambulance course at Blackrock Further Education Institute. Curtis spent two years as a call-taker before moving into her new role as an Emergency Medical Dispatcher just over six months ago. In her job as a dispatcher, she collates all the information received by call-takers and assigns an appropriate response vehicle and crew to the emergency. Dispatchers have to take into account a myriad of factors, including the severity of an emergency, vehicle availability, and the safety of the scene. “Dispatching is a lot more fast-paced than call-taking,” Curtis says. “I would call dispatching like putting pieces to a puzzle; you’re trying to figure things out for each case. Every crew member is your responsibility from the start of the shift until the end. “You need to know where all your crew members are and who is going where, because sometimes when the radio is going, and you are on your own at the desk, there could be six or seven radio transmissions, and you need to know what each crew is doing to be able to prioritise which crew you answer first.” Trainee dispatchers are mentored by a senior member of staff for 13 shifts before becoming fully qualified. This may seem like a relatively short schooling; however, Duty Control Supervisor John Larkin points out that although it is a particularly difficult job, NEOC staff are constantly receiving further education through the HSE’s learning and development programmes. Advertisement “It is an extremely challenging environment for the dispatchers because [they are dealing with] multiple calls, and are getting a lot of information thrown at them from the radio and the people around the desk. “It’s about assimilating that information and putting it in a logical order in terms of its priority, and figuring out what each piece of information does to your next decision.” Larkin explains that there are various layers to learning how to dispatch, but that the ultimate outcome is patient care. All staff are licensed by the academy, and there is mandatory continuous learning associated with re-certification every two years. In yet another corner of the room, there is a set-up that looks like a mini situation room: it contains a whiteboard with codes, call signs, and maps with a row of desks in front. This is where the aero-medical dispatch desk is located, and the team that sit there are responsible for coordinating helicopter responses to medical emergencies. In Ireland, there are two helicopters available to the National Ambulance Service. The Air Corps operates one air ambulance from the Custume Barracks in Athlone, which is staffed by military pilots, an Air Corps Emergency Medical Technician, and an advanced paramedic from the NAS. In Cork, the ambulance service contracts another, smaller helicopter based in Rathcoole. In addition, the Coast Guard has four rescue helicopters based in Shannon, Dublin, Waterford, and Sligo, which are on hand to assist the ambulance service if required. The Coast Guard can organise medical evacuations for critically ill patients to other countries, such as England. It’s also responsible for pre-planning and dispatching the Critical Care Retrieval Service (CCRS) – like an intensive care unit on wheels, enabling critically ill patients to be transported to a major hospital alongside a team of specialist doctors, nurses, and pre-hospital practitioners. The National Emergency Operations Centre in Tallaght Alex Rowley Alex Rowley Daragh Lettice is one of the members of that team, and explains how he co-ordinates air ambulances to 999 incidents anywhere in Ireland, liaises with the Irish Coast Guard for search and rescue missions, and works with emergency teams for mountain rescues. “We also look after repatriations with a wider HSE group, the Treatment Abroad service, [looking after] any injured parties on holidays or whatever the case may be, technically, for anywhere in the world,” he says. “The flip side of that is that if we have a patient going out of the country, we would arrange all the logistics again. That may involve ambulance transport or an air ambulance with the Irish Air Corps, or from a list of private suppliers that are contracted to the HSE. The team also carries out vital work helping children who are on organ transplant lists, called the ‘Priority 1′ service. In those cases, the team’s job is to keep children’s details – their addresses, next of kin, and passports – on file and up to date. If a call comes in for transport, there is a four-hour window from the time of the call to get a child to the hospital, whether that’s in the UK or elsewhere. “Our goal is always to get advanced life support to the scene of an incident that may warrant helicopter transfer.” Lettice explains. “We see it as a completed mission if we deploy the advanced paramedic to the scene, regardless of whether the patient flies to the hospital or goes by road”. But what is the work like day-to-day? Duty Control Supervisor John Larkin puts considerable emphasis on the working environment of the control room and the overall culture within NEOC. The aim is to ensure that each staff member can operate at the highest level every day. The control room is full of people with experience working in clinical settings and in different parts of the HSE, with whom younger colleagues can liaise if they’re faced with a problem. There are also strong support structures in place for anyone who wishes to avail of them, should they feel overwhelmed by a particular emergency. “What we are really after here culturally is an environment where people can perform to their maximum ability but also an environment that encourages escalation and cooperation, so that nobody is sitting at their desks wondering, ‘What will I do here?’,” Larkin says. “We are very open about it: if you have an issue, put your hand up, and we will fix it together. “If that is on the aeromedical desk, dispatch desk, or call-taking desk, it doesn’t matter. “If we know about it, we can put the remediation in, and that is the culture that we absolutely promote.” Sometimes, those tasked with responding to 999 emergency calls need help too.

Title: Who is Friedrich Merz? Meet the conservative leader taking the reins of the German chancellery
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/02/23/germany-election-who-friedrich-merz/79860012007/
Time Published: 2025-02-23T21:33:41Z
Full Content:
Friedrich Merz, a man who has never held a government role, is preparing to take the reins in Germany just as the country faces its biggest economic and diplomatic crises in decades and Europe looks urgently for a new generation of leaders for an era of transatlantic tension. Merz's conservatives came first in Germany's national election on Sunday, according to projected results, well ahead of their closest rival, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), giving him a mandate to form a coalition government. "Germany will once more be governed reliably," he told supporters on Sunday evening. The results spell an unlikely third-act triumph for the 69-year-old, who just seven years ago was seen as a failed politician fully reconciled to ending his career as a wealthy lobbyist and member of numerous company boards. A protégé of the late Wolfgang Schaeuble, finance minister and icon of German fiscal conservatism, Merz enjoyed a meteoric rise through his Christian Democrats, becoming the party's parliamentary leader in the 2000s. Tall and with a sonorous voice, the arch-conservative Merz was a perfect figure for the party in 1989 – when he first won elected office for the European Parliament. Hailing from the Sauerland, a Catholic upland region in far western Germany known for its social conservatism and close-knit village communities, he embodied many of the virtues of West Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall – transatlanticist, business-oriented and socially conservative. However, reunification in 1990 allowed Angela Merkel, the East German daughter of a protestant pastor, to enter politics and elbow both Schaeuble and Merz aside on her rise to become chancellor. The east continues to be Merz's weak spot. A Forsa poll on Friday showed that unlike his Social Democrat and Green rivals, this distinctly Rhineland figure is still far less trusted in the east than the west. It is also the east that gave rise to the greatest challenge to Merz's authority in the guise of the far-right AfD, which took first place in one eastern regional election last year and could yet greatly constrain his ability to govern after the elections. Never the favorite of his party's professional advisers, Merz was twice rejected as Merkel's successor as party leader, in 2018 and 2021, before his doggedness won out in 2022. He took office pledging to kill off the nativist AfD by breaking with Merkel's centrism and moving the party rightwards. The AfD, on 10% when he took office, won some 20% in Sunday's election, according to projected results. "I want to do politics so that a party like the AfD is no longer needed in Germany," he told a congress of his conservatives in January, blaming the Social Democrat Scholz and his Green partners for creating the conditions that nurtured the AfD. In January, responding to two high-profile killings in which immigrants were the main suspects, he manoeuvred to get a resolution demanding a clampdown on migration through parliament, knowing that it would only pass with AfD support. Critics, even in his own ranks, saw this as an unforgivable breach of a political quarantine designed to keep the AfD out of power. For some, it was a case of Merz's strategic sense not matching the acute tactical skills that enabled him to repeatedly pin down Scholz, first with a 2022 visit to Kyiv that exposed the chancellor's hesitancy on supporting Ukraine, and then by getting a court to strike down a budget, setting in motion the chain of events that collapsed Scholz's government. The migration vote created a lingering sense of distrust, and fueled concerns that he may struggle to persuade other parties to govern with him, a necessity in Germany's proportional electoral system. "I don't want to suggest Merz plans (a coalition with the AfD), but I have to say my personal confidence that he won't do it after the election if that's his only way of becoming Chancellor - that's gone," said Ulf Buermeyer, host of the popular and influential podcast State of the Nation. Some internal critics grudgingly sense his Atlanticism, excellent spoken English and negotiating skills honed in the boardrooms in which he served during his political hiatus make him a good candidate for the Trump era. An early and outspoken backer of supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia, he has said he would under some circumstances send Kyiv the high-end Taurus missiles that Scholz has always blocked. On fiscal policy, his policies are equally ill-defined, but he has suggested he is open to reforming constitutionally-enshrined debt limits that doomed Scholz's government and have hampered attempts to boost military spending. For all that, he is in many ways an old-fashioned figure from the time before he left politics for a lucrative second career at Blackrock that made the hobby pilot wealthy enough to own an aeroplane. Parts of his policy agenda are reactive: he has pledged to scrap an unemployment benefit and easier citizenship rules introduced by Scholz's coalition, and to introduce tougher border controls. He once told an interviewer that he would leave politics if it ever placed his 40-year-marriage, to Charlotte, a judge, under strain. "For me that price would be too high," he said. If he takes office, he will be the first chancellor with children, and the first not previously divorced, since Helmut Kohl left office in 1998. He has been assiduous about building contacts with the European leaders who would be his peers, with some welcoming the prospect of an end to Scholz's divided and indecisive government. "Almost undiplomatic," was how one European diplomat described the enthusiasm with which Paris was awaiting Merz's arrival. Last weekend's Munich Security Conference saw him doing the rounds of European leaders and holding meetings with U.S. Vice-President JD Vance and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. But world leaders may have to wait: with polls showing a real chance of a parliament with as many as seven parties, Germany could be in for many months of fractious coalition talks before Merz walks into Berlin's riverside chancellery.

After winning the German election, the conservative leader must navigate a new era without Washington as a close ally. This article is also available in: French BERLIN — Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany’s most American chancellor. Never in history has a German head of government had more affinity for the United States. Merz has traveled to the U.S. over 100 times, by his own tally, and counts former U.S. President Ronald Reagan as one of his role models. Merz, whose conservative alliance looks to have won Sunday’s national election with 29 percent of the vote, according to early official projections, is particularly fond of one Reagan quip that summarizes the German leader’s American-style skepticism of state intervention: “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’” But just as Merz is on the cusp of taking power in Germany, his cherished America has turned from indispensable friend to frenemy. Merz and other European mainstream leaders increasingly see the U.S. no longer a beacon — that “shining city upon a hill,” as Reagan liked to call it — but rather as another force joining Russia and China to steadily chip away at their ever-more brittle democracies. “This is really now the change of an era,” Merz said on stage at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month after U.S. Vice President JD Vance gave a speech that cast Europe’s centrist parties — not Russia or China — as the greatest threat to European security. “If we don’t hear the wake-up call now,” Merz added, “it might be too late for the entire European Union.” Vance’s appearance in Munich is likely to go down in European history as an epochal shift just as significant as Vladimir Putin’s 2007 speech at the same conference, when the Russian president effectively declared war on the U.S.-led liberal order. Now, it’s the U.S. administration itself that is turning its back on that consensus. German leaders, including Merz, have been especially slow to accept the new reality, declaring until recently that the transatlantic alliance will endure despite clear signals from the Trump administration that it will halt military aid for Ukraine, question the U.S. commitment to defend Europe, and bolster far-right, Kremlin-friendly forces. For Merz, an avowed transatlanticist, there could hardly be a ruder awakening. The question that will define his tenure will be whether he can lead Germany and Europe in defending the fraying liberal order without the U.S. — or whether, as Merz suggested in Munich, it’s already almost too late. This wasn’t how Merz had imagined his long-sought moment of victory. Born a decade after the end of World War II in Sauerland, a rural, mountainous region of West Germany, Merz was, by his own account, a less-than-spectacular student and an early smoker and drinker prone to disciplinary problems. Despite that rebellious streak, he was influenced by the deeply embedded conservative culture of the area and joined the center-right Christian Democratic Union while still in high school. After serving a brief stint in the military, Merz went to university in Bonn, then the capital of West Germany, where he studied law. Merz became a conservative member of the European Parliament in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. Five years later he was elected to the German Bundestag, where he developed a close relationship with Wolfgang Schäuble, the CDU stalwart and forceful advocate of European Union integration. Under Schäuble’s tutelage, Merz rose in stature and was considered a likely choice for chancellor candidate. His rise ended in 2002, however, when he lost a power struggle with the more centrist Angela Merkel. Note: Without rounding, BSW’s result stands at 4.972 percent; Source: ARD Seeing no role for himself in the CDU under Merkel, Merz withdrew to the back benches, and in the midst of the world financial crisis of 2008 published a paean to free markets titled “Dare for More Capitalism.” A year later he left the Bundestag to work as a corporate lawyer while also taking the helm of Atlantik-Brücke, a lobby advocating transatlantic ties. While with Atlantik-Brücke, Merz pushed for an EU-U.S. trade agreement — the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP — and forged closer connections with the U.S., networking with American politicians and corporate leaders. One of his favorite places in the U.S., he told biographer Volker Resing, is the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, where the former president is buried. Over a decade in the private sector, Merz sat on a series of corporate boards, including a four-year stint with U.S. asset manager BlackRock, a time he counts as among the happiest in his life, according to biographer Resing. Merz says this time provided him valuable experience outside of politics, but his critics accuse him of simply using his political connections to lobby for powerful interests, making himself a millionaire in the process. When Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018, Merz saw an opportunity to return to politics. Merkel’s centrism and generous refugee policies, Merz believed, had opened up the CDU’s right flank and allowed the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Merz set out to undo much of Merkel’s legacy and aimed to pull the CDU sharply to the right. The party, looking for reinvention after 16 years of Merkel and an election loss to Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 2021, elected him chairman in early 2022 on his third attempt for the job. “I am deeply moved,” Merz said after the vote, fighting back tears. Though Merz and his conservatives emerged victorious in Sunday’s election, surveys suggest he’s not particularly popular among the public. In a country that remains deeply skeptical of the financial industry, Merz’s wealth and time at BlackRock, the American investment company, are often viewed with suspicion. It doesn’t help matters that Merz routinely jets around the country in his own twin-engine plane, which he flies himself, having fulfilled a lifelong dream by getting his pilot’s license in his 50s. “Friedrich Merz is not really very beloved, but he is respected,” Günther Oettinger, a former senior CDU politician and European commissioner, told POLITICO late last year. Yet Merz also has a reputation for being impulsive, thin-skinned and prone to populist bluster, particularly when it comes to migration. His defenders say he’s merely a risk-taker — at trait he took from his years in the private sector — and someone who doesn’t shy away from sharp-tongued debate. Merz took one of his biggest gambles shortly before the election. After a series of high-profile attacks blamed on asylum-seekers in the months before the vote, Merz saw his conservatives steadily decline in the polls while the AfD rose. In January, after a knife-wielding Afghan man attacked a group of preschool children in a park in Bavaria, killing one child and a man who tried to protect the children, Merz decided it was time for a drastic shift. In a taboo-breaking move that weakened Germany’s postwar “firewall” around the far right, he and his conservatives aligned with the AfD in an attempt to get tough immigration measures through parliament — including a proposal to reject asylum-seekers at the border. In response to Merz’s acceptance of AfD support, tens of thousands of outraged demonstrators turned out in cities across the country. “Merz can no longer be trusted,” said Scholz, whose center-left SPD came third in Sunday’s election. Robert Habeck, the chancellor candidate for the Greens, called Merz’s move “a disqualification” for the office of chancellor. But voters, who were broadly supportive of his tough migration policies, ultimately disagreed, lifting Merz to power. German conservatives have long hoped that Merz’s tough border policies, business background and familiarity with the U.S. will endear him to Donald Trump. “Merz is one of the Germans who is best connected in the U.S.” said Thomas Silberhorn, a conservative lawmaker specializing in transatlantic ties. “In this respect, I am very confident. He also knows the way things work. He is used to the mindset that you have to speak plainly.” Merz has also vowed to make “deals” with Trump. In an interview last month he suggested Germany could endear itself to Trump by buying American F-35 fighter jets and boosting defense spending to put Germany consistently above the NATO spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product. Despite the U.S. president’s love of tariffs, Merz also floated trying to bring back negotiations on TTIP, which collapsed during the first Trump administration. Until recently, however, Merz’s approach for confronting the Trump administration consisted mainly of denying the enormity of the challenge. Just a day before Vance’s speech at the MSC, Atlantik-Brücke, the transatlantic lobby group Merz formerly headed, published one of his essays on the transatlantic relationship. “Our alliance with America has been, is and will remain of paramount importance for security, freedom and prosperity in Europe,” Merz wrote. With Trump, he went on, “transatlantic relations will change again and yet we will continue to share common values, interests and a common promise of protection within NATO.” A few days later, Merz’s tone changed drastically as he warned of a transatlantic rupture. “The differences between the U.S. and Europe are taking on a whole new quality,” he wrote in a note to his supporters after Vance’s speech. “Now it is no longer ‘just’ about defense; now it is about our basic understanding of democracy and an open society.” Merz compared the moment to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when, as he put it, “we woke up from our dreams and had to learn to understand that our world is no longer what it was supposed to be.” German and European leaders were even more alarmed when Trump, a few days later, blamed Ukraine — not the Kremlin — for starting the war and then called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator.” Following Trump’s statements, Merz warned supporters at a rally in the state of Hesse that the “autocratic behavior at the top of the state” in the U.S. could persist for a long time. “Our response can only be that we must finally become resilient, capable of defense, and able to stand on our own feet in Europe,” he added. In an interview the following day, Merz warned that Europe should prepare for Trump to end NATO protection and hinted at a major strategic shift, saying Germany needed to discuss the possibility of “nuclear sharing, or at least nuclear security” with European nuclear powers the United Kingdom and France. German conservatives have previously favored maintaining strong ties with the U.S. over calls from Paris to cultivate European “strategic autonomy.” Merz’s rhetorical shift showed just how unnerved he now is by the Trump administration. The question is whether Germany’s next chancellor will succeed in taking the EU — itself confronting the rise of Russia-friendly, far-right parties — in a fundamentally new direction. Merz has expressed a willingness to chart a new course, but the way forward remains murky. “Within this Europe, Germany must play a leading role,” Merz said at the rally in Hesse. “We must take on this responsibility. I, for one, am determined to do so.” Nette Nöstlinger and Rasmus Buchsteiner contributed to this report. Conservative leader’s gambit to weaken the postwar ‘firewall’ may be a boon for the AfD ahead of a national election. The AfD is using Elon Musk’s endorsement to reach out to Donald Trump — and to appear more acceptable at home ahead of a national election. The “chameleon” tech billionaire is one of the most powerful politically connected people in the world. Europe’s governments are still working out how to deal with being on his bad side. Dissolving of parliament sets the stage for what could be Germany’s sharpest swerve to the right in decades.

Title: Vitalik Buterin Reveals the Most Disappointing Moment for Ethereum
URL: https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-reveals-the-most-disappointing-moment-for-ethereum/
Time Published: 2025-02-23T15:58:02Z
Full Content:
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has voiced concerns over criticisms directed at Ethereum’s stance on blockchain-based gaming applications. During a Wednesday AMA session on the chat app Tako, Buterin addressed user Mable Jiang’s inquiry about moments in the past year that left him frustrated or disappointed with the Ethereum Foundation, its community, or the industry. Jiang also asked if he had ever considered taking a break. In response, Buterin expressed his disappointment, particularly over criticisms that Ethereum is “bad and intolerant” for not embracing blockchain-based casinos as openly as other networks. “Perhaps the most disappointing thing for me recently was when someone said that Ethereum is bad and intolerant because we don’t respect the ‘casinos’ on the blockchain enough, and other chains are happy to accept any application, so they are better.” He stated. Despite occasional online rants about the network, Buterin, however, noted he finds comfort in personal interactions with the Ethereum community, most of whom remain committed to the platform’s original values. “I have a responsibility to this community and cannot abandon them. We Ethereum need to work together to create the world we want to see,” he added. Buterin also suggested potential strategic shifts to enhance the network, emphasizing the need for structural improvements for the network and greater decentralization within the Ethereum Foundation. He noted that the foundation, which currently facing a backlash for lack of neutrality, might need to be less neutral at the application layer and take a more active role in supporting certain initiatives. “This will require some changes,” he stated, adding, “But this project is worth doing.” Notably, Buterin’s response comes amid an ongoing debate in the blockchain space about balancing ethical considerations with open access. Some networks, like Solana, have taken a more permissive approach, welcoming applications across various sectors, including gambling and speculative ventures. However, this openness has also led to high-profile failures, such as the collapse of LIBRA, a meme coin on the Solana network. Recently, LIBRA collapsed, wiping out $4.5 billion in investor funds and causing a 15% drop in Solana’s value. Ethereum, in contrast, has long positioned itself as a network focused on decentralization, innovation, and long-term sustainability. These qualities have attracted institutional interest, with entities like BlackRock launching tokenized investment funds on the Ethereum network. Meanwhile, beyond his frustrations, Buterin remains actively engaged in Ethereum’s evolution, particularly its scalability through Layer 2 (L2) solutions. In January, he reaffirmed Ethereum’s commitment to scaling via L2s, identifying key challenges such as insufficient space for BLOB objects and L2 heterogeneity. He detailed upcoming upgrades, such as the Pectra update, which aims to enhance Ethereum’s transaction throughput with long-term goals, including achieving 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). He also underscored the importance of Ethereum’s economic model, advocating for ETH to serve as a “triple point asset,” functioning as a means of exchange, a consumable product, and a store of value. To strengthen Ethereum’s economic position, he proposed incentivizing L2 projects, optimizing rollup revenue structures, and adjusting BLOB pricing strategies.

Title: Open-Access Networks Explained: A New Way to Get Internet

How we test ISPs Open-access networks bring fast fiber to cities across the US, but they don’t work like typical internet service providers. It may not be Santa and his sleigh, but trucks like these bring a present of another kind: the gift of fiber connectivity. Colorful painted symbols decorate the streets a few blocks from my Albuquerque, New Mexico, home. Bright arrows and checks mark hidden water and gas lines. Large trucks with boring machines and vast spools of orange pipe are parked along the sidewalks. They’re here to install fiber for Gigapower, an open-access network. When Gigapower arrives at my house, it won’t be my internet service provider. Gigapower represents a different fiber model. Here’s what home internet customers need to know about open-access networks. Chances are, your home is covered by one or more internet providers, each with its own infrastructure -- whether cable, fiber, DSL or 5G, like my T-Mobile Home Internet. Open-access networks flip this concept on its head. Locating local internet providers An open-access fiber network is installed by a company that then sells access to ISPs. That means you can have multiple providers offering plans for your house. They use the same infrastructure but may have different prices, services and bundles. Don’t be surprised if you haven’t heard about open-access networks before. “Open access is not mainstream,” says Gary Bolton, president and CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association. “It’s kind of an edge case in the US.” Locating local internet providers Bolton says the concept is more widespread in countries where regulations and government involvement mean open access is common. You’re about to hear more about open-access networks thanks to Gigapower’s ambitious plans to expand fiber into previously overlooked communities. “From an operator's perspective, it's a no-brainer because someone else bears the cost of building out the network,” says Bolton. You’ll find two types of open-access networks in the US. Municipally-owned networks are owned by cities. Private companies own commercial networks. They both work in a similar fashion, usually with multiple ISPs competing for customers. The Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency (Utopia Fiber) is a community-owned fiber network covering homes in 21 Utah cities, including Brigham City, Orem, Payson and Woodland Hills. The Utopia communities weren’t satisfied with existing home internet options. They wanted fast fiber. “If the incumbent operators aren't willing to make the investment, then the community takes it in their hands because they need it for economic development,” says Bolton. Gigapower is an example of a commercial open-access network. The company is a joint venture between telecommunications giant AT&T and investment company BlackRock. In Albuquerque, AT&T Fiber is signed on as an anchor tenant, but that still leaves room for other ISPs to potentially jump on board and compete to offer fiber internet to customers. When ISPs share the same network, they want to stand out from the crowd. That can translate into a complex dance of promotions, pricing and streaming or phone bundle options. Gigapower’s rollout is still young, so we have yet to see how this might play out in the longer term, but we can look to Utopia for clues. With the Utopia model, consumers cover two fees. One is the monthly price paid to the ISP and the other is the fiber connection cost for Utopia, which typically runs $30 monthly. Put the two together to get your total. For example, you could sign up for XMission’s 1Gbps plan for $54. Adding in the Utopia fee brings your monthly total to around $85. Bolton says that’s pretty typical for gigabit pricing on an open-access network. “You start seeing there's a lot of bundling going on,” Bolton says. “Providers typically try to find other things of value that they can add to sweeten the deal.” If you’re shopping among ISPs on an open-access network, look at promotions, bundles, add-ons and the provider’s customer service reputation. Scan the Utopia providers’ pricing and you won’t see huge swings at the 250Mbps, gigabit or 2.5Gbps plan levels. But there is one area where pricing varies widely. Not all ISPs offer 10Gbps plans, but those that do have prices ranging from $110 to $200 per month. That won’t likely affect very many customers. Here’s how to figure out how much internet speed you really need. Utopia and Gigapower are two big names in open-access networks, but others exist. Colorado Springs Utilities, for example, is building out with Ting Internet as its initial anchor tenant. Other communities scattered around the country -- including Ammon, Idaho and Ashland, Oregon -- have open-access networks as well. On the commercial side, Ubiquity is expanding with a focus on Arizona, California, Nebraska and Texas. SiFi Networks specializes in citywide open-access fiber with networks under construction in California, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and New York. Cities that feel passed over for fast fiber broadband will continue to consider open-access networks. Meanwhile, Gigapower’s rapid expansion could bring more commercial companies into the fold. “I think it’s a great model and I wouldn’t be surprised if other people took advantage of it,” says Bolton. While gigabit speeds are common across fiber networks, most can offer faster services to homes. Utopia, for example, goes up to 10Gbps with some ISPs. AT&T Fiber typically offers up to 5Gbps. The open-access networks going in across the country can be scaled up to handle the internet demands of the future. “This is the final network for at least the next couple of generations,” says Bolton. There’s a hunger for fiber. Albuquerque has been a cable and DSL town for too long. Gigapower isn’t the only fiber player in the city. Ezee Fiber, Vexus Fiber and Quantum Fiber are all staking out parts of town with traditional networks, but Gigapower is coming in hot. I’ll notice Gigapower when it shows up on my street to install the bright orange tubes to run fiber. After that, I likely won’t give it much thought. I’ll be dealing with AT&T Fiber as my ISP, and, perhaps someday, I’ll be comparing AT&T with a competitor using the same network. Ultimately, what’s most important to me as a customer isn’t how the fiber gets here, just that it gets here. If that means ISPs competing on pricing and bundles down the line, then all the better. An open-access network is installed and operated by a company that leases access to ISPs. That means multiple providers can offer plans to customers using the same fiber network. An open-access network is one way a community overlooked for fiber can access fast, symmetrical broadband services. If private companies aren’t willing to invest, cities can use a municipal model instead. On the commercial side, open access networks remove the burden of installation and operation from ISPs, which can then piggyback on the network to reach customers. Plus, customers may benefit from competition among ISPs looking to differentiate themselves through pricing, customer service, perks or bundles. Competition among ISPs on an open-access network can benefit consumers, but don’t expect cut-rate price wars. There may be slight contrasts in pricing but more significant differences in phone and video bundles or free add-ons like streaming services. Also, look for promotional deals, like one or two months of free service for new customers.

Title: The House of Cards of Russian Aggression Against Ukraine Collapses

The news from the New York Times is explosive: “U.S. Opposes Calling Russia Aggressor in G7 Declaration on Invasion”. U.S. opposition to a draft Group of 7 statement on the third anniversary of the Russian attack on Ukraine comes after President Trump blamed Kyiv for starting the war. Trump’s shift towards Putin’s Russia reverses generations of US policy. At the opening of the peace talks in Saudi Arabia, President Trump made it clear that Russia’s days of isolation are over and suggested that Ukraine is to blame for its invasion. Zelensky and Trump exchanged blows as the feud over the peace talks escalated. President Trump called Volodymyr Zelensky an ‘unelected dictator’ after the Ukrainian President said Trump was ‘in a web of disinformation’. “Europe,” writes the Wall Street Journal, “is looking for a response after Trump blamed Kyiv for the war in Ukraine. Stunned by the US rapprochement with Russia over Ukraine, European leaders are trying to find common ground.” . . . Screenshot from WSJ . Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni “reaffirmed Italy’s support for Ukraine”, but prudently did not go to Kyiv to the commemoration of the third anniversary of the war. Vice-President Matteo Salvini is explicitly siding with Trump, wishing that “he will absolutely go ahead”. The parliamentary left-wing declares through Fratoianni “nothing in common with Trump on Ukraine.” However, it is announced that in Kyiv “the EU will reaffirm Zelensky’s legitimacy as president of Ukraine.” Who Zelensky is and what his role is, we documented in Grandangolo of 11 August 2023. We, therefore, report the essential part of it: Scott Ritter’s investigative documentary showing the offshore companies set up by Zelensky and his associates in tax havens, through which “his puppeteers provided him with a financial cushion” with a first payment of 41 million dollars. The film shows the luxurious villas that Zelensky owns in Miami (this one alone is worth $34 million), in Israel, in Forte dei Marmi (Italy), in London, in Georgia, in Greece, and even in Crimea (the only bad investment, because Zelensky no longer owns it). Scott Ritter’s investigation also shows how Ukraine is being robbed of its most fertile land, sold off by Zelensky and Co. to multinational corporations. Still, it is also becoming increasingly indebted as the huge military supplies he receives from the US and the major European powers are not given away, but given on credit. This debt will increase with the ‘reconstruction‘ that Zelensky has put in the hands of BlackRock, the world’s largest investment company. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Exclusive — Nate Morris: America Has to Fight Back Against the Climate Change, 'ESG Mafia'

Kentucky businessman and potential Senate Republican candidate Nate Morris on Breitbart News Saturday said that America has to fight back against the environment, social, and governance (ESG) “mafia,” noting how large Wall Street firms push leftist policies on corporations. Morris spoke to Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle as he considers a potential run for Senate to replace the retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY). The Kentucky businessman, who founded a waste management company, said that the pressure he received to back ESG policies was like nothing else, noting that the waste management business often has mafia connections, citing the hit television show the Sopranos. “I’ve never seen extortion like what I saw with the ESG mafia and the thugs that try to push corporate America into doing things that satisfy a political agenda,” Morris said on Breitbart News Saturday. ESG was one of the major vectors by which Wall Street firms, namely asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, could push publicly listed companies to back leftist policies such as anti-climate change policies, diversity quotas, among others. Companies, facing a backlash, stopped employing these controversial policies. Morris then said he invested in Strive, a firm backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, that seeks to push anti-ESG policies, and challenge BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. “We got to fight the ESG mafia that has been coming against our corporate leaders as an extension of politics to satisfy the leftist agenda,” he remarked. Morris said that the country needs to expose “ESG for the scam it is.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.

It’s halftime at Twickenham and Scotland lead England 10-7. Thank you for your company today. Ireland win in Cardiff and all roads lead to a meeting with France at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday week. Man of the match Jamison Gibson-Park 🗣 "They're an unbelievable team, a proud nation, they showed that today."🗣 "It would be a dangerous thing to do to come over here with preconceived ideas."Player of the Match Jamison Gibson-Park after Ireland's battling win in Cardiff. #WALvIRE | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/Lgv9nrNqt5 MATCH REPORT: Gerry Thornley has his say. “The home side were, as expected, much improved; beyond recognition in truth. As was always liable to be the case, Matt Sherratt had injected enthusiasm, energy and no little cohesion in his first game in charge. Their set pieces were strong and with a much more balanced 9-10-12-13 combination their attack had variety, shape and width. Ireland’s initially confident and smooth start unravelled in large part through ill-discipline and especially scrum penalties. This was compounded by Garry Ringrose incurring a red card following a bunker review for his 35th-minute high hit on Ben Thomas, and Ireland were relieved and indebted to this being a 20-minute red card, not least as Bundee Aki was an ideal replacement.” You can read the full match report here Scotland lead England 10-7 at Twickenham after 24 minutes. James Lowe produced another brilliant performance. He’s what he had to say about a tough afternoon in Cardiff. One of Ireland's key men yet again this afternoon.Great to chat to James Lowe live from Cardiff.#WALvIRE | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/EM4moAonb0 PLAYER RATINGS: Johnny Watterson gives James Lowe, Jamison Gibson-Park and Jack Conan 8/10. You can read them here A fitting tribute Not sure Finlay Bealham, gets enough credit! Again If you like what you see, please like share and follow, cause I've f#%k all other reasons to do them! 🙏❤️#SixNations #WalvIre @IrishRugby #FinlayBealham #Rugby pic.twitter.com/4dyhpxFZf1 Easterby: “We’re pleased with the result. There’s lots of things we could have done better. I’m pleased with how we got ourselves out of a hole.” ⌚️ Sam Prendergast slotted the three points for Ireland against Wales to steer his side to a win and a Triple Crown in Cardiff 🙌#Breitling #DefiningMoment @Breitling pic.twitter.com/MvYnOUZPWh Watching the Andrew Porter incident again. No wrap from replacement tighthead prop Thomas his arm in tucked and even though it is chest to shoulder, it is not a legitimate attempt to tackle. Therefore should have been a yellow card. Johnny Watterson’s player ratings are going through the subbing machine and will be available here presently. Simon Easterby, calm and measured in victory. Acknowledged some of the shortcomings, gave credit to Wales, which they deserved and pointed to the fact that his tea showed character to see out a match that got sticky.

A stunning cross-field kick to James Lowe! Jamie Osborne is there to collect the ball and score!! #GuinnessW6N pic.twitter.com/5Eq7cq0Lz8 Johnny Watterson’s player ratings, lot of red pen you’d suspect, Gerry Thornley’s match report and all the reaction coming here. That’s a 14th Triple Crown for Ireland. MATCH SNYOPSIS: Ireland led 7-0, trailed 13-10 at half-time and 18-10 early in the second half, before Gibson-Park, Lowe and Osborne combined for the latter’s try and then Prendergast’s boot saw them home. Ringrose had a yellow card upgraded to a red card. Ireland win a Triple Crown. Performance was well below par, individually and collectively. To Ireland the spoils, including a Triple Crown but to Wales the plaudits in performance terms. Coming off a 14-match losing streak, that’s now gone to 15, and given very little hope but the home side was so courageous in defeat, playing some cracking attacking rugby to boot. Ireland will be relieved rather than happy. Finlay Bealham, Ryan Baird and Bundee Aki made a huge difference on their arrival. Full-time: Wales 18 Ireland 27 80 mins: Prendergast takes on long range penalty that drops short after Beirne won a ruck penalty. Wales with one last effort in chasing a bonus point. 77 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. Great counter-ruck from Ireland led by van der Flier supported by Gus McCarthy and Jack Boyle leads to a penalty. Henshaw and Baird with key tackles in the build-up. Prendergast is unerring. Gibson-Park announced as man of the match. No argument. Brilliant again. Conor Murray on at scrumhalf Wales 18 Ireland 27 75 mins: Gus McCarthy on for captain, Sheehan. Brilliant again from Osborne in tidying up. Wales 18 Ireland 24 72 mins: Brilliant response from Wales and Ellis Mee is deemed to have scored a try by referee Ridley. His on-field decision is try. Tempest the TMO is rocking and rolling the angle, I think his hand is in touch. 47 angles later. Knock-on. Hits short and it’s a knock-on. That’s unfortunate for Wales. Another superb passage of play in attack. Ireland are very, very lucky. Good work from Hansen, who’s now been replaced by Jack Crowley and Osborne. Boyle and Bealham win a scrum penalty. Crowley is on at fullback, Osborne moves to the wing. Wales 18 Ireland 24 Jack Boyle becomes the 12th St Michael’s College old boy to be capped at senior level by Ireland; 11 have been in the last decade. Michael’s capped players, year of debut and number of caps. 1984 - Derek McGrath (5) 2014 - Noel Reid (1) 2016 - Dan Leavy (11) *Luke McGrath (19) 2017 - Rory O’Loughlin (1) *James Ryan (70) 2018 - *Ross Byrne (22) 2020 - *Ronan Kelleher (39) *Max Deegan (2) 2021 - *Ryan Baird (25) *Harry Byrne (4) 2025 - *Jack Boyle (1) * - still active 69 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. A blood splattered Bundee Aki wins a penalty at a ruck, clamped on after Sheehan’s tackle. Prendergast is going to take it on. It’s two metres inside the Welsh half. The outhalf strikes it superbly. Gibson-Park with a brilliant relieving kick from the re-start. Jack Boyle is on for his debut. Wales 18 Ireland 24 68 mins: Porter is hit in the head by Thomas, referee thinks it’s chest. Ian Tempest agrees. NO further sanction. NO foul play. Wales 18 Ireland 21 64 mins: PENALTY Prendergast. Wonderful catch and kick from Lowe. Ryan back on for McCarthy. Gibson-Park with a wonderful sniping break. Hansen denied a try, held up brilliantly by Murray and Morgan. Ireland were on penalty advantage. Hansen might have given Sheehan a scoring pass in hindsight. The Irish hooker and captain asks Prendergast to kick the penalty and the young outhalf bisects the posts. Wales 18 Ireland 21 62 mins: It’s another brilliant counter-attack from Wales who are playing without fear. Width to their attack, first instinct is to offload. Joe Roberts is on for try scorer Tom Rogers. Free-kick Ireland ats scrum, the first after Welsh loosehead Nicky Smith has gone off. Wales 18 Ireland 18 58 mins: Osborne has done superbly in the air for the most part. It’s been a superb post interval response from Easterby’s side. The one caveat is the discipline. 11 penalties now, the latest for a neck roll. Wales 18 Ireland 18 55 mins: TRY OSBORNE. That’s a great reaction from Ireland. On penalty advantage Ireland pack Sheehan, O’Mahony X2, Baird carry and Gibson-Park with a cross-kick with the boot is tapped back brilliantly by Lowe into the waiting arms of Osborne. Prendergast misses the conversion. It’s all tied up. Wales 18 Ireland 18 53 mins: Ireland have conceded nine penalties to date. Fantastic piece of skill from Prendergast, brilliant spiral for a 50/22 after great play from Osborne. Ireland deep inside the Welsh 22. Wales 18 Ireland 13 52 mins: Henry Thomas on for WillGriff John for Wales. McCarthy with a superb play. Ireland scrum. Anscombe off for a HIA. Jarrod Evans is on. No referee changes his mind. Penalty Wales. Wales 18 Ireland 13 50 mins: McCarthy is back on for Ryan having passed his HIA. Wales with some lovely running angles and offloading but Henshaw comes up with a brilliant turnover. Great line kick from Prendergast and Ireland are back up to 15 players, as Aki replaces Ringrose. Wales 18 Ireland 13 47 mins: PENALTY Prendergast. Ireland win a scrum penalty inside the Welsh 22, more direct around the fringes, where there is space. Baird involved several times. Finlay Bealham on for Clarkson. Wales 18 Ireland 13 42 mins: ROGERS TRY. Ireland are panicky. Osborne kicks away possession, Sheehan gives away possession and it all ends in a try for TOM ROGERS. Flamboyant finish. Ireland again the architect of their downfall. Anscombe misses the conversion. Conan off with an injury. Ryan Baird, who didn’t expect to play today, is on. Wales 18 Ireland 10 Ireland will have to survive another 10-minutes a man down until Ringrose’s 20-minute red card is played out and they can bring on Bundee Aki. Referee Ridley confirms the red card ruling as the second half gets under way. “High degree of danger and no mitigation.” James Ryan is on for McCarthy (HIA) Okay, how to unpack that. Ireland conceded four scrum penalties, two against Porter, two against Clarkson. Apart from the opening 15-minutes, they have been very disjointed, dogged by basic mistakes, handling hasn’t been good and some of the decision making has been flawed too. They will rue that missed opportunity when Osborne’s pass to Ringrose went to turf as a try beckoned. That would have out them 17-3 up. Wales though deserve hue credit for the manner in which they have hung around and to be honest played the better attacking rugby. They’ve troubled Ireland particularly out wide. Ireland will need to be a lot more precise and composed in possession. They’ll need to sort out the scrum, be better disciplined and connected in attack and defence. The high point of the Irish half from an Irish perspective The Power of Jack Conan 😮‍💨💪#GuinnessM6N @IrishRugby pic.twitter.com/aIUIWgCk6d RED CARD: Ireland’s Garry Ringrose’s yellow card has been upgraded to a 20-minute red card. Head on head contact on Ben Thomas. The correct decision. Needed to be lower. Half-time: Wales 13 Ireland 10 40(+2) mins: TRY Morgan. Wales on penalty advantage from the lineout after Ireland come in from the side at the maul; van der Flier pinged. Clarkson saved a try with a great tackle. Anscombe kicks the penalty to the corner. Rowlands takes, backs join maul. Wales pound the Irish line, stopped by millimetres until captain, Morgan forces his way over. Anscombe converts. Wales have deserved that. Wales 13 Ireland 10 36 mins: Prendergast hits an upright with a long-range penalty. Superbly struck but the outhalf then knocks on a high ball. Ireland are at sixes and sevens defensively, looking a little ragged on both sides of the ball and there are simply too many missed straight up tackles. Ireland concede a fourth scrum penalty. Leads to a schemozzle. Seven penalties Ireland have conceded, four at scrum time. Wales 6 Ireland 10 31 mins: Ireland are guilty of ball watching at a ruck. Van der Flier protects the ball, but no one goes in to move it on in the absence of Gibson-Park and Ireland penalised for holding on. Osborne with a superb tackle at Wales go on the attack again. They are inside the Irish 22. Ireland are penalised, Ringrose not rolling away. The television match official Ian Tempest advises the referee Christophe Ridley to look at a Ringrose tackle previously. Ringrose receives a yellow card and it will be reviewed by FPRO, Matteo Liperini (Italy). 34 mins: Anscombe kicks the penalty. Wales 6 Ireland 10 30 mins: Should have been a try for Ireland, great work by McCarthy and Peter O’Mahony in the build-up, the visitors sweep wide, but Osborne throws a poor pass. Ringrose was in for a walk in try, if the pass had gone to hand. A long pass was required but Osborne slapping the turf tells you he felt he should have done better. Smith is back in the front row. Scrum is completed. Wales 3 Ireland 10 27 mins: Good work from Ireland, good strike, Conan gets off the base of the scrum superbly and Lowe completes the clearance with his left foot. Wales though are back on the attack and they’re playing some lovely rugby. Wales 3 Ireland 10 24 mins: A poor enough re-start from Prendergast, too far and Tomos Williams with a superb clearance into the Irish half. Ireland kick away possession, Wales get it to the edge. Sheehan rescues his team by covering a kick through but Osborne doesn’t get much on the clearance. Brilliant work from Wales down the touchline but Williams knocks on what would have been a try scoring pass from Jac Morgan. That’s a huge let off for Ireland. Wales 3 Ireland 10 22 mins: Brilliant take from Beirne at the re-start, Sheehan knocked on though and Ireland are caught offside. Anscombe kicks the easy penalty. Wales 3 Ireland 10 19 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. Gareth Thomas (Ospreys) on for Nicky Smith at loosehead prop. We’re about to have another scrum. Wales 3-0 up on penalties. What will the change do? Ireland win a scrum penalty. Thomas, the new boy penalised. Prendergast points at the posts and thumps it over. Wales 0 Ireland 10 15 mins: Lovely fluency from Ireland in attack, going from one touchline to the other. Move ends when Lowe goes through a gap but loses the ball in contact seven metres from the Welsh line. Wales win a third scrum penalty. Clarkson called again, this time by Gianluca Gnecchi, the other assistant referee. Worrying for Ireland. All three officials have called a scrum penalty against Ireland. Wales 0 Ireland 7 11 mins: Ireland are penalised at the second scrum, this time Thomas Clarkson for dropping his bind. Josh van der Flier reclaims an overthrow at a lineout. Hansen kicks through but Blair Murray rescues Wales and the home side clears. Good work from Lowe and Ringrose. Prendergast kicks the ball away. Wales 0 Ireland 7 8 mins: Good clearance from Jamison Gibson-Park from the re-start, Tom Rogers beats Jamie Osborne to Gareth Anscombe’s up and under. Wales get some continuity. The home side penalised, Elliot Dee for a tip tackle on a ruck clear-out. Tadhg Beirne inverted. Ireland clear but Henshaw knocks on from the long throw over the back. Wales 0 Ireland 7 6 mins: TRY Jack Conan. Superb from Conan, great power and a one-handed fend to stretch and reach over the Welsh line. Prendergast kicks the conversion. Wales 0 Ireland 7 5 mins: Good direct running from Ireland, Taulupe Faletau penalised two metres from his line. The visitors take it off the tail. Joe McCarthy great carry, James Lowe too. Wales 0 Ireland 0 4 mins: A bit of aerial tennis ends in a Welsh knock-on and the first scrum of the match. Collapses. Re-set. Andrew Porter penalised. Call came in from assistant referee Nika Amashukeli. Nothing in it. Ball had gone. Should have been play on. Jack Conan wins turnover. Mack Hansen counter-ruck. Garry Ringrose great grubber for a 50/22. Wales 0 Ireland 0 Ireland kickoff through Sam Prendergast. Roof closed, wonderful atmosphere, passionate rendition of the anthems. Let’s go. A reminder of the teams WALES: Blair Murray (Scarlets); Tom Rogers (Scarlets), Max Llewellyn (Gloucester), Ben Thomas (Cardiff), Ellis Mee (Scarlets); Gareth Anscombe (Gloucester), Tomos Williams (Gloucester); Nicky Smith (Leicester Tigers), Elliot Dee (Dragons), WillGriff John (Sale Sharks), Will Rowlands (Racing 92), Dafydd Jenkins (Exeter Chiefs), Jac Morgan (Ospreys) (capt), Tommy Reffell (Leicester Tigers), Taulupe Faletau (Cardiff).

Time for the anthems. Tommy Bowe knows a thing or two about Irish and Welsh rugby. What is the secret to Ireland's rugby success? 🤔@TommyBowe has his say 🗣️ #BBCRugby #SixNations pic.twitter.com/C0YdCVQPrL Right a little under half an hour to go to kickoff. Johnny Watterson will have green and red markers as he does the Player Ratings post match, Gerry Thornley will have his match report and I’ll keep you up to date with all the post match reaction. Stay here and all that will be coming your way on the blog. We will link everything to this blog. Statistics, the last refuge of the scoundrel. And I’d know. One that caught the eye was that Ireland had just 47% possession in their first two games – the second lowest after Italy (44%) – but they have enjoyed more territory (56%) than any other side and made more entries into the opposition 22 (22) than anyone else. Other reasons to be cheerful from an Irish perspective. Wales have conceded the most (26) and been awarded the fewest (14) penalties of any side in the Six Nations. We'll wear our new alternate white kit in Cardiff on Saturday to help supporters impacted by colour blindness! ⚪️#TeamOfUs pic.twitter.com/h1D22FiGck The reason that Ireland will wear their changed strip today. In a significant move to support spectators and viewers with colour vision deficiency (CVD), Ireland will wear their new alternate white kit against Wales. This decision, driven by new World Rugby regulations, aims to prevent kit clashes that can be problematic for those affected by CVD. Colour vision deficiency, commonly known as colour blindness, affects approximately one in 12 men and one in 200 women. The traditional red jerseys of Wales and the green jerseys of Ireland create a challenging visual scenario for those with CVD, making it difficult to distinguish between the two teams on the pitch. The stage is set! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿#TeamOfUs pic.twitter.com/dPIAtAvJ2L Today’s teams WALES: Blair Murray (Scarlets); Tom Rogers (Scarlets), Max Llewellyn (Gloucester), Ben Thomas (Cardiff), Ellis Mee (Scarlets); Gareth Anscombe (Gloucester), Tomos Williams (Gloucester); Nicky Smith (Leicester Tigers), Elliot Dee (Dragons), WillGriff John (Sale Sharks), Will Rowlands (Racing 92), Dafydd Jenkins (Exeter Chiefs), Jac Morgan (Ospreys) (capt), Tommy Reffell (Leicester Tigers), Taulupe Faletau (Cardiff).

Referee: Christophe Ridley (England) Assistant Referees: Nika Amashukeli (Georgia), Gianluca Gnecchi (Italy) TMO: Ian Tempest (England) FPRO: Matteo Liperini (Italy) BREAKING NEWS: Cian Prendergast has had to withdraw from the Ireland bench because of illness and his place goes to Ryan Baird. That’s very unfortunate for the Connacht captain but Ireland are fortunate to have such an accomplished stand-in. A word from the coaches. Simon Easterby: “Playing Wales in Cardiff is one of the great tests and we know the challenge that awaits us. “With a new coaching set-up in place, Wales will be re-energised and determined to impress in front of a vocal home support. “There will also be a huge Irish travelling support which, when added to the closed roof and the great respect and rivalry between the two nations, will add to an electric atmosphere.” He added: “We have made a few changes to the squad this week, some of which were enforced, and we’re confident that the 23 we have selected are primed and ready to go. “Dan’s (Sheehan) selection as captain is recognition of his high standing within the squad, both on and off the pitch. I have no doubt that he will relish the opportunity to lead Ireland for the first time. “Equally, I would also like to congratulate Jack Boyle on his inclusion in the matchday squad for the first time. Jack has impressed for his province Leinster, and in the national training camps over the last number of months, and he’s a young forward with a bright future.” Wales interim head coach Matt Sherratt: “We’re looking forward to the challenge of facing Ireland. We have spoken this week about being brave, but not reckless and making sure everyone knows their roles. “We also know that keeping our discipline will be huge. Everyone is excited for our first home game of the Six Nations. “The atmosphere Wales fans create at the Principality Stadium is incredible, and playing at home is something the players really look forward to.” Love the sentiment behind this image. Good to hear the Wales fans in good voice and spirit as the first rugby special pulls out of Pontypridd for Cardiff this morning #cymru #CYMvIWE #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/Svg9KFVbgO Some important information for those using the train station in Cardiff before and after today’s game. 🏉3 things to remember before coming to watch the Wales v Ireland rugby game today @principalitysta 🧍A post-event queue system will be in place at Cardiff Central❌Cardiff Queen Street station will close at 15:30🎟️Buy your tickets before you board the train pic.twitter.com/dUyzo8bAHq Wonderful atmosphere in Wales (Cardiff) this morning ahead of their #SixNations game against Ireland this afternoon!Great to bump into lots of supporters from home, in a city which is already buzzing. C'mon @IrishRugby - you got this!#TeamOfUs #ShouldertoShoulder pic.twitter.com/RKZR9pBOMK For those of us who have been around a while (!) I remember the Triple Crowns of 1982 and 1985 - our 5th and 6th ever in history. Glory days ! Today we’ll be going for our 8th this century after 04, 06, 07, 09, 18, 22 & 23. @IrishRugby has come a long way …. Welsh Twitter is certainly going all-in on the victory of the Wales Under-20 side as a positive harbinger for this afternoon’s game at the Principality Stadium. I am half expecting to see them point to the fact that the Irish 20s and the senior side were/are in the changed white, and I use that description loosely, strip. Maybe it’s an omen. A little under an hour and a half to go to kickoff in Cardiff. Just enough time to grab a bite and a drink of choice and read Gerry Thornley’s preview Former Wales great Jonathan Davies things that the Welsh 20s can inspire their senior brethern. Great win for Wales U20s just the boost Welsh rugby needed. 👍💪👏👏👏 Time to rip the plaster off the Ireland Under-20s performance in the 20-12 defeat to Wales at Rodney Parade last night. Once again they dominated territory and possession but the same old failings came back to haunt them in the opposition 22, leaving behind oodles of points. To their credit Wales defended with courage and grit, making over 228 tackles to their opponents 67 but the visitors made that job easier with an attack that lacked shape and cohesion and a multitude of handling errors. Nathan Johns was in Newport and here’s his thoughts on Ireland’s shortcomings. The best of both worlds for one Welsh fan. About to make the long long drove to Monmouth services for a @GreggsOfficial And while I’m in the area i thought i might catch Wales playing Ireland in the #GuinnessM6N Say hi if you’re about! pic.twitter.com/S1EIYYQqlp Go well Ireland 🙌#SUAF ☘️ | @SixNationsRugby | #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/TGkgHmnghd The bookmakers have Ireland as 25-point favourites on the handicap for today’s game and offer Wales at 14/1 against on a straight bet, which is long, long, long odds in a two-horse race to mix sporting metaphors. However, the Irish side would do well to remember that the tournament has had some famous upsets in the past, starting on the opening weekend on the first ever Six Nations in 2000. Scotland, the defending Fix Nations champions, travelled to the Stadio Flaminio in Rome to face an Italian side playing their first ever game in the Six Nations and lost 34-20. Italy’s, Argentine born outhalf, Diego Dominguez kicked 29-points. Wales beat raging hot favourites England 31-30 at Wembley in 1999 to deny them a Grand Slam. A late try by Scott Gibbs gave Wales the win and Scotland the title on points’ difference. In 2019 Ireland had just toppled world champions New Zealand in an unbeaten series of matches in November and sat on a run of 12 home wins on the bounce and 18 victories from their past 19 games. England, the visitors, hadn’t scored a try in Ireland in eight years, so it was no wonder that Joe Schmidt’s men down as heavy favourites on the day. England, under Eddie Jones, cruised home 32-20 for only their second win in Dublin since 2003. Italy enjoyed two huge upset wins in Rome, the first in 2011 when the squeezed-out France 22-21 with Mirco Bergamasco the hero, while two years later it was Ireland that suffered a similar fate losing 22-15 in the last game of Declan Kidney’s tenure as head coach. When Scotland beat England 11-6 at Twickenham in 2021, they were 9/2 underdogs with their hosts 1/6 to win that match. England were the reigning champions and it was a first win for the Scots in 38 years at the London venue. Good news and bad news today. Bad news is I’ll miss the rugby because we’re racing 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 Good news is… I’ll miss the rugby because we’re racing 🤣 Come on boys 💪🙏🏉 #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/Gpy9NIL9am Hello and welcome to the Irish Times blog for today’s Six Nations match at the Principality stadium. John O’Sullivan here and I’ll be taking you through the afternoon, before, during and after the game. We have some exclusive content too, not just what’s been on the website or in the newspaper. Will Wales get the big game bounce under new management with Cardiff coach Matt Sherratt taking over in an interim capacity following Warren Gatland’s departure, a decision based on mutual agreement between the New Zealander and the Welsh Rugby Union? The home supporters will be hoping that’s a fervent, ‘yes.’ Ireland are also under an interim coach, albeit in happier circumstances, in Simon Easterby, who is caretaking while Andy Farrell devotes himself to the British & Irish Lions head coach’s role. Not sure, when, if ever you would have had two countries facing one another in a Six Nations clash under interim head coaches. That’s not the only similarity. Wales and Ireland share a common identity prior to today’s match as the only two sides capable of winning the Triple Crown in this season’s Six Nations Championship. Ireland have safely negotiated two thirds of that remit with victories over England and Scotland, while for Wales this is the first leg of the treble with games against England and Scotland to come. Ireland take on Wales this afternoon as they look to keep their perfect start to this year’s Six Nations campaign going and claim the Triple Crown, although eyes are firmly set on the bigger prize with a third championship in a row and a grand slam within their sights. Simon Easterby has made seven changes to his side for the game with Dan Sheehan set to captain his country for the first time. Ireland come into the game as heavy favourites after the poor start Wales have had to the tournament and the departure of Warren Gatland.

Title: Here's what to know about Germany's election this Sunday

Rob Schmitz People walk past a truck with an election campaign poster featuring Friedrich Merz, leader of conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in Oberhausen, Germany, on Feb. 21. VOLKER HARTMANN/AFP via Getty Images hide caption BERLIN — An economic slump, an immigration crisis and the lifting of a security blanket provided for decades by its most powerful ally are on the minds of German voters as they head to the polls for Sunday's national parliamentary election. The general election of the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, was not supposed to come until September of this year. But on Nov. 6, just a day after American voters elected Donald Trump to a second term in office, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister after months of squabbling over how to revive Germany's struggling economy, leading to the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government and the call for a snap election. The latest polling data shows Scholz's Social Democrats in third place among voters (16%), behind the far-right Alternative for Germany or AfD Party (20%) and the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) alongside its Bavarian sister CSU party (29%). The CDU will likely emerge as the largest vote-getter and thus be in the position of forming a coalition government with one or two other parties. Since all of Germany's mainstream parties have vowed not to govern with the AfD, which is under domestic surveillance for the threat it poses to Germany's democracy, the CDU's candidate for chancellor, Friedrich Merz, may have a difficult time forming a coalition government. "I'm just worried that after the election that it will take maybe two months for a coalition government to form," says Jana Puglierin, director of the Berlin office at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "Once the coalition is in place, they need to draft a budget. And if we are very lucky, all of this will be done before the parliamentary summer break." The expected drawn-out German political timetable worries observers because of the next government's urgency to deal with multiple crises that face Europe's largest economy. These include an economic recession, a national debate over migration, and, perhaps most importantly, how to navigate a new global security order now that the Trump administration appears to be working with Russia to bring an end to Moscow's war in Ukraine without inviting Europe or Ukraine to the negotiating table. Whichever parties form the next coalition government in Berlin, Merz remains Scholz's likely successor. He is a 69-year-old conservative who hails from a family of lawyers. In addition to serving as a CDU member of parliament, Merz has also worked as a corporate lawyer and as a member of the supervisory board for the German branch of Blackrock, the largest asset management company in the world. Merz's longtime colleague Norbert Röttgen, who also serves as a CDU member of Germany's parliament, says Merz is a politician of conviction. Röttgen has known Merz for more than 30 years. The two entered parliament together and have worked side by side through successive governments. He says Merz has strong beliefs: "Societally conservative, traditional values and a strong, free-market conviction that liberal markets serve the people," says Röttgen. "And he is a fundamental pro-European trans-Atlanticist." Röttgen says Merz's convictions will prove useful as Germany is faced with difficult decisions after the United States has signaled changes in how it sees its European allies. The outgoing administration has not helped build a cohesive way forward for Europe on Ukraine, Puglierin says. "I think Merz, by disposition, would be more open to also support Ukraine more decisively," says Puglierin. "But he has to work in a framework. He will be constrained by his coalition partner and also by the German population." After coalition talks and tackling a budget that the Scholz administration left on the table, it might take months before Merz has the opportunity to put his mark on Germany, Puglierien says. Hints of how he will lead, though, have trickled out in recent weeks, as Merz got into trouble with his own party when he agreed to work with the AfD late last month to pass a motion that would have toughened up Germany's immigration policy. The motion failed after significant backlash against Merz for agreeing to work with a party seen by mainstream political parties as anti-democratic. Voter Ute Wolters, a 64-year-old architect from Lower Saxony, worries about Merz's potential leadership. "He claims to be up to the job, and we know he's a good businessman, but I worry he will go back on his promise to never enter into a coalition government with the AfD," she says, referring to repeated vows Merz has made throughout the campaign. Another voter, Ulrich Hinz, a 74-year-old retired businessman from Frankfurt, says he thinks Merz's pro-European outlook could help at such a trying time for Germany. "We need a chancellor and a government that is more European and one that can get along better with the French, Italians and the Poles," he says. "That's the only way we are going to be able to keep up with China, Russia, and the United States." Esme Nicholson contributed to this story from Berlin. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: Travel Startups Raise $580 Million Over Two Weeks

Time Published: 2025-02-21T21:05:20Z

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Select a question above or ask something else In the past two weeks, six travel startups have collectively raised $580 million, showcasing ongoing investor interest in travel technology advancements. Companies like Archer Aviation are leading the charge with significant funding aimed at developing flying taxis, with plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Klook and RoomPriceGenie are leveraging AI and automation to enhance travel experiences and hotel pricing, underscoring a shift towards modernizing traditional travel sectors. Tech companies promising to automate old industries are still getting big investment deals in 2025. Klook, which is modernizing the historically low-tech sector of ticketed experiences, just landed its second large fundraise in the past 18 months. And RoomPriceGenie, despite having several notable competitors, raised $75 million to help hotels automate pricing — an area that’s seen a lot of demand as hotels have been looking to modernize and generate more revenue since the pandemic. While startups developing flying taxis and renewable jet fuel are not producing much revenue yet, they’re raking in large amounts of money with the promise of big business in the future. Six travel startups raised nearly $580 million over the past two weeks. Archer Aviation, which is developing a flying taxi for commercial flights and defense clients, has raised $301.8 million. Investors included funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. The company has now raised over $2 billion, including its most recent deal of $430 million in December. The company said the latest fundraise brings its total liquidity to around $1 billion. California-based Archer is developing an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft called Midnight. It is designed to hold a pilot with four passengers and luggage for urban trips of 20-50 miles at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. It is powered by six independent battery packs, each supporting a pair of electric engines, the company said. Archer said it now has manufacturing contracts worth over $6 billion. That includes a recent purchasing agreement for up to 100 aircrafts from Soracle — owned by Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation — which plans to operate a flying taxi service in various cities in Japan. The company recently unveiled plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles ahead of some major sporting events: the World Cup in 2026, the Super Bowl in 2027, and the Summer Olympics in 2028. The network includes vertiports (eVTOL airports) at Los Angeles International Airport, University of Southern California, Orange County, Santa Monica, Hollywood Burbank, Long Beach, and the Van Nuys neighborhood. The company is also planning to establish a vertiport near the SoFi Stadium, home of the Los Angeles football teams Rams and Chargers. The plan is to begin LA network operations in 2026. This is in addition to plans for a network at California airports where Southwest Airlines operates, along with five vertiports in the Bay Area. The funding will go toward the continued development of the company’s aircraft. Klook, an online travel agency for tours and attractions, has raised $100 million The company said that the fundraise brings its valuation to over $1 billion for the first time. Vitruvian Partners led the round. The company last raised $210 million in equity and debt in 2023. Hong Kong-based Klook says it offers hundreds of thousands of ticketed experiences, such as walking tours, in 2,700 destinations globally. The company has also been expanding to offer hotels, trains, and car rentals. The new funding will go toward AI initiatives, such as for enhancing merchant operations, through an expanded partnership with Google Cloud. (See Skift’s story.) RoomPriceGenie, which provides AI-powered pricing tech for hotels, has raised $75 million. The funding comes from Five Elms Capital. Switzerland-based RoomPriceGenie provides a revenue management system for independent hotels and groups. The tech is meant to automate updating room rates based on changing market conditions. Competitors include Duetto, which was acquired by a private equity firm last year. The company says it has more than 3,000 hotel clients in 65 countries. The company also said it appointed Chas Scarantino as CEO. The co-founder and previous CEO, Ari Andricopoulos, is now the chief strategy officer. The funding will go toward expanding internally. Twelve, a renewable jet fuel production startup, has raised $83 million. Investors included DCVC, Amazon (The Climate Pledge Fund), Mitsui & Co., Development Bank of Japan, Japan Hydrogen Fund, Greycroft (Coca-Cola Sustainability Fund), 2551 Capital, SMBC, TPG, Pulse Fund, and others. The company most recently raised a series C round of $200 million in September. The new funding is a mix between an extension of the series C round plus financing to build a production facility. California-based Twelve says its tech generates jet fuel by converting a mix of carbon dioxide from either tanks or the atmosphere, along with water and renewable energy. Airline customers so far include Alaska Airlines and International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways. Superlogic, which helps users apply loyalty points to ticketed experiences, has raised $13.7 million in its series A funding. Superlogic, a trailblazer in experiential rewards technology, today announced a first closing of $13.7 million in its Series A funding round. Led by Powerledger led the round, with support from including Sangha Capital, 10SQ, Nima Capital, Actai Unicorn Fund, Hyla Liquid Venture Fund, Liquid 2 Ventures, Amex Ventures, Galaxy Interactive, Mirabaud Lifestyle Impact and Innovation, Recharge Capital, Dispersion Capital, Sanctor Capital, and more. Miami-based Superlogic provides an AI-powered platform that loyalty programs can use to connect users with experiences tailored to their interests. Spark e-Fuels, which is developing tech to make renewable jet fuel, has raised $2.4 million (€2.3 million) in pre-seed funding. Nucleus Capital led the round, with support from Zero Carbon Capital, IBB Ventures, Chemovator, Voyagers.io, 1.5° Ventures, and a group of angel investors. Spark is focused on building its first e-fuel pilot plant and expanding its team to accelerate technology development and commercialization. The Berlin-based startup is developing tech that converts renewable resources like carbon dioxide, into jet fuel. The funding will go toward building its first pilot production plant and hiring.

Title: Coinbase CEO’s Hot Take: Bitcoin Is Basically A ‘Meme Coin’
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/coinbase-ceos-hot-take-bitcoin-is-basically-a-meme-coin/
Time Published: 2025-02-21T21:00:16Z
Full Content:
Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, has recently made an audacious statement regarding Bitcoin that has caused quite a stir in the crypto industry. He recently proposed that Bitcoin could be regarded as “somewhat of a meme coin,” which sparked a debate among enthusiasts, analysts, and investors. Like meme currencies, Armstrong pointed out that the value of Bitcoin is essentially derived from popular or collective belief. He explained that unlike conventional assets, Bitcoin lacks inherent value connected with actual objects or direct use. Instead, its value is swayed by societal trust and the shared perception of its significance. He also likened Bitcoin to the US dollar, noting that although the dollar’s value has persisted mostly due to mass acceptance and faith in its purchasing power, and it is not connected to the gold standard. This comparison highlights Bitcoin’s status as a store of value rather than a commodity with inherent worth. Armstrong did not intend to undermine Bitcoin’s credibility; however, his statements underscored the expanding influence of meme coins. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two cryptocurrencies that have amassed substantial followings despite possessing minimal fundamental utility. On memecoins… Memecoins have generated a lot of buzz recently, and I’ve gotten some questions on how I think about them. I am personally not a memecoin trader (beyond a few test trades), but they’ve become hugely popular. Arguably, they’ve been with us since the beginning –… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 19, 2025 For example, Dogecoin, which originated as a joke, experienced a price increase of over 15,000% in 2021 as a result of social media publicity and endorsements from prominent figures such as Elon Musk. Shiba Inu reached an all-time market cap of around $40 billion. This trend is a reflection of how sentiment and viral appeal can push asset valuation up, much like what Armstrong suggests applies to Bitcoin. Armstrong agreed that, in spite of the comparison, Bitcoin is still the most well-known cryptocurrency. The crypto continues to dominate institutional adoption, regulatory discussions, and long-term investment strategies. Meanwhile, the legitimacy of Bitcoin has been strengthened even more by the trust big financial firms like BlackRock and Fidelity have in the crypto asset. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and decentralized nature also sets it apart from the typical meme coin phenomenon. Armstrong’s statement has fueled discussions about how cryptocurrencies derive their value. Some critics argue that equating Bitcoin to a meme coin undermines its role as “digital gold,” while others believe it accurately describes the evolving nature of financial assets in the internet era.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) vowed this month that a stablecoin bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, will be passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law within the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s administration. As the bill gains momentum, some experts say the industry may be at a crossroads. While the measure would for the first time provide a pathway to legality for stablecoin giants like Tether and Circle, it would also likely unleash massive competition. A federal framework would embolden countless companies to dive into the $233 billion stablecoin market, according to Niklas Kunkel, the founder of blockchain oracle builder Chronicle Labs. At the least, many firms will consider what strategic advantages stablecoins have, he told Decrypt. “As soon as this legislation passes, there are going to be 10,000 companies looking at this,” Kunkel said. “I would expand that beyond just payment companies and asset issuers. [...] You can include tech companies: the Amazons, Ubers, Metas and Googles of the world." Among interested firms, Kunkel bet 1,000 of them would debut a stablecoin within the following year that stablecoin legislation is passed. In lieu of adopting an existing stablecoin like Circle’s USDC, however, Kunkel said firms will be incentivized to release their own equivalent. “They would love their users to use their own branded stablecoin because they can make the yield on the underlying reserves,” he explained. “They may even be white-labeled.” As an example of a white-labeled stablecoin, Kunkel pointed to Paxos. The company once issued a Binance-branded stablecoin called BUSD, while playing a central role in PayPal’s stablecoin foray as the issuer of PayPal USD (PYUSD). As digital assets are pegged to the price of a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, stablecoins are often backed by reserves of cash and U.S. Treasuries that generate yield. In Coinbase’s fourth quarter, the company disclosed $224 million in revenue from assets backing USDC. A report published by S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday found that the GENIUS Act would increase the adoption of stablecoins in the U.S. The lack of regulation in the U.S. is “one of the main impediments” to broader adoption, the analysts wrote. In November, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla wrote in a letter addressed to Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris—then the Democratic presidential candidate—that America’s opportunity to cement financial dominance through stablecoins had been stifled so far by “countless examples of regulatory overreach.” Though firms like BlackRock have issued tokenized money market funds that resemble stablecoins, S&P analysts wrote that a lack of regulation and supervision has prevented their broader adoption in fields like everyday payments. Chronicle Labs is developing a network for oracles, which allow blockchains to connect with external, real-word data sources. Before starting the Switzerland-based firm, Kunkel worked for five years at MakerDAO, the popular lending protocol behind the stablecoin DAI. (MakerDAO has since rebranded to Sky and replaced DAI with USDS.) Kunkel was part of the founding team at MakerDAO when the organization launched in 2017. And at this point, building something that resembles a bank and operates solely on stablecoin rails is possible, he said. The regulatory backdrop just needs to catch up. “As soon as you get the government involved, everything slows down to a crawl,” he said. “The rate at which that iceberg thaws is going to determine how far into the future that we have to look before we realize this.” When PayPal introduced its stablecoin in 2023, the firm faced criticism from Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a top Democrat on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. She said that “federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential,” expressing deep concern that the payments giant had moved before a framework was passed. Ultimately, stablecoin legislation may further intertwine the U.S. financial system with crypto’s sprawling decentralized finance, or DeFi, landscape, according to S&P analysis. “In our view, the role of stablecoins will continue to evolve and could eventually lead to more integration between traditional finance and decentralized finance,” they wrote.

Title: New UK-Based Climate Group Emerges as Banks Retreat
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/02/20/812605.htm
Time Published: 2025-02-20T15:41:21Z
Full Content:
It was a dank, drizzly February evening when about 120 people gathered in the brightly lit art gallery of London’s Guildhall, surrounded by gold-framed paintings ranging from Pre-Raphaelites to realists. At the event, Alok Sharma, a former member of the UK parliament who served as president-designate of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2021, announced the launch of the Transition Finance Council. The goal of the London-based group, which includes banking executives, is to rally the City of London, companies and policymakers to scale funding for decarbonization efforts at home and abroad. The intention is “to ensure that London is positioned as a preeminent financial hub for transition financing” and to “deliver at scale the finance to transition the global economy” to cleaner energy sources, Sharma said in his speech. As Sharma pointed out, it was five years ago almost to the day that a similar event took place in the same building. The UK government, together with the Bank of England, had rallied six times as many people for the launch of what was called the private finance agenda for COP26. That gathering was a more boisterous affair. The room was “packed to the rafters,” Sharma recalled. Mark Carney, then BOE governor, took the stage to interview legendary biologist and broadcaster David Attenborough. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, dialed in. It was “the point at which talk of sustainable finance and climate action moved from being a [corporate social responsibility] issue to being a C-suite issue,” Sharma said. A year later, Carney introduced the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, an industry initiative uniting firms with more than $70 trillion of assets to accelerate the transition to net zero. Much, of course, has changed since then. Starting in December, all of the largest US and Canadian banks began fleeing the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, itself once part of the broader GFANZ framework. And last week, Australia’s Macquarie Group Ltd. said it too was retreating from the coalition. The defections occurred as financial institutions seek to avoid right-wing attacks on sustainability and renewable energy, a US Republican-led war on behalf of the oil industry that’s only intensified with Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The insurance sector’s climate alliance also has been discontinued, while a similar group in the fund-management industry is on pause as it seeks to ensure that it remains “fit for purpose.” There’s “a lot of turmoil,” said Nina Seega, director of the Centre for Sustainable Finance at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. “Rhetoric is shifting and climate denial is becoming much more mainstream, so you then see a shift in the way different financial institutions are dealing with that.” Some are under more pressure than others, she said, but “none are immune.” Last week, a few minutes before Sharma took the microphone to announce the Transition Finance Council’s formation, one chief sustainability officer (CSO) of a large UK-based investment manager was asking attendees who they thought would be the next company to retreat from net zero. The query wasn’t surprising. CSOs face a more difficult landscape these days, what with big firms like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BlackRock Inc. quitting climate-finance groups. On Wednesday, HSBC announced it’s pushed back its deadline to meet a number of key climate targets by two decades. As more companies back away, there are serious questions about the financial industry’s long-term commitment—and capacity—to help slow increasingly catastrophic global warming. Forced to battle headwinds both inside and outside their firms, many CSOs are concerned they may no longer have the full support of their companies and leadership teams. “Finance is being politicized, if not weaponized,” said Clemens Calice, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who set up his own investment and advisory firm, Cygnum Capital. “Companies are under increasing pressure to align with a side or an agenda.” For CSOs, all of this amounts to a “very challenging operating environment,” said James Alexander, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association. Politics and policy have “become much more fractured,” making judgment calls “much harder to make.” At the same time, he said, “if you’re managing money, your responsibility is to consider risks, and sustainability is undeniably one of those risks.” Britain stands out as a rare example of a country that’s advancing on climate action. Seven of the world’s 10 largest economies missed a recent deadline to file updated emissions-saving plans with the United Nations. The UK was the only one to outline a strategy for the next decade that’s anywhere close to consistent with the Paris Agreement target to keep warming below 1.5C. “I’m very pleased to say” that the UK “has a government which recognizes that there is no trade-off between economic growth and the drive to decarbonize the economy,” Sharma said. The country is “uniquely positioned to lead.” (GFANZ is co-chaired by Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, and Mary Schapiro, the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission.) North Carolina-based Duke Energy Corp., one of the biggest US power providers, removed a mention of climate targets in its latest earnings release as the company builds more natural gas plants and even reconsiders its plans for coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. Duke said in its third-quarter earnings release last year that it was “executing an ambitious clean energy transition” and noted its goals to emit net-zero methane by 2030 and net-zero carbon by 2050. But the company’s fourth-quarter release on Thursday, while stating it was “executing an ambitious energy transition,” omitted the word “clean” and left out emissions goals. Though Duke says its strategy hasn’t changed, the move comes as Trump, who previously called climate change a “hoax” though has occasionally modulated that claim since, is nevertheless trying to increase production of fossil fuels while simultaneously seeking to zero-out net-zero policies. Duke said late last year it would consider shifting its plans for coal plants if the US president follows through on his promises to terminate rules governing power-plant pollution.

Title: Wisconsin More Than Doubled BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Holdings to 6M Shares

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun The state’s investment board’s stake is worth more than $340 million at IBIT’s current price of $56.10. Wisconsin’s investment board saw fit to significantly add to its bitcoin (BTC) bet in the last three months of the year. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) disclosed ownership of just over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of the Dec. 31, per a 13F filing on Friday, up from roughly 2.9 million shares three months prior. The position is valued at $340 million at IBIT’s current price of $56.10 and would be worth about $588 million at bitcoin’s current price near $98,000. The fund in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a bitcoin ETF purchase, initially buying 94,562 shares of IBIT and some shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which it later sold. The State of Michigan Retirement System later also reported owning shares of bitcoin ETFs, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and two of Grayscale’s bitcoin products. SWIB, established in 1951, oversees more than $156 billion in assets including funds from the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and the State Investment Fund (SIF). The board manages investments on behalf of state employees and other trust funds. Today marks the deadline for institutional investors managing at least $100 million in assets to report quarterly holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The market is closely monitoring these filings to gauge whether large traditional finance firms have been adding bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios since their launch last year. UPDATE (Feb. 14, 18:49 UTC): Updates current valuation of State of Wisconsin’s stake in IBIT.

Title: Bird flu: They Are Re-Running The COVID Script

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Rhoda Wilson | Feb 20, 2025 | Coincidence, Conspiracy Fact and Theory, Headline News, Health | 2 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Exposé. Bird flu is a rerun of COVID-19. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The pandemic planners have a playbook; they used it for COVID-19 and now they are using it for bird flu, with one difference. With COVID-19, they targeted us directly. With bird flu, they are targeting us indirectly through our food supply. It is currently being claimed that bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry, dairy cows and cats, and has resulted in several human cases in the US, including a recent case in Wyoming. By coincidence, yesterday, the US Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) gave conditional approval for an updated bird flu vaccine for poultry. An outbreak of bird flu at a farm in New Zealand in December resulted in the culling of almost 160,000 hens. But, warned New Zealand’s Biosecurity Minister yesterday, a different strain of the flu was circulating globally and would likely arrive in New Zealand. At the end of January, GAVI “Vaccines Work” was delighted to announce that restrictions had been put in place in the UK to curb the spread of bird flu. Almost 1.8 million farmed and captive birds have been culled in the past three months due to avian flu outbreaks across the UK. Reuters reported yesterday that there has been an outbreak of bird flu in Canada. And so, it goes on. Countries’ pandemic-vaccine industries are moving in lockstep, just as they did with COVID-19. In the following, Clayton Baker explains more about their pandemic playbook, which they used for COVID-19 and are now using for bird flu. “Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it,” he writes. Although he refers to the pandemic industry in the USA, similar can be applied worldwide. Bird Flu Is a Rerun of the Covid Playbook By Clayton J. Baker as published by Brownstone Institute Bird flu can be very confusing. This is true because, as is so often the case with our government, those who claim to be trying to solve the problem – our so-called “public health” and “pandemic preparedness” “experts” – are actually the ones who created the problem. What is worse, they are actively seeking to perpetuate it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the laboratory-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS-CoV-2, was leaked from a laboratory. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the laboratory leak by denying its occurrence while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing, along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now with H5N1 bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, Georgia. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other laboratories. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatises farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyses decision-makers and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.TheCDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing Health and Human Services (“HHS”) agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the covid era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s biography shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Georgia, should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. 6. The Kawaoka Bird flu laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. 7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. People such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (“OPPR”).Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 million bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled. 10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognise what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Since Trump is intent on issuing as many executive orders as he can, why hasn’t he ordered USDA to stop testing chickens for the (figmentary) bird flu? Not only is that rogue agency culling entire flocks for just one “asymptomatic” positive PCR test, they’re using it as an excuse to cull the flocks of commercial farms within 5-7 miles of the PCR positive flock. Trump’s failure to stop the psychopaths from executing the Covid script against our nation’s poultry farmers is the reason for the eggflation. Now the script has extended to PCR testing cattle, which means higher beef prices are no doubt ahead. SB, its a chess game. My theory is that Trump is letting this kind of stuff (which terrifies the ignorant, the same ones that oppose his efforts) so much of his opposition (press?) is occupied with this stuff and have even more trouble keeping up with and criticizing Trump’s waste and fraud cleansing efforts. I’ve thought on this a while and wondered the same. I think Trump is allowing this to confuse and terrify his enemies. So many are worried about the bird flu and their attention is split away from TDS activities. You must be logged in to post a comment.

Top mutual fund manager Vanguard has paused meetings with portfolio companies while it reviews the impact of new guidance on investor activism from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the matter. In a recent notice, the SEC, whose acting chair was appointed by President Donald Trump, revised its “beneficial ownership reporting” interpretations in ways that could put new burdens on firms like Vanguard that now rely on the SEC’s Schedule 13G form to report major holdings. Going forward, the SEC said managers may need to use the more complex Schedule 13D, which would increase their costs, if they pressure management on matters like climate questions or whether a company has a staggered board or poison pill takeover defenses. Vanguard put the pause in place because it is “trying to process and understand the new guidelines so they can remain a 13G filer and not a 13D filer,” said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Ending the meetings could reduce the power of shareholder activists focused on environmental, social or governance questions, corporate attorneys say, the apparent goal of the SEC’s current leadership. But it could also diminish the input that executives receive from top investors on more traditional corporate questions like executive pay. A Vanguard representative did not respond to questions on Tuesday. Rival asset manager BlackRock had also paused meetings with some of its portfolio companies. A company representative did not immediately comment on the status of these meetings on Tuesday.

Dublin Dublin sisters helping to give the ‘gift of hearing’ to hundreds of people around the world Ailbhe and April Lennon at the Special Olympics in Berlin Two Dublin sisters, who run an audiology clinic in Blackrock, have helped give “the gift of hearing” to hundreds of people around the world. Audiologists Ailbhe Lennon (32) and her sister April (30), run Lennon Hearing in south Dublin, previously known as Advance Hearing. A DUBLIN man “instigated” the Coolock riot last year when he threatened security at a planned asylum seekers’ centre, trespassed and dragged out bedding while an “extremely hostile crowd” gathered, it is alleged.
