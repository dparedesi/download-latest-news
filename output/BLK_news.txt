ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Brian Moynihan, the chief executive officer of $2.6 trillion (assets) Bank of America, doesn’t usually make headlines for his crypto opinions. But in February, he did just that: “If they make that legal, we’ll go into that business.” He was talking about stablecoins—blockchain-based tokens typically pegged to the U.S. dollar and, increasingly, the plumbing of global payments. “They” are Congress, which is now racing to lay down the rules of the road for these crypto creations. The STABLE Act in the House and the GENIUS Act in the Senate are dueling bills with a common goal: to bring stablecoin issuers into the regulatory fold, spelling out exactly how much capital, liquidity and risk management is enough. They also aim to clarify which federal or state agencies get to play referee. But there’s another, less flashy subplot: how will widespread acceptance of stablecoins among traditional institutions globally affect the $28 trillion United States Treasury market? Here’s the thing: Treasurys are the backbone of stablecoin reserves because not much else comes close in terms of safety and liquidity. If you’re offering a digital dollar, you need to back it with assets that are as close to risk-free as possible. This sounds a lot like hundreds of money market mutual funds, which are issued by giants like BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard and hold over $6 trillion in assets, mostly in U.S. Treasury bills. The big difference is that unlike a money market fund, say, from Fidelity, which might pay you an annual yield of 4%, most stablecoin issuers have so far resisted offering any kind of yield or income to their holders. That’s one reason why Tether, the largest of them, has extremely high margins and reported over $1 billion in operating profit in the first quarter of 2025. Right now, the dozens of stablecoin issuers that exist—though mostly Tether, based in El Salvador, and Circle, headquartered in New York—hold an estimated $150 billion in U.S. government debt, primarily short-term T-bills. That’s a rounding error in the $28 trillion Treasury securities market and a fairly insignificant portion of the $6 trillion in Treasury bills outstanding. Most Treasurys are still held by the U.S. government itself, think Social Security and federal pension funds. U.S. mutual funds, banks and insurance companies are the next biggest holders, with foreign investors accounting for about 30% (roughly $8.8 trillion), led by Japan and China. But Britain’s Standard Chartered Bank, an $874 billion (assets) institution that offers custody for cryptocurrencies, projects that the global stablecoin market could jump from $240 billion to $2 trillion in just three years. Both current drafts of the stablecoin bills explicitly identify Treasury securities with maturities of 93 days or less as one of the few acceptable reserves. That could mean an extra $1 trillion in demand for T-bills in the near term, according to an April 30 presentation by the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC), a group of senior bankers, asset managers and hedge fund representatives that advises Treasury officials each quarter. Citi’s research team goes further, suggesting that by 2030 stablecoin issuers could surpass any single foreign country as holders of U.S. government debt. Despite its controversial history, Tether, with $120 billion invested in U.S. Treasurys already, could become the largest holder if it falls into compliance with new regulations. Citi This market upheaval could unfold as the U.S. national debt climbs past $36 trillion, swelling by another trillion roughly every 176 days. Meanwhile, creditors like China and Saudi Arabia are quietly trimming their Treasury holdings. China’s dropped to $761 billion earlier this year, its lowest since 2009, while Saudi Arabia’s have fallen to a year-and-a-half low of $126 billion, reflecting a global rebalancing of reserves and rising skepticism about U.S. sovereign debt. Enter crypto users around the world, in places like Buenos Aires and Nairobi, using stablecoins for everything from paying their rent to hedging against local currency volatility and simultaneously stepping up as a new, eager class of lenders to Uncle Sam. The Trump administration has already made its stance on stablecoins clear. Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks has argued that they could help secure the dollar’s global dominance, and President Trump has pressed Congress to get a bill to his desk before the August recess. “Stablecoins have the potential to ensure American dollar dominance internationally to increase the usage of the U.S. dollar digitally as the world’s reserve currency, and in the process create potentially trillions of dollars of demand for U.S. Treasuries, which could lower long-term interest rates,” said Sacks during his first press conference in February. Additionally, the Trump family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, announced plans for its own stablecoin, which is now apparently complicating the fate of pending regulation. On May 1, World Liberty announced that the token would be used by MGX, an Abu Dhabi government-backed firm, to invest $2 billion into Binance, the crypto exchange whose founder is reportedly seeking a presidential pardon. A couple of days later, nine Senate Democrats, including four who previously backed the stablecoin “GENIUS” bill, issued a statement saying they would oppose the legislation in its current form, Politico reported. But lawmakers had been promoting the idea of stablecoin issuers as ultimate Treasurys buyers even before Trump took office. Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York wrote last fall that more stablecoin adoption means higher demand for Treasurys and, in turn, lower U.S. borrowing costs. Earlier, former House Speaker Paul Ryan floated stablecoins as a buffer against a future wave of foreign selling: if traditional buyers retreat, dollar-backed token issuers could fill the gap. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, puts it bluntly: “You couldn’t invent a better innovation for the U.S. dollar than a stablecoin. It makes the dollar more available globally. It reinforces it as the global reserve currency. If it gets into the wrong hands, there's due process by which the government can freeze and seize assets. It checks so many boxes: creates buyers for your debt, brings your interest rates lower.” Yesha Yadav, a professor at Vanderbilt University whose research focuses on the Treasury market, is decidedly less enthusiastic about a crypto takeover of the government securities market. She believes that embedding stablecoins into it creates new vulnerabilities. “If the U.S. Treasury market becomes, for whatever reason, stressed, if there are doubts about the U.S.’s ability to make good on its payments, then for stablecoin issuers, it's no longer a safe asset that can substitute as a money claim,” she explains. And if a major stablecoin issuer collapses, it could be forced to dump Treasurys en masse, destabilizing the market. Unlike foreign central banks, stablecoin issuers face genuine run risk: panicked customers can pull funds instantly, triggering immediate selling pressure. Of course, this risk applies to money market funds as well. In 2008, after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the $65 billion Reserve Primary Fund, which held less than 2% of Lehman’s commercial paper, experienced a run and “broke the buck”, forcing it to liquidate its assets. “For the first time, the Treasury market is supporting the moneyness of a payment system by becoming a backstop of an entirely new monetary claim,” Yadav notes. If a crisis hits, will the government have to bail out stablecoin issuers to honor the dollar claims they’ve issued? Policymakers haven’t fully grappled with these questions, and they should, she says. Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at the George Washington University, raises another concern: “The creation of major new demands for Treasury bills and Treasury-backed repos and reverse repos by stablecoin issuers could cause dangerous shortages of available Treasury bills, particularly during periods of financial stress.” He points to past disruptions like the repo market crisis of September 2019 and the “dash for cash” in March 2020 as cautionary tales. For now, another trillion dollars in Treasury demand from stablecoin issuers might seem manageable. But the landscape is shifting fast. Major financial institutions like Bank of America and Fidelity, which manage trillions in assets, are eyeing stablecoin launches. Visa and Stripe-acquired Bridge just rolled out stablecoin-linked cards across Latin America, and Mastercard unveiled a new platform through which users will be able to pay for purchases with stablecoins and withdraw them directly into their bank accounts. Still, Yadav cautions anyone thinking that stablecoins will become a reliable backstop for the U.S. dollar or the Treasury market: “The presumption that stablecoin issuers will simply fill the gap, is not something that policymakers should be counting on,” she warns. And there’s another potential risk: will banks and other stablecoin issuers limit their reserves to Treasurys? Kevin Lehtiniitty, CEO of Borderless.xyz, believes bank-issued stablecoins could become subject to the fractional reserve rules that banks have long used to turn their FDIC-insured deposits into more lucrative growth areas. Perhaps, commercial real estate, subprime mortgages, DeFi? Stay tuned.

Title: Deliveroo deal shows UK still can't hang on to big firms
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp22d2kexo
Time Published: 2025-05-06T08:00:05Z
Full Content:
The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at £2.9bn and will create a company with operations in more than 40 countries. While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years. Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens. Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items – like nappies, flowers and pet food. Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time – Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange. But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much. This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value – its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets. Let's look at another measure – the price of each share. An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%. An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%. What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival – just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets. This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing. There are many reasons. Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half. How can there be such a huge disparity? Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies – the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings – still a massive premium to the UK. One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand. UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled. Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds. But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets – and they have been dead right. In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%. But there are changes afoot. The government's so-called "Edinburgh Reforms", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others. There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan. They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year. The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market. Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had "no immediate" plans to move, he and his company "got a very warm welcome" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it. What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals. Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges. But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here. Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate. Trading on the London Stock Exchange is dwarfed by the trading of currencies, bonds and complex contracts but it has always been a centre of gravity for financial activity and one which many argue has lost its power to attract. Oury Amadou Diallo, 22, did not have licence for modified bike classed as motorcycle, court hears. David Nicholson rents a school kitchen out of hours and cooks meals that are sold on Deliveroo app. Councillors say action is needed from companies to avoid the safety risks being posed to shoppers. Illegally converted bikes are linked to fires while charging, often overnight in users' homes. The London Fire Brigade says e-bikes and e-scooters are the capital's fastest growing fire risk.

The expansion brings Spark’s total value locked (TVL) to $2.4 billion, making it the leading on-chain allocator, per DeFiLlama data. The allocation follows the conclusion of Spark’s "Tokenization Grand Prix," a months-long initiative that awarded capital to three RWA protocols: BlackRock/Securitize’s BUIDL, Superstate’s USTB, and Centrifuge-Anemoy’s JTRSY. “The expanded capital base comes at a time of growing institutional and retail momentum in onchain finance, particularly across Asia Pacific and emerging markets,” the platform shared in a statement with Decrypt. The initial $1 billion allocation, finalized following a Sky governance vote on April 3, deployed $500 million to BUIDL, $300 million to USTB, and $200 million to JTRSY. Spark’s Liquidity Layer automates liquidity provision for USDC, among other stablecoins, directly from Sky across various networks and protocols. The new funds are being distributed to the same recipients as Spark’s original $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix. The latest allocation offers a clearer picture of how tokenized RWAs, primarily short-term U.S. Treasuries, are being actively adopted as primary reserves by major DeFi protocols seeking to stabilize yields and reduce exposure to crypto-native volatility. The Tokenization Grand Prix, launched in July 2024, was an open call for asset issuers to propose RWA products for Spark’s stablecoin-backed treasury. Thirty-nine applications were reviewed by Steakhouse Financial, a firm embedded in the Spark ecosystem with experience underwriting RWA protocols. Evaluations focused on liquidity, pricing transparency, and alignment with Spark’s goal of integrating low-volatility, yield-generating assets into DeFi. The assets were onboarded via the Spark Liquidity Layer (SLL), which holds stablecoins including USDC, USDS, sUSDS, USDe, and sUSDe. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund holds approximately $2.81 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasuries, making it the largest among the three. Superstate’s USTB follows with $490.7 million, while Centrifuge’s JTRSY stands at $237.1 million, according to DeFiLlama data. All three funds are backed by short-duration government debt and structured to reinvest as securities mature. Spark’s role within Sky, a rebranded MakerDAO, has grown since the governance overhaul was announced in August 2024. Now operating as a standalone “Star” (Sky’s designation for modular sub-protocols), Spark has reported around $40 million in revenue in Q1 2025 and launched a USDC Savings Vault, which has attracted more than $41 million in deposits, according to the protocol. The protocol also expanded to Arbitrum and Base earlier this year. While many DeFi protocols have explored exposure to sovereign debt, Spark’s combined $2.4 billion deployment places it ahead of peers. RWA.xyz data shows that total tokenized U.S. Treasury assets across protocols now exceed $3.5 billion, meaning Spark alone accounts for more than two-thirds of the current market.

Title: Conservative Leader Friedrich Merz Set To Become Germany's Chancellor
URL: https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/conservative-leader-friedrich-merz-set-to-become-germanys-chancellor-8341776
Time Published: 2025-05-06T06:08:39Z
Full Content:
Conservative Friedrich Merz is set to be sworn in on Tuesday as Germany's new chancellor at a critical juncture as the economy battles its longest post-war downturn, relations with top security ally the United States fray and the far-right surges. Lawmakers are widely expected to back Merz as chancellor in a vote in the lower house of parliament after his CDU/CSU conservatives, who won February's federal election, secured a coalition deal with the centre-left Social Democrats. The pressure is on for Merz to show leadership after the implosion last November of outgoing SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-way coalition left a political vacuum at the heart of Europe, even as it faced a myriad of crises. "People have been asking Germany to lead for a long time, and there is no more space to not heed that call," said Sudha David-Wilp of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. "Everything that had been undergirding post-war Germany in the past eight decades is no longer the case, whether it be open markets and free trade, whether it be the U.S. security presence in Europe." A global trade war sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping import tariffs is threatening a third year of downturn in Europe's largest economy, which has already had to grapple with the end of cheap Russian gas since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and growing rivalry from China. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened not to come to the aid of fellow members of the NATO defence alliance, prompting even transatlanticist Merz to question the reliability of the United States and urge Europe to improve its ability to defend itself. The German coalition deal has mapped out plans to revive growth such as reducing a corporate tax and lowering energy prices. It also vows strong support for Ukraine and higher military spending. While Merz is a veteran politician who started his career as a European lawmaker in the 1980s, he still has to prove his chops in power as he has never held a government office. After losing a power struggle to arch party rival Angela Merkel in 2002, he spent over a decade working in the private sector before finding his way back into top level politics. A wealthy, Catholic west German lawyer and hobby pilot who served for four years as chairman of the German arm of fund manager BlackRock, Merz is widely considered the antithesis in both style and policy to the woman who led Germany for 16 years. Where Merkel was an even-tempered pragmatist who shifted the conservatives more towards the centre, Merz is a provocative economic liberal who has pulled the bloc back to the right. Merz's supporters highlight the fact he secured a historic fiscal package to boost spending on infrastructure and defence even before taking office. Critics say it was only necessary because of his erratic decision to push an anti-migration motion through parliament with the backing of the Alternative for Germany, breaking a taboo on cooperation with the far-right. That decision boosted support for both the AfD and the far-left Left party, who together secured enough support to be able to block a loosening of Germany's fiscal rules in the next parliament. "Merz remains a black box," said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. "The U-turn on fiscal policies, as much needed as it was, still begs the question why Merz ruled it out during the elections, and does he really have a longer-term vision on the economy?" With the AfD topping some recent polls, the new government's main challenge is clearly to restore confidence and trust in Germany's political centre, said Brzeski. "If this government fails, the AfD will get more support in the next elections and could become part of any next government," he said. Merz's designated cabinet reflects a belief in the need for expertise over political capital and a desire for renewal given the declining trust in the establishment, say analysts. Only one minister from the previous government will retain his position: Defence Minister Boris Pistorius. The rest of the cabinet are new appointees, many of them like the economy minister with private sector experience in the area they will now be governing.

Title: ‘It’s a stunning setting for any cafe, but this one has extra-special credentials’

There is a palpable sense of purpose and job satisfaction among the young adults with Down syndrome who work in the Happy Out cafe in Dún Laoghaire. We are chatting on the outdoor terrace of the cafe in the refurbished Dún Laoghaire Baths building overlooking the harbour. It’s a stunning setting for any cafe, but this one has extra-special credentials because it may be the first commercial cafe in Ireland to employ adults with Down syndrome in partnership with a social enterprise. “I don’t have anyone in my family with Down syndrome, but this opportunity fell into my lap and I thought it would be very nice to do,” says Brian Hanratty, who owns Happy Out cafes on Bull Island and in Donnybrook as well as Dún Laoghaire. Hanratty first came in contact with the Together Academy social enterprise – which trains and finds work for adults with Down syndrome – at its base in the Wanderers Football Club a few years ago. “I helped them set up their coffee shop in the bar at Wanderers and trained them how to make coffee,” Hanratty explains. The Together Academy was cofounded by Therese Coveney, whose 14-year-old daughter April gave her the impetus to set up the social enterprise. “I can feel change in the Dún Laoghaire/Blackrock area since the Happy Out cafe opened [in July 2023]. Most adults with Down syndrome rely on day services when they turn 21, but we wanted robust, industry-recognised training and a job to change the statistic that only 10 per cent of adults with Down syndrome work,” says Coveney. “After Covid, most of us understood what it was like to have meaningless, aimless days with no purpose. We are giving these young adults opportunities to be more independent, to be a valuable part of their community and to be paid employees.” Currently, there are 14 adults with Down syndrome on the roster at Happy Out in Dún Laoghaire. Each person does a three-hour shift – partly because they can’t work more than about 10 hours a week while keeping their disability allowance, but also because three hours is long enough for most of the employees. [ Down syndrome and employment: ‘It shouldn’t be amazing anymore, it should just be the norm’Opens in new window ] “In the beginning we found it hard to get enough guys to work with us but not now. They do everything from serving on the till, making and serving coffee and dealing with orders,” says Hanratty. The cafe has a card-only payment system which reduces potential for errors. Hanratty says the younger generation of customers love seeing adults with Down syndrome working in the cafe, but it has taken some older people a bit of time to get their heads around it. “Some ‘old school’ people don’t expect things to be done right and they will look to another staff member to make sure it’s really happening. But when they see that the staff member with Down syndrome has done the job well, they are very positive,” says Hanratty. The staff working regular eight-hour shifts also have to be a bit more flexible. “When we hire staff, we have to make sure that they know what they are taking on and be willing to help out in certain scenarios, and be more patient at times. They need to know that it’s different to a regular cafe.” Hanratty says the key to everything is to serve good coffee. “If the coffee isn’t good, people will come once and won’t come back, even if they think it’s a nice idea.” Ciara Donohoe from Newtownmountkennedy in Co Wicklow works on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays at Happy Out. “It’s really good and not too hard. It’s very challenging making the drinks and I’m still learning how to be a barista,” she says. [ Down syndrome: ‘Sarah regards herself as a businesswoman... she’s certainly breaking the stereotype’Opens in new window ] Charlie O’Reilly from Sandycove works on Mondays and Fridays: “I love chatting with customers and colleagues when I’m working at Happy Out. It’s a really good business.” Kim Williams from Shankill has a reputation for being good at latte art. “I also do the tills and take orders,” she says, admitting that walking through the cafe when it’s really busy can be a bit difficult. Cafe manager Matthew Roche says some of the staff with Down syndrome can get a bit flustered and emotional if it’s very busy. “We just take some time out in the foyer or outside if this happens – especially on busy days or at the weekends,” he explains. Building up people’s confidence to work front and centre in a public space has taken time, says Coveney. “When we first started training people, there was a lot of heads down, withdrawn people with their headphones on, but they have grown and flourished,” she says. “Working in a cafe won’t suit everyone, but there was something there waiting to be nurtured and educated. “It is about having higher expectations of these young adults but it would be naive to let them fly on their own. They need the supports around them.” Paula Doherty is the Pathways to Employment lead with the Together Academy. Her job involves finding work placements and paid employment for students who have completed the two-year culinary and hospitality programme that Together Academy runs at the Wanderers Football Club. [ Man with Down syndrome who wants to live independently brings council to court over housing assessmentOpens in new window ] “It’s about matching the person with the job and carving out a role for them. This can involve two or three tasks over two mornings a week from, say, 10am-1pm,” she says. “Some businesses are nervous about taking someone on, but once they meet with us and see the supports they get, it eases their minds.” The Together Academy provides backup support for the workers, meeting them before and after their job, and checking in every four to six weeks with three-, six- and 12-monthly reviews. They also do inclusive training with staff and set up a buddy system in the workplace so the person with Down syndrome has one key worker to turn to if they have any concerns. This summer the Together Academy will open a second, larger training centre in SMBC Aviation Capital on Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin. “This will be about providing more programmes for young adults with Down syndrome. It’s about elevating people’s expectations whilst giving people a lot of support,” says Coveney. She adds that all of the staff at Happy Out still live with their families and it has taken a lot of forbearance on their parts. “Many travel to work independently on public transport. We know that we are still working with vulnerable young adults. We take our role very responsibly.” Sylvia Thompson, a contributor to The Irish Times, writes about health, heritage and the environment © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Adani Power aims to expand to 30,670 MW by 2030 using brownfield expansion for quicker execution and competitive advantage. Ather Energy IPO Post-listing Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk Ather Energy made a muted debut on the stock market, opening with a modest 2% gain before slipping 8% intraday to close at approximately ₹303—below its lower issue price of ₹304. The IPO saw a lukewarm response, with the retail portion subscribed just 1.89 times and the HNI segment at a mere 0.69 times. The stock’s weak listing and subsequent dip reflect cautious investor sentiment around its steep valuation. However, continued downward pressure could help realign its valuation, potentially making it more attractive to value-conscious investors. The Indian rupee slipped on Tuesday, tracking mild losses in regional peers and dollar demand from foreign banks, though broader weakness in the greenback limited the decline.

Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) had permitted general insurers to issue surety insurance bonds in April 2022. The bonds are legally enforceable tripartite contracts that seeks to provide hedge against risk involved with infrastructure projects. In the last decade, India has initiated 9,242 PPP infrastructure projects amounting to massive Rs. 68.13 lakh crore. The Government of India (GoI) has also announced to launch several infrastructure projects in water supply and urban transport. Likewise, Indian Railways too has plans for major infrastructure overhaul. To make these projects a reality, India needs to widen the contactors’ pool, who face fund issues, especially with regard to limits that is required under India’s bidding and other processes, said Subrata Mondal, Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of IFFCO-Tokio. This is where the Surety Bond insurance provides respite to contactors and frees up financial burden on them, he said.

But he never cottoned to Bitcoin, although his stance about the technology behind digital assets softened over time. The 94-year-old Buffett, who made his surprise announcement at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting, maintained that Bitcoin would never endure as a unit of value, and once famously called Bitcoin “rat poison squared” in a May 2018 interview with CNBC’s "Squawk Box." He remained skeptical of its usefulness, even after meeting with some of the industry’s most powerful advocates. In a 2018 interview with CNBC earlier in the year, Buffett had said that “cryptocurrencies, generally... with almost certainty… will come to a bad ending." “When it happens or how or anything else, I don’t know,” he added in an interview from Omaha, Nebraska. “If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I’d be glad to do it, but I would never short a dime’s worth.” “We don’t own any, we’re not short on any, we’ll never have a position in them,” he added. “I get into enough trouble with things I think I know something about,” he added. “Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don’t know anything about?” As recently as 2023, even as the price of the asset had surged to new highs in the years prior, Buffett called Bitcoin a "gambling token." He said that people investing in it were chasing easy money, and that investors wanted to "play the roulette wheel" by putting funds into it. To be sure, Buffett was a reluctant tech investor, whose portfolio weighted more to companies in manufacturing and other traditional industries. He began buying shares in Apple only in 2016, although the personal device manufacturer later became the largest part of his holdings. Buffett’s rhetoric about the technology behind Bitcoin changed over the years, too. In a 2019 CNBC interview he said “blockchain was important,” although he called Bitcoin “a delusion" in the same discussion. His remarks echoed the opinions of financial services titans, including JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who praised blockchain technology but slammed Bitcoin. Those firms have subsequently debuted multiple crypto-focused initiatives over the years and shown an increasing willingness to embrace digital assets as a long-term fixture. (Fink is now a fan of Bitcoin; Dimon not so much.) Buffett reiterated his own more nuanced Bitcoin-Blockchain stance during a fancy dinner with Tron founder and crypto mogul Justin Sun, saying that while Bitcoin was just value changing hands and “no different from a seashell,” crypto companies were here to stay. “Bitcoin cannot capture the value of blockchain,” he said at the much-publicized 2020 dinner date. “Just because something has value doesn’t make it a good investment,” Buffett added. Buffett made a living off seeing a company’s value before everyone else, buying up its shares and being patient. But his distaste for the so-called digital gold was perhaps understandable: Buffett also famously avoided commodities like gold and oil.

The problems in question are wide-ranging, from medicine and cybersecurity to materials science and chemistry. But first, there are very practical problems to be solved, such as developing chips that can reliably host large numbers of qubits — short for quantum bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing. As usual in a high-stakes tech race with an uncertain time horizon, tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are at the forefront. Yet startups are also set to play an important role, especially tackling bottlenecks like connectivity and error correction that are critical for scaling quantum systems. But some startups and smaller tech companies are taking on the chip challenge head-on and deserve mention alongside the more attention-grabbing efforts from industry giants. While Big Tech projects typically boast the highest qubit counts, rethinking designs from first principles and using different approaches could yield equally promising results. Here are some of the companies behind the main quantum chip projects that are worth tracking. Akhetonics is a German photonics startup working on an all-optical, general-purpose chip — a contrarian bet in a field where most focus on narrower applications. This bold version and its first-principles approach helped the company raise a €6 million seed funding round led by Matterwave Ventures in November 2024. Alice & Bob is a French startup that raised a $104 million Series B round of funding in January 2025 to continue working toward building a “fault tolerant” quantum computer. Unlike companies focusing only on chips, Alice & Bob is developing a full quantum computing system. To do so, it relies on cat qubits, a type of superconducting qubit designed to reduce errors and simplify error correction. Amazon officially joined the quantum chip race in early 2025 when AWS introduced Ocelot, developed in partnership with the California Institute of Technology. While this is the company’s first quantum chip, AWS had previously launched Braket, a quantum computing service, in partnership with D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti, and others. Atom Computing is a U.S. company building quantum computers with arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms. At the Microsoft Ignite 2024 conference, Microsoft and Atom Computing announced plans to launch a commercial quantum computer in 2025. D-Wave is a quantum computing company whose latest flagship system, the Advantage2 prototype, relies on a process called quantum annealing, which uses quantum physics to find the most stable, lowest-energy arrangements of elements to figure out the best mix for a given problem. Founded in 1999 as a spinoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada, D-Wave is now a public company listed on the NYSE. Illinois-based EeroQ is a startup betting on helium for its quantum chip design. Having raised a $7.25 million seed funding round in 2022 and received regional public support, the company made a $1.1 million commitment in September 2024 toward expanding its HQ in Chicago’s Humboldt Park. In April 2025, Fujitsu and Japanese research institution RIKEN announced having developed a 256-qubit superconducting quantum computer at the RIKEN RQC-FUJITSU Collaboration Center, up from a 64-qubit iteration in 2023. In December 2024, Google announced Willow, its latest quantum computing chip. Google didn’t stop at saying Willow was better than its predecessor, Sycamore, or at describing it as “a major breakthrough in quantum error correction.” In a statement that made headlines, Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven wrote that Willow’s performance lent “credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes.” IBM’s quantum efforts include Condor, its milestone superconducting chip for scaling up to 1,121 qubits, and Heron, a 156-qubit processor focused on improved performance and lower error rates. Founded in 2007, Infleqtion (formerly ColdQuanta) is a US-based company developing quantum computers based on neutral atom technology. Intel is developing quantum computers based on silicon spin qubits. In June 2023, it unveiled Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit research chip, and said a next-generation quantum chip based on Tunnel Falls was expected to be released in 2024, but this hasn’t happened. IonQ is a publicly listed U.S. company developing trapped-ion quantum computers, including the IonQ Forte. After going public via a SPAC in late 2021, it acquired Canadian networking specialist Entangled Networks. IQM is a Finnish startup building superconducting quantum computers and is a spinout of the Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. It received funding in its early days from the Business Finland government agency, followed by additional support from the EIC Accelerator program. In 2022, IQM raised €128 million in Series A2 funding led by World Fund, adding to the €39 million led by MIG Fonds it had raised in 2020 as part of what was then its Series A. This second tranche included part of a previously announced €35 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank, as well as participation from the EIC Fund and others. In February 2025, Microsoft introduced Majorana, a quantum chip using a topological core architecture. Microsoft previously declared that it expected to build a quantum supercomputer within 10 years. As its name suggests, Oxford Ionics is a British startup that spun out of Oxford University and focuses on trapped-ion quantum computing. It raised a £30 million Series A (approximately $36 million) in early 2023, followed by an additional £2 million (approximately €2.32 million) from the UK’s National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF) that same year. More recently, it was selected for DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) alongside Quantinuum. Pasqal is a French startup taking a full-stack approach to quantum computing and betting on neutral atoms. The company emerged out of the Institut d’Optique in 2019, and its co-founders include 2022 Nobel Prize laureate for physics and professor Alain Aspect. In February 2023, Pascal raised a €100 million Series B funding round led by Singapore’s Temasek, with participation from existing investors Quantonation, the Defense Innovation Fund, Daphni, and Eni Next, as well as new investors European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund, Wa’ed Ventures, and Bpifrance (through its Large Venture Fund). PsiQuantum is a quantum computing startup using photonics technology and aiming to build “a 1 million-quantum-bit machine.” In February 2025, it announced Omega, a quantum photonic chipset manufactured at GlobalFoundries in New York. In 2021, PsiQuantum landed a $450 million Series D investment led by BlackRock, which is now said to be leading a potential $750 million round into the company at a $6 billion pre-money valuation. Founded by Australian academics, it is also backed by the Australian and Queensland governments. Qilimanjaro is a Spanish startup focusing on analog quantum app-specific integrated circuits (QASICs) and taking a full-stack approach, including hardware, software, and applications. Based in Barcelona, it won the Four Years From Now startup competition at Mobile World Congress in 2024, going on to receive €1.5 million in funding from Catalonia later that year. Quandela is a French startup founded in 2017 to develop photonic quantum computers. In November 2023, Quandela raised a €50 million Series B and received support from the French government through the France 2030 Plan. Quantinuum is a quantum computing company formed in 2021 by the merger of Cambridge Quantum and Honeywell Quantum Solutions. Its flagship product is the H-Series of trapped-ion quantum computers. In April 2024, together with Microsoft, it announced a breakthrough in error correction. QuantWare is a Dutch startup that came up with a proprietary 3D chip architecture, VIO, which focuses on scaling bottlenecks in quantum processing units (QPUs). It started accepting preorders for Contralto-A, its first QPU for quantum error correction, in February 2025. Founded in 2020, it is a spinout of TU Delft and its affiliated research institute, QuTech. In March 2025, and following a €6 million seed round in 2023, it announced having raised a €20 million Series A (approximately $19.27 million) — including €5 million in equity out of the €7.5 million it previously secured from the European Innovation Council (the remainder is a grant). Boston-based QuEra is betting on neutral atoms as the “best approach to achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.” Its products include Aquila, a 256-qubit analog neutral-atom quantum computer launched in 2022 and accessible via Amazon Braket. QuEra is notably backed by Google, which led the $230 debt round that the quantum startup raised in February 2025 — with a convertible note also backed by SoftBank, Valor, and existing investors. Founded in 2013 by Chad Rigetti, Rigetti Computing is a quantum company focusing on superconducting technology. Its range of products include Ankaa-3 and the uppcoming 336-qubit Lyra system. Just like rivals D-Wave and IonQ, Rigetti Computing is a listed company; it raised just under $200 million in VC capital before going public via a SPAC in 2021. In February 2025, it signed a strategic partnership with Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, which is set to invest $35 million and purchase shares of Rigetti, while both companies invest more than $100 million each over the next five years to accelerate the development and commercialization of superconducting quantum computing. U.S. quantum startup SEEQC — an acronym for “scalable, energy efficient quantum computing” — is a spinout of chip company Hypres, which was itself established by former employees of IBM’s superconducting electronics division. In 2023, SEEQC announced a partnership with Nvidia to build an “all-digital, ultra-low-latency chip-to-chip link between quantum computers and GPUs.” In January 2025, SEEQC raised a $30 million round of funding co-led by Booz Allen Ventures and Japanese-European VC firm NordicNinja. Other backers include Merck’s corporate venture capital arm, M Ventures. SEEQC is leading the U.K.-supported QuPharma project to explore how quantum computing can accelerate drug discovery, in partnership with BASF and Merck. SpinQ is a Chinese startup founded in 2018 that develops quantum computers. It claims that some of them are portable and making use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Xanadu is a Canadian startup aiming to build quantum computers through a photonic approach. In January 2025, it introduced Aurora, a 12-qubit system, including 35 photonic chips. Founded in 2016, Xanadu raised some $275 million to date, including a $100 million Series C in November 2022 at a $1 billion valuation.

Title: Germany's chancellor-in-waiting: Who is Friedrich Merz?

He has never held a top position in government, yet he has become Germany's tenth chancellor. DW takes a look at the life of Friedrich Merz. Friedrich Merz has made it to the chancellery after a bumpy start. He needed an unprecedented second vote to secure the necessary majority in the Bundestag in what was a historic debacle in German politics. Now Merz's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) the regional Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) will be working together as Germany's new government. For Merz, it is a big step in an unusual career. Merz, who is 69 years old, has never held a top governmental office with significant leadership responsibilities. He has never been a federal minister, or a state premier, or even mayor of a small town. He is the oldest chancellor to take office since Konrad Adenauer, the first post-war German head of government (1949–1963). The previous weeks were also the first time he had ever taken part in negotiations aimed at forming a government coalition. The media, as well as some unnamed representatives from the negotiation teams, have at times held this against him. The SPD leaders, Lars Klingbeil and Saskia Esken, and the head of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), Markus Söder, all have experience in this particular kind of wrangling. But as the would-be head of government, Merz hopes to lead a coalition between the CDU and these parties, and mediate between their interests. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video According to the German business magazine Wirtschaftswoche, Merz is a "trans-atlanticist, friend of Europe, and reformer." This, it wrote, could mean he was "exactly the right person for the current times." From 1989 to 1994, Merz was a member of the European Parliament. This was followed by 15 years in the Bundestag, between 1994 and 2009, during which he rose to become head of the CDU's parliamentary group, only to lose out to Angela Merkel in a struggle for the party leadership. Over these years, he took a particular interest in Germany's relationship with the United States. A commercial lawyer, Merz hails from Sauerland, an area of North Rhine-Westphalia, east of the Ruhr, where he still lives. It's predominantly a middle-class, rural region, popular with tourists, that tends to espouse conservative, Catholic values. Merz was clearly more traditionally conservative than his East German rival, the quantum chemist Angela Merkel. Early in his career, he was a close confidant of the now-deceased veteran CDU politician Wolfgang Schäuble, who was a member of the German parliament for more than 50 years. Merz chose not to stand for parliament again in 2009, and went on to pursue a career in business. From 2016 to 2020, he was chairman of the supervisory board of the German arm of BlackRock, currently the world's largest asset management company, and during this time he was often in the United States on business. It wasn't until 2021 that Merz ran again for the Bundestag, and was elected. In fleshing out his plans for government, he has been more outspoken than his taciturn predecessorOlaf Scholz, Merz frequently makes a point of mentioning that, for several months now, he has been in regular contact with European heads of government: dinner with France's President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace, bilateral talks in Berlin or Brussels. He also intends to travel to the US before the summer recess to meet Republican President Donald Trump. In a particularly striking example, Merz gave an hour-long TV interview to the German political talk show Caren Miosga eight days before the Easter weekend, in which he spoke about continuing military aid to Ukraine, going significantly beyond the "red line" repeatedly drawn by Chancellor Scholz. Merz raised the prospect of Germany delivering Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv. These long-range, high-impact weapons would be of great assistance to Ukraine, and could seriously pressure Russia. He added that the UK, France, and US had already been supplying cruise missiles, and if the weapons supply was coordinated with its allies, "Germany should also participate." He commented that the Ukrainian army "has to get out of the defensive position — all it does is react." It needed to "be able to exert some control over what's happening." Merz even explicitly mentioned the possibility of Ukraine destroying the Crimean Bridge, a key strategic link between Russia and the unilaterally annexed Crimean peninsula. With this rhetoric and level of detail, Merz has positioned himself in direct opposition to Scholz, who consistently opposed Taurus deliveries and warned against any further escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Continued support for Ukraine is only one element of the broader political upheaval in Germany that has resulted from the policies of the new US administration — an upheaval that at times has caused Merz's standing and credibility to plummet. For months, both in the Bundestag and on the campaign trail, Merz and other conservative politicians emphasized the importance of adhering to Germany's debt brake, and called for fiscal discipline. This abruptly changed with the start of the exploratory talks between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. By mid-March, both of Germany's legislative chambers had approved a historically unprecedented decision: From now on, there will be no cap on defense spending. A package worth €500 billion ($570 billion) is also being introduced, aimed at improving Germany's crumbling infrastructure. This entails easing the debt brake to which, during the election campaign, the CDU and CSU had initially promised to adhere. Meanwhile, Merz — and all the mainstream parties — have the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) pressuring them from behind. Observers say the AfD's gains in the most recent election have prompted the future coalition partners to include stricter immigration policies and a greater focus on internal security in the coalition agreement. Just days before the federal election, Merz sparked controversy and confusion, both at home and abroad, by effectively weakening the "firewall" that he, along with all the other mainstream parties, had pledged to maintain against the AfD. Merz accepted the AfD's backing in several parliamentary votes on migration policy, in a bid to help the CDU/CSU and pro-business Free Deomcratic Party (FDP) defeat the remaining red-green votes, which by then no longer held a majority. This move triggered a wave of outrage among politicians and in German civil society. Now, Merz says he wants to boost the confidence of the German people. "We are a great country of more than 80 million people, who live and work here and take care of their families," he said. He wants to show "that the effort is worth it."

IBIT holdings surge as BlackRock's broader Bitcoin exposure strategy unfolds. BlackRock expanded its exposure to Bitcoin-linked assets in the first quarter of 2025, pushing its total investments to more than $5.4 billion, according to data from Timechainindex. Between the last quarter of 2024 and March 2025, BlackRock added over 3.2 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to its portfolio. This move brought its total IBIT holdings to around 5.85 million shares, valued at roughly $274 million. In an interesting shift, BlackRock also began investing in rival spot Bitcoin ETFs. It purchased nearly 71,000 shares of Fidelity’s FBTC and made smaller allocations to Grayscale’s GBTC and GBTC Mini products. This marks the firm’s first foray into rival ETFs, reflecting a broader strategy aimed at tapping into multiple channels of Bitcoin market exposure. Combined, these holdings are valued at more than $5 million. Altogether, BlackRock’s total position in spot Bitcoin ETFs has reached approximately $279 million. At the same time, the firm increased its exposure to companies with direct ties to Bitcoin. The asset management firm increased its stake in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) to over 14.4 million shares during the quarter. The firm also acquired more than 620,000 of MicroStrategy’s Series A preferred shares and nearly 15 million shares across two of the company’s commercial notes. These positions bring BlackRock’s total exposure to Strategy to over $4.23 billion. Meanwhile, BlackRock also deepened its positions in Bitcoin mining companies, pushing its investments in these cohorts to almost $1 billion, with investments in Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, TeraWulf, and others.

Title: Stablecoins Could Soon Replace China As Top U.S. Creditor

ByJon Helgi Egilsson ByJon Helgi Egilsson, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Jon Egilsson explores crypto, decentralized finance, and regulation. ByJon Helgi Egilsson, Contributor. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent views stablecoins as a strategic tool to boost U.S. Treasury demand ... More and strengthen dollar dominance. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) A powerful U.S. Treasury advisory group sees stablecoins emerging as a major new source of demand for government debt. With the market projected to reach $2 trillion by 2028—nearly all of it dollar-denominated. At its meeting last week, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee —comprising senior executives from BlackRock, JPMorgan, and other major financial institutions reporting to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessen—highlighted the stablecoin market as a rapidly expanding force in creating new Treasury demand. The implication is clear: current regulatory proposals could channel more stablecoin reserves into U.S. Treasuries than China currently holds. While the committee stopped short of making direct comparisons, its analysis suggests that if projected growth materializes and legislation like the GENIUS Act is enacted, stablecoin demand could rival that of traditional sovereign creditors. The GENIUS Act, expected to pass in 2025, would regulate stablecoin issuers and link reserves ... More directly to short-term U.S. Treasuries. With the GENIUS Act expected this August, U.S. dollar stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle will be required to hold reserves—including Treasuries—positioning them as major institutional buyers. That demand could surpass the $784 billion currently held by China, reshaping how the U.S. finances its debt. This isn’t just regulatory housekeeping—it’s strategic fiscal architecture. “The ultimate design and adoption of stablecoins will drive the magnitude of impact they have on U.S. Treasury demand,” the TBAC wrote in its meeting minutes. By designating T-bills with maturities under 93 days as eligible reserves, the proposed rules would position stablecoin issuers as key players at the front end of the curve. The GENIUS Act goes further, allowing those Treasuries to be used as repo collateral—making them even more attractive as backing for stablecoins. Japan and China—the top two foreign holders of U.S. Treasuries—currently hold $1.13 trillion and $784 billion, respectively. Combined, that’s still less than the projected $2 trillion market cap of stablecoins by 2028. If that projection holds, U.S. dollar stablecoins could soon rival or surpass traditional sovereign creditors. This isn’t just crypto—it’s a structural shift in how America funds itself, trading geopolitical reliance for market-based infrastructure powered by code and regulation. Stablecoin issuers are already acting like institutional buyers of U.S. Treasuries. Over $120 billion in short-term Treasuries back stablecoins today, with another $90 billion in money market funds. Unlike banks, which operate on fractional reserves, stablecoin issuers—under proposed U.S. rules—would hold full reserves, making them a steady, transparent source of Treasury demand. This shift has high-level backing. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called stablecoins “a new channel of strategic demand,” saying they not only expand access to the dollar but also “support sustained demand for U.S. Treasury bills.” Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has backed the role of stablecoins in extending U.S. dollar access globally—especially in high-inflation countries and regions with limited banking. “U.S. dollar stablecoins could be particularly appealing to those in high-inflation countries or to those without easy or affordable access to dollar cash or banking services,” Waller said. “I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally.” According to a report by the venture firm a16z, stablecoins are crypto’s first “killer app.” In 2024, stablecoins facilitated $15.6 trillion in transfers—roughly equivalent to Visa’s annual volume. In March alone, stablecoin transactions hit a record $1.82 trillion, the report stated. While much of this is financial flows rather than retail payments, it highlights their rapid adoption in global finance. As trade tensions and tariff wars strain U.S.–China ties, Washington looks to stablecoins to reduce ... More its reliance on foreign creditors. As China steadily pulls back—its U.S. Treasury holdings dropping from $1.32 trillion in 2013 to $784 billion—Washington faces a question: who fills the gap? The TBAC suggests stablecoins might. With legislation expected by August, the U.S. could soon have a framework that turns stablecoins from crypto fringe into fiscal foundation. McKinsey estimates global bank deposits at $117 trillion; if less than 8% of this flows into dollar-backed stablecoins, it would exceed all foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries. If current projections hold and regulation advances, the next major buyer of U.S. Treasuries may not be China or any foreign government—but a global network of dollar-backed stablecoins.

Since returning to office in January 2025, US President Donald Trump has aggressively pursued a radical reshaping of US foreign policy. In early March, the State Department terminated foreign assistance programs supporting political opposition and regime change in Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, as it deemed them no longer in the US’s “national interest.” Trump also reversed the Biden administration’s agreement with Cuba, after it released 553 prisoners, to ease sanctions on the country. In February, the government issued an executive order to dissolve the Inter-American Foundation, an organization that had long promoted economic and community-led development in Latin America. The African Development Foundation is also slated to be eliminated under the executive order. And AFRICOM, the US military command for Africa, could be next. Trump’s sweeping cuts extend to global initiatives like the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), the US Agency for Global Media, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and US support for political prisoners worldwide. Facing a divided opposition, a largely compliant Grand Old Party (GOP) and key loyalists in power, Trump’s teardown of the foreign policy establishment is well underway. In place of the US-led multilateral order, he is embracing a blunt, America First, transactional approach to international affairs centered on military threats, economic coercion through tariffs and sanctions, and stricter immigration policies — stripped of the usual lip service to human rights. One of Trump’s first priorities has been a more aggressive crackdown on unauthorized migration. Weeks into his term, his administration began transferring undocumented immigrants to Guantanamo Bay. While migrant and advocacy groups challenged this action, in March a federal judge “expressed doubts toward those challenging the federal policy,” according to an article by The New York Times. Now, alleged Venezuelan gang members are being sent to El Salvador under a detention agreement with Trump ally El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. Panama, Costa Rica and Honduras have also agreed to accept third-party nationals, under the pressure of tariffs being imposed and other economic measures. Trump is also seeking greater control over strategic infrastructure abroad. In March, a consortium led by US firm Blackrock acquired both Panama Canal ports in a $19 billion deal, which underscores the role of the private sector in realizing his goals. Chinese state-run media criticized the Hong Kong-based seller and labeled the move as “economic coercion.” With Chinese entities removed from the canal, Trump has increasingly hinted at possible military action to secure even broader control over the Panama Canal. In his first term, Trump floated the idea of sending private military companies to Venezuela to topple Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a tactic that could resurface. Tensions with NATO allies have played out publicly. This has undermined the transatlantic alliance crucial to the US-led global order, with Trump wielding tariffs and even threats of annexation to pressure partners. Trump is also using US aid as leverage to highlight the dependence of partner countries, like shutting off intelligence-sharing and military aid to Ukraine, one of the several pressure tactics used to push Kyiv toward peace talks with Russia. In turn, Senior Advisor to Donald Trump Elon Musk briefly hinted at disabling Starlink services in Ukraine, which are vital for the country’s military communications, before walking back his comments. This pattern of signaling intent is common among Trump allies — before the March 14 executive order was issued to force Voice of America to shut down, Musk publicly called for its closure in February. To continue with his overhaul, Trump must dismantle much of the entrenched civil service and foreign policy bureaucracy, which he struggled with during his first term. Career officials, including some Republicans like John McCain, resisted his agenda through leaks, delays and policy changes. Their efforts were complemented by the GOP’s disdain for the civil service, which has shifted increasingly left in recent decades. In the final months of his first term, Trump issued Schedule F, an executive order that reclassified certain career positions as political appointments, thereby making them easier to dismiss. US President Joe Biden rescinded this order when he took office in January 2021. Dismantling a decades-old political apparatus is no simple feat. Since World War II, Washington has built a vast ecosystem of non-governmental organizations, think tanks and development agencies that shape US foreign policy and diplomacy. Even after the September 11 terror attacks, as President George W. Bush leaned heavily on hard power with the launch of the Global War on Terror, his administration also introduced initiatives like the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the President’s Malaria Initiative, to maintain international goodwill while waging unpopular wars. These programs, alongside organizations like the Peace Corps, the US Trade and Development Agency and others mentioned previously, were all repurposed by various administrations, awarded lucrative contracts and had close ties to policymakers. Over time, a revolving door of agencies, contractors and policymakers has reinforced and expanded this system, consolidating funding and influence. Until 2006, USAID’s website openly stated, “The principal beneficiary of America’s foreign assistance programs has always been the United States,” with nearly 80% of USAID contracts and grants flowing to US firms. By 2018, of the $48 billion in official development assistance (ODA), 21% went to governments, 20% to nonprofit organizations, 34% to multilateral organizations and 25% elsewhere. Despite reaching nearly $80 billion in 2023 under the Biden administration, ODA still accounted for just 1.17% of the federal budget. Trump’s efforts to undermine ODA may not just be limited to cutting its spending but also extend to dismantling the core institutions that have driven American foreign policy for decades. Now, in his second term, his purge of the civil service is far more aggressive. After labeling institutions like USIP and the Inter-American Foundation as politicized and aligned with Democratic priorities, Trump has made it harder for Democrats to justify billions of dollars for projects abroad — especially given longstanding concerns over ODA’s efficiency. In 2015, the acting deputy inspector general flagged USAID’s “chronic, systemic weaknesses,” citing poor oversight, weak risk management and human capital issues. By 2017, as Trump intensified scrutiny, the Carnegie Endowment reported that USAID “lacked programmatic focus” and found both the State Department and USAID were overstretched, with little evaluation of their effectiveness. Aid often went to corrupt governments, was too small to make an impact and failed to give Washington meaningful leverage. USIP, originally designed for conflict resolution when introduced in 1984, has increasingly been viewed by critics as a vehicle for nation-building. Similarly, AFRICOM, established in 2007 to promote US national security interests in Africa, has turned its focus toward counterterrorism, with limited results. Aid recipients also face restrictions, often required to purchase goods and services from donor countries like the US. Other areas of ODA, such as global media outreach, promote a more traditional approach favored by Democrats and established foreign policy experts, have also lost their strategic edge as rival powers have undercut their effectiveness. US-backed media outlets like Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty have seen their influence wane amid competition from alternative international networks like Al Jazeera, RT and China’s state-run media. These competitors have reshaped the global information sphere, while decentralized information and social media platforms have proven more effective at reaching audiences. Meanwhile, China’s Belt and Road Initiative has demonstrated the effectiveness of direct infrastructure development investment, offering countries tangible benefits in exchange for strategic concessions, such as port access for Chinese ships. Russia and Israel, in contrast, have shown how unilateral military force can be used to advance foreign policy objectives. Trump views America’s lingering military and economic dominance as key tools for reasserting US power in a changing global order. His more aggressive military stance and mercantilist economic approach prioritize coercion over multilateralism, seeking immediate and concrete gains in the national interest. While previous administrations invested in steady economic and diplomatic maneuvering, Trump’s strategy emphasizes swift tariffs, threats and direct pressure to drive markets and provoke immediate reactions. This approach is unpalatable to the ingrained culture of the current foreign policy bureaucracy. If successful in reshaping American foreign policy, Trump will force a departure from Washington’s historical promotion of free trade. Former US presidents like Bill Clinton, Bush and Barack Obama all reduced tariffs. While Biden eased some with the European Union, he raised them on China. Trump’s global tariff increases and trade wars will have far-reaching implications; it could signal the potential end of the US as a faithful consumer market, challenge the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency and question its commitment to protecting global sea lanes. American democracy promotion, which is never a consistent priority, is now without even rhetorical commitment. While the US has long backed autocrats, Trump’s acceptance of strongman rule extends to adversaries. His recent characterization of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a dictator while avoiding such language for Russian President Vladimir Putin shows a deliberate loosening of ideological constraints. Additionally, the US has long been averse to international law, refusing to ratify the International Criminal Court and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Yet, it has traditionally played a central role in upholding basic global legal frameworks, with Europe often supporting its efforts. Now shunning Europe, Washington’s acceptance of border changes by Russia and Israel signals a growing respect for force, whether from allies or adversaries. China, Iran and others are taking note. They may soon strongly mirror the US’s use of economic and political pressure, reducing the autonomy of smaller countries. Trump’s ongoing dismantling of the foreign policy establishment does not indicate an American retreat from global affairs, but a radical overhaul. Washington is shedding the post-World War II and post-Cold War neoliberal order it created, characterized by multilateralism, in favor of a more confrontational, transactional approach based on unilateral strength. The erosion of institutions is another mark of the end of America’s “unipolar moment” and a return to a more volatile and unpredictable era of global affairs.

Title: Ben Powell on Market Volatility: Riding the global investment seesaw

BlackRock Investment Institute's APAC Investment Strategist Ben Powell in an interview to ET Now acknowledged market volatility and emphasized that investors must adapt to this new reality. He advised staying calm, avoiding overreaction to short-term movements, and instead focusing on long-term structural shifts to guide investment decisions. Despite ongoing global concerns, market sentiment has recently turned more positive. One of the key contributors has been the continued strength of the AI sector, which is driving growth particularly in the US. India is also benefiting from favorable developments, such as falling oil prices and a more balanced geopolitical position. Notably, the S&P 500 has achieved a nine-day winning streak — a milestone not seen since 2004 — reflecting the strength of current market momentum. Ben Powell attributed the current equity rally to strong earnings, especially from major tech companies. These firms have consistently outperformed expectations, fueled by the ongoing AI boom. Despite widespread concerns, the hard data — particularly earnings reports — has shown resilience. This earnings strength is now the core reason behind the market's recent upswing, rather than sentiment alone. Powell stressed that the global equity landscape has changed dramatically over the past decade. Today, investors need to be more selective and nuanced, especially when considering emerging markets. These markets are not uniform, and in a world increasingly fractured by geopolitical and economic divisions, picking the right markets is essential. Both the US and India stand out as strong contenders in this environment. India is emerging as a key beneficiary of current global shifts. The country stands to gain from the recent decline in oil prices, which supports its macroeconomic stability. Additionally, India’s unique geopolitical stance allows it to negotiate favorable trade arrangements with multiple partners. The Reserve Bank of India may also find more flexibility in its monetary policy, further strengthening the country's economic outlook. Despite recent market gains, risks remain. Powell pointed out that the US economy is still expected to face a contraction, partly due to unresolved trade tensions and potential new tariffs from the US administration. Structural challenges such as labor market disruptions and supply chain issues are also likely to affect corporate earnings and broader economic stability in the coming quarters. Acknowledging the unpredictable nature of the current environment, Powell urged investors to accept that we are no longer in the era of stability seen a decade ago. With rising uncertainty driven by AI, geopolitics, and trade conflicts, the key is to stay grounded and focus on the fundamentals. Even though the headwinds are real, Powell believes the tailwinds — particularly from AI — are powerful enough to keep certain sectors moving forward. Markets are being buoyed by strong corporate earnings, especially in the tech sector, and by transformative forces like artificial intelligence. India continues to benefit from global rebalancing and macroeconomic tailwinds. However, challenges such as an expected slowdown in the US economy and unresolved trade issues remain. In this complex environment, Powell advises sticking to long-term investment principles and recognizing where sustainable growth is likely to emerge.

Title: The Degen Banker: When Wall Street Meets Crypto Twitter (Nkahiseng Ralepeli)

Once upon a time, calling yourself a “degen” was financial heresy. It meant you YOLO’d into dog coins, aped into DeFi yield farms with 6,000% APRs, and spent more time in Discord than on Bloomberg. You were a creature of chaos, allergic to compliance decks and powered by memes and Metamask. But times have changed. Today, the degen banker is no longer a contradiction in terms. It’s a job description. It’s also a symptom of something far more seismic: the full-on convergence between crypto-native innovation and institutional finance. And if you’re still under the impression that institutions are sitting this one out, let me offer you a very different reality—one backed by numbers, balance sheets, and, yes, some very large suits chasing digital alpha. From Edge to Centre: Institutional Inflows Are Here Crypto may have been born in rebellion, but it’s growing up in a three-piece suit. In 2024 alone, over $10 billion in institutional capital flowed into digital asset products globally, with Bitcoin ETFs accounting for nearly $5 billion of that figure in just the first quarter of their U.S. launch. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone crossed $15 billion in AUM within five months of going live. That’s not degen retail—those are RIAs, wealth managers, and pension funds, slowly but surely embracing exposure. And it’s not just ETFs. 47% of hedge funds now have digital asset exposure, up from just 33% in 2022, according to PwC’s latest global crypto hedge fund report. Meanwhile, tokenized U.S. Treasuries—yes, on-chain government bonds—grew by over 450% in the past year, surpassing $1.5 billion in market cap, with players like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock issuing tokenized bonds on public and permissioned blockchains. Tokenized treasuries have now surpassed the $5 billion mark. What’s more, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan, HSBC, and Standard Chartered now all have live pilots or products in tokenization, custody, or blockchain-based payments. No longer science experiments, these projects are tied to core infrastructure upgrades and new commercial models. In 2023, JPMorgan’s Onyx processed over $900 billion in value using blockchain for repo transactions. That’s not weekend degen liquidity; that’s wholesale capital markets saying, “We’ll have what DeFi’s having—but with compliance, please.” Why Institutions Are Frothing to Play Let’s not kid ourselves—institutions aren’t here because they suddenly developed a soft spot for decentralisation. They’re here because: So yes, the gold rush is real. But this time, it's not prospectors with pickaxes—it's institutions with policy teams and quarterly earnings calls. The Great Cultural Merge The cultural tension here is delicious. Imagine a DeFi protocol engineer explaining LP mechanics to a middle-office credit team. Or a banker asking a DAO treasurer how to assess counterparty risk when the counterparty is pseudonymous. But it’s happening. Slowly, messily, and with a lot of mutual mistrust—but it’s happening. This cultural merge is forcing both sides to evolve: And for all the friction, the convergence is producing real-world innovation: programmable bonds, on-chain invoices, stablecoin-based treasury products, and more. So, What’s a Degen Banker, Really? A degen banker isn’t just a meme or an oxymoron. It’s a recognition that the future of finance is hybrid. It’s someone who understands that slippage and spreads matter just as much as smart contract audits. That compliance isn’t a blocker—it’s a moat. That building trustless infrastructure doesn’t mean we abandon trust; it means we rebuild it on different rails. And let’s be honest: the degen bankers are winning. Because while crypto’s early believers were often dismissed as naïve gamblers, it turns out we were early to a fundamental truth: money is information, and the next generation of financial infrastructure would be digital, open, and programmable. Today, institutions are just catching up. Final Word We are no longer in a world of “either/or.” We are living the “both/and.” You can trade options and still mint NFTs. You can issue a bond and wrap it on Ethereum. You can quote LIBOR and know what MEV is. That’s the world we’re heading into. The only question is: are you still watching from the sidelines? Or are you ready to go full degen—in a tie?

Title: The Irish passport at 100: Not just a travel document but a declaration of hope and of reclaiming identity

Weeks after Terence Reynolds, originally from Cloncowley, Drumlish, Co Longford, died at his home in Yonkers in New York, his daughter Christina found an old suitcase in the attic. “[It had] a single identifying label in cream tape with a handwritten writing stating CLONCOWLEY,” she wrote in reply to a request from the Department for Foreign Affairs for stories about Irish passports. The story of Terence Reynolds is one of scores told in an exhibition on the history of the now 100-years-old passport at Epic, the Irish emigration museum on Custom House Quay in Dublin. Throughout, it has not just been a travel document, but often a declaration of hope in a better future for those who left Ireland’s shores, or a reclaiming of identity by many of those in the Irish diaspora today. The suitcase was the one Terence Reynolds, a carpenter, had carried from his Cloncowley home: “Inside, I found what I believe was my dad’s very first Irish passport. It was in pristine condition, frozen in time.” His photograph was one she had never seen before, revealing “a very young, fresh-faced” man “full of hope, ambition, and the quiet determination that would carry him across the Atlantic”. “I sat there imagining this young 20-year-old in 1968 getting on a plane for the first time and landing in 1960s New York, taking up abode in Inwood,” his daughter writes. The contribution by Christina Reynolds illustrates one of the key themes of the On The Move exhibition, says Epic’s historian, Catherine Healy: “We really wanted to tap into the emotions around passports.” The first Irish passports were used by WT Cosgrave, Desmond Fitzgerald and the delegation that went to Geneva in 1923 to take up the Irish Free State’s League of Nations place “to resounding applause”. The public began to apply for the passports from April 1924, although significant tensions emerged between Dublin and London over the terminology to be used. Writing from London, Fitzgerald, the minister for external relations, told the department’s top official, Joseph P Walshe, of a meeting with “a most objectionable” Foreign Office official. The British were insistent that the term “British subject” be used, arguing that any other language breached the Anglo-Irish Treaty and would “cause endless trouble and confusion”. Regarding the Irish passport as “a branch” of the British one, the British side, the records show, “didn’t want Irishmen going around over in the US saying that they’re not British subjects”. The British arguments were a nonsense, Fitzgerald told them, since “the term ‘British subject’ included everyone from (prime minister Stanley) Baldwin to an undiscovered savage in British Guiana”. In the end, an uneasy compromise was reached: “Ultimately, bearers were described as a ‘citizen of the Irish Free State, one of the British Commonwealth of Nations’,” says Healy. The early troubles did not end there because British consular officials sometimes refused to recognise the passport or doctored it if it was handed in to them, writing “British subject” in, she says. The first passport, well finished with a hard cover, cost 1 shilling. For most in the 1920s and 1930s, and later, it was not a declaration of pride but an exit document required for emigration. Now available usually within days, for decades passports took longer to get. “Passport officials were handwriting documents right up until the 1990s,” says Healy. Security has tightened, too. A cabinet illuminated by ultraviolet light highlights just some of the security features of today’s passports, including Celtic imagery invisible to the naked eye. The latest electronic passports now display the holders’ biometric image three times – as a photograph, a laser imprint and a hologram. Tougher security was prompted from the late 1980s following a series of incidents, including the conviction of an Irish official in 1989 who sold passports to North African buyers. In 2010, Micheál Martin, then the Minister for Foreign Affairs, ordered an Israeli diplomat to leave Ireland after Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad, used Irish passports in the Dubai killing of a leading Hamas figure. [ From the archive: Fake passports? They're part of a very long storyOpens in new window ] The exhibition tells the stories of the famous, and those not so famous. Poet, WB Yeats – by then a senator – travelled on Irish, not British documents, to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in Stockholm in December 1923. Not every artist thought the same way, however. James Joyce, who lived in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s , never applied for one: “That surprised me,” says Healy. However, he did seek one during the second World War for his daughter, Lucia, who he tried to move to Switzerland from the Parisian mental asylum where she was staying. “German officials were already aware that she had British papers and said that it wouldn’t be possible. She remained (in Paris) until 1951,” says the Epic historian. Joyce never explained his attitude. “It could have been purely pragmatic,” she says, “or possibly resentment against the Free State, which he saw as quite suffocating. “In one of his letters to his son, he says he was advised to get an Irish passport, and he declined and got a British replacement instead. So, he consciously chose not to do so.” For others, however, an Irish passport has been hugely important. Take Abigail O’Reilly, two of whose grandparents, Bill Phillips and his wife, Jean, left Cabra and Fairview respectively for 1960s England. “They were part of the ‘forgotten generation’,” says O’Reilly, telling of how her grandparents “ended up working together on the buses where he was the driver and she the conductor”. During a break in Covid restrictions, O’Reilly moved to Dublin in 2020 for college. “My grandfather and I have forged a really special bond. He has started opening up to me about his childhood,” she says. Suffering from dementia, his childhood memories are now uppermost in his mind; cycling through Moore Street with friends, knowing Brendan Behan. “Ireland now seems to hold a much more romantic and nostalgic place in his mind,” says O’Reilly. A year ago, she received her own Irish passport. “I feel incredibly lucky and proud to have been able to return to a country which my grandparents were not able to remain in. I feel all the more connected to them,” she says. The exhibition also tells of the secrets of the past, including of the adoption of thousands of Irish children who were sent abroad on Irish passports until the 1970s, “With their birth name in the document”, says Healy. She tells the story of Brian Burke, who was born in Dublin to a single mother and spent his first year in St Patrick’s Infant Hospital in Blackrock. “He was adopted by an American couple in the US in the 1950s, even though legislation at the time didn’t allow overseas adoptions. In his photo, he’s just over a year-and-a-half old,” she says. Once adopted, his name was changed to Daniel Doherty. Before his mother died, his adoptive mother shared with him his carefully kept adoption records. Embarking on his journey to discover his Irish heritage, he requested in 2021, when he renewed his passport seven decades later, that both of his names would appear. And now they do. A year later, he returned to Ireland, learning of “an amazing family history”. “I am blessed and thankful for the life I was given and the path I was set on so long ago,” he said. “I am proud to be from Ireland and I value my Irish citizenship. It has been an amazing journey that started 70 years ago with a little green Irish passport.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Arizona Governor Shoots Down Plans for State Bitcoin Reserve

Arizona’s governor has vetoed legislation that would have let the state invest in cryptocurrency. “The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments,” Gov. Katie Hobbs wrote Friday (May 2) in a letter to state Sen. Warren Petersen, president of the state Senate. “Arizonans’ retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currencу.” State lawmakers last week approved legislation that would have established a bitcoin reserve, allowing the state to invest as much as 10% of its public funds in digital assets. Republican state Sen. Wendy Rogers told NBC News last week that it was in Hobbs’ best interest to sign the legislation, which would have created the first state-level bitcoin reserve in the country. “Crypto and bitcoin have a huge following nationwide and in Arizona. They are wildly popular with the youth and independents,” Rogers said, adding, “I certainly hope she signs it, because she can take credit and it will make her look good.” She voiced her disappointment with Hobbs on X following the governor’s decision on Friday, writing: “Politicians don’t understand that Bitcoin doesn’t need Arizona. Arizona needs Bitcoin.” The efforts by state lawmakers to establish an Arizona bitcoin reserve mirror plans by President Donald Trump to create a similar reserve on a national level. And as PYMNTS wrote last week, it’s also a sign of the growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. “Observers believe it is becoming increasingly held, across Wall Street and beyond, that digital assets may no longer be confined to speculative circles. As bitcoin ETFs become a growing component of diversified portfolios and regulatory frameworks begin to crystallize, the decentralization dream that once defined crypto appears to be giving way to a new era of structured integration. “It’s no longer a novelty to see major investment firms exploring crypto, but this year has seen a turning point. Morgan Stanley is preparing to offer cryptocurrency trading to its vast E*Trade customer base as soon as next year, with the potential to introduce millions of retail investors to digital assets via a familiar platform. “Meanwhile, Charles Schwab is preparing to offer spot crypto trading for bitcoin and ethereum within the year, with the goal of meeting increasing demand from traditional investors. “These moves are not isolated,” the report added. “BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is pushing blockchain technology deeper into conventional finance. The firm recently announced plans to register a new share class of its $150 billion money market fund on a blockchain, a step designed to enhance transparency and operational efficiency.” Arizona Governor Shoots Down Plans for State Bitcoin Reserve Trump's 'Warm Spot' for TikTok Could Extend Ban Deadline Again Airbnb: 50% of Users Turn to AI Bot for Customer Service Wendy's Predicts Diners Will Feel Pressured All Year We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Why the Panama Canal is a big, long-term prize in Trump's global trade war

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The Panama Canal has spent the past few years battling extreme weather, with the El Niño phenomenon and severe drought leading to a water-level crisis. Now, it’s President Trump’s trade war that is threatening the global trade gateway. A critical passage for U.S. East Coast bound ocean freight container traffic, the Panama Canal is facing a potential business slump as a result of Trump’s China tariffs and a rapid decline in manufactured goods being ordered by U.S. shippers. Forty percent of all U.S. container traffic travels through the Panama Canal every year, and in all, $270 billion in cargo annually. The U.S. and China are the top users of the Panama Canal, and its role in global shipping has increased in recent years due to the disruption of global supply chains. The Panama Canal Authority’s revenue hit $3.38 billion last year, despite drought conditions, and revenue has increased every year since 2017. The trade war uncertainty and Trump’s 145% tariff on Chinese goods — which will start to hit goods arriving from China to U.S. ports on May 27 based on the four to six weeks it takes for ocean freight to reach the U.S. from Asia — has already resulted in a massive pause on U.S. imports bound from China. According to data from supply chain intelligence firm Project44, there has been a 300% increase in blank sailings (cancelled freight vessels) from China to the United States since Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement on April 2. West Coast ports in the U.S. are already being hit and the impact on East Coast ports is expected to increase, with the pullback in vessels a result of the decrease in manufacturing orders for Chinese factories: less products manufactured translates into less shipping containers for ocean carriers. For the Asia to North America East Coast trade route, Sea-Intelligence has recorded a cumulative blanked capacity of 261,822 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs.) over the last six weeks. This decrease in containers and vessels can impact Panama Canal revenue. The Panama Canal makes its money off of the number of vessel transits and containers moving through the waterway. ″Since close to 75% of our cargo goes to or from the United States, any recession worldwide or in the United States will impact somehow the Panama Canal,” said Boris Moreno, vice president of operations for the Panama Canal Authority. “That’s for sure.″ One of the “Seven Wonders of the Modern World,” according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the canal has been a lightning rod for controversy in recent years in the battle for global supremacy between the U.S. and China. Trump has claimed the canal’s key ports are being controlled by China and has threatened to reassert U.S. control over the canal, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates. China, along with government of Panama, have denied those claims. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth both visited with Panamanian government officials in recent months. ″I think that Panama over the last five years has inched closer and closer to China and away from the United States,” Federal Maritime Commissioner Louis Sola said in an interview with CNBC earlier this year. “I’ve seen China and Brazil take away $20 billion with direct contracts. We definitely need to at least have a game there.” Ricaurte Vasquez, administrator for the Panama Canal Authority, tells CNBC that with the U.S. being the world’s largest economy, it is reviewing Trump’s concerns. “Whatever is said in Washington has repercussions all over,” said Vasquez. “We try to stay cool, calm and collected.” He added, “It is not true that we are run by Chinese. It is not true that we differentiate rates. It is not true that 38,000 people die in the construction of the Panama Canal. Everyone that wants to sail sails through the Panama Canal. And we are open to the world. That is the neutrality treaty. We have to remain open.” In March, an investment group led by U.S. firm BlackRock announced it was trying to purchase two ports at either end of the canal, as well as about 40 others from Hong Kong based-CK Hutchison. The outcome of that deal remains unclear. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Why Private Equity Is Betting On Tokenization

Time Published: 2025-05-04T16:42:18Z
Full Content:
ByAzeem Khan ByAzeem Khan, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Web3 and Digital Assets ByAzeem Khan, Contributor. Close-up of hands of a man viewing balances of Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies in a wallet ... More app from popular service Coinbase, Martinez, California, June 26, 2019. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Over the past decade, private equity became one of the most influential forces in global markets. With interest rates near zero and capital flowing freely, firms like Blackstone, KKR, and Apollo went on an unprecedented buying spree. They acquired everything from single-family homes to hospitals, software companies, and telecom infrastructure. Between 2012 and 2022, global private equity assets under management more than tripled, reaching over $13.4 trillion. That wave of acquisition concentrated enormous value into illiquid and closely held assets. It also created the kind of structural bottleneck that tokenization may now be uniquely positioned to help resolve. But in 2025, the environment looks very different. With Donald Trump back in office, inflation proving difficult to contain, and the Federal Reserve holding rates higher for longer, liquidity is harder to manufacture. IPO windows remain limited, secondary transactions continue to trade at steep discounts, and traditional exits are slow or nonexistent. The era when private equity firms could simply sell portfolio companies to one another, often at inflated valuations, has quietly ended. Tokenization is no longer just a concept being floated at panels. It is becoming one of the few tools large capital allocators are seriously exploring to create flexibility in portfolios that were never designed to stay illiquid this long. Low interest rates are unlikely to return anytime soon. Markets have largely accepted that the Federal Reserve will move cautiously, with traders pricing in fewer than three rate cuts through the end of 2025. Longer-term yields remain elevated, and the days of abundant, cheap capital are over. That capital fueled a decade of leveraged growth in private markets. What remains is a backlog of assets that need new liquidity rails to move. That backdrop makes the push toward tokenization more strategic than revolutionary. With traditional exits constricted and public markets still tentative, financial institutions are actively searching for alternatives. Tokenization has emerged as one. By wrapping illiquid assets such as private equity, real estate, or infrastructure stakes into blockchain-based instruments, firms can fractionalize ownership, enable 24/7 trading, and expand access to a broader pool of global investors. This is not just about efficiency. It is about building new distribution infrastructure for assets that no longer have clear paths to exit. Major financial institutions are already moving in this direction. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has filed with the SEC to tokenize shares of its $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund, creating a new class of digital shares recorded on a blockchain ledger. Franklin Templeton has launched the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, a fully tokenized fund that allows investors to gain exposure through digital tokens. Hamilton Lane has partnered with platforms like Securitize and Republic to offer tokenized versions of its private equity funds in an effort to broaden access to retail investors. For retail investors, this shift presents both opportunity and risk. On one hand, tokenization could finally provide access to asset classes that were once reserved for pension funds and billion-dollar LPs, such as private equity, real estate, and credit. Fractional ownership and 24/7 trading might lower the barriers to entry. On the other hand, the assets being tokenized are often the hardest to value and the least liquid for a reason. Institutions are not turning to blockchain out of altruism. They are using it to create new distribution channels to retail capital for assets they cannot easily offload elsewhere. Without proper regulation, disclosures, and investor protections, tokenization may become a way to transfer illiquidity risk under the appearance of innovation. That does not mean tokenization is inherently flawed. It may still unlock access and improve capital formation in meaningful ways. But it is critical to understand what is motivating the shift. If we focus only on the technology and ignore the incentives behind it, we risk mistaking distribution for disruption and missing the real forces reshaping capital markets. Tokenization is often framed as the next frontier of financial innovation. And it is. But it is also something more urgent and less romantic: a pressure valve. As trillions in private capital search for liquidity in a world where traditional exits no longer work, blockchain infrastructure is quietly becoming the system of last resort. Whether driven by strategy or necessity, this shift is already underway. The financial architecture of the next decade will not be defined solely by regulation or ideology. It will be shaped by who needs liquidity and how quickly they can create new ways to unlock it.

Title: Best Crypto to Buy as Solana Shows Technical Strength amid ETF Buzz

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Solana is ready to pump thanks to strong technical indicators and ecosystem support. The ‘cup’ started forming around November 2022, with the handle emerging during the tariff-induced panic sell-off. Even more encouraging is that this pattern hasn’t popped overnight – it’s taken 2.5 years to form, which makes it a stronger bullish indication. $SOL has risen around 38% since the second week of April, showing good upward momentum. Read on for more reasons investors are bullish on $SOL. We’ll also point you towards the best crypto to buy to benefit from the upcoming bull run. There has also been an increasing push towards stock tokenization on the Solana blockchain. The Solana Policy Institute has submitted a proposal called ‘Project Open’ to the SEC, which will issue tradable tokens for stocks. This would make transactions faster, and billions of dollars stuck in settlement delays can be pumped back into the markets almost instantly, generating more wealth over time. Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. – Larry Fink More good news: a Solana exchange-traded fund also looks like a certainty in the near future. Bloomberg has predicted a 90% chance for $SOL ETF approval in 2025 itself. Furthermore, the Solana stablecoin supply is also at an all-time high. It reached $11.7B in February 2025 and further shot up to $13B by May. Note that it was just $5B last year. A hike like this should open up new possibilities in the Web3 and DeFi space. All in all, if you want to ride Solana’s growth, this is the best time to invest. The cryptos mentioned in this guide, especially Solaxy, offer the highest potential for returns. Even though Solana has many positives potentially propelling it to new highs, it’d be difficult for the network to realize its full potential until it can overcome its congestion and scalability issues. Enter Solaxy ($SOLX). Solaxy is a new cryptocurrency and one of the very few offering real-world application. After all, it plans to build the very first Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. This Solana L2 will offload some transactions onto a sidechain, which is how it’ll reduce the burden on Solana’s mainnet and speed up the entire blockchain. Additionally, $SOLX will also reduce the transaction fees on Solana by processing a lot of transactions simultaneously, instead of one by one. Currently, however, one $SOLX will only cost you $0.001714. That’s because the token is in presale, where it has raised a staggering $33M. If this is your first crypto presale purchase, check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy. With over $1.5B in market capitalization, Bonk ($BONK) is easily the biggest dog-themed meme coin on Solana. It was also the first-ever dog coin on the network. In case you have any reservations about the potential of dog cryptos, just look at the most successful meme coins of all time. Three out of the top five, i.e., $DOGE, $SHIB, and $BONK, are inspired by ‘man’s best friend.’ What’s more, one of the biggest success stories of recent times, $BROCCOLI, is also a dog-themed coin. Coming to $BONK, its chart suggests that it’s now taking support at the $0.000016 level, which happens to be a previous resistance zone. The crypto is already up over 50% in the last month and can rally further once $SOL takes off. Thanks to a low price of $0.0000161p, $BONK is in contention for the best cheap cryptos to buy now. Created on a suggestion by the Truth Terminal AI chatbot, Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) is one of the most amusing community-driven cryptos on the market. It rewards token holders if they submit hilarious fart jokes. Moreover, there’s an uncanny ‘Gas Fee’ mechanism that emits a fart sound every time a transaction goes through. Quite naturally, crypto degens were quick to send $FARTCOIN soaring; it’s, in fact, one of the best meme coins on the market. The token has jumped over 145% in just the last month or so, and it’s expected to continue its climb with much velocity once it breaks through the $1.20 resistance level. You can buy it now for just $1.09. $SOL’s upcoming upward momentum can indeed drag the best altcoins on its network along with it. However, even though the signs are all there, there’s really no guaranteeing anything in crypto. The market is volatile and full of ups and downs, which is why it’s recommended you DYOR and only invest an amount that’s small enough for you.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-first investment strategy has once again taken the spotlight after Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) laid out an ambitious new plan to scale its BTC holdings. The company now owns over half a million bitcoins, making it one of the biggest institutional players in the crypto market. However, the company isn’t done yet, as recent filings shows an ambitious $84 billion plan to acquire more Bitcoins. As the Bitcoin price hovers around $97,000 in early May, the scale of Strategy’s Bitcoin plan is important, not only for its size but also for the significant role it now plays in the company’s trajectory. During its latest earnings call, Strategy introduced what it calls the 42/42 Plan, which is a roadmap aimed at raising $84 billion in capital over the next two years. The funding will be split equally between equity and fixed-income instruments, all designated to be used for further Bitcoin acquisitions. This initiative follows a $21 billion at-the-market equity offering that recently brought in over 301,000 BTC in recent months, sending the company’s share price soaring by 50%. As of April 28, 2025, Strategy holds 553,555 BTC, acquired at a total cost of $37.9 billion and an average price of $68,459 per coin. Of this total, 107,155 BTC have been bought in 2025 alone, making it the company’s most aggressive buying year to date despite only four months having passed. The firm’s internal disclosures also note an average cost of $66,384.56 per bitcoin. The latest acquisition round included 15,355 BTC purchased at an average price of $92,737 on April 28 at $1.42 billion. These aggressive purchases have positioned Strategy as the world’s second-largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, just behind BlackRock. Interestingly, Strategy’s playbook for building a BTC-heavy balance sheet is not slowing down. Even as the company reported its fifth consecutive quarterly net loss, investor sentiment is still optimistic. The company reported an unrealized $5.9 billion loss in the first quarter of 2025. However, its stock is up by approximately 32% since the beginning of the year and has outperformed the Nasdaq 100 index, which is down nearly 6% over the same period. Strategy’s market value is now deeply influenced by Bitcoin’s price direction. The company’s BTC portfolio has yielded a 13.7% return so far in 2025, generating a paper gain of $5.8 billion. Despite the crypto market volatility, the company updated its BTC yield target from 15% to 25% and a $15 billion profit goal by the end of the year. At the time of writing, Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy continues to pay well, and the company’s stock has been rising in tandem with Bitcoin’s recent rally. MSTR is currently up by 3.35% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $394.37. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is trading at $96,500.

While the populist consensus is that MAGA is killing off diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in corporate America, that may not always be the case in some of the nation’s biggest companies. According to one report, shareholders of some leading companies, including Costco, Apple, Levi’s, John Deere, Goldman Sachs, and others, have voted against proposals targeting DEI programs. Those proposals included asking companies to ditch their DEI policies and examine the legal risks of pursuing them. Two conservative think tanks, the National Center for Public Policy Research and the National Legal and Policy Center, are reportedly behind most of the DEI-killing measures. In January, Breitbart News noted that Costco had dug in its heels after a shareholder proposal urged the “wholesale club operator to conduct an evaluation of any business risk posed by its” DEI practices, according to AP. “‘But Costco’s board of directors voted unanimously to ask shareholders to reject the motion,’ an AP report stated, noting their message to shareholders claimed that having a diverse workforce and suppliers resulted in greater customer satisfaction.” DEI in the workplace results in employee training, resource networks, and recruiting practices that advance representation of different races, genders, and classes, people with disabilities, veterans, and other groups. But opponents like Elon Musk, the Tesla and X CEO, and President Donald Trump himself, say DEI is unfair to qualified workers and represents “reverse racism.” Dozens of companies, including Target and Meta, have dialed back or eliminated their diversity programs in recent months under pressure from the Trump administration. Opponents sometimes cite that DEI violates the spirit of a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that stated racial preferences in college admissions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. But as Breitbart reported at the time, that decision only applies to state governments and institutions. Shareholder votes are where DEI opponents are losing, reported CNN Business. The rejections of anti-DEI proposals “reveal that the investor community doesn’t think that having a tough stance on DEI makes financial sense,” Matteo Gatti, a professor of law at Rutgers University who studies corporate governance, told the network. “Investors are saying they don’t want ideological shareholders to drive business.” That “community,” however, appears to be dominated by Wall Street’s big players. “Large institutional investors” apparently call the shots at many multinational corporations. Mega investors “such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are the top shareholders of most companies. “They typically oppose outside shareholder resolutions,” the network reported, “siding with company management in around 90% of the votes.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Rhode-based Ivy League Institution Brown University disclosed in a recent regulatory filing that it is holding exposure to Bitcoin via BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares. This marks the first time the academic institution has sought exposure to the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency. Add Brown University to the list of institutional investors taking a shine to Bitcoin. A new 13F-HR filing with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission shows the university owned 105,000 shares of IBIT, worth roughly $4.9 million, as of March 31. The IBIT shares were not listed in the previous quarter’s filing. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is credited with rekindling the spot BTC ETF movement, after the SEC time and again rejected such products since 2013. These novel investment products give traditional investors access to Bitcoin without the hassle of buying and storing it themselves. Pundits believe the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs marks one of the most successful financial product launches in history. Notably, IBIT is currently the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF, with a staggering $57 billion in assets under management. It’s worth mentioning that Brown is not the first university to have exposure to Bitcoin. The University of Austin (UATX) partnered with Bitcoin services company Unchained in May 2024 to launch a $5 million Bitcoin endowment. Then, in October of the same year, Atlanta-based Emory University disclosed ownership of more than $14 million worth of shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust. Showcasing the growing appetite for digital asset exposure, increasingly more institutional funds, publicly listed companies, and nation states are racing to gain access to the apex crypto. The Bitcoin price soared above $97,500 on Friday for the first time since February, rebounding from a local low around $75,000 in early April. The asset is currently trading hands at $96,170, according to data from CoinGecko.
