Title: Texas Allocates $5M into BlackRock’s $BTC ETF as Bitcoin Hyper Raises Over $28.5M

Quick Facts: When a US state buys the dip, people pay attention. Texas just allocated $5M into BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ($BTC) ETF while $BTC trades well below its all-time high. This signals that state-level capital still sees asymmetric upside in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. If you’re a crypto investor, that’s a strongly bullish message. That’s because when public institutions step in during a pullback, they’re effectively saying volatility is a feature, not a deal-breaker. But simply holding $BTC on a centralized ETF rail isn’t where the real innovation is happening. The next leg of the cycle is increasingly about what can be built on top of Bitcoin: scaling, programmability, and yield-generating infrastructure. That’s where projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) become appealing to more aggressive risk-takers looking to ride institutional narratives. Bitcoin Hyper pitches itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, attempting to blend Bitcoin’s settlement finality with Solana-style performance. If you’re watching Texas buy the ETF dip, the thesis is straightforward: if state treasuries are comfortable with base-layer $BTC, the upside may shift toward infrastructure that unlocks high-speed payments, DeFi, and dApps on top of that base. Texas’s spot Bitcoin ETF allocation strengthens $BTC’s role as a long-term store-of-value rather than just a speculative trade. The catch is that Bitcoin’s base layer still processes 7-10 transactions per second, with confirmation times measured in minutes. Meanwhile, its fees regularly spike into several dollars during congestion. For everyday payments, on-chain DeFi, and gaming, that user experience can’t compete with newer high-throughput chains like Solana that finalize in seconds for fractions of a cent. That gap has triggered a flood of Bitcoin scaling plays: Lightning for peer-to-peer payments, sidechains like Rootstock and Liquid for smart contracts, and emerging rollup-style or L2 concepts to add programmability anchored in Bitcoin-level secure settlement. As more institutional money holds passive $BTC exposure via ETFs, the opportunity space shifts to these L2 projects attempting to make Bitcoin usable, not just investable. Within that landscape, Bitcoin Hyper sits alongside other Bitcoin L2 contenders but takes a more aggressive approach by importing SVM semantics and Solana-style tooling onto a Bitcoin-secured execution layer. Where Bitcoin Hyper tries to stand out is in raw performance. The project positions itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration, aiming to deliver Solana-fast transaction throughput and low-latency execution while still anchoring finality back to Bitcoin Layer 1. In practice, that means sub-second block times, rapid confirmation, and fees targeted in the sub-cent range for routine transfers. Under the hood, the architecture is modular: Bitcoin L1 handles settlement and periodic state anchoring, while a high-speed SVM-based Layer 2 processes execution in real time. A single sequencer orders transactions and commits them back to Bitcoin, while a decentralized canonical bridge allows $BTC holders to move value onto the L2 as wrapped assets. SPL-compatible token standards are adapted for this environment, giving Rust developers a familiar model to build swaps, lending protocols, and NFT or gaming primitives. From an adoption standpoint, the team is leaning on tokenonomics and early traction to draw capital. The presale has already raised over $28.5M, with tokens at $0.013335, indicating that a growing number of investors is already investing in SVM-on-Bitcoin narratives. Whales are particularly interested in the project. Less than two weeks ago, one purchased a little over $500K worth of $HYPER tokens, which is the strongest signal of support yet on Bitcoin Hyper. Long-term, $HYPER token could explode, and according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, it could reach a high of $0.20 by the end of 2026. That’s about a 1,399% increase from its current price. Bitcoin Hyper’s value proposition is simple: if states like Texas are bullish on Bitcoin, then an L2 that builds upon $BTC’s infrastructure can only soar in popularity. But with a price increase coming up a day from now, it’s best to act quickly and lock in $HYPER at a discounted price. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he is wrapping up the second round of interviews for the next Federal Reserve Chair. He added that there is a strong possibility President Donald Trump will reveal his choice before Christmas. (Source: Reuters) White House adviser Kevin Hassett is widely viewed as the leading contender, according to a Bloomberg report. Hassett, like Trump, believes interest rates should be lower than they are under current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Bessent explained that the selection has been narrowed from eleven names to five strong candidates. He said the final interviews focused on how each candidate would manage what has become a very complicated institution. The White House dismissed the Bloomberg scoop, calling any discussion about the Fed nomination speculative until the president makes an official announcement. Along with Hassett, the shortlist includes former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governor Christopher Waller, Governor Michelle Bowman, who also serves as vice chair for supervision, and Rick Rieder, the global fixed-income chief at BlackRock. Betting platforms Kalshi and Polymarket showed a neck-and-neck contest between Hassett and Waller. Waller’s odds improved sharply after he said he had a strong second interview with Bessent. After the Bloomberg report, bets began shifting heavily towards Hassett across both platforms. Each market assigned him around a 50% probability of being chosen. The Federal Reserve has already cut interest rates at its last two meetings, and markets expect another cut in December. The benchmark rate is currently in the 3.75% to 4.00% range. Waller and Bowman, both appointed during Trump’s first term, have argued since the summer that the greater risk lies in a weakening job market rather than rising inflation. They both dissented at the July meeting in favour of a rate cut.

Title: Bitcoin Recovery From Worst Of Selloff Holds, Buoying Traders
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/bitcoin-recovery-from-worst-of-selloff-holds-buoying-traders
Time Published: 2025-11-26T02:41:20Z

The intense selling pressure that has weighed on Bitcoin in recent weeks looks to be easing, raising hopes that the token’s brutal slide is nearing an end. The original cryptocurrency was little changed at around $88,000 on Tuesday, well above last week’s slump that consigned it to a seven-month low, triggering massive liquidations and erasing more than $1 trillion in value from the broader digital-asset market. The mood among traders remains cautious, highlighting the market’s fragile state. Bitcoin remains on track for its worst month since 2022, and exchange-traded funds investing in the token look likely to record their heaviest monthly outflows since launching. But after Bitcoin’s modest rebound, some see cause for optimism. In the Bitcoin options market, the cost of purchasing downside protection has fallen sharply, with the premium for one-week puts over calls sliding to around 4.5% from a 2025 high of 11% reached on Friday, according to Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets. “This indicates the level of stress has come down significantly, and investors expect we’ve seen the bottom for now,” she said. Another metric drawing attention is Bitcoin’s 14-day relative strength index, now at 32 after a steep decline from early October. A reading of 30 or below typically signals an oversold asset while 70 or above indicates the opposite. Meanwhile, implied volatility on Bitcoin options — a gauge of expected future price movement — has returned to April levels, when tariff news induced a wave of selling. “This suggests traders are positioning for a breakout, which could of course be in either direction,” said Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter. “But options skew shows that the bets on further drops are softening relative to those on a price increase from here.” Global crypto exchange-traded products have seen more than $6 billion in outflows so far in November, the largest monthly withdrawal on record going back to 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Even so, investors are largely staying put. The US Bitcoin ETFs’ combined redemptions of $3.7 billion in November represent about 3% of their $110 billion in assets. For BlackRock Inc.’s Bitcoin fund (IBIT), short interest — measured by the dollar value of shares sold short — has plummeted, according to a report published by S3 Partners LLC. BTC Markets Analyst Rachael Lucas noted that Bitcoin’s muted trading on Monday could also indicate that selling pressure is subsiding. She sees $80,000 as the near-term floor, with $90,000 to $95,000 forming the resistance band to any meaningful rebound. US stocks climbed after the tech sector trimmed the sharp decline it suffered earlier in the session as traders contended with the AI chip rivalry between Nvidia Corp. and Alphabet Inc. Investors have put the chances of a rate cut at the upcoming December meeting of the Federal Reserve at about 80%, up from 42% a week ago, according to futures contracts. Fed officials appear deeply divided over whether another reduction would be appropriate, following cuts in September and October. “The market is going to be in wait-and-see mode until the Fed’s decision,” Orbit’s Mauron said. “Long-term holders who were exiting their position over $100,000 are seeing current levels as too low to sell and are back in holding mode, while those looking to accumulate new positions may try to wait for another dip below $85,000.” As investors contend with a mix of concerns from a cooling US labor market to surging artificial-intelligence capital spending by major corporations, a risk appetite gauge maintained by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has fallen to zero. The reading signals mounting pressure on speculative assets, including Bitcoin. A drop of this magnitude reflects fading risk enthusiasm and, at extreme levels, may even suggest that markets have overshot to the downside. “Elevated equity valuations and bullish positioning increased vulnerability to shocks, especially within more retail-driven segments such as Unprofitable Tech,” wrote strategists at the bank including Christian Mueller-Glissmann.

Title: ONDO adds $25M in yield assets amid EU approval – Details here!

Tokenized yield-bearing real-world assets could be the next financial revolution, and Ondo Finance has a big role to play. The Figure Technology YLDS addition strengthens and diversifies the OUSG yield sources, whose portfolio already includes funds from trusted asset managers. News of the BNB Chain expansion and the EU regulatory approval did little to stem the selling pressure behind the Ondo ecosystem token. Ondo Finance [ONDO] announced the purchase of $25 million of YLDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Figure Technology Solutions. Terming it a strategic investment, the addition will enhance and diversify the yield source supporting OUSG. OUSG (Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries) is the flagship product of Ondo Finance. OUSG has more than $780 million in total value locked (TVL) and gives investors exposure to U.S. Treasuries. It offers 24/7 redemption with an estimated annual return of 3.68%. In addition, its multi-chain support expands accessibility for a wider range of users. The recent purchase adds to the reserve portfolio, which already has tokenized Treasury products from well-known asset managers, such as BlackRock and Fidelity. In October, Ondo Finance expanded its tokenized asset offerings to the BNB Chain. An announcement from the network read that over 100 tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) went live. On the 18th of November, the company stated that it had received regulatory approval to bring its products to the European Union (EU) and the broader European Economic Area (EEA). Ondo Finance had obtained authorization from the Lichtenstein Financial Market Authority, a well-established European regulator. This development meant the company’s tokenized stocks and ETFs were available to European investors and ensured it operated within the EU regulatory framework, adding to safety and appeal. Tokenized yield-bearing real-world assets could be the next global financial revolution. If this prediction comes true, the Ondo Finance brand would likely keep growing in the coming years. Source: ONDO/USDT on TradingView Despite the bullish developments behind Ondo Finance, the token faced steady selling pressure. The CMF showed that capital flow has been outwards for most of November. The MFI agreed, and has sunk below 20 in recent days. This showed seller dominance, something the price action confirms. The 1-day timeframe’s ONDO structure was firmly bearish, and has been since the second half of September. The $0.5-$0.55 area was a long-term support zone from August to September 2024, but was breached and now acts as resistance.

Title: Custody shuffle continues as 87,464 more Bitcoin leaves institution-tagged wallets in 24 hours

Data flagged by Timechainindex shows large transfers from ETF and custodian addresses, likely re-custody rather than sell pressure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Timechain Index founder Sani reported 87,464 BTC flowing out of institution-tagged wallets between Nov. 21 and Nov. 22, adding that he hadn’t seen such movement in months. The raw data showed over 15,000 BTC leaving tracked cohorts on Nov. 21 alone, the largest single-day outflow since June 26. Yet, as Sani clarified in a note, the headline figure overstates actual selling pressure. Most of the movement represents internal reshuffling rather than institutions exiting Bitcoin positions. Sani explained that pre-processed data can show extreme volatility when large holders move coins between custodians or wallets, but after reconciliation, the net flows often land near zero. Strategy accounted for 49,907 BTC of the tracked outflows, but CEO Michael Saylor confirmed the company sold no Bitcoin that week. In fact, Strategy added 8,178 BTC last week, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Sani’s assessment indicates that Strategy transferred holdings to new custodians to diversify risk, with some coins appearing in addresses linked to Fidelity Custody. Additionally, that’s the second time the firm has performed such a movement. This is not unique to Strategy. Sani shared that BlackRock moved Bitcoins out of their known addresses twice as well. The first time happened last year, and the second occurred a few weeks ago, when they moved nearly 800,000 BTC to new addresses. Additionally, Coinbase also reshuffled a similar amount this weekend in a UTXO consolidation exercise. Back to the over 15,000 BTC in outflows, Bitcoin ETFs bore the brunt on Nov. 21, shedding 10,426 BTC as issuers processed redemptions tied to $903 million in net withdrawals reported Nov. 20. ETF outflows translate directly to liquidations, as fund managers must sell the underlying Bitcoin to meet shareholder exit requests. Still, the scale fell within normal bounds given the prior day’s redemption activity. Timechain Index tracks 16 entity categories, including centralized exchanges, miners, ETFs, publicly traded companies, custodians, governments, OTC desks, and payment processors. The platform aggregates known addresses for each cohort and monitors balance changes in real time. Sani’s “LiveChangesSummary” data showed Strategy’s 49,907 BTC outflow, Coinbase’s 11,762 BTC outflow, and ETC Group’s 6,973 BTC outflow as the largest movements, with smaller flows across custodians, exchanges, and miners. The distinction matters because Bitcoin’s on-chain transparency makes wallet movements visible before context arrives. When 87,464 BTC appears to leave institution-tracked addresses in a 24-hour window, the immediate read can suggest panic selling or a coordinated retreat from crypto exposure. The post-processing showed the opposite: net institutional holdings remained stable after accounting for internal transfers and standard ETF mechanics. Strategy’s custody diversification aligns with treasury management best practices for large holders. Concentrating nearly 650,000 BTC with a single custodian creates operational risk, and spreading holdings across multiple qualified custodians reduces exposure to any single point of failure. Bitcoin ETFs operate under different constraints. When investors redeem shares, authorized participants return creation units to the issuer and receive the underlying Bitcoin, which they then sell on the market to close out arbitrage positions. The Nov. 20 outflow figure of $903 million corresponded to roughly 10,400 BTC at prevailing prices, matching the ETF-cohort outflow Timechain Index recorded the following day. The lag reflects settlement timing rather than discretionary selling. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Title: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says there’s ‘very good chance’ Trump names new Fed chair by Christmas

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/25/2025 9:34:18 AM PST by DFG There is “a very good chance” that President Trump names a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. Bessent, who has been leading search efforts for a new Fed leader, told CNBC he still has one interview left and is not ready to speculate on who might succeed Powell, whom Trump has said he’d “love” to fire. “I think there’s a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas,” said the Treasury secretary. “But it’s [Trump’s] prerogative, whether it’s before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well.” Finalists for the role reportedly include National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. Trump has been eager to replace Powell – whose term expires in May 2026 – after months of blasting the Fed chairman for not slashing rates quickly enough. Last week at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, DC, Trump said Powell has “mental problems” and he would love to “fire his ass,” but Bessent is holding him back. As the audience of investors, tech bros and foreign leaders laughed, Trump urged Bessent – who was in the crowd – to “work on this guy,” adding: “The rates are too high, Scott. And if you don’t get it fixed fast, I’m going to fire your ass, okay?” “If you were in the room, he was joking,” Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday. “We’ve gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it’s more than just cutting rates.” (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Title: Trump could make a decision on a new Fed chair 'before Christmas.' See who's on the short list

Every time Brent D. Griffiths publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump is checking his list of potential Federal Reserve chairs twice. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been leading the search, said that Trump could name his nominee to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas. "I think there's a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas," Bessent told CNBC in late November. "But it's his prerogative, whether it's before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well." No matter who Trump selects, Bessent said he wants a less prominent central bank. "I think it's time for the Fed just to move back into the background, like, it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people," Bessent said. Powell's term expires next May, but hasn't stopped the White House from aggressively searching for his replacement. Here are the five finalists. Before joining Trump's orbit, Kevin Hassett advised a succession of Republican presidential nominees on economic policy, including George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney. Just before Thanksgiving, Hassett briefly lost his lead among the contenders on leading prediction markets. After a Bloomberg News report said he was the frontrunner, Hassett shot back up into first on Kalshi and Polymarket. As of November 25th, he has a double-digit advantage on both platforms. During Trump's first term, Hassett served as director of the president's Council of Economic Advisors. He returned to the White House during the COVID-19 pandemic and was severely criticized for publishing a model showing coronavirus deaths hitting zero by May 15, 2020. In October 1999, Hassett cowrote with journalist Jason Glassman "Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market." Some economists have heavily criticized the book, largely because the index took more than 22 years to reach that threshold. Fed Gov. Christopher Waller told Fox News that he thought his most recent conversation with Bessent went well. "I talked to Scott about 10 days ago. We had a nice, a great, meeting," Waller told Fox Business in late November. Waller said that the White House is looking for someone with "experience." It's not clear what experience that entails, but of the reported finalists, only three have experience serving on the central bank. "I think they are looking for someone who has merit, experience, and knows what they are doing in the job, and I think I fit that," he said. Just before Thanksgiving, Waller briefly dethroned White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett as the favorite of leading prediction markets. Waller's lead was short-lived as Hassett quickly supplanted him. Waller, a longtime regional Fed official, was seen as a convention pick when Trump nominated him to the central bank in 2019. Simultaneously, Trump also nominated Judy Shelton, a former campaign advisor and a Fed critic. The fight over Shelton's nomination soon spilled over onto Waller's. In December 2020, the Senate confirmed Waller 48-47, the narrowest margin for any Fed governor since 1980, per The New York Times. In July, Waller joined Gov. Michelle Bowman (another Trump first-term pick) in opposing the Fed's decision not to cut interest rates, the first dual dissent in more than 30 years. Trump told reporters in September that Hassett, Waller, and Warsh were "the top three" to replace Powell. Back in his first term, Trump reportedly considered Warsh to lead the Fed before he chose to nominate Powell in 2017. Warsh spent his early years at Morgan Stanley, working as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions. President George W. Bush nominated him to the Fed in 2006 after Warsh served as an economic advisor in the Bush White House. Drawing on his Wall Street ties, Warsh played a pivotal role in the central bank's response to the 2008 global financial crisis. When he left the Fed in 2011, the Times called him the Fed's chief liaison to Wall Street. From the sidelines, Warsh has echoed Trump's criticism of Powell, calling for "regime change" at the Fed. "The specter of the miss they made on inflation, it has stuck with them," Warsh told CNBC in July. "So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy." In 2018, Trump appointed Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman to the central bank. After confirmation, she was reappointed in 2020. In June, she was narrowly confirmed as the vice chair of supervision. Bowman started as an intern for Sen. Bob Dole. During the George W. Bush administration, she held posts at FEMA and the Homeland Security Department. She was vice president at Farmers and Drovers Bank in Kansas, her family's bank, before becoming the state's top banking official. In September 2024, Bowman became the first Fed governor to vote against an interest rate decision since 2005. In July, she again voted against holding rates steady, though this time Waller joined her dissent. There's also a big Wall Street name on Trump's shortlist. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, has spent decades on Wall Street, dating back to his time at Lehman Brothers. Rieder is responsible for managing roughly $2.4 trillion in assets, per BlackRock. He's served as a member of the Fed's Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets. Trump's shortlist at one point reportedly had almost a dozen names. CNBC previously reported that the following are no longer under consideration: David Zervos, Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies; Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan; former St. Louis Fed President James "Jim" Bullard; Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson; and Marc Sumerlin, a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush. Former Fed Gov. Larry Lindsey told CNBC that he withdrew from contention. Jump to

A Dublin-based Chinese businessman has been jailed for seven years and nine months over a money-laundering operation connected to an international €10 million “zombie” iPhone fraud. Chengwen Guo (43), who was described in court as the “Irish representative of a transnational crime organisation”, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to theft and money-laundering offences on dates between 2021 and 2022. Guo, of Ivy Exchange, Parnell Street, Dublin, owned a number of mobile phone shops called Murray Mobile, with eight stores in locations including Blackrock, Dundrum, Sutton Cross, Ranelagh and Newbridge. Guo has one previous conviction for having a false passport at Gatwick Airport in the UK, for which he received a custodial sentence of 13 months, the court was told. The court heard three sums of money seized in January 2022 included €6,515 found in an Audi Q7 car registered to Guo; €143,245 at his home address; and €20,700 at Murray Mobiles on Main Street in Dundrum, Dublin 14. Three Rolex watches were also found when gardaí searched his Parnell Street apartment in Dublin. His Audi has yet to be seized, the court heard. Judge Martin Nolan described Guo as “a very energetic man” who had engaged in “very substantial criminal misbehaviour”. “This man deserves a severe custodial sentence,” said Judge Nolan. The judge said it was “white-collar deviance”. The judge said “there was a gap there” and “the situation was found out”. The court was told the fake or “zombie” phones from China were exchanged under warranty for genuine iPhones which were then sent to countries outside of the EU for resale. The court heard 10,158 phones provided to Guo were last active mostly outside Ireland. The total retail value of the Apple products was €10,262,617. Det Sgt Robert Madden of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau told the court that representatives from Apple Corporation were in court for the hearing. The scheme operated on the basis of the Apple warranty on its phones. The fraud involved sending in fake iPhones for repair and then claiming a replacement under Apple’s one-year warranty scheme. These fake phone components would come from China and would be assigned the EMEI number of a genuine iPhone when sent for repair. The replacement genuine iPhones would then be sent to Hong Kong for resale to countries outside the EU. The court heard Guo also sold counterfeit Apple products such as power chargers, charging cables and phone cases in his shops. In July 2021, counterfeit Apple goods, including 15 damaged iPhones and sim trays, were found after a package was sent to Ireland addressed to “Johnny Cheng” – which the court heard was a name the defendant used in Ireland for its simplicity rather than his Chinese name – at Murray Mobile in Main Street, Dundrum. Gardaí commenced an investigation and searches of all eight Murray Mobile shops took place on January 10th, 2022. Last month, Guo’s co-accused, who was an employee of Fonfix, a tech repair business in Sandyford, south Dublin, was jailed in the same court. Lukasz Lupa (45) of Kukukcza, Wagrowiec, Poland was given a 4½-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to two counts of facilitating a criminal organisation on dates between June 5th, 2019, and September 3rd, 2021, under section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006. Lupa had claimed he did not know what he was doing was illegal and received little financial benefit for his part in the warranty fraud. Det Sgt Madden said Apple realised that the number of units Guo was sending in was unusually high. He told Eoin Lawlor SC, prosecuting, the phones would not power on and a diagnostic could not be performed on them. The phones were submitted without proof of purchase in the name of a company that runs a legitimate business and was not at fault, the court heard. Guo received brand new phones and was getting €30 to €40 per unit. Diana Stuart SC, defending, told the court in mitigation that Guo has four children. One is in boarding school in the UK and one is in boarding school in Ireland. He also has a child in university in Edinburgh. His wife’s day-to-day living expenses amount to €1,000 a week, Ms Stuart told the court. Judge Nolan said the appropriate global sentence was one of seven years and nine months.

Title: Mother killed in attack near her Cork home had ‘inbuilt generosity’, funeral told

Mother of four Stella Gallagher had an “inbuilt generosity” and was always giving of herself and helping others, mourners at her funeral mass have heard. Her brother-in-law, Alan Gallagher, spoke with emotion as he delivered a eulogy to mourners, led by Ms Gallagher’s husband, Brian, and their daughter and sons, Ciara, Conor and Mark, at her funeral mass in Cork city on Tuesday. Ms Gallagher (59) was fatally injured and her 63-year-old husband suffered serious injuries when they were attacked near their home at Shrewsbury Downs in Ballinlough, Cork, on November 17th. Alan Gallagher told mourners at a packed Our Lady of Lourdes Church how he had asked his brother, niece and nephews what memories they had of Ms Gallagher and they said: “Stella had 30 wonderful years of life with her family.” He said: “Stella loved meeting people and chatting with them, whether her many relatives, cousins and second cousins, or someone she had just met. She loved going on outings with people, whether for a hike in the country or to a film or on a shopping trip. “She had an inbuilt generosity and was always doing things for others or giving them things. If you mentioned in passing you liked something, the next time you saw her she’d have bought them for you or baked them for you or whatever. “It was the same when Stella was cooking food. When cooking for two people, she cooked enough for six. If you mentioned you had to go into town later, she’d get her car keys and offer to drop you in.” Mr Gallagher recalled the great pleasure and joy his sister-in-law derived from her involvement with the Togher Community Garden and the Cork Health Education Project Choir, based in nearby Blackrock, with whom she sang. “Stella was an excellent baker, and got pleasure from giving you scones or sourdough bread or apple tarts and she’d come in after losing track of time in her garden, delighted to be able to present you with her harvest of blackcurrants or potatoes or beetroot or whatever was in season. “Stella seemed to know the name of every flower and every tree, and on a recent visit to JFK Arboretum in Wexford she was like a child in a sweet shop. “We are so grateful to have shared our lives with this lovely person. We love you, Stella, and we always will.” Celebrant Msgr Gearóid Dullea told mourners when people were confronted with death they experienced a maelstrom of emotions, and he said the shock and sadness over Ms Gallagher’s death spread far beyond her family and the community in Ballinlough. “Stella’s shocking death has brought a great pall of darkness, not only over the Gallagher and Griffin families, but also on so many others – Stella’s colleagues from her work in Eli Lilly, the local communities in Ballinlough and Ballinspittle and over many friends.” Taoiseach Michéal Martin, who lives nearby in Ballinlough and spoke last week of how devastated the Gallagher family must be, was represented at the funeral his Aide de Camp, Comdt Joe Glennon. Ms Gallagher’s eldest son, David Gallagher (25), of Shrewsbury Downs, Ballinlough, is due to reappear at Cork District Court on Wednesday. He was charged last week with his mother’s murder and with assault causing harm to his father, Brian Gallagher, at Shrewsbury Downs on November 17th.

Title: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says there’s ‘very good chance’ Trump names new Fed chair by Christmas

Time Published: 2025-11-25T15:38:35Z
Full Content:
There is “a very good chance” that President Trump names a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. Bessent, who has been leading search efforts for a new Fed leader, told CNBC he still has one interview left and is not ready to speculate on who might succeed Powell, whom Trump has said he’d “love” to fire. But White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is reportedly seen by advisers and allies of Trump as the frontrunner, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. “I think there’s a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas,” said the Treasury secretary. “But it’s [Trump’s] prerogative, whether it’s before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well.” Finalists for the role reportedly include Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. Trump has been eager to replace Powell – whose term expires in May 2026 – after months of blasting the Fed chairman for not slashing rates quickly enough. Last week at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, DC, Trump said Powell has “mental problems” and he would love to “fire his ass,” but Bessent is holding him back. As the audience of investors, tech bros and foreign leaders laughed, Trump urged Bessent – who was in the crowd – to “work on this guy,” adding: “The rates are too high, Scott. And if you don’t get it fixed fast, I’m going to fire your ass, okay?” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email.

Never miss a story. “If you were in the room, he was joking,” Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday. “We’ve gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it’s more than just cutting rates.” Hassett appears to agree with Trump’s view of the economy, including that interest rates need to come down. He told Fox News during an interview on Nov. 20 that he would “be cutting rates right now” if he were the Fed chairman because “the data suggests that we should.” Hassett has also criticized central bankers for losing control of inflation. Follow The Post’s live coverage of President Trump and national politics for the latest news and analysis Fed officials, meanwhile, have been split on whether to cut interest rates further after two consecutive quarter-point cuts at the September and October meetings, down to the 3.75% to 4% range. Markets rebounded after New York Fed President John Williams said Friday there is room for “further adjustment in the near term” to interest rates. Traders are currently betting on 83% odds of a quarter-point cut at the Dec. 10 meeting, according to CME FedWatch. But Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan on Friday called for holding rates “for a time,” and Boston Fed President Susan Collins said she was “hesitant” about the next policy move since “restrictive policy is very appropriate right now.” Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson said she’s approaching the December meeting “cautiously.” But Fed Governor Stephen Miran has said he would vote for a quarter-point cut if that meant the difference in getting lower rates. He has previously dissented in favor of a larger cut. Meanwhile, Bessent said he is hoping for the next chairman to bring the role into a new era. “I think we’ve got to kind of simplify things,” he said Tuesday. “I think it’s time for the Fed just to move back into the background, like, it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people.” Advertisement

Title: Best Crypto to Buy as Ondo Finance Puts $25M Into YLDS Tokenized Fund
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-as-ondo-finance-makes-25m-tokenized-fund/
Time Published: 2025-11-25T14:50:53Z

Quick Facts: Ondo Finance just injected $25M into YLDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Figure Technology Solutions, to diversify the assets backing its tokenized U.S. Treasury fund. YLDS will join an exclusivist portfolio which also includes assets from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. It’s a textbook signal that serious capital is leaning further into tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) and crypto-backed lending as a core part of modern market infrastructure. The winners are likely to be the tools and tokens that sit directly on those flows. So, as interest for RWAs grows, the best crypto to buy next focuses less on hype and more on who is building the plumbing. With that lens, three projects stand out in the current market: Best Wallet Token ($BEST) as a next-gen wallet layer onboarding everyday users, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) as an AI-plus-Web3 content economy play, and XRP ($XRP) as the institutional cross-border backbone to fuel efficient crypto transfers. As tokenized treasuries, yield-bearing stablecoins, and onchain credit markets expand, the bottleneck is no longer just liquidity – it’s UX and security. Best Wallet steps in to solve this issue with a mobile-first, non-custodial wallet that aims to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026. The $BEST token provides in-app utility for holders using this wallet layer. For example, $BEST unlocks first-stage presale access in the Upcoming Tokens portal. Here, early buyers can check vetted presales with a simplified purchase flow, effectively turning the wallet into a vetted deal-launchpad for emerging opportunities. Economically, the presale has already raised over $17.4M with $BEST sitting at $0.025995, signaling meaningful traction at seed-stage valuations. Based on Best Wallet’s value proposition, our price prediction for $BEST puts the token at $0.072 by the end of 2025. That makes up for a 175% ROI potential for EOY investment. In a favorable market context, the numbers can go higher, especially if Best Wallet sees mainstream adoption. Note that the presale only has three days left, so slots are running out. Buy $BEST today before the presale ends. While DeFi chases yields, the $85B content-creation industry is quietly shifting toward models where creators actually own their output and audience data. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) targets that gap by merging Web3 payments with AI-native tools, giving creators both lower platform fees and more control over monetization. The presale has already raised over $1.3M+ at a token price of $0.057025, suggesting early conviction in the thesis that creators will follow better economics. Given that the project is planning to onboard the top 2,000+ highest-earning creators, we expect SUBBD to see massive post-launch adoption. From a growth-sector perspective, SUBBD is a leveraged bet on AI + creator monetization rather than just number-go-up memetics. As onchain finance broadens, attention remains the most scarce resource – SUBBD is building rails to tokenize it. Buy $SUBBD from the official presale today. On the institutional side of this market shift, XRP ($XRP) sits in a privileged position. XRP is designed specifically for fast, low-cost cross-border payments and liquidity provisioning for financial institutions, settling transactions on the XRP Ledger in around 3-5 seconds with minimal fees suitable for high-volume flows. $XRP is also a top-five cryptocurrency by market cap and a leading asset in the blockchain-based payments sector, making it a more mature, lower-volatility way to express a view on the continued growth of onchain settlement rails. The project’s profile lines up directly with the kind of tokenized treasuries and yield-bearing stablecoin activity Ondo’s move highlights. As more traditional finance players look for instant, global settlement of tokenized assets, they need enterprise-grade infrastructure, which Ripple has spent years building – from compliance tooling to bank integrations and payment corridors. In November 2025, Ripple raised $500M at a $40B valuation to expand institutional XRP use and deepen its footprint in payments. Find $XRP on Binance today. This is not financial advice.

Title: 21Shares taps Standard Chartered for custody as TradFi tightens grip on crypto
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/standard-chartered-21shares-crypto-custody-shift
Time Published: 2025-11-25T14:37:56Z

Standard Chartered will provide digital asset custody for 21Shares, signaling deeper expansion into crypto by traditional financial players. Update (Nov. 26, 2025, at 8:30 am UTC): This article has been updated to add commentary by Alistair Byas-Perry, head of EU investments and capital markets at 21Shares and Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody. Major bank Standard Chartered announced fund manager 21Shares has selected it as its digital asset custodian, potentially moving away from a crypto-native partner. According to a Monday announcement from Standard Chartered shared with Cointelegraph, the bank will provide crypto custody services to 21Shares, which offers multiple exchange-traded crypto products. Margaret Harwood-Jones, the bank’s global head of financing and securities services, said the collaboration allows them to “to extend our expertise into the fast-evolving digital asset ecosystem.” However, 21Shares already had a crypto-native custody partner. In late June 2024, the fund manager partnered with crypto-native custodian Zodia Custody to hold its assets. Zodia Custody was co-founded by Standard Chartered in 2020 and operated as a wholly owned subsidiary, indicating that the bank wanted to avoid direct involvement in crypto at the time. Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody, said that the company views Standard Chartered’s appointment “as a positive sign of the industry’s continued maturity.” He also explained that “Standard Chartered’s custody offering employs Zodia Custody’s underlying technology and risk frameworks.” The move comes as more traditional financial institutions roll out crypto services, often with reputational advantages over crypto-native competitors. Still, Alistair Byas-Perry, head of EU investments and capital markets at 21Shares, told Cointelegraph that this is not a shift from existing partners. Instead, “adding Standard Chartered simply expands our multi-custodian model.” He said: Byas-Perry also said that “21Shares continues to work with leading crypto-native custodians.” He explained that the fund manager chose Standard Chartered “because of their global reputation, regulatory footprint, and risk-management standards” and added: Byas-Perry explained that “some institutions prefer working with names they already know, while others rely on crypto-native specialists.” Still, he believes that 21Shares’ “job is to support both.” Standard Chartered had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment by publication. Related: BlackRock quietly accumulated 3% of all Bitcoin. Here’s what that means Standard Chartered said 21Shares will work with its newly established digital asset custody service based in Luxembourg. The announcement follows the bank’s mid-July launch of a trading service that allows institutions and corporations to trade major cryptocurrencies. 21Shares’ global head of product development, Mandy Chiu, said the collaboration is “an important milestone in our continued mission to bring institutional-grade infrastructure to the digital asset ecosystem.” She pointed to the bank’s reputation in traditional finance as an advantage. Other major banks have taken similar steps. In September, US multinational financial services firm US Bancorp reentered the crypto space by relaunching its digital asset custody services aimed explicitly at investment managers. This follows the company’s launch of its custody service in 2021, which was subsequently shut down due to unfavorable regulations. Mid-August reports also note that Wall Street giant Citigroup is weighing plans to offer cryptocurrency custody and payment services. In July, Germany’s biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, was also reported to be planning to allow its clients to store cryptocurrencies — amid a broader trend in the nation. Related: US Federal agencies outline key risks for banks eyeing crypto custody That trend has stirred debate within the industry, as crypto-native institutions face intense competition. In October, Martin Hiesboeck, head of blockchain and crypto research at crypto financial services platform Uphold, said that large Bitcoin (BTC) wallets moving their assets into ETFs is “another nail in the coffin of the original crypto spirit.” The comment follows Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, saying that the company had already facilitated more than $3 billion worth of real Bitcoin to ETF conversions. He added that holders recognize “the convenience of being able to hold their exposure within their existing financial adviser or private-bank relationship.” Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: BlackRock’s $400 Million Bitcoin Move Sparks Liquidity Alarm | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee as markets enter an unusual phase where large players are repositioning and liquidity is tightening. Against this backdrop, the timing of one major transfer has raised fresh questions about what might be coming next for Bitcoin. BlackRock quietly moved 4,471 BTC to Coinbase Prime, hours before the PPI report. The move comes as its flagship Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, logged record monthly outflows. BlackRock just deposited another 4,471 $BTC($390.8M) to #CoinbasePrime.https://t.co/qmuDIrPHc6 pic.twitter.com/3CqgyHozVC The timing has ignited a new debate: Is the world’s biggest asset manager preparing for a deeper US liquidity shock? Arkham data shows the same wallet has fallen from a $117 billion peak to $78.4 billion, losing more than 30% of its value over the past month. The transfer occurs at a time of increasing stress across Bitcoin markets, with analysts like Crypto Rover noting that BlackRock’s move could exacerbate selling. Meanwhile, the timing ahead of the US PPI has also raised concern. Meanwhile,VanEck’s Matthew Sigel sees the Bitcoin price’s ongoing struggle as primarily a macro dynamic, calling it an “overwhelmingly a US-session phenomenon. “…The driver: tightening US liquidity and widening credit spreads as AI-capex fears collided with a more fragile funding market,” he stated. This aligns with recent stress across equities, credit, and rate-sensitive assets. Traders are watching whether the November PPI print, due just after the BTC transfer, signals further tightening. However, ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood argues the current liquidity pressure is temporary. “The liquidity squeeze that has hit AI and crypto will reverse in the next few weeks,” she said. The Ark Invest executive cited a 123% surge in Palantir’s US commercial business, calling it evidence that enterprise adoption is accelerating despite macro headwinds. The blockchain activity comes as BlackRock’s IBIT posts its worst outflow month on record, over $2 billion this month. Analysts highlight it as the biggest withdrawal wave since launch. “…After months of steady inflows, the outflows reflect rising caution as Bitcoin falls ~22% over the past month and 7% year-to-date,” wrote Walter Bloomberg. However, ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pushed back on the panic, stressing that context is being lost. According to the analyst, the majority of investors are sticking around despite the outflows. That’s bc it never had outflows bf! All told the “record” is 3% of aum. The real story (that you def won’t see in ALL CAPS let alone in the media at large) is 97% of investors are sticking around despite not starting the -35% fire. https://t.co/2p0c5gJIji He also highlighted the collapse in short interest, ascribing plummeting IBIT short interest to traders who tend to short into strength and cover in downturns. In other words, despite headlines screaming about “record outflows,” the majority of institutional holders appear to be staying put. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF Flow Data.

Title: Private Assets to Be Half of Industry Revenues by 2030, PwC Says

The asset- and wealth-management industry will take in about $432 billion in revenue from private assets in 2030, PwC found. November 25, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Private markets will generate more than half of the money-management industry’s revenues by 2030, an increase that reflects the intensifying competition among firms to expand in private debt and equity and infrastructure, according to PwC. “The winners won’t be those who gather the most assets, but those who rewire the fastest,” Albertha Charles, global asset and wealth management leader at PwC UK, said Monday in a report that surveyed 300 global firms and investors. The asset- and wealth-management industry will take in about $432 billion in revenue from private assets in 2030, exceeding the totals for traditional actively managed investments and for passive products, the consultancy found. In 2024, private assets accounted for 44% of total revenue, with traditional investments making up most of the industry total, according to PwC. Still, private markets have become increasingly crowded. Many traditional fund houses — including Franklin Resources Inc., Invesco Ltd. and State Street Corp. — have acquired or partnered with private-markets firms recently to gain a foothold. BlackRock Inc. has spent more than $25 billion since the start of 2024 to grow in private credit and infrastructure and compete with the likes of Blackstone Inc., Apollo Global Management Inc. and Ares Management Corp. Related:Rowan Says People ‘Lost Their Minds’ Over Private Credit Fears The asset management industry is also facing unrelenting fee pressure on traditional stock, bond, money-market and multi-asset funds, with almost 60% of institutional investors surveyed by PwC saying they’re likely or very likely to replace a manager solely for cost reasons. As a result, fees are expected to decline across active and passive strategies, even while costs remain stubbornly high. “Traditional cost-cutting has barely made a dent,” PwC said. “Diversifying into new asset classes and expanding into new markets add cost and complexity.” Fast forward five years, though, and technology will help drive profits in an industry with ever-narrowing margins, according to PwC. “Asset managers see AI integration and automation as the most important actions they’re taking today to transform and future-proof their business models for 2030,” the firm said in the report.

November 25, 2025 09:12 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Strategic Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence in Financial Services 2025" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.This report provides an overview of the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation in the financial services industry. It examines the forecasted size of the AI market, delving into specific types of AI spend (such as generative AI, computer vision, and agentic AI). The report lists different ways of utilizing AI to combat fraud, cyberattacks, evolving regulation, bad user experience, growing volumes of transactional data, and new attack vectors. It provides new case studies of innovative uses of AI within the industry, while providing company profiles of the leading AI adopters and specialist vendors across the insurance, banking, payments, and wealth management industries.AI adoption in financial services has ramped up significantly in the last few years. Financial services firms have long adopted generative AI tools for customer service and improved decision making, yet sustained direct profitability remains far off. The recent boom of agentic AI investment has necessitated financial services companies to reconsider all of their AI pilots, to govern deployments like product launches: require return on investment gates, scale what demonstrably pays, and sunset what does not. Financial services firms must adopt AI to improve cybersecurity and fraud prevention in the face of adaptive cyberattacks, new attack vectors, and rising insider threats.Report Scope Reasons to Buy Key Topics Covered: 1.

Title: 'Shocked, stunned' - locals gather for Gallagher funeral

The funeral mass of a 59-year-old woman who died after an attack near her home in Ballinlough in Cork city earlier this month has heard that she brought "goodness and beauty to this world". Family, friends and members of the local community gathered at Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Ballinlough today for the funeral mass of Stella Gallagher. Her husband Brian Gallagher, who was also injured in the attack, was at the mass along with the couple's adult children Ciara, Conor and Mark. Brian Gallagher was among the pallbearers who carried the coffin out of the church at the conclusion of the service for burial at St Michael's cemetery in nearby Blackrock. Alan Gallagher, a brother-in-law of Stella Gallagher, said a few words on behalf of his brother Brian during the requiem mass. Mr Gallagher said Stella had 30 wonderful years of life with her family. "When I asked them what some of their good memories of Stella were, they looked back at me and said they were all good. She was a joy to be around and great fun. She was game for anything and would go anywhere and have a good time." Mr Gallagher emphasised that Stella loved meeting people and chatting with them. "Whether her many relatives, cousins and second cousins, or someone she had just met. She loved going on outings with people, whether for a hike in the country or to a film or on a shopping trip." Mr Gallagher also recalled the activities that made Stella "really light up with joy" including singing, gardening and baking. "We are so grateful to have shared our lives with this lovely person. We love you, Stella, and we always will." Mr Gallagher closed his eulogy with a few lines by American short story writer Raymond Carver. "And did you get what you wanted from this life, even so? I did. And what did you want? To call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the Earth." Meanwhile, Monsignor Gearóid Dullea, co-parish priest in Ballinlough, told mourners that the death of Stella had left her loved ones "broken hearted" and "bewildered". He stated that her "shocking death" had brought a "great pall of sadness" not only over the Gallagher and Griffin families but also on the wider community. "Stella’s colleagues from her work in Eli Lilly, the local communities in Ballinlough and Ballinspittle, her friends and the Togher Community Garden and her fellow singers in the SHEP choir. Stella’s death has shocked us, stunned us and shaken us. "Stella was deeply loved as wife, as mother, as sister, as daughter-in-law, as sister-in-law, as aunt, as cousin, as friend. She was a positive person, often humming a song, with a quiet religious faith," he said. Offertory gifts included apples representing Stella’s love of gardening, sourdough signifying her enjoyment of baking, sheet music arising of her fondness for music and a gift box symbolising her generous and giving nature. Monsignor Dullea celebrated the mass alongside Fr Gerard Dunne and Rev Alan Marley, both of whom were representing University College Cork. Taoiseach Micheál Martin was represented by his Aide de Camp, Commandant Joe Glennon. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Crypto ETF flows: BTC sees $151M outflows as ETH and SOL funds thrive

The cryptocurrency sector remains weak as bearish sentiments prevail. Indeed, recent price drops, muted trading activities, and worries about short-term recoveries have seen many investors adopt a defensive bias. Exchange-traded funds flow data reflects this uncertainty, with Bitcoin recording massive withdrawals as altcoin products hold steady. Let us find out more. BTC spot ETFs had a rough session on Monday, with net outflows totaling $151 million, according to SoSoValue. That signals deteriorated interest in these financial products, which have played a key role in institutional crypto adoption. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC stood out as it posted positive ETF flows of $15.49 million on Monday amidst the broader retreat. On the other hand, BlackRock has struggled lately, with iShares’ outflows surpassing $2.2 billion so far in November. Meanwhile, the mixed ETF outflows come as the Bitcoin price experiences notable downward pressure. The bellwether crypto is trading at $88,190, down from late last month’s high above $115,500. While investors remain more conservative about Bitcoin, Ethereum thrived. Data shows Ether ETFs attracted $96.67 million in inflows yesterday, with BlackRock’s ETHA dominating at $92.61 million. Ethereum seems to thrive as Bitcoin struggles, as narratives like the latest attacks on Strategy by JPMorgan magnified uncertainty in BTC-based financial products. Institutions are seemingly migrating to Ethereum, possibly indicating renewed trust in its unique role in powering scaling solutions, decentralized apps (dApps), and support for new infrastructure. ETH is changing hands at $2,925 after gaining 3% the past 24 hours. It lost more than 2% the past week. Solana held its ground, attracting net inflows of $57.99 million on November 24. The altcoin has seen positive ETF flows since its debut, highlighting steady institutional demand. For instance, Bitwise’s Solana spot exchange-traded fund surpassed $500 million AUM last week. Solana experienced amplified institutional interest due to its robust network that prioritizes scalability, speed, and security. The team spent the past years rewriting Solana’s reputation, darkened by previous network outages. Now, the blockchain exhibits a thriving developer community, booming app usage, and Solana-based tokens. With these factors, Solana has carved a unique lane in the blockchain industry. SOL is trading at $138 after soaring 5% in the last 24 hours. The altcoin lost nearly 30% of its value over the past month. Meanwhile, Solana inflow confirms investors looking beyond price performance while prioritizing long-term potential. Meanwhile, the latest ETF flow statistics highlight a split market. Investors are now exploring crypto offerings beyond Bitcoin. Institutional investors are no longer treating all cryptocurrencies the same. They’re now evaluating every project based on solid catalysts, narratives, and momentum.

Title: What happened to crypto market today – Mild recovery, but where is smart money?

Rebound on bid support, smart money still on the sidelines. Despite a mild rebound, extreme fear shows that broader capital hasn’t entered the crypto market today, keeping smart money cautious. Bullish signs like rising whale holdings and institutional interest in DOGE/XRP ETFs indicate the market still has upside potential. The crypto market today registered a mild rebound. Bitcoin [BTC] retested $88,000, sparking debate over whether it has bottomed or if selling pressure is still weighing on the market. Ethereum [ETH] followed, climbing back above $2,800. All in all, has the market turned bullish? On the macro side, nearly $50 billion flowed into the crypto market over the last 24 hours. Notably, $30 billion of that went straight into Bitcoin. That’s 60% of inflows, a sign that traders are still favoring BTC over altcoins, keeping this cycle BTC-led. The result? The Altcoin Season Index slipped by 3 points to 39. In short, the minor rebound of the crypto market today isn’t broad-based. The inflows seemed to be too concentrated, making it premature to call a market bottom yet, with the TOTAL index already down 0.38% intraday. Source: TradingView (TOTAL/USDT) Simply put, the overall market participation has been cautious. BlackRock, for example, has been selling aggressively, moving 2,822 BTC and 36k ETH into Coinbase Prime. On the ETF side, inflows for both BTC and ETH have been flat, showing that big money isn’t jumping in yet. Reinforcing this, the Fear and Greed Index ticked up just 2 points to 12. However, it’s still in “extreme” fear, matching market positioning, with 95% of 24-hour liquidations in the crypto market today coming from longs. Despite bearish signals though, the crypto market today did see some signs of optimism. On the institutional front, Grayscale’s Dogecoin [DOGE] and Ripple [XRP] ETFs grabbed attention, reinforcing confidence in digital assets. Backing this trend, a prominent analyst challenged the idea of a market top. For one, 560k BTC flowed off CEXs, pushing reserves to an eight-year low. Meanwhile, whales holding over 10k BTC hit a five-month high – A sign that even in a risk-off environment, buying pressure didn’t quite disappear. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) In short, the crypto market today jumped on bid support. Alas, with institutional catalysts still missing, inflows concentrated in BTC, fear at extreme levels, and the Altcoin Season Index slipping, broader capital hasn’t entered yet. This is keeping smart money on the sidelines for now. So, while the crypto market today sparked some hope, it’s too early to call a bottom. The bright side – Bullish signals may be still intact, driving the rebound, with a market top nowhere in sight.

Title: Ondo turns to Figure’s stablecoin with $25M investment to back tokenized fund

Time Published: 2025-11-24T18:37:20Z

The investment broadens Ondo Finance’s onchain Treasury reserves and comes amid a renewed push into crypto-backed lending across fintechs, lenders and exchanges. Ondo Finance bought $25 million worth of YLDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Figure Technology Solutions, to diversify the assets backing its tokenized US Treasurys fund. The company said Monday that YLDS will be added to a reserves portfolio that already includes tokenized Treasury products from major asset managers, including funds issued by BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. Designed for institutional investors, the Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund (OUSG) offers onchain exposure to Treasurys with 24/7 redemptions and an estimated annual return of 3.68%. The tokenized fund had about $777 million in total value locked (TVL) as of this writing. Figure runs lending and capital-markets infrastructure on the Provenance blockchain, and has originated more than $19 billion in loans across home-equity lines, mortgage products, and crypto-backed credit. The deal follows Figure’s completion of its Nasdaq IPO earlier this year. According to DefiLlama data, its YLDS stablecoin has a market capitalization of around $100 million. Ondo Finance is a US-based platform founded in 2021 that tokenizes traditional financial assets. In October, the company expanded its tokenized asset lineup to BNB Chain, adding more than 100 tokenized Wall Street stocks and exchange-traded funds onchain. On Wednesday, the platform received regulatory approval from the Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority (FMA) to offer tokenized stocks in Europe. Figure’s stock price was up nearly 4% in early trading on Monday, according to Yahoo Finance data. Related: Ondo Finance to SEC: Hold off on Nasdaq’s tokenized securities plan Crypto-backed lending is gaining traction globally, and the trend has accelerated in 2025 as more lenders revive and expand crypto-collateralized loan products. In July, Block Earner introduced Bitcoin-backed home loans in Australia, offering borrowers cash worth up to half a property’s value, with the crypto collateral safeguarded by Fireblocks. On Tuesday, stablecoin issuer Tether announced an investment in Ledn, a platform that provides Bitcoin-backed consumer loans. In the third quarter, Ledn reported originating over $390 million in BTC-backed loans. Centralized exchanges are also expanding into this space and broadening their offerings beyond Bitcoin (BTC). On Thursday, Coinbase rolled out Ether-backed loans for US customers, letting users borrow up to $1 million in USDC against their Ether (ETH) holdings. Coinbase’s onchain lending markets have handled about $1.28 billion in loan originations since launching earlier this year, according to Dune data.

For more information, please contact: Sequana Medical Investor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.com T: +44 (0) 797 342 9917 About Sequana Medical Sequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload, a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease, heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study, a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada, the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1,2. Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025, CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1, 2025. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements3. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients, which is dependent on securing additional financing. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com. Important Safety Information: For important safety information regarding the alfapump® system, see https://www.sequanamedical.com/wp-content/uploads/ISI.pdf.

Wall Street funds, including BlackRock , have been cutting MicroStrategy exposure because the original “high-beta Bitcoin proxy” trade has broken down and the risk/reward on MSTR now looks worse than just owning Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs directly. A mix of aggressive dilution, leverage, governance concerns, and looming index/mandate issues has turned what was a clean proxy into something closer to a complex, quasi-closed-end Bitcoin fund with rising structural risks.

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Arthur Hayes predicts Bitcoin may dip below $80K before the Fed ends QT on Dec 1. Market liquidity shows early signs of improvement. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says macro liquidity trends are showing early signs of improvement. Hayes believes that this could probably lead to a Bitcoin BTC $91 264 24h volatility: 4.1% Market cap: $1.82 T Vol. 24h: $75.96 B price recovery, while staying confident that liquidity conditions would improve after the US Federal Reserve ends quantitative tightening (QT) on December 1. Crypto industry veteran Arthur Hayes noted that Bitcoin may continue to trade below the $90,000 level in the near term. He also flagged the possibility of one final BTC price move toward the low-$80,000 range. However, he believes the $80,000 level is likely to hold as support. minor improvements in $ liq:– fed qt stops dec 1, this wed will prob be last fall in b/s– us banks increased lending in nov we chop below $90k, maybe one more stab down into low $80k's but i think $80k holds. might start nibbling, but leave the bazooka until the new year — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 24, 2025 Despite the pullback, Hayes indicated he is considering small accumulation but plans to delay larger purchases until early next year. Hayes says macro liquidity trends are showing early signs of improvement, while highlighting two key developments. The first is that the U.S. Federal Reserve is scheduled to halt quantitative tightening on December 1. The other big improvement is that U.S. banks increased lending activity in November. Both hint at greater liquidity, which could benefit risk-on assets like BTC and digital assets. In a similar prediction, market research firm Swissblock noted a sharp decline in its “Risk-Off Signal,” indicating that the most intense phase of selling may have passed. The firm added that any remaining weakness is likely to appear as a smaller, secondary wave, potentially signaling seller exhaustion. This ultimately signals a shift towards buying momentum ahead. As per data from CoinShares, digital asset investment products recorded US$1.94 billion in outflows last week, extending the four-week total to US$4.92 billion. This marks the third-largest continuous outflow period since 2018. Bitcoin accounted for the largest share, with US$1.27 billion exiting the asset during the week, amid the BTC price correction. However, the report noted a partial reversal on Friday, when the asset saw US$225 million in inflows. Last week, BlackRock Bitcoin ETF saw record outflows, leading the pack. The early trading hours on Monday, November 24, show that the fund continues to bleed further. BlackRock just deposited another 2,822 $BTC($243.59M) and 36,283 $ETH($101.72M) to #CoinbasePrime.https://t.co/qmuDIrPHc6 pic.twitter.com/cAFKd0xDCY — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 24, 2025 Ethereum ETH $3 031 24h volatility: 2.9% Market cap: $366.25 B Vol. 24h: $21.92 B also faced significant pressure, with US$589 million withdrawn. Last week, the altcoin saw outflows representing 7.3% of its total assets under management (AuM). Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) and AccessFintech (AFT), a leading data and workflow collaboration network for financial markets, today announced a strategic partnership. 0 24 November 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Through Aladdin®, BlackRock’s technology platform that unifies the investment management process, the firms will aim to deliver bilateral connectivity and real-time post-trade collaboration between the global buy-side Aladdin platform community, and the 250+ capital markets and asset servicing institutions already connected to AccessFintech’s Synergy Network. “This partnership is a major milestone in our mission to unlock capital market efficiency at scale,” said Sarah Shenton, CEO of AccessFintech. “We’re proud to deepen our relationship with BlackRock and bring the power of our Synergy Network to Aladdin platform clients. This integration will enable interoperable, secure, and intelligent workflow across the investment lifecycle—delivering tangible benefits to the buy-side and enhancing collaboration for brokers, custodians and agent bank participants.”A New Standard for Post-Trade Collaboration The integration between AccessFintech and the Aladdin platform seeks to enable secure, API-first connectivity between buy-side firms and their sell-side, asset-servicing, and market-infrastructure counterparties. Benefits for Aladdin clients include:• Real-time visibility into trade lifecycle events and collaborate directly with brokers and custodians to resolve exceptions and reduce fails;• Access to real-time, cross-asset, multi-region data and AI-driven predictive analytics without changing existing infrastructure;• Accelerated remediation processes and reduce operational risk across securities, private markets (loans), and derivatives (swaps). Sell-side participants and asset servicers gain a powerful new channel to engage with the global network of buy-side firms on the Aladdin platform, enabling faster resolution and prevention of exceptions and providing transparency for better decision-making to improve client outcomes. “BlackRock has accelerated its strategy in partnership with AccessFintech, integrating real-time data across the post-trade and asset servicing lifecycle. This delivers more efficient workflow, greater interoperability, and improved risk management,” said Michael Debevec, Head of Global Investment Operations at BlackRock. “Our partnership extends these benefits to the wider Aladdin community, helping clients achieve higher operational performance and capacity throughout the investment lifecycle with a broader ecosystem of collaborators, enhancing the client experience.”Strategic Investment to Accelerate InnovationBlackRock has separately made a strategic capital investment in AccessFintech designed to support the company’s next phase of growth, including product innovation, global expansion, and deeper ecosystem integration. The investment reflects a shared commitment to a more connected, data-driven capital markets infrastructure. “BlackRock shares our vision for what advanced technologies can do to transform the post-trade landscape,” added Shenton. “This investment will accelerate our efforts to bring to market the innovations that continue to drive alpha for our clients.”Terms of the investment were not disclosed.

Title: A massive tech update will bring faster, cheaper trading to Wall Street. Get ready for stocks on a blockchain

Time Published: 2025-11-24T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
In early 2021, an army of retail traders made massive bets on meme stocks and briefly melted down the market. Trading volume swelled to such a huge extent that popular brokerage Robinhood had to halt buy orders for stocks like GameStop for a few days in order to escape a liquidity crisis. At the time, the situation led to claims of a conspiracy, but the reason for the meltdown was more mundane: Wall Street’s creaky infrastructure could not settle trades fast enough. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and others called for an overhaul, and since then there has already been progress, as stock trades now settle a day sooner than in 2021. But the financial industry is also pushing ahead with a more radical solution: turning stocks into digital assets that can be traded and settled instantly on a blockchain. It is not just crypto firms and fintech players leading this charge for “tokenization.” Big banks like J.P. Morgan are also using blockchains to facilitate trades in certain assets and, in doing so, transforming the financial ecosystem more broadly. Already, tokenization—which Tenev has described as a “freight train” poised to eat Wall Street—has brought fundamental changes to how stocks and other assets are traded. The potential upsides to tokenization are huge, but significant questions remain over how to implement it. Meanwhile, some fear the coming train could undermine some protections for individual “retail” investors and destabilize a U.S. equities market whose reliability has for decades been the envy of the world. The tokenization wave isn’t the first push to overhaul Wall Street’s under-the-hood operations. In the 1970s, traders confronted what became known as the “paperwork crisis,” which saw stock markets, drowning in orders, shut down mid-week simply to keep up with recordkeeping. Repeated work stoppages finally led to a computer-based solution. “Once upon a time there were leather-bound journals that said who owns all the stock,” explains Robert Leshner, a former economist who now runs the tokenization firm Superstate. “Then, people said, ‘This is too hard, let’s not update anymore,’ so they decided to create a legal fiction that assigned ownership of all the stock to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation,” or DTCC. The DTCC regime, which has been in place for decades, means it’s no longer necessary to record every single share transfer. Instead, the clearinghouse keeps track of the stock held by different brokerages on behalf of their customers and settles up transactions between those brokerages the next business day. Under this system, the brokerages nominally own the stock, but all the rights that attach to it—dividends, voting privileges, and so on—remain with the customers. The system has worked pretty well over the decades, and for those who insist on doing things the old-fashioned way, DTCC means they can still demand physical copies of their shares. (This option is popular with “GameStop truthers,” who believe reverting to paper will thwart a Wall Street conspiracy against retail investors.) Now, though, the current DTCC system of “T+1”—in which the clearinghouse closes out trades the next business day by reconciling accounts among brokerages—has come to feel outdated in an age when so much business is conducted instantly and around the clock. This has prompted companies like Leshner’s Superstate to offer a faster alternative. The startup is working with companies to issue versions of their shares that trade on a blockchain, an arrangement under which the firms don’t have to rely on intermediaries to hold or track their stock. It also means stock trades can be settled instantly, while allowing firms to interact with their shareholders more directly. Outside the U.S., tokenized assets are already helping investors avoid big trading commissions and invest in private companies like SpaceX Other firms are approaching tokenization in a different fashion. Robinhood, for example, doesn’t help firms tokenize their stocks, but instead takes stocks available on the open market and offers them in a blockchain “wrapper” as a sort of derivative. These offerings are currently available only in Europe, where stock owners can buy and sell the “Stock Tokens” alongside assets like Bitcoin. Retail investors unfamiliar with tokenization may be surprised, and possibly alarmed, to discover that a company they own is trading in the crypto-verse. For now, at least, it’s not something to worry about.Currently, even tokenization boosters say the new blockchain system will exist alongside the old one rather than replace it. So why do all this in the first place? For the average investor who trades only from time to time, the arrival of tokenized assets won’t mean much. Active traders, though, will appreciate the move to blockchain, since it opens the door for more trading after hours and on weekends. The new regime will also be appealing to institutional investors, since it will free up collateral that might otherwise be tied up waiting for settlement. “Imagine you’re a hedge fund and want to buy $1 million of Tesla stock,” says Johann Kerbrat, SVP of Robinhood Crypto. “You buy it on Friday, so you don’t have the money anymore, but you don’t get the shares in your account until Monday. So for three days, you can’t do anything.” It’s not just stocks being tokenized. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, working with Superstate’s tokenization rival Securitize, offers access to money-market funds and U.S. Treasuries via blockchain, and has already grown to $2 billion in assets under management. Meanwhile,J.P. Morgan is offering tokenized versions of private equity assets on its in-house Kinexys blockchain, in part because the process makes capital calls easier to track and manage. This is likely just the beginning. Rob Hadick, a partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly Capital, notes that other realms of finance like credit and fixed income are still conducted primarily in pre-digital fashion, with some transactions still made official by means of a fax. A switch to tokenization could enable such transactions to settle faster and more reliably. Hadick says it will also produce savings for banks and brokerages since it will reduce the ranks of back-office staff and disrupt specialized middlemen who handle tasks like loan origination and servicing fees. Meanwhile, for traders of all sorts, tokenized assets will be easier to move across brokerages or post as collateral. It is still early days, especially in the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to give the green light to tokenized equities. As of mid-November, the total value of such assets worldwide was about $660 million, according to research site RWA.xyz; the most popular ones include tokenized versions of index-tracking ETFs and Big Tech stocks such as Tesla, Nvidia, and Alphabet. But that nascent state hasn’t stopped brokerages from pushing forward, including crypto shop Kraken, whose tokenized versions of select U.S. stocks are doing a brisk trade in markets like Brazil and South Africa, where traders still pay hefty commissions that can amount to 10% or more, even as such fees have largely been eliminated in the U.S. Robinhood, meanwhile, got its hands on shares of privately held OpenAI and SpaceX, and has given away tokenized versions of them to European customers. As for the DTCC, it would be easy to assume the clearinghouse opposes the tokenization wave. Quite the opposite: According to two sources familiar with the company, the outfit is eager to move into blockchain, partly because it offers a potential way to expand into private markets. Asked for comment, the DTCC did not provide details but did suggest it is embracing the technology. “DTCC believes in the power and potential of tokenization to evolve and modernize market infrastructure. We are actively working to enable capabilities that further our products and services,” said Brian Steele, DTCC’s president of clearing and securities services. Not everyone is convinced a rush to tokenization is a good thing. Those urging caution include Citadel Securities, which has asked the SEC to adopt a go-slow approach. According to a source close to the firm, the trading giant fears that some crypto-aligned firms want to use the rulemaking process around tokenization to gain exemptions from long-standing consumer protection obligations. The person also expressed concern that a rapid shift could undermine trust in a U.S. equities market that is the biggest in the world and has been fine-tuned for decades. This concern may not be unfounded. Already, there have been notable discrepancies between the prices of traditional shares of a company’s stock and the prices of tokenized versions offered by the likes of Kraken. Meanwhile, it’s unclear if every firm offering tokenized equities has put in place adequate guardrails when it comes to custody and fiduciary obligations to the customer. What happens, for instance, in the event of a crypto firm going bankrupt while holding tokenized shares of a customer’s stock? And while every financial institution appears to view blockchain as the technology of the future, they may not agree as to which blockchain. Robinhood, among others, is relying on the open-source Ethereum chain to build out its tokenization business, while J.P. Morgan appears wedded to its own proprietary chain. According to Hadick, the venture capitalist, this situation could slow adoption, since, he says, other big firms like Goldman Sachs will be reluctant to rely on a blockchain controlled by a rival. Hadick adds, though, that any impasse is unlikely to last long, since “one thing blockchains do well is coordinate trust.” This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline: “Get ready to own a tokenized portfolio.” This article is part of Fortune’s 2025 Investor’s Guide.

MAGA Liz Wolfe | 11.24.2025 9:30 AM Trumpworld schism: On Friday night, MAGA Queen Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her resignation from Congress. "I've always represented the common American man and woman as a member of the House of Representatives, which is why I've always been despised in Washington, D.C. and just never fit in. Americans are used by the political industrial complex of both political parties, election cycle after election cycle, in order to elect whichever side can convince Americans to hate the other side more," the Georgia Republican said in her resignation video: My message to Georgia's 14th district and America.Thank you. pic.twitter.com/tSoHCeAjn1 — Marjorie Taylor Greene ???????? (@mtgreenee) November 22, 2025 Greene struck predictably populist America First notes ("Americans' hard-earned tax dollars always fund foreign wars, foreign aid, and foreign interests") and mapped her disagreements with the president ("H1Bs replacing American jobs, AI state moratoriums, debt for life 50 year mortgage scams, standing strongly against all involvement in foreign wars, and demanding the release of the Epstein files") while touting her loyalty. Read her full statement here. The Reason Roundup Newsletter by Liz Wolfe Liz and Reason help you make sense of the day's news every morning. Until recently, Greene and President Donald Trump seemed to be thick as thieves. But the Epstein files tore them asunder, with Greene positioning herself as an ardent advocate for full transparency while Trump (until recently) refused to go along. The president, pissed off by Greene's adamance, disavowed her and started publicly musing about how someone should mount a primary challenge, calling his once-loyal acolyte a "ranting lunatic." The Epstein issue wedged the door open for Greene to raise more grievances with Trump, especially the idea that he's been getting distracted from his domestic agenda and hasn't delivered much financial relief to the American people. The conflict came to a head during the recent government shutdown. "I don't see political party lines," said Greene, discussing health care and the many Americans who could soon see premiums spiking. Greene criticized her own side for having no workable plan in place to prevent these higher costs. "I don't know what happened to Marjorie," said Trump recently. "Nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think." Many of her constituents are still behind her. "I feel like she has stood her ground," Meredith Rosson, a 43-year-old paralegal and the chairwoman of the Republican Party in Chattooga County, told The New York Times. The Republican Party in Floyd County, also in Greene's district, issued a statement of "unwavering support" for Greene as soon as she announced her resignation. "She's realized, 'I need to do what's right for my community and for people who are mostly in the middle ground,'" cocktail bar/gun store owner Brandon Pledger told the Times. Scenes from New York: "Violent crime is overwhelmingly the work of a small group of repeat offenders—that is, it is highly concentrated. The remedy, as [James Q.] Wilson argued half a century ago in his classic book Thinking About Crime, is not social engineering but incapacitation: keeping the violent few from striking again," argues Tal Fortgang in City Journal. "In 2022, the New York Times reported that 'nearly a third of all shoplifting arrests in New York City…involved just 327 people,' or 0.004 percent of the population, who had been 'arrested and rearrested more than 6,000 times.'"

Landlords in Foxrock, Co Dublin, are commanding the highest average rents in the State at almost €4,000 a month, latest data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) shows. Renting a home in the south Dublin neighbourhood in the first quarter of this year would set a household back an average of €3,718 a month, said the CSO. Areas in south Dublin had the top 10 highest rents at the start of the year, with Goatstown in second place (€3,104 per month), followed by Dalkey, Killiney, Glenageary, Sandymount, Booterstown, Blackrock, Ballsbridge and Donnybrook, where average rents were €2,547. Outside Dublin the highest rents were in Greystones and Delgany, both in Co Wicklow (€2,331 and €2,077 per month), Bishopstown, Co Cork (€2,043) and Barna, Co Galway (€1,961). Across local authority housing, there was a 6 per cent increase in rents on average over the 12 months to September 2025. The rental figures, drawn from Residential Tenancies Board statistics, are among a wealth of information collated on the CSO’s housing information hub, including property prices, housing commencements and completions, planning permissions and vacant dwellings numbers. Property prices continued to increase this year compared with last, though by almost twice as much outside Dublin (9.4 per cent) as in the capital (5.3 per cent). On new homes, the number of dwellings granted planning permission was down 13 per cent – from 8,513 units in the third quarter of last year to 7,447 in 2025. However, the number of dwelling completions was up 13 per cent in the first three quarters of the year, standing at 24,325, compared with the same period in 2024. There were 177,600 people working in the construction industry. Among these, 67 per cent mainly worked on new housing developments or renovations. Average hourly labour costs for the sector were €34.22 in third quarter of this year, up from €30.85 in the second quarter of last year. Data shows that home heating fuels of choice are changing. As of the third quarter this year the most common main heating fuel across all dwellings was gas (35 per cent), followed by heating oil and electricity. For homes built since 2015 however, the most common heating fuel was electricity. Homes constructed from 2020 to the third quarter of this year were 93 per cent electrically heated, with 6 per cent using gas and less than 1 per cent using oil. Statistics on building energy ratings (BERs) show Kildare had the highest proportion of A-rated homes (28 per cent), followed by Meath (27 per cent) and Dublin county (27 per cent), while the lowest were in Leitrim and Cork city (both 5 per cent). The highest proportions of G-rated dwellings were in counties Roscommon and Leitrim (11 per cent).

The lowest level of A ratings in the capital was 7 per cent in Dublin 7, which includes Cabra, Phibsborough and Smithfield. In the last three months of 2023, the estimated national vacancy rate was 3.3 per cent based on low to zero electricity consumption in a dwelling. The local authorities with the highest vacancy rates this period were Leitrim (8.5 per cent), Roscommon (6.5 per cent) and Mayo (6.4 per cent).
