Shorts stack, liquidity piles – BTC’s weekly drama unfolds. Shorts are piling up, but spot demand remains strong. With liquidity building, fading Bitcoin here is bold. However, the setup could trigger a short squeeze. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF is soaking up 84% of this month’s $5 billion inflows, contrasting mid-August outflows, making leveraged shorting a risky play. Is it still too early to move against Bitcoin [BTC]? Weekly, BTC’s showing classic post-ATH behavior. The last two ATHs at $123k and $124k in Q3 both printed red candles, averaging a -1.5% pullback. A similar pattern appears to be repeating. After kicking off the week with the longest wick stretching to a $125k ATH, the candle is already 1.3% in the red, with the lowest wick reaching $119k. In short, betting against Bitcoin could be a strategically sound move. Source: Coinglass Backing this up, derivatives remain skewed to the short side, with 55% of positions betting against Bitcoin. In fact, that’s a +4% jump from the previous day, marking the steepest short skew we’ve seen in a month. Moreover, nothing underscores this more than AMBCrypto’s recent report, highlighting a massive $420 million short opened by an OG BTC whale at $120,678, showing smart money is bracing for a repeat post-ATH flush. However, with BTC trading at $121,600 at press time, that position is sitting on a 0.76% unrealized loss. That’s roughly $3.2 million bleeding on the books, reiterating the question: Is it still too early to bet against BTC? Institutional outflows are hitting BTC ETFs as fear creeps in. That said, BlackRock’s IBIT spot ETF is still racking up straight inflows, taking 84% of this month’s $5 billion. Technically, that’s nearly $4.2 billion flowing in, making IBIT a key bid and a major catalyst for Bitcoin. Notably, that’s a sharp divergence from mid-August, when IBIT made up 70% of $800 million in outflows, which slammed two weekly reds and sent Bitcoin down 9% from its $124k all-time high. Source: SoSo Value Against this backdrop, stacking leveraged shorts is a risky play. Analyst Aixbt echoed the same view, calling shorting into heavy ETF inflows and low profit-taking a “bold move,” with greed pushing traders to bet on a quick pop rather than sustained downside. In fact, $120.96 million in short liquidity is stacked around $121.8k, showing how much near-term juice is piled up. However, with bids still solid, BTC’s consolidation is shaping up as a bullish setup for a potential short squeeze.

Title: Billions “vanish” in First Brands bankruptcy as creditors demand independent probe

First Brands Group, an auto parts supplier, filed for bankruptcy with liabilities between 10?50 billion amid allegations of extensive debt rehypothecation. Creditors claim up to $2.3 billion has "simply vanished," raising suspicions of collateral pledged multiple times. Major financial players, including UBS, Millennium Management and Jefferies, face hundreds of millions in losses. Jefferies, the companyâs long-time banker, faces reputational damage as its role in opaque financing deals comes under scrutiny. Creditors demand an independent examiner, questioning the integrity of First Brandsâ internal investigation. 10?50 billion amid allegations of extensive debt rehypothecation.

Creditors demand an independent examiner, questioning the integrity of First Brandsâ internal investigation. Creditors demand an independent examiner, questioning the integrity of First Brandsâ internal investigation. The sudden implosion of First Brands Group, an Ohio-based auto parts supplier, has sent shockwaves through Wall Street, exposing what creditors allege is one of the most chaotic corporate bankruptcies in recent memory. With liabilities estimated betweenÂ 10?50 billion, the companyâs collapse has left financiers scrambling to locate billions in missing fundsâraising urgent questions about fraud, regulatory oversight and the hidden risks lurking in private credit markets. First Brands filed for Chapter 11 protection in late September in Texas, but the real story lies in the tangled web of off-balance-sheet financing, rehypothecated debt and potential double-pledged collateral that creditors say has left them empty-handed. Trade finance firm Raistone, owed millions, claims $2.3 billion has "simply vanished," while emails between lawyers reveal alarming gaps in accountability â including admissions that segregated accounts meant to protect creditors hold "$0." The fallout has ensnared some of financeâs biggest names, from UBS OâConnor ($500M exposure) to Millennium Management ($100M loss) and Jefferies, whose decade-long relationship with First Brands now faces intense scrutiny. Wall Streetâs winners and losers While most creditors brace for steep losses, a few savvy investors emerged unscathedâor even profited. Apollo Global Management and Diameter Capital Partners had shorted First Brandsâ debt before its collapse, a rare but lucrative bet in private credit markets. Jefferies, however, finds itself in the hot seat. The bank not only arranged risky loans for First Brands but also had deeper ties through its Leucadia Asset Management unit, which held $715 million in receivables linked to the company. When lenders paused a $6 billion refinancing deal in Augustâspooked by irregularities in First Brandsâ accountingâthe company spiraled into bankruptcy within weeks. Now, Jefferies faces reputational damage as clients question its due diligence. BlackRock has already requested partial redemptions from a Jefferies-linked fund exposed to First Brandsâ receivables. The shadowy world of off-balance-sheet financing First Brandsâ downfall highlights the dangers of opaque financing structures like factoring and supply-chain financeâmethods that allow companies to borrow against future cash flows without clear disclosures. The company reportedly factored 70% of its revenues, meaning it sold unpaid invoices to investors for upfront cash. But creditors allege these invoices may have been pledged multiple times as collateralâa practice akin to selling the same house to multiple buyers. Charles Moore, First Brandsâ restructuring officer, admitted investigators are probing whether assets were "commingled" or pledged "more than once." If true, it would mark a stunning breakdown in financial controlsâand potentially fraud. Systemic risks beyond first brands The First Brands debacle underscores broader vulnerabilities in todayâs credit markets, where private lending has surged with minimal oversight. CLOs & private credit funds: Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and private lenders, including Blackstone and PGIM, hold chunks of First Brandsâ debtânow trading at 15 cents on the dollar. Regulatory blind spots: Unlike publicly traded bonds, private credit deals often lack transparency, leaving investors in the dark about a companyâs true leverage. AI bubble distraction: With markets fixated on AI-driven stock rallies, few noticed the rot beneath the surfaceâuntil it was too late. Judge Christopher Lopez, overseeing the bankruptcy, remarked: "I donât think since my time on the bench Iâve seen anything like this." A warning sign for markets First Brandsâ collapse is more than a corporate failureâitâs a cautionary tale about the hidden risks in todayâs financial system. As creditors demand an independent probe, the case could expose deeper misconduct, from accounting fraud to lender complicity. For Wall Street, the lesson is clear: When debt is piled atop debt, and collateral disappears into a "black box," even the most sophisticated investors can be left holding the bag. And with private credit markets ballooning to $1.7 trillion, First Brands may be just the first domino to fall.

The bank not only arranged risky loans for First Brands but also had deeper ties through its Leucadia Asset Management unit, which held $715 million in receivables linked to the company. When lenders paused a $6 billion refinancing deal in Augustâspooked by irregularities in First Brandsâ accountingâthe company spiraled into bankruptcy within weeks. Now, Jefferies faces reputational damage as clients question its due diligence. BlackRock has already requested partial redemptions from a Jefferies-linked fund exposed to First Brandsâ receivables.

Title: ‘AI will change the way we work. But it will take time, and then it will go fast’

Wall Street is hedging its bets. While the S&P 500, the world’s most followed stock market index, keeps hitting record highs every other day amid a three-year bull run, gold, which usually moves in the opposite direction to shares, has been on a tear of its own. The price of the safe-haven asset has jumped more than 50 per cent so far this year to breach $4,000 (€3,443) an ounce for the first time. Reasons for the gold rush abound. Many market strategists say the precious metal is being used as a hedge against economic uncertainty caused by Trump administration tariffs. Some point to a fall this year in the value of the dollar, the currency in which gold is priced. And others say gold is a safe bet in case the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has been fuelling the stock market starts to fizzle out. But, for Ron O’Hanley, chairman and chief executive of State Street – a leading administrator to the global investment management industry and one of the biggest asset managers in its own right – the reason for the anomaly may be more simple. [ ‘Gold-plated Fomo’ powers bullion’s record-breaking rallyOpens in new window ] “In some ways, gold is an indicator of what investors’ beliefs are about long-term inflation prospects,” O’Hanley says, speaking to The Irish Times in Dublin this week. There are good reasons to be concerned about rising inflation over time. “If you look at government debt levels, there’s been a fundamental change if you think about the ’08 period to where we are now,” he says. “The pandemic proved quite costly in the taking on of government debt.” Global government debt surged from 58 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 to 93 per cent last year, or almost $100 trillion, driven by the borrowings to support businesses and households during Covid lockdowns, according to the International Monetary Fund. Some investors believe central banks may, eventually, tolerate higher inflation to reduce the real burden of public debt. So, why is the equity market continuing to rise? “In aggregate, consumer debt levels are in pretty good shape relative to where they were in the past. Corporate debt levels are also in pretty good shape,” says O’Hanley. “That is a good signal to the equity market.” The impact of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have driven the S&P 500 in recent years – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – is now starting to broaden to other companies, he says. Official interest rates are continuing to decline. Meanwhile, corporate earnings are, for the time being at least, also holding up well – with the consensus forecast among analysts pointing to 10 per cent earnings per share growth this year in the US – even as many industries are absorbing much of the impact of tariffs, rather than passing them on to customers. A survey published by KPMG last week found that just a fifth of US businesses have passed on over half of new tariff expenses. O’Hanley, whose group has $49 trillion of assets under custody and administration (almost the equivalent of the US and EU economies combined, measured by GDP), is on the fence – publicly at least – on the long-term effects of US president Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies. “That’s the $64,000 question that everybody’s asking. And probably the entity that is asking it the most is the Federal Reserve. There is a school of thought that the tariffs are a one-time price reset and they shouldn’t actually reset inflation expectations. Others say this has a rolling impact that will be cumulative – and in a way that we just don’t know.” The biggest challenge is ongoing uncertainty, as many tariffs are still not finalised, he says, more than six months after Trump’s Liberation Day speech. The broader question is the future of globalisation. “Whether you call it deglobalisation or a reordering of globalisation, we’re going to see change – and national interests become much more prominent,” he says. “We’re in a period of adjustment. And the biggest challenge to investors and companies is that it’s very hard to make a decision that has long-term implications when you’ve got this kind of uncertainty.” It must be disorienting to ponder for someone whose career began at the dawn of the era of hyperglobalisation. Following the completion of a master’s in business administration (MBA) at Harvard Business School in 1986, Hanley joined management consultancy McKinsey, where he would end up as a partner and head of the firm’s investment management practice worldwide. [ ‘You’d have to have been a turkey not to have made money in venture capital in 1997’Opens in new window ] He subsequently joined Mellon Financial Corporation in 1997 and went on, following the group’s 2007 merger with Bank of New York, to serve as the wider BNY Mellon group’s asset management arm. Hanley also spent a four-year stint in a senior role at Fidelity Investments before joining State Street in 2015 as head of the investment management arm. State Street traces its roots back to 1792 as Union Bank in Boston. Fifty years ago it shifted its focus from commercial banking to the plumbing work that takes place after shares and bonds are traded – like clearing, settlement and custody – as well as asset management. State Street set up an Irish operation in 1996 and has since become one of the largest international financial services employers in the State, employing about 2,300 people in offices in Dublin, Kilkenny, Naas, Co Kildare, and Drogheda, Co Louth. Almost a decade and a half ago, the investment arm bought Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM), once the crown jewel of the Irish bank. BIAM had €26 billion of assets under management (AUM) at the time. The US group had $49 trillion of assets under custody and administration as of the end of June. Its asset management arm, rebranded as State Street Investment Management this year, had $5.12 trillion of AUM. While O’Hanley’s appointment as incoming CEO of State Street in November 2017 marked the culmination of his career, a report in The Boston Globe the next day drew attention to a less flattering episode from his distant past. It’s interesting to see all the excitement in AI as if it was invented in 2023 ... we – and others – have been on this AI journey for many, many years It reported that he withdrew from Vanderbilt University Law School in 1983 after admitting to plagiarism as editor-in-chief of the Vanderbilt Law Review. A day after the report, he issued an email to staff, acknowledging that “as a student I made a big mistake”. State Street stood by O’Hanley. A spokeswoman said at the time that he had fully disclosed the matter and the organisation supported him “unequivocally”. His “track record as a corporate leader and his achievements both at State Street and in his previous roles speak for themselves”, she added. Under O’Hanley’s tenure as CEO, which officially began in January 2019, the group’s assets under custody and administration have jumped 55 per cent, while assets under management have more than doubled. While the softly-spoken executive is a lower-profile figure than many other bosses of top US financial institutions – such as JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink of BlackRock or Jane Fraser at Citigroup – he is well regarded in the asset management and administration world. Last year, Global Custodian, the go-to publication for the industry, gave him a lifetime achievement award. The past three years have seen State Street take out $1.3 billion of running expenses, driven by the use of AI to do more mundane tasks normally carried out by entry-level workers, O’Hanley told a conference in June. He said the underlying global headcount fell by 4,000 last year – even as the headline figure jumped 13 per cent to 53,000 as it consolidated an Indian joint venture into the group. “It’s interesting to see all the excitement in AI as if it was invented in 2023,” he says now. “But we – and others – have been on this AI journey for many, many years.” [ AI’s replacement of humans in HR is emblematic of what could happen across the workplaceOpens in new window ] Machine learning has long been used for one of the most important daily tasks of State Street: calculating the net asset value (NAV) of tens of thousands of funds. “Fifteen or 20 years ago, markets would close and a flurry of activity would start to work out what happened in a fund that day – the buys, the sells, the corporate actions, the dividends paid and received – to come up with a net asset value. It typically took an hour and a half to produce and send on to clients. “What’s happening now, with machine learning, is that the NAV is being calculated transaction by transaction every day. That was, if you will, a prior generation of AI.” State Street is currently teaming up its software engineers with what he calls “AI buddies”. And it is encouraging employees to continually think differently about how AI can be used at work. “I’m often amazed at some of the ideas that come up. Some you might think of as trite, but they’re actually changing work in a fundamental way. The housing crisis isn’t unique to Ireland. Our home city of Boston is equally challenged when it comes to housing. It’s a global problem “For example, take the end of a financial period. Again, that’s a time when a lot of people spring into action. All that work has now shortened. Is it reducing the number of people? Not really. But time that was spent on identifying ‘what happened’ is collapsing. That’s created more time for the ‘so what’ of what’s happened – the analysis around it.” Most importantly, it’s left time to consider the ‘now what?’ – what are we going to do next?” he says. “AI will change the way we work. But, like a lot of change, it will take time, and then it will go fast.” Will AI lead to dystopian scenario of the robots taking over white-collar jobs, or create a future where people are free to enjoy greater leisure and personal fulfilment? “I think neither is going to happen. For the most part, it will change the nature of work for the positive,” he says. “It’ll put new requirements on employees. It will also have implications for the education system. We need to move away from a way of thinking, where people go, ‘I know exactly what my child needs. They need to go to coding camp and be prepared to be an electrical engineer.’ In future, you need to be a problem solver and you need to be a lifelong learner.” O’Hanley (68) says he spends about 60 per cent of his working life away from Boston. He has been in Ireland this week for a series of meetings and to speak at a convention in Dublin on Thursday. He has Irish roots on both sides of his family tree. Forebears of his mother, whose family name was Fagan, moved to the US in the 18th century. “The O’Hanley’s were famine emigrants from Roscommon in the late 1840s,” he says. “They took the classic journey, with a couple of generations in Canada before making their way down to the Boston-Rhode Island area.” O’Hanley also speaks about State Street’s commitment to regional Irish towns and cities, even as rival BNY Mellon recently decided to close its offices in Wexford and Cork – affecting hundreds of jobs – to improve “operational efficiency”. Dublin’s position at the epicentre of a national housing crisis makes it more important to spread the company’s Irish operations to attract and keep “talent”, O’Hanley says. [ Dublin is becoming a place of extremes, home to only the very richest and the poorestOpens in new window ] “The housing crisis isn’t unique to Ireland. Our home city of Boston is equally challenged when it comes to housing. It’s a global problem.” The CEO says he’s “actually quite encouraged” by Government efforts to boost housing supply. While economists say the Government faces major challenges meeting its target of delivering 300,000 new homes by 2030, home builders have concluded that Budget 2026 measures aimed at rebooting apartment building – together with new apartment construction guidelines unveiled during the summer – have moved the dial significantly and will help narrow the viability gap for apartment construction. “But, like everybody else,” O’Hanley says, “we’d like to see more, faster.” Name: Ron O’Hanley.

Title: In Bankruptcy Court, First Brands Creditors Demand Explanation for ‘Vanished’ Cash

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/09/2025 4:36:21 PM PDT by CFW Since it filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 29, auto-parts supplier First Brands has come under intense scrutiny for alleged accounting malpractice, opaque financing agreements, and late payments to suppliers. In an effort to shed light into the company’s murky finances, one of First Brands’ largest creditors filed an emergency motion in bankruptcy court on Wednesday calling for an independent investigation into the beleaguered firm’s books. As much as $2.3 billion in short-term financing has “simply vanished,” wrote Richard Jacobsen, counsel for Raistone, a fund that is partly owned by O’Connor, a UBS hedge fund. Raistone said it was owed at least $172 million. The Department of Justice also opened an inquiry into the collapse, The Financial Times reported on Thursday. For years, First Brands had received funding through a short-term lending strategy known as “factoring.” After the supplier delivered products to customers including Walmart and O’Reilly Autoparts, it sold the right to the customer invoices to outside investors, including units of UBS and Jefferies. The arrangement allowed First Brands to receive cash upfront, smoothing its inflows, while giving lenders the opportunity to earn interest. Factoring, part of a broader credit strategy known as trade financing, isn’t unusual. Yet First Brands allegedly borrowed billions of dollars of the short-term loans, with much of the money kept off-balance sheet through a network of separate corporate entities. It may also have sold certain invoices more than once, according to court filings and transcripts. [snip] When asked in court on Oct. 1 where roughly $2 billion of factoring cash was located, Sunny Singh, a lawyer for First Brands, said: “It’s not here. We don’t have it. Zero dollars. There’s $12 million in the bank account today. That’s it. There’s nothing else.” (Excerpt) Read more at msn.com ...

JPMorgan and Barclays had provided the company with a line of credit. “We have conviction that our differentiated approach enables us to deliver consistent, predictable and positive outcomes,” Chu said in a June 11 statement announcing the Barclays-led securitization. Less than three months later, his auto empire lay in shambles. On Sept. 5, Tricolor abruptly closed its 65 lots across six states before filing for liquidation under Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy code. S&P put its auto-loan-backed securities on watch for downgrades before suspending its ratings entirely, and some of the company’s lenders have flagged their exposure in regulatory filings.

Title: Dem Influencer Who Called Trump ‘Dementia-Addled’ Cheers Violent Rioters at BlackRock
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/10/09/dem-influencer-who-called-trump-dementia-addled-cheers-violent-rioters-at-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T21:15:14Z
Full Content:
Jack Cocchiarella, a Democrat social media influencer with over 1.25 million YouTube subscribers who recently appeared on CNN and interviewed California Gov. Gavin Newsom, expressed support on social media for protesters involved in an unruly demonstration at BlackRock headquarters. Cocchiarella posted on X, “Fuck BlackRock free Palestine it’s that simple,” in response to footage of violent pro-Hamas rioters attempting to storm BlackRock headquarters in New York City. Cocchiarella, known for his political commentary, appeared on CNN last week, where he described President Donald Trump as “kind of this dementia-addled, really nursing home patient in the White House right now.” During the same exchange, Cocchiarella criticized Trump’s approach to policy negotiations, claiming the president “doesn’t seem interested in negotiating” and instead uses his time “to go out to golf” or “maybe remodel some more parts of the White House,” taking pleasure in “the traumatizing of federal workers.” Cocchiarella’s claims fall short on the facts. Just six months into his second term, President Trump brokered roughly one peace deal or ceasefire per month, a level of achievement the president Cocchiarella supports could not match in four years. In September 2024, RNC Research reported that President Joe Biden had “spent a total of 532 days (40.3% of his presidency) on vacation.” Cocchiarella conducted an interview with Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) in August, where the two discussed national politics and the Republican Party’s future leadership. Cocchiarella said: We talk a lot in our party right now about rebranding. We need to fix the brand of the Democratic Party. We do. But I think in this moment, we also have to focus on the brand of the Republican Party. These people don’t want lower taxes, more freedoms. JD Vance doesn’t care about that. JD Vance wants to take his lifestyle and impose it on you and then not live it himself. This guy’s a squish. He’s weak. He’s desperate for power. Newsom responded by warning “This is not just about Trump. This is about something much more insidious, much more alarming,” urging viewers to “pay attention” to figures like JD Vance and Stephen Miller, “The folks around Trump and those that are perpetuating, promoting Trumpism, and sometimes to your point, running circles around Trump in many respects.” He added, “JD Vance is a unique one, because he’s complete weakness masquerading as strength.” Cocchiarella’s admiration for Newsom contrasted sharply with the governor’s own record. Gavin Newsom spent $250 million on a special election to gerrymander California’s congressional map while blaming Donald Trump for a lack of wildfire aid, even as displaced residents waited for relief. Newsom called a November 4 special election under the “Election Rigging Response Act” to eliminate Republican seats in Congress, claiming he was “saving democracy” despite questions over the law’s constitutionality. Despite boasting that California’s economy rivals Japan’s, Newsom presides over surging homelessness, rising poverty, and a $68 billion budget deficit that indicate widespread mismanagement within his administration. These examples are far from exhaustive. The California governor praised Cocchiarella’s growing online platform, saying, “Let’s see the growth of your podcast, bro, what you’re doing with this YouTube channel. It’s like blowing up. That just gives you hope, and it inspires other people.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

Title: Cardano’s Hoskinson Says Bitcoin’s Four-Year Cycle Is Dead, Predicts Lower Price Spikes And Dips
URL: https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-hoskinson-says-bitcoins-four-year-cycle-is-dead-predicts-lower-price-spikes-and-dips/

Full Content:
Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has theorized that the concept of a four-year cycle for Bitcoin is fading away after holding sway for nearly 13 years. Hoskinson noted that financial heavyweights like BlackRock and Fidelity wading into BTC will reduce the volatility typically associated with the asset. In an interview with CNBC, Hoskinson noted that Bitcoin’s four-year cycle will no longer hold sway in the coming years, given the entry of new players into the space. According to Hoskinson, new institutional money and complex financial products like synthetics and derivatives will be the death of the four-year cycle. The Bitcoin four-year cycle refers to a historical market pattern revolving around the Bitcoin halving event, marked by price surges and drawdowns. The pattern begins with the accumulation phase, usually one year after the halving event, with long-term investors making sizable purchases. By the second or third year in the cycle, Bitcoin typically breaks its previous all-time high to trigger retail FOMO. The third or fourth year in the cycle is marked by sharp corrections, with previous pullbacks accumulating to 85% in losses. “I don’t think we’re gonna see those kinds of cycles anymore because there is too much money in the space and there is too much market structure,” said Hoskinson. Furthermore, Hoskinson added that new capital inflows and complex products will play a significant role in reducing Bitcoin’s volatility in the coming years. For Hoskinson, there will be “stronger floors and less volatility,” noting that large price jumps will be a thing of the past. He noted that reducing the volatility will play a significant role in boosting Bitcoin’s adoption to the “next half a billion people.” Hoskinson also added that regulations in the space will introduce new players with a specialty in stability and risk management, justifying his stance on lower volatility levels. Despite predicting the end of the four-year cycle for Bitcoin, Hoskinson disclosed that altcoin season will still exist in the near future. However, the Cardano founder opined that rather than a random price spurt for altcoins, key narratives will shape the ecosystem. For example, Hoskinson noted that the altcoin season of the last cycle was focused on the next Ethereum killer, leading to the rise of Solana and Polkadot. Hoskinson disclosed that the fourth-generation altcoin season will be dominated by privacy-focused projects, with the Cardano founder tipping Midnight for success.

Title: Wes Edens is selling his sprawling $35M penthouse — located in a famed architect’s only NYC building

Time Published: 2025-10-09T18:02:11Z
Full Content:
Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wes Edens has found a buyer for his trophy Manhattan penthouse, which was last asking $35 million. The posh perch overlooks the High Line at the curvaceous 520 W. 28th St., the only residential building in New York designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid — the first female architect to win the Pritzker Prize. And it’s about as far from Edens’ upbringing on a rural ranch in Montana as one could reasonably imagine. If the deal closes near that price, it would be a win for Edens, a co-founder of Fortress Investment Group and founder of New Fortress Energy, a liquefied natural gas company. As the sale is in contract, there’s no word yet on how much he’s selling it for — and who the new owner is. Edens, who got his start at BlackRock and Lehman Brothers, is also co-owner of Aston Villa Football Club and owns the e-sports franchise FlyQuest. In addition, he founded Brightline, a high-speed passenger rail system connecting Miami to Orlando at 125 miles an hour. Brightline also plans to connect Southern California and Las Vegas at speeds of about 200 miles per hour. The deal was first reported in the weekly Olshan Luxury Market Report. Edens bought the penthouse for $20.2 million in 2020 — four years after it hit the market for $50 million, and renovated it in 2022, according to the listing — from Clayton Orrigo and Stephen Ferrara, of Compass, who declined to comment on the pending deal. The 6,618-square-foot aerie comes with five bedrooms and seven baths, and features its own internal three-story sculptural staircase and private elevator — along with 2,500 square feet of outdoor space. The home opens to a great room with 20-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling glass windows and views over the High Line. The room is further anchored by a large gas fireplace, custom lighting and a three-story chandelier. The main floor also comes with a chef’s kitchen, a media room, a library and a private balcony. Upstairs, a main bedroom suite comes with two walk-in closets, a spa-like bath, a sitting area and a private balcony. There are also an additional three bedrooms and a wet bar. Finally, a landscaped rooftop, “rebuilt from the studs” includes a sauna, a custom hot tub and cold plunge, a barbeque and an indoor wet bar. Amenities in the building — which was completed in 2017, a year after Hadid’s death of a heart attack at age 65 — include a 75-foot sky-lit pool, robotic parking and a private IMAX theater.

Title: Analysis:'Every electron counts': Why renewables stocks are back in play

Business MILAN :A return of fund inflows into renewable energy stocks is helping to breath new life into these companies' shares, powering their strongest quarterly rise since the sustainability boom early this decade. After two years of bearish sentiment and relentless redemptions that made the sector a short-sellers' hotspot, a fundamental shift in the U.S. power demand outlook and greater policy certainty are luring investors back. U.S. President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" and the subsequent move to direct the U.S. Treasury to restrict tax credit rules have hit the renewables industry. But money managers say the outcome was not as bad as many feared, and offers enough certainty for investors to engage and companies to resume projects. "Valuations were so disconnected from the fundamentals that even confirmation of negative news became a positive catalyst, said BlackRock portfolio manager Alastair Bishop. "It allowed investors to start focusing on the fundamentals." Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday. This service is not intended for persons residing in the E.U. By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading With the outlook improving, Bishop said outflows from BlackRock's active clean-energy strategies had slowed.Robeco portfolio manager Roman Boner said flows into the company's Smart Energy strategy had recently turned positive after sustained outflows. Lipper data shows alternative energy funds had their first net monthly inflow in June, after 25 straight months of outflows totalling around $24 billion. Investors pulled out money again in July before inflows returned in August and neared $800 million in September, the largest since April 2022. Quarterly data from Morningstar shows outflows from Clean Energy/Tech have shrunk to their lowest since the last recorded inflow in Q2 2023. These green shoots coincide with double-digit gains in clean energy indices, ETFs, and a surge in individual stocks across the sector — from producers to infrastructure plays. Bloom Energy is a prime example, teaming up with Oracle to deploy fuel cells at data centres. Its shares have rallied 300 per cent in four months to become the biggest weight in the iShares Clean Energy ETF, a jump some investors view as over-exuberant.The Federal Reserve's dovish tone has also helped. Capital-intensive renewable projects benefit from lower borrowing costs, though rates remain well above the ultra-low levels seen during ESG's heyday.PRIVATE EQUITY MOVES IN LOOKING FOR VALUEPrivate equity is also moving in, ignoring political noise to focus on long-term value. Global Infrastructure Partners is reportedly in talks to buy AES, potentially one of the largest deals involving a Wall Street power company. The MSCI Global Alternative Energy Index has halved since its January 2021 peak, but rose 17 per cent in the three months to September — its strongest quarter since end-2020 and more than double the broader market's gain.The rally, from a record-low base, has extended into October and is not purely U.S.-centricFirst Solar, a U.S. solar bellwether, climbed about 33 per cent over this period. Portuguese renewable energy company EDP Renovaveis rose 18 per cent.SHIFT IN MARKET FROM SUBSIDIES-DRIVEN TO DEMAND-LEDDriving the rally is rising electricity demand from Big Tech's rapid AI data centre build-outs, electrification of transport and industry, and the upgrading of grid infrastructure to handle new loads.U.S. power consumption, stagnant for over a decade, is forecast to grow sharply. With gas turbines in short supply and nuclear years away, solar-plus-storage is emerging as the only scalable short-term solution."Data centres need electricity in two to three years. People will just add as much renewables as they can. It's not only the cheapest source, but also the fastest to build," said Boner. These trends show renewable energy is morphing from a sector driven by policy and subsidies, to one shaped primarily by market forces, where strong demand requires all forms of energy."Every electron counts," Boner added.Cumulative new U.S. power generation demand is seen at 450 gigawatts by 2030, based on data presented by renewables developer NextEra. Of that, only 75 GW is projected from gas-fired plants, around 40 GW from deferred coal retirements, and limited nuclear contributions. Jonathan Waghorn, who manages both sustainable and fossil fuel funds at Guinness Asset Management, sees renewable earnings picking up, noting electricity demand forecasts have surged eightfold in just a few years."That's starting to get earnings momentum into the companies, especially those with AI, data centre, and grid-building exposure. The industry has just started to get going again, and the market is reacting."Waghorn's fund holds stocks involved in electrifying the energy mix like Eaton and Legrand. He also likes European names like cable maker Prysmian and grid services company Spie.Bishop expects earnings upgrades, typically supportive of price performance, and sees room for valuations to rise. At 14.6 times forward earnings, MSCI's Alternative Energy Index trades at a 40 per cent discount to world stocks, vs a 10-year average premium of 7.4 per cent, based on LSEG data, illustrating how the sector is currently valued well below the broader market despite historically commanding a premium. There are still risks - including higher-for-longer interest rates, policy reversals, and speculative retail excitement in unprofitable areas like new-generation nuclear - but some managers say unwinding bearish bets could help sustain the rally."There are still shorts to be squeezed out of the renewable space," said Luca Moro, CIO at SpesX, an energy transition fund.

More Info As we approach the end of the 2025 financial year, the U.S. stock market continues its defiant rally, shrugging off concerns about job losses, a partial government shutdown, and geopolitical instability. While the S&P 500 has surged with a roughly 14.2% year-to-date (YTD) gain, fueled largely by the relentless AI-driven investment boom—a phenomenon reshaping capital flows from semiconductors to energy infrastructure—the overall Energy sector is lagging badly. With a mere 4.5% YTD gain, it holds the third-lowest spot among major sectors, as oil and gas producers contend with softer commodity prices, the unwinding of OPEC+ cuts, rising costs, and elevated tariffs. Yet, beneath the surface of this underperforming sector, a significant transformation is taking hold.... A rebound in clean energy has seen the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) rise nearly 40 % this year, with demand tied to AI data centers and electrification is driving new investing patterns. Solar stocks are also benefiting, bolstered by policy support and tax incentives preserved (in part) under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). One recent Oilprice article warns that OBBBA “gutted key tax incentives for clean energy projects” and warns the bill’s impact on solar could worsen over time. The U.S. Senate’s July passage of OBBBA without last-minute excise taxes on solar that some lawmakers had proposed also helped stabilize investor sentiment in domestic solar and storage. The removal of those tariffs lent clearer direction to the U.S. clean energy supply chain and gave developers greater confidence in the viability of long-term projects. This shared agenda of capital rotating toward electrification, AI-driven power demand, and policy stability is creating room for a diverse set of energy names to outperform. These winners are not all pure-play renewables. They include integrated power operators, utilities reinventing themselves, and grid-tech enablers. Below are five off-the-radar energy stocks quietly outperforming their peers. Market Cap: $2.20B YTD Returns: 161.4% Israel-based smart energy SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) has been one of the best performers in the solar sector, alongside the broader Israeli stock market, with SEDG up in the triple digits thanks to the company’s improving business fundamentals. SolarEdge returned yet another healthy quarterly scorecard on Tuesday, with second quarter revenue of $289.4M (+9.0% Y/Y) beating the Wall Street consensus by $14.91 million, while non-GAAP EPS of -$0.81 beat by $0.03. According to SolarEdge CEO Yehoshua Nir, Trump’s OBBBA "validates our multiyear strategy of onshoring manufacturing to the U.S. by preserving the 45X advanced manufacturing credit for the next 7 years. We intend to manufacture in the U.S. and to ship U.S.-made SolarEdge products both domestically and across the globe for years to come." SolarEdge’s gross margins continued to improve, increasing 310 basis points sequentially to 11.1%. The company reported that the ongoing supply chain optimizations will cut gross margins by ~ 2%, down from a previous forecast of 4% to 6%. SolarEdge also issued upbeat guidance, with third quarter revenue in the range of $315 million to $355 million, representing 28.4% Y/Y growth at the midpoint while non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 15% -19%, including the 2% of new tariff impact. Market Cap: $165.0B YTD Returns: 83.7% GE Vernova (NYSE:GE) is one of the youngest energy companies, having been spun off by industrial giant General Electric (NYSE:GE) in 2024. GE Vernova is a global energy company that develops and provides products and services for generating, transmitting, and orchestrating electricity. With a market cap roughly half that of its parent company, GE Vernova is one of the largest renewable energy companies, with its GE Renewable Energy division offering a broad portfolio of wind, hydro, storage, and solar technologies. GEV shares have increased more than five-fold from their IPO price, thanks to rising global demand for the company’s services, strong backlog growth and multiple tailwinds from electrification and decarbonization. However, the wild runup has lately attracted some downgrades from Wall Street, with RBC Capital recently trimming GEV price target from $631, with the bank saying the company’s strong outlook is already reflected in the valuation. Market Cap: $113.8B YTD Returns: 60.1% Constellation Energy Corp. (NYSE:CEG) produces and sells energy, including electricity and natural gas, along with sustainable energy solutions to commercial, industrial, residential, and public sector customers. The company operates a diverse portfolio of generation assets, including nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric power, with a total capacity of approximately 31,676 megawatts. CEG shares have been on a tear after the company unveiled an agreement in June to sell more than 1,100 MW of nuclear power to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) from its Illinois nuclear plant for 20 years. According to The Wall Street Journal, the deal is the first deal of its kind for an operating nuclear plant in the United States, and closely mirrors a similar deal Constellation signed with Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) last year. The Microsoft deal is a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) that will see Constellation Energy restart its undamaged reactor in Three Mile Island, which was undergoing decommissioning. Neither deal will draw power from the main grid. However, Meta appears to have secured a better deal, with Citi’s Ryan Levine estimating that the 20-year PPA is priced in the $70-$95/MWh range, considerably cheaper than Jefferies' estimate of at least $110/MWh for Microsoft's PPA, because Meta’s deal “...does not offer a substantial premium for low-carbon nuclear power”. Levine has projected that ~70% of Constellation's existing nuclear plants could secure comparable datacenter deals at ~$80/MWh. Market Cap: $67.9B YTD Returns: 44.8% Irving, Texas-based Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is an integrated power generation company that generates and sells power to residential, commercial, and industrial customers across the United States. The company operates a diverse portfolio of power generation facilities, including natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage, and serves customers through retail brands like TXU Energy and Ambit Energy. VST shares have easily outpaced their energy brethren thanks to the company recording increased power demand from AI data centers and strong results from recent PJM capacity auctions, which are creating a favorable market environment for Vistra's generation and retail operations. Vistra’s diversified fleet, strategic positioning in the nuclear power sector through the Harbor Energy acquisition, and focus on long-term growth and customer-tailored solutions also contribute to investor confidence. Market Cap: $10.3B YTD Returns: 12.7% The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a Virginia-based power generation and utility company that operates in the United States and internationally. AES is actively transforming into a leader in renewable energy, focusing on solar, wind, and energy storage solutions to accelerate a greener energy future. AES shares have been rallying following a report by the Financial Times that BlackRock's (NYSE:BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners plans to acquire the utility company soon, in what would be one of the largest infrastructure takeovers on record. The deal would value AES at ~$38 billion, AES’ $29 billion in debt. Global Infrastructure Partners, which BlackRock acquired a year ago, has a history of utility mergers, including a $6.2 billion deal that took public utility company Allete private.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Empire Nears $100 Billion — But What’s the Real Endgame? | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee to read how a single fund is rewriting the rules of finance, blurring the line between crypto and traditional markets. With it, concerns arise that its next milestone could change how power itself moves through money. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is closing in on a historic milestone of $100 billion in assets under management (AUM), just 22 months after its launch. According to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the fund has already surpassed legendary funds like VIG. It is now ranking 19th overall in AUM, signaling how fast Bitcoin has embedded itself into institutional finance. IBIT WATCH: lost a bit of aum yesterday bc of btc price decline but made it up w inflows. Still at $99b. So close yet so far. Just passed $VIG (an etf legend) to take the 19th spot in overall aum. pic.twitter.com/w5Lto2OaTP According to Onur, a Near Protocol ambassador and popular user on X (Twitter), IBIT’s $245 million annual fees reflect the extraordinary pace of institutional adoption. It now outpaces every other BlackRock ETF, some over a decade old. With $1.8 billion inflows last week alone and a path to $100 billion faster than any fund in history, IBIT shows how deep institutional adoption runs when Bitcoin rallies. This milestone is not happening in isolation, coming as part of a larger shift in how capital moves through crypto markets. Analysts increasingly argue that net inflows now matter more than fundamentals or narratives. “The only thing that matters in crypto right now is flows…net inflows (buy pressure) are infinitely more important than…fundamentals or narrative,” said analyst Miles Deutscher. That observation aligns with IBIT’s dominance in ETF flows. Over the past week alone, IBIT accounted for $3.5 billion in inflows, roughly 10% of all ETF flows across the US market. Even long-time laggards like GBTC saw inflows, a signal, Balchunas noted, that “the fish are hungry.” Behind these flows sits a staggering accumulation of Bitcoin. As of this week, BlackRock controls more than 802,000 BTC, following a fresh purchase of 3,450 coins. 🚨Blackrock Buys 3450 BitcoinNow Holds 802,200 BTC1M Bitcoin Soon. pic.twitter.com/NBEjRTrd12 At the current trajectory, the asset manager could soon hit 1 million BTC holdings, a figure representing a seismic shift in Bitcoin ownership concentration. A recent US Crypto News publication highlighted that the asset manager is nearing Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin stash. However, it is worth noting that other factors significantly affect BlackRock’s prospective $100 billion milestone. For perspective, Balchunas first anticipated BlackRock’s IBIT reaching $100 billion in July, which was over three months ago. “I wrote last week that IBIT could hit $100 billion this summer, but hell, it could be this month. Thanks to recent flows + overnight rally, it’s already at $88 billion,” Balchunas wrote at the time. Factors such as fluctuating flows and Bitcoin price volatility have been at play, derailing the landmark target. Notwithstanding, this fast-paced accumulation is intensifying questions about who ultimately controls Bitcoin’s future. While ETFs are expanding access, they are also centralizing custody and decision-making power in the hands of financial giants. Based on this, some critics see BlackRock’s ambitions extending beyond Bitcoin. Investigative journalist Whitney Webb warns that Larry Fink’s vision involves tokenizing and financializing natural assets on a “universal ledger” that would allow unprecedented tracking and control. “BlackRock being able to unlock and take control of as many natural assets as possible… is obviously a way for them to expand their control not just over people and the existing financial system, but really over the natural world as well,” Webb said in a recent interview. The convergence of Bitcoin ETF dominance and broader asset tokenization plans suggests a new financial infrastructure where Bitcoin could serve as both a liquidity magnet and a building block in a far more centralized global ledger.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Rockets Past 800,000 BTC Milestone In Record-Breaking Run

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now holds a staggering 800,000 Bitcoin (BTC), according to Glassnode data, and has accumulated $98 billion in assets under management in less than two years since its debut in January 2024. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, now holds 802,200 BTC in its IBIT ETF, according to Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer. The fund had amassed 798,747 BTC as of Oct. 7, per BlackRock’s own iShares website. IBIT’s purchase of 3,510 BTC (worth $426.2 million) yesterday was enough to push its total holdings above the 800K milestone. The market-leading ETF now holds roughly 3.804% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. IBIT accounts for over 55% of the total BTC held in US spot Bitcoin ETFs, data from Bitbo shows. Additionally, the BlackRock ETF holds more than Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, which boasts a 640,031 BTC stockpile (valued at roughly $78 billion). The recent Bitcoin milestone comes amid reports that IBIT has become BlackRock’s most profitable ETF, surpassing the revenue of its flagship S&P 500 fund, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, which debuted in 2000. Meanwhile, IBIT has led the charge in weekly inflows among all U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, as pointed out by Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. “IBIT is #1 in weekly flows among all ETFs with $3.5 billion, which is 10% of all net flows into ETFs,” Balchunas wrote in a Wednesday X post. “Also notable is the rest of the 11 OG spot BTC ETFs all took in cash in the past week, even GBTC, somehow; that’s how hungry the fish are. Two steps forward mode. Enjoy while it lasts.” On Monday, the dozen BTC ETFs pulled in their biggest daily inflow since crypto-friendly President Donald Trump secured the presidency against Kamala Harris as institutional appetite for crypto exposure continues to build. These funds have now posted cumulative net inflows of $63 billion since their launch, with IBIT taking in $65 billion, offset by net outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).

Title: Bitwise ‘Not Playing Around,’ Proposes Low Fee For Its Solana Staking ETF As Official Launch Nears
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bitwise-not-playing-around-proposes-low-fee-for-its-solana-staking-etf-as-official-launch-nears/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T14:18:03Z
Full Content:
Crypto fund manager Bitwise designated a 0.20% fee for its Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund, which has a staking component, as asset managers inch closer to securing a green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for their crypto-based ETFs. In a Wednesday amendment to its registration statement, Bitwise formally renames its fund to the “Bitwise Solana Staking ETF,” while including language that enables it to “seek to provide exposure to the value of Solana held by the Trust.” By adding staking, the funds would earn small rewards from helping secure blockchains like Solana or Ethereum. Those rewards flow back into the ETF, providing investors with an opportunity to earn additional income from the same assets, rather than relying solely on price gains. The firm also stated that it would charge a 0.20% unitary management fee, a single charge that covers all fund operating costs, waived for the first three months on the first $1 billion in assets. According to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, this incredibly low fee could be a sign of how competitive the investment vehicle could get among ETF issuers. “Bitwise not playing around, plans to charge just 0.20% for their spot Solana ETF,” Balchunas postulated. “Thought we’d see higher first, need war to get this low.” At that rate, the proposed fee undercuts most competing crypto ETFs, which often fall between 0.15% and 0.25%, and matches the lowest levels seen among greenlighted crypto products. “Low fees have near perfect record of attracting investors so good sign for inflow potential,” Balchunas explained. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF (SSK), the US’s first Solana staking ETF, ended its first day of trading with $12 million in inflows. The annual management fee for the SSK stands at 0.75%. According to Balchunas, Bitwise’s proposed offering is cheaper, has better tracking, and is 100% physically backed by Solana’s spot assets. “SSK is riddled with tracking issues like a futures ETF. It trails spot Solana by 12% — although it got better in the past month,” he opined. Despite leading the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has yet to submit paperwork with the SEC for an SOL ETF. In August, Bloomberg’s ETF analyst James Seyffart suggested that it would be “messed up” if BlackRock were to file a last-minute application to debut its own SOL product simultaneously with other bidders, after those firms had already spent so much time working with the U.S. regulator to get the paperwork right. Nonetheless, analysts have predicted that several applications for Solana ETFs with staking could win the SEC’s regulatory blessing in the course of this month.

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 10/10 update below. This post was originally published on October 09 Bitcoin has surged into October, with traders strapping in for a market “frenzy” in coming months. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has hit a fresh all-time high over $126,000 per bitcoin, giving it a market capitalization of around $2.5 trillion amid fears of a Federal Reserve-fueled U.S. dollar crisis. Now, as U.S. president Donald Trump floats the idea of a $2,000 Covid stimulus check-style tariff dividend, BlackRock’s market-leading spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is on the verge of crossing $100 billion in assets under management—on track to hit the milestone far faster than any other ETF in history. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock’s IBIT, which launched in January 2024 to huge fanfare, has surged thanks to massive inflows over the last few months and the increase in the value of the bitcoin price itself. The fund now has assets of $98.6 billion and could cross the psychological line in a matter of days. 10/10 update: The bitcoin price has dipped as the crypto market rally comes off the boil, even as the Federal Reserve looks all but certain to cut interest rates again later this month. “Bitcoin volatility is poised for a breakout. Implied volatilities across 14, 30, and 90-day expiries have surged to their highest levels in the past 30 days, pointing to increased anticipation of big moves ahead," Sean Dawson, head of research at leading onchain options platform Derive.xyz, said in emailed comments. “This spike comes as markets price in a near-certain 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month, with Polymarket odds currently sitting at 90%. Following a 3% dip from $123,000 to $120,000, bitcoin has recovered to $121,600. According to Coinglass data, a dense band of short positions is at risk of liquidation just above this level. A modest push upward could trigger a cascade of liquidations and propel BTC back toward $125,000 and beyond." Bitcoin and crypto traders remain bullish despite the latest bitcoin pull back, with analysts pointing to a mismatch between current price action and the underlying market. “Bitcoin is up 7% in October, perfectly matching its seasonal pattern — but this time, the rally feels different,” 10x Research analysts led by chief executive Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note. “Despite trading near all-time highs, momentum is fading, and what once looked like a clean breakout now sits in no-man’s-land. Beneath the surface, the story unfolds differently: institutional whales are buying aggressively, while early adopters quietly sell into strength.” Bitcoin ETFs could add another $20 billion worth of inflows before the end of the year, according to some market watchers, with the lion's share of that likely to go to BlackRock's bitcoin fund. “Following the recent rally over the first weekend of ‘Uptober’, which saw bitcoin’s price surge to a new all-time high above $125,000, record-level ETF inflows totalled above $3 billion across the first week of the month,” Dom Harz, cofounder of bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) platform BOB, said in emailed comments. BlackRock’s IBIT is on track to hit the $100 billion milestone about five times faster than any other ETF in history, according to a report from Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, with it also “by far the youngest” of the 20 largest ETFs. BlackRock's flagship S&P 500 ETF took 25 years to reach its current revenue levels, while IBIT has achieved higher profitability in less than two years. The fund, charging a 0.25% fee, is thought to bring in annual revenue of $240 million for BlackRock, becoming the most profitable BlackRock ETF when it surpassed BlackRock’s IWF and EFA funds in July. “The fact that IBIT is now BlackRock’s most profitable product is extremely impressive," Seyffart, who added that BlackRock’s bitcoin fund—and rival crypto-tied ETFs—faced a lot of criticism ahead of their launches last year, told Bloomberg. “We were very bullish on the amount of demand and flows that we thought would come into the bitcoin ETFs, but even these numbers have blown away our most bullish expectations.” The BlackRock bitcoin fund has become the de facto route for traditional finance to gain bitcoin exposure, with the surging popularity of the "debasement trade" this year catapulting bitcoin higher along with gold. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market “While it’s very possible that gold will continue to outperform other assets for the foreseeable future, it has certainly become a crowded trade,” Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. "That means there is more risk involved in initiating exposure at this point. After more than a 50% rally in the gold price year-to-date, attention may now turn to other alternatives that express a similar view. These include other metals and commodities, tokenized real assets, and bitcoin, which remain undervalued against gold. These alternative assets can all play a similar role in portfolios—a hedge against future inflation and political intervention, and an alternative to the U.S. dollar and other debasing currencies.” Crypto ETFs more widely drew record inflows of almost $6 billion globally last week, according to data from CoinShares. "This level of investment highlights the growing recognition of digital assets as an alternative in times of uncertainty," James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, wrote in the weekly report.

Title: How Asset Managers Can Eliminate Child And Forced Labor From Their Portfolios

ByBhakti Mirchandani, Contributor. Child labor is a large and growing problem in the United States. With child labor violations in the US up 79% year-over-year following an 140% increase over the past decade, detecting and mitigating child labor violations is material for all investors. This is the second article in a series on child and forced labor due diligence and monitoring. The series draws from guides for asset owners and asset managers that Kathy Hahn and Juho Rana Kim from Casey Family Programs, Jerome McCluskey of Latham & Watkins, and I co-authored following consultations with and/or contributions from over 100 experts, ranging from Save the Children to Neuberger Berman and from UNICEF USA and its Impact Fund for Children to BlackRock. This one-page child and forced labor due diligence guide for asset managers consists of six due diligence questions for asset managers to use when underwriting portfolio companies. If the answers to all of the questions immediately below are no, the process is complete. If the answer to any of the questions below is yes, asset managers would proceed with the longer questionnaire that follows further below. Alternatively, questions may be adapted and put to management or the compliance team of a target on a legal due diligence call. This guide is designed to be intuitive enough for any team member to use and brief enough for investment team members to hang in their cubicles as a reference to use while underwriting and monitoring portfolio companies. The following tables present a four-page child and forced labor due diligence questionnaire for asset managers to use with higher risk portfolio companies. If answers to any of the questions in the Standard Questionnaire immediately below are unclear or suggest a higher level of risk, parts or all of the Detailed Questionnaire should be applied based on the responses to the Standard Questions. As Human Rights Watch Senior Researcher Jim Wormington notes, optimal use of the Detailed Questionnaire would require in-house sector expertise, external partners, or both, and asset managers should consider resource requirements. Asset managers would naturally vary the number of questions from the Detailed Questionnaire that they ask based on position size, whether the position is a controlling interest, potential risks involved, and what change they are trying to drive in their portfolio and/or across the industry. Where the answer to any of the above questions is unclear or suggests a higher level of risk, please use parts or all of the below Detailed Questionnaire based on the responses to the Standard Questionnaire. The next article and final in this series presents a longer list of due diligence questions for asset owners to use if answers to any of the three Heightened Risk Scenario questions from the first article in this series is unclear or suggests a higher level of risk. Note: Special thanks to the organizations with team members who generously took the time to contribute to this work, listed here. The views of this series of articles should not be construed as reflecting the views of these organizations.

Title: What Will It Take to Actually Get Alts in More Portfolios?

The key to greater acceptance may be using them in more traditional products, like mutual funds and ETFs. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com It’s the first rule of finance: Don’t invest in what you don’t understand. While access to alternative assets is expected to broaden under the Trump administration’s Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Paul Atkins, mass affluent clients, and even advisors, aren’t overly familiar with the investments, including venture capital, infrastructure or real estate deals. The key to greater alt acceptance may lie in introducing them through more traditional products, like certain kinds of mutual funds and ETFs. “If you’re going to introduce a new asset class to the market, people will need time to become comfortable,” said Eric Pan, CEO of the Investment Company Institute. “I’m not advocating for direct sales of private assets to retail, but using [40 Act] funds.” One way to introduce alts to retail investors or mass affluent clients is through target-date funds, Pan told Advisor Upside at a Financial Times conference in New York City this week. Such funds automatically adjust asset allocations over time and are already popular in 401(k)s. While alternatives often carry higher costs and potential risk, the biggest hurdle for retail investors is illiquidity, Pan said. “If it’s a piece of infrastructure, it may take you 20 years to build a bridge,” he said. “If it’s real estate, you can’t sell that overnight.” He suggested closed-end funds, which are less liquid by design, as another solution. Some firms are already using these vehicles to reach retail investors: Another big piece of the equation is transparency. If firms want to attract more clients to alternatives, private market products are going to have to become more transparent. “That’s a requirement to unlock everything else,” BlackRock COO Rob Goldstein said during a panel discussion at the conference. “The more transparency you provide on private markets, I actually think you’ll see an increase in allocation of capital to the private market.” Not So Fast. Some industry leaders remain skeptical, though. While PIMCO has launched private credit funds geared toward wealthy retail investors, company CEO Emmanuel Roman said the firm is “paranoid” about illiquidity risks, and that investors need to be compensated for locking up their investments long term. “You really have a burden of proof in terms of having a product, which delivers double-digit returns and offers what it says on the box in terms of liquidity,” he said during the conference. “It’s hard to make liquidity out of nowhere.” Advisors and clients haven’t been chasing returns, though, instead smartly choosing to stay diversified. Tax-law and human behavior are complicated, but there’s a method to mitigating past investment mistakes. In the long-running bull market, it’s not hard to make a case against risk-parity funds. But it’s harder to make one against Ray Dalio and his massive hedge-fund firm Bridgewater Associates. The opportunities to invest are expanding, but due diligence is key. Advisors are taking a variety of approaches in fixed income, stocks and alternatives. Allocations today have a striking resemblance to where they stood in 2023, according to new Goldman Sachs data. Investing $1 billion in T. Rowe may be more efficient for Goldman than building out its own channel. Mixing politics and investing is like mixing emotions and math: It rarely adds up. They’re going to have to adapt to not only younger clients’ approach to finances, but also their communication styles and social preferences. Rules-based investments are appealing, but even index-fund investing comes with limitations. With assets reaching new heights, advisors need to inform clients about what exchange-traded funds can — and can’t — do. The hype for expanded access to alternatives is real, but are they in the best interests of clients who may not understand how they work? © 2025 The Daily Upside

Time Published: 2025-10-09T09:56:00Z

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. Tesla is weeks away from a monumental shareholder vote on CEO Elon Musk’s potential $1 trillion pay package at its annual investor meeting, and the EV maker is pulling out all the stops to push the measure through. Last year, Tesla rallied thousands of mom-and-pop retail investors to vote their shares of stock in favor of Musk’s billions in pay. Now, Tesla is teeing up retail holders for another vote on Nov. 6 that would set Musk on the path to becoming the world’s first trillionaire by granting him up to 12% of Tesla’s outstanding shares divided into 12 tranches through a restricted stock grant. The first tranche starts at $2 trillion, and the final tranche is $8.5 trillion. If he hits all the goals in the plan, he’ll have brought Tesla to a market cap of $8.5 trillion, and his stake would be worth more than $1 trillion. Much of the playbook for 2025 is similar to 2024: a slick investor website, a bevy of posts, and engagement on X about how investors can vote shares on specific brokerage platforms, and even a special video with Optimus humanoid robots explaining voting in between taking a sauna and overseeing platters of bagels and cream cheese. Tesla’s Annual Meeting is coming up on November 6 & we need your vote!Voting is quick and easy – you can vote online, by mail, by QR code or by phone@Tesla_Optimus can show you how pic.twitter.com/OM5UwtkJWx— Tesla (@Tesla) October 6, 2025 Tesla is clearly dedicating resources to communicating with its individual retail investors and informing them about how to vote, independent activist investor Michael Levin told Fortune, a feat that is difficult to accomplish in the U.S. Given how Tesla pulled it off last year, this year’s vote to approve Musk’s new award isn’t nearly as in doubt as it was in 2024, he said. Plus, Tesla has the same playbook to work from this year. “The result of 2024 gives a very strong clue about how 2025 will work out—and that passed with 72% of voters supporting it, and that’s pretty comfortable,” Levin said. “This year, it’s sort of a version of the same thing: A comp plan going forward with these insane, ambitious goals, and people are fine with that and don’t mind him being a trillionaire.” Thousands of retail investors and Tesla loyalists have pledged their support in favor of Tesla and Musk’s stratospheric new pay plan, but a growing coalition of pension funds and Democratic state fiduciaries are speaking out about what they see as red flags: a comp package that is too large, a lack of independence on the board, and the potential for other founders and controlling CEOs to follow in Musk’s footsteps. The latter would be disastrous for an economy that is already tilted too favorably in the direction of billionaires like Musk while employees writ large are battling inflation and lackluster pay raises, sources said. “It’s not only the magnitude, it’s the way in which the pay package is sort of a ransom aimed at shareholders,” New York City Comptroller Brad Lander told Fortune. “It’s a megalomaniacal trip of bizarre proportions that is all about Elon’s ego and not about the financial health of the company or its stakeholders and shareholders.” Lander, who signed a letter with other investors urging shareholders to vote against Musk’s pay plan and to oppose the reelection of three Tesla board members, oversees more than $1 billion invested in Tesla on behalf of New York City’s pension funds. Similarly, New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, who oversees about $1.4 billion invested in Tesla on behalf of the state’s pension funds, called Musk’s pay “excessive,” and said it “waters down the holdings of other shareholders, and gives a captive board unwarranted discretion.” DiNapoli said he plans in coming weeks to lobby other investors to vote against the plan and all directors with reelection bids on the board. The vote will be a pivotal moment—not just for Tesla, but for all those who oversee invested assets on behalf of shareholders and retirees, New Mexico State Treasurer Laura Montoya told Fortune. “If we don’t hold them accountable you’re going to have so many others who are going to try and follow suit,” Montoya said. “This is a precedent that could be damaging to our economy, not just today and tomorrow but in our children’s future.” The Tesla meeting agenda includes investor votes on 14 proposals, but the two that are keenly relevant to Musk’s compensation include a proposal to approve his 2025 CEO performance award, and a second proposal that would include the creation of a special reserve of 208 million equity shares for Musk. The vote authorizing more shares will also replenish the equity pool of 60 million shares available for employees and directors that companies typically use to compensate executives. “All the action is in those two proposals,” said Levin, who holds a small investment in Tesla and plans to oppose the pay proposals. The pay plan up for a vote this year comes after a Delaware judge rescinded Musk’s previous moonshot award in January 2024, a decision that prompted Tesla to hold an investor vote to ratify his pay package a second time in 2024 and to authorize a move from being incorporated in the state of Delaware to Texas. The 2024 ratification vote and the move to Texas were enormous victories for the EV maker, even though the same Delaware judge rescinded Musk’s pay package a second time following the vote. Since then, the Tesla board has given Musk an interim award of 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at about $24 billion. Musk’s proposed 2025 award involves the CEO hitting both market capitalization and operational goals that could potentially see Tesla reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion if Musk successfully unlocks all 12 tranches. He’ll have to stick around at Tesla for a minimum of 7.5 years and up to 10 years for his shares to vest. The board claimed during negotiations that Musk “raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests” if he does not get paid for his past work at Tesla and receive at least a 25% voting interest in the company. The new award requires him to “participate in the board’s development of a framework for long-term CEO succession,” one of the provisions states. All told, Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire, and he would hold 28.8% of Tesla if he hits all the goals in the moonshot plan. He would also become the first and only CEO to hit a moonshot hat trick—three back-to-back pay packages. The Tesla board told investors the pay package is key to keeping Musk focused on Tesla and motivated to grow the company. “In light of the AI talent wars, Tesla’s internal efforts to develop and expand its product offerings within the AI industry, the absence of a comprehensive plan to address the compensation that remains outstanding for Musk’s past performance, and the lack of any go-forward incentive to motivate Musk to keep his focus aimed at Tesla long enough to achieve meaningful results that will transform Tesla over the long term, we believe there is a pressing need to retain and incentivize Musk immediately,” the board told investors last month. In their criticisms, pension funds and Democratic state fiduciaries are taking aim not only at the size of Musk’s potential pay package but the Tesla board, chaired by Robyn Denholm. Pension leaders have said Denholm and the board are letting investors down by failing to properly oversee and challenge Musk when needed and ensure that he stays focused on Tesla. “In our view, the board’s failure to limit Mr. Musk’s outside endeavors while rewarding him with unprecedented pay packages for only a part-time commitment strongly indicates a lack of true independence by management and jeopardizes long-term shareholder value,” states a letter from SOC Investment Group, signed by a dozen fiduciaries and investors. “The board has permitted Mr. Musk to be overcommitted for years, allowing him to continue as CEO while taking time-consuming leadership roles at his other companies, xAI/X, SpaceX, Neuralink, and Boring Company.” The letter noted that the level of compensation paid to the Tesla board members could also compromise the board’s impartiality. Average comp paid to S&P 500 board members in 2024 was $327,096, the letter states. Denholm’s average compensation per year has been $62 million. Denholm has repeatedly denied that her objectivity has been clouded by the wealth she’s made selling Tesla stock over the years. Still, some investors are planning to send a message to the board by voting against the three directors up for reelection this year: Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson. Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman told Fortune her concerns about Tesla as a fiduciary were based on the board’s governing track record and the lack of accountability by directors overseeing Musk in his role as CEO. “This is one of those circumstances where somebody has to say, ‘Enough is enough,’” said Lierman. Despite the organizing by pension funds, the battle to sway the vote is an uphill climb, although that is no reason not to speak out, noted Lierman. Tesla appears positioned to win approval of Musk’s new moonshot pay plan based on Musk’s ownership, the voting history of large institutional investors, and the company’s track record with individual holders. According to the proxy statement, owned by Musk—and his brother and board colleague Kimbal Musk—can be voted for the two key comp proposals. Meaning there is no majority-of-minority requirement, a corporate governance mechanism where a transaction or proposal has to be approved by a majority of shareholders who are not involved in the transaction. Currently, Musk holds about 20% of the company, and Kimbal Musk holds about 1.5 million shares, less than 1% of Tesla’s outstanding stock. In addition, large institutional investors BlackRock and Vanguard hold close to 13% of Tesla between them, and both voted in favor of Musk’s pay ratification in 2024. According to FactSet, retail shareholders equate to approximately 34% of outstanding shares. Last year’s ratification vote saw 72% of all votes cast in approval of his pay, which excluded shares connected to Musk and his brother. Given the level of insider control plus Tesla’s command over its retail base, proxy advisory firms like ISS and Glass Lewis aren’t going to be a determinant even if they recommend investors oppose the pay proposals, said Levin. Similarly, BlackRock and Vanguard don’t disclose their votes in advance, but they may not be much of an issue even if they suddenly reverse course on Musk’s pay this year versus last year. Still, Musk is unlikely to leave anything to chance, said Levin, given his ownership stake in Tesla. And if Musk left Tesla it would be terrible for investors; the stock would likely immediately plummet. “Maybe it’s a risk this board doesn’t want to take,” said Levin. “But I think the cost of avoiding that risk is way too high—it’s a trillion dollars of equity.” Tesla’s shareholder meeting is slated to take place on Nov. 6 at its headquarters in Austin. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Crypto-Focused AMINA Bank of Switzerland Offers Regulated Staking of Polygon Token
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/10/09/crypto-focused-amina-bank-of-switzerland-offers-regulated-staking-of-polygon-token
Time Published: 2025-10-09T07:19:35Z

Swiss-regulated crypto bank AMINA has become the first bank worldwide to offer institutional clients regulated staking access to POL, the native token that powers the Polygon blockchain. The launch allows qualified participants, including asset managers and corporate treasuries, to earn staking rewards while supporting network security in compliance with financial regulations. As part of this collaboration, AMINA clients can receive up to 15% in staking rewards. This rate combines AMINA’s base yield with an additional incentive from the foundation. The move expands the bank’s existing POL custody and trading services, giving institutions a compliant path to participate in blockchain infrastructure relied on by firms like BlackRock, JPMorgan and Franklin Templeton for their tokenization efforts. Myles Harrison, AMINA’s chief product officer, said the service bridges traditional finance with “the networks that matter.” AMINA Bank (previously known as SEBA Bank) holds a license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”), and also has nods to offer crypto services from regulators in Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong. Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron called the development a sign that institutions “aren’t just buying tokens anymore — they want to participate.” Polygon, an Ethereum overlay blockchain which processes transactions for less than a cent and settles them in under five seconds, has become one of the main networks for on-chain finance. It now hosts over $1 billion in tokenized real-world assets and nearly $3 billion in stablecoin value. The POL token had a market cap of $2.5 billion at press time.

Title: Finn McRedmond: Forget VAT. Delivery apps are killing our restaurants
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2025/10/09/finn-mcredmond-the-more-takeaways-we-order-the-more-miserable-we-become/

Call the social scientists. I propose a new method for tracking the social health of society and it’s called The Takeaway Index. It suggests that the moral status of the nation is tightly correlated with the amount of time we spend ordering food via apps on our smartphones. I think it stands up against accepted scientific methods. This is, conveniently, rather good news for me. I have ordered just one takeaway in 2025. It was Monday, June 30th. I had returned from Glastonbury after a seven-hour trip home, husk-like, to an empty fridge. I scrolled through Uber Eats and ordered chicken, broccoli and some pickled cabbage, in repentance for the hedonism of recent days. I felt immediate guilt, not because it was going to be disgusting, but because I know delivery apps are wreaking havoc on the restaurant industry. Forgive the moralising (it’s just dinner), but your beloved local trattoria’s life depends on it. In the first quarter of 2025, 150 restaurants in Ireland closed. Six-hundred restaurants, cafes and hospitality businesses closed in the 12 months from September, 2023. This is a crisis and if the impersonal data doesn’t do it for you, then look to your main street. Near to where I grew up, Gareth Smith’s restaurant, Big Mike’s (in Blackrock, Co Dublin), has been forced to shutter. The economics of the industry are “insurmountable”, he explained. Allow me to acknowledge the cost-of-living crisis and all the hardship it places on the consumer. Regular dinner out is an extravagance beyond many. A fish pie for €20 is not trivial pocket change. With that out of the way, now turn your eyes to this staggering figure reported by RTÉ this summer: we spend €2.2 billion a year on takeaways. Restaurants are caught in a nasty doom loop. They were once reliant on the likes of Uber Eats or Deliveroo to survive, but those are now among the factors making brick-and-mortar restaurants less viable. There are other things at play of course, but this part of the story is too often overlooked. During the pandemic, restaurants relied on these delivery apps to reach their customers. It was a vicious cycle; customers became too used to takeaways and restaurants grew too reliant on takeaway apps. Now, in 2025, not enough people are eating out. Or, as UCC professor Ronan Carbery puts it in a piece for RTÉ, “delivery platforms transformed from pandemic lifelines into structural threats”. The Government is listening. Tuesday’s budget announced VAT on “food businesses” will reduce from 13.5 per cent to 9 per cent from next summer. This might dig hospitality out of the grave, but only if those in search of dinner are willing to give up their Uber Eats account too. “It’s actually much more complicated than that.” These are the words I hear from the more annoying among you. Isn’t single-cause history out of fashion? All well and good, but this is not about the multifaceted source of hospitality’s malaise. Rising wages, cost of produce, hostile rental markets – these are all problems too. But what we are witnessing beyond the economic analysis is a much more troubling directional trend. And we have always been able to learn a lot about the world by looking at how it decides to eat. Last I heard, society is more atomised than ever – polarised, miserable, with nasty populists in the wings and surrounded by a truculent electorate. The isolating power of the smartphone turns out to be even greater than we ever imagined – as young people in particular while away their hours, and thus their lives, scrolling through endless amounts of slop. This radicalises some and makes loners out of others. Meanwhile, everyone wants to sit inside and order a pizza to their front door from an app. Breaking bread might be the most ancient practice, slowly being lost to the lure of the smartphone. Ordering food off an app is a symptom of this bigger sickness. Just like the decline in shared community activities like sports teams and bridge clubs, the retreat inside to eat dinner on the sofa is part of this social atomisation. But it is a cause of the isolating spiral too. As fewer people want to be – or can afford to be – in shared places like restaurants, is it any wonder that everyone has forgotten what is nice about it in the first place? This is a self-sustaining crash-out. I’ve glanced into the future and it is a grim place where the dimly-lit wine bar serving pan-European small plates is closed. Also closed are the robust kitchens serving trad-hibernian fare, the seafood bars on Dublin’s south coast and West Cork’s shores. We have ceded our appetites to middlemen at Silicon Valley mega-corps. We demand lunch in a box handed to us by a low-wage gig-economy worker. All the while the local restaurant was just around the corner, begging for your custom. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Elm Park offices present opportunity for offices and healthcare investors
URL: https://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/elm-park-offices-present-opportunity-for-offices-and-healthcare-investors/a1420248835.html

Block A at Elm Park With office deals increasing in both the lettings and sales markets, the launch of Block A at Elm Park, Dublin 4, along with the adjoining annex, presents an interesting opportunity for investors and owner occupiers. It also reflects how keen pricing has become for Dublin offices. Agent TWM is guiding in the region of €18.5m for the entire block which is equivalent to €1,744 per square metre – whereas to develop the same block at current prices could cost more than double that, at €4,198 per square metre. Block A is a modern seven-storey office building extending to about 72,000sqft with an adjoining smaller building known as the annex, extending to about 10,000sqft. The sale includes 76 secure basement car spaces. Currently the lot generates annual rent of €1.32m and there is potential to increase that by letting out two vacant floors extending to 29,000sqft which can be accessed via individual entrances. Strategic risk management firms Willis Towers Watson has a lease on four floors accounting for 60pc of the building and they are paying about €1.2m in rent. Recent figures for the Dublin office market saw increased activity when 822,000sqft of office space was leased across 61 deals during the three months to the end of September. That was the highest number of transactions in a quarter since the third quarter of 2018. Recovery in office demand was also reflected in the investment market, where offices accounted for 35pc of deal volume, across 12 deals. Michele Jackson of TWM also says Elm Park could also appeal to purchasers and occupiers in the healthcare sector, partly because its basement is built to double height level, which is designed to accommodate ambulances. “The 2024 strategic acquisition by the HSE of its Elm Park Green portfolio for approximately €50m is understood to have triggered a broader interest in this location from investors seeking a value add/alternative use play as well as from the immediate healthcare sector.” The HSE acquisition comprised 275,000sqft of accommodation across two buildings which included the vacant Seamark building, extending to approximately 180,000sqft. The acquisition will support cost-effective and expedient delivery of healthcare accommodation in line with the most recent Programme for Government. Elm Park is a prime Dublin 4 location adjacent to St Vincent’s public and private hospitals and 2kms from Blackrock Health. The development has generous secure basement parking and easy access to bus and Dart public transport. Ms Jackson says that “The location is likely to appeal to both investors and owner occupiers looking to buy into sectors poised for growth.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Commentary: Is Hong Kong’s comeback for the world or for China?

Commentary As China prepares for a key meeting to discuss its next five-year plan, repositioning Hong Kong must take focus, says former SCMP editor-in-chief Wang Xiangwei. File photo of people crossing a street during busy evening traffic in Central Hong Kong. (Photo: AFP/Mladen Antonov) This audio is generated by an AI tool. HONG KONG: Just a few years ago, many outsiders had written Hong Kong off. The violent protests of 2019, followed by the imposition of a national security law in 2020 and strict COVID-19 restrictions, triggered a mass exodus of local and foreign talent and capital. Professionals and firms fled to safer havens like Singapore, while others sought refuge in New York and London, leaving the city economically battered and demographically hollowed out. Yet, in a striking turnaround, Hong Kong is staging a robust comeback - albeit one fraught with inconsistencies. The city's stock markets have surged back to prominence, fuelled by Beijing's economic stimulus measures unveiled in September 2024. In the first half of 2025 alone, the city raised HK$107.1 billion (US$13.7 billion) through initial public offerings (IPOs) - seven times the amount from the same period in 2024. PwC forecasts that 2025 will mark Hong Kong's most active IPO market in four years, with fundraising expected to claim the global number one spot. Much of this momentum is being driven by mainland Chinese firms, which account for around 60 per cent of the over 2,600 companies listed in Hong Kong, as well as more than 80 per cent of total market capitalisation. Government incentives have also drawn hundreds of thousands of Chinese talents from the mainland and overseas. The latest vindication came last month when Hong Kong supplanted Singapore as Asia's premier destination for attracting talent and rocketed to fourth place worldwide in the IMD World Talent Ranking - its highest-ever position. This resurgence, however, feels lopsided on the ground. The streets are bustling, and the vibrancy is unmistakable. Tourism footfall is up, especially from mainland China, which accounted for nearly 80 per cent of Hong Kong’s visitor arrivals between January and August. But boarded-up storefronts tell another story. High rents and competition from cheaper cross-border alternatives have hit parts of the retail and restaurant segments hard, even as other sectors, for example jewellery and watches typically favoured by tourists - thrive. Beneath this uneven recovery looms a larger, strategic question: Is Hong Kong rebounding to reclaim its cherished mantle as Asia's World City - a cosmopolitan powerhouse akin to New York or London - or is it morphing into China's World City, a specialised outpost serving the mainland's ambitions? The answer will dictate everything from investment flows and urban planning to cultural identity and global relevance. Since 2001, Hong Kong has leaned heavily into its "Asia's World City" branding, spotlighting its prowess in financial services, trade, tourism, transport and communications. This narrative positioned the city as a vibrant, rule-of-law bastion bridging East and West. But the past five years have upended that vision, amid escalating US-China tensions. Perceptions have shifted dramatically; serious doubts now swirl about whether Hong Kong is devolving into "just another Chinese city". This unease stems partly from the territory's political elite, who have increasingly embraced mainland-style rhetoric and governance practices. Over the last two years, Beijing has exhorted the city to prioritise economic growth, leveraging its unique perch as a capitalist enclave under the "one country, two systems" framework. Yet Hong Kong grapples with striking a delicate equilibrium between security and development, and between deeper integration into the mainland economy and its role as a regional hub for international business. Recent flashpoints underscore the tension. In March 2025, state-backed media unleashed blistering criticism against tycoon Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings for its plan to sell strategic Panama Canal ports to a consortium led by US financial behemoth BlackRock, branding the move a "betrayal" and "spineless capitulation". Similarly, early this month, Beijing's top diplomat in Hong Kong warned the newly arrived US Consul General Julie Eadeh against "colluding with anti-China forces", after she met with local civil society figures. Contrary to fears that Hong Kong would be collateral damage in the US-China showdown, its liminal "in-between" status is proving a surprising asset. The mainland stimulus not only juiced stocks but also amplified Hong Kong's appeal as a conduit for global capital into China. Looking ahead, the city stands to gain from cross-border talent flows. In the US, President Donald Trump's aggressive crackdown on elite universities like Harvard and restrictions on foreign scholars have unnerved Chinese students and scientists, many of whom view Hong Kong as a lifeline. Its capitalist ethos, English common law, and open access to Western platforms like Google and Facebook, which are banned on the mainland, make it an alluring alternative. Beijing's blessings have supercharged this trend. Hong Kong's talent admission schemes, offering low taxes and top-tier international schools, have magnetised mainland professionals eager for global exposure while securing better futures for their children. Since 2022, these programmes have fielded nearly 500,000 applications, approving over 330,000 and welcoming more than 230,000 arrivals. The government's back-patting as an "international talent hub" rings somewhat hollow though, as the vast majority hail from the mainland, raising eyebrows about diversity and true global pull. These newcomers will undoubtedly invigorate the economy, restoring the frenetic energy of old. But they also fuel anxieties over whether Hong Kong can preserve its status as an international business nexus amid ballooning geopolitical friction. Officials have pivoted toward forging economic ties with Middle Eastern powerhouses and Belt and Road Initiative partners, with Dubai and Qatar emerging as favoured haunts. This shift isn't whimsical: US sanctions on senior figures, including Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, have hamstrung outreach to traditional business partners like the US, UK, and Europe, forcing a reorientation. The result? Apprehensions that Hong Kong is settling for a diminished role - a regional player on par with Dubai - rather than reclaiming its perch as a global financial titan rivalling New York and London. As China's leaders convene imminently to chart the 2026-2030 Five-Year Plan against a backdrop of roiling geopolitics, repositioning Hong Kong must rise to the fore. It needs to make the city indispensable to China’s modernisation and equally indispensable to global capital seeking exposure to China and Asia. To deliver that dual indispensability, Hong Kong must navigate these currents with nuance - honouring Beijing's directives while safeguarding the openness that once defined it as Asia's unrivalled world city.

Title: Think tank founder faces scrutiny over China corporate ties despite decoupling advocacy

Republican strategist Katie Zacharia joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss President Donald Trump's negotiations with China on trade, tariffs and the framework for a TikTok sale. Oren Cass, founder of the Washington-based think tank American Compass, has built a reputation as one of the right’s most outspoken advocates for economic nationalism and "strategic decoupling" from Beijing. Yet recent details about the group’s corporate partnerships and staff affiliations raise questions about consistency between its rhetoric and its operations. In essays and media appearances, Cass has argued that the United States must take a tougher stance toward China and prioritize domestic manufacturing and independence from Chinese supply chains. In a 2023 Foreign Affairs essay, Cass and a colleague warned that the U.S. "must break from China or else become irrevocably corrupted by it," arguing that economic interdependence had already "weakened America’s industrial base and constrained its political will." MAJOR COLLEGES FACE HEAT OVER CHINESE SCHOLARSHIP TIES AS ESPIONAGE CONCERNS MOUNT Oren Cass has become (Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images) In the same essay, Cass and his co-author argued that China’s influence extended deep into U.S. research and policy institutions. "China has long targeted U.S. universities, think tanks and research institutes to extract economic gain and advance its own ideological agenda," they wrote, adding that such organizations "must accept processes and controls designed to ensure the integrity and security of their work." They went further, calling for legal restrictions. "U.S. law should be changed to prohibit these institutions from entering into any partnerships with China-based and affiliated entities. Any funding flowing from one nation's institutions to the other's must be stopped." Lawmakers from both parties have long raised concerns that the Chinese government exploits educational exchanges, research partnerships and business investments in the U.S. as cover for espionage activities. These warnings have intensified in recent years amid growing scrutiny of Beijing’s influence operations on U.S. soil. The national flags of the United States and China flutter at the Fairmont Peace Hotel on April 25, 2024 in Shanghai, China. (Photo by Wang Gang/VCG via Getty Images) On July 28, 2025, Cass joined a group of policymakers and national security experts in a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressing "deep concern" over the decision to resume exports of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China. The group warned that the Trump administration’s move "represents a strategic misstep that endangers the United States’ economic and military edge in artificial intelligence." He reiterated his stance during a conversation on Steve Bannon’s "War Room" podcast where he argued against lifting export restrictions on advanced computer chips bound for China. CHINA'S MALIGN INFLUENCE TOUCHES EVERY ASPECT OF US LIFE. WE ALL NEED TO HELP STOP THEM And yet, Cass’s uncompromising rhetoric on China appears at odds with the realities of operating a Washington think tank in a globalized economy.

Title: Spiritans to sell Tipperary farm to fund compensation for abuse survivors

The Spiritan order is to sell one of the biggest farms in Co Tipperary as part of its pledge to compensate victims of abuse. The 765-acre Rockwell Farm will be sold on the open market and is likely to fetch at least €20 million, according to industry sources. The land was used for an agricultural college until the 1980s and is now a dairy farm with up to 650 cows. By November of last year, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published in September 2024. The schools involved were Blackrock College, its feeder junior school Willow Park, Rockwell College, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College. In a statement, Spiritans provincial Fr Brendan Carr said the order had been upfront about not having the cash to compensate victims and would instead need to sell assets. He said the order had been “fully transparent about their financial position” from the beginning. “Progress is being made and Rockwell Farm will be the first of these properties to be sold, but this involves multiple legal, valuation and regulatory steps that simply take time to complete.” He added that as a registered charitable organisation, the Spiritans are subject to the oversight of the Charities Regulator and subject to audit. The order also felt a need “to respond clearly to the suggestion that the Spiritans are deliberately delaying or obstructing progress”. Last Friday, the order was accused of adding to the suffering of the survivors by missing the deadline given last June in announcing a redress scheme. The Spiritans had not provided any such update at the end of summer, the Restore Together group said, and had been seeking a meeting with the order ever since. Responding on Wednesday, Fr Carr said “a commitment was made” but “progress has not been as fast as anyone would wish”. [ Spiritans commit to redress scheme for school abuse survivors in attempt to ‘offer atonement’Opens in new window ] Fr Carr acknowledged “the immense urgency that victims and survivors feel. We feel it too.” He added: “We continue to meet regularly with survivors and to provide ongoing counselling and restorative meetings facilitated by the independent restorative justice team. These encounters are deeply important to us and they continue to shape how we respond and plan.” He appealed “for understanding as we continue to navigate these complex financial and legal steps”. Fr Carr said: “We will provide a further public update as soon as key transactions are concluded and timelines can be confirmed with confidence.” The value of Co Tipperary land was brought into focus during a recent legal action involving billionaire businessman John Magnier. Mr Magnier lost a case at the Commercial Court claiming a verbal agreement to buy the 751-acre Barne Estate amounted to a sale. He agreed a price of €15 million with the owner Richard Thomson-Moore in August 2023, but eventually lost out to New York-based businessman Maurice Regan who agreed to buy the estate for €22.5 million.

Title: How Has The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Fared Compared To Its Older Funds?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-fared/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T19:00:41Z

Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has highlighted how the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has performed in comparison to the world’s largest asset manager’s older funds. This comes as the fund approaches the $100 billion milestone, which will make it the fastest to reach this milestone. In an X post, Balchunas revealed that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which is approaching $100 billion, is now the most profitable fund for the asset manager by a “good amount.” The Bloomberg analyst also highlighted that this is a massive feat for the Bitcoin fund, considering its age in comparison to the other funds. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which was launched last year, is currently generating an annual revenue of $244.5 million for the world’s largest asset manager. This is well ahead of BlackRock’s Russell 1000 Growth ETF, which is 25 years old and generates an annual revenue of $219.3 million, placing it in second place. Notably, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is the only fund on the list that has a single-digit age. The other of BlackRock’s funds are 12 years and above. Eric Balchunas also noted that IBIT was approaching $100 billion in assets under management (AuM), which could make it the fastest to reach this milestone. The Bloomberg analyst revealed that the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF currently holds this record, although it achieved this feat in 2,011 days. Meanwhile, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which is just 437 days old, currently has $99.44 billion in assets under management, putting it on track to surpass this record by a considerable margin. This comes as the BlackRock BTC ETF continues to lead the pack, with massive daily net inflows. On October 6, these Bitcoin funds saw $1.19 billion in daily net inflows, with IBIT accounting $970 million of these flows. Meanwhile, they recorded a daily net inflow of $875.6 million yesterday, with IBIT accounting for $899.4 million of these flows. Eric Balchunas also revealed that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is now in the top 20 in ETF assets following the rapid increase in its AuM. Based on its current AuM, IBIT is 19th on the list of largest ETFs, just ahead of Vanguard’s VIG and the “legendary” Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. The Bloomberg analyst remarked that if the last 12 months are repeated, it may not take too long for the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF to break into the top 10. He noted that the fund took in $40 billion over the last 12 months and saw an 85% increase. He added that he will put the timeline at December 2026 if he has to give one. At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at around $121,500, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Jury told Quilligan subjected to a violent assault
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/courts/2025/1008/1537523-kieran-quilligan-case/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T16:30:14Z
Full Content:
Jennie O\u0027Sullivan The jury in the trial of two men accused of the murder of Kieran Quilligan has been told that the 47-year-old had been subjected to a violent assault with a hammer-like weapon. Mr Quilligan's skeletal remains were found in a one-tonne gravel bag on scrub land near Rostellan in east Cork on 29 January last year, five months after he was first reported missing. Niall Long, 33, formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon and 27-year-old Luke Taylor, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock in Cork city have both pleaded not guilty at the Central Criminal Court to murdering Mr Quilligan on dates unknown between 1 September 2023 and 29 January 2024, at an unknown location within the State in the district court of Cork city, contary to Common Law. On the opening day of the trial before Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford at the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork, Prosecution Counsel Donal O'Sullivan SC told the jury of two women and ten men in his opening address that while the prosecution is not in a position to say who landed the blows, the allegation is that this was a joint enterprise where two people embarked on an enterprise to commit a murder. He said the jury would see alot of CCTV footage of both of the accused and alot of the evidence is circumstantial as there were no eye witnesses. He told jurors that Mr Quilligan was a user of the Simon Community and lived in an apartment provided by them. "He was someone who took drugs and was dealing drugs at the time. Niall Long (one of the co-accused) is someone who was a drug user and may have been dealing drugs as well," Mr O'Sullivan said. Mr O'Sullivan said on the morning of 1 September, Mr Quilligan and another man John Paul Thornton (known as 'Bubbles') robbed and assaulted Mr Long on York Hill. "It appears this is the instigating factor of what occured later that evening," Mr O'Sullivan said. It will be the State's case that at around 8pm that evening, the co-accused Luke Taylor was seen with Kieran Quilligan on CCTV leaving his apartment on Anderson's Quay and heading up along the quays towards St Finbarr's Cathedral. Two people in a house on St Finbarr's Place later reported hearing a violent altercation at around 9pm. Prosecution Counsel Donal O'Sullivan said CCTV will allegedly show a white Toyota RAV4 car registered to Niall Long's mother driving along Dean Street at the top of St Finbarr's Place. It will be claimed that the CCTV footage will show it reversing so that the boot of the car is facing down the lane at 9.05pm. Gardaí conducted a trawl of CCTV footage across Cork city and county and the same car was tracked going to a location in Little Island and afterwards dropping Mr Taylor off at an address at Jacob's Island. Mr O'Sullivan says Mr Quilligan was never seen alive again. He was reported missing on 4 September and a garda investigtion began. He said the jury would also see CCTV footage taken on 4 September which shows Mr Taylor being picked up from the Rochestown Park Hotel at 10.15pm by a white Toyota RAV4, which travelled to a number of locations in east Cork. On 29 January, a cadaver dog on scrubland at Whitewell, Rostellan, "reacts to an area below the road, wet and damp, not the sort of place anyone would be walking", Mr O'Sullivan said. There gardaí found a one-tonne gravel bag. Underneath it was a second bag inside which were skeletal human remains later identified as Kieran Quilligan's. Prosecution Counsel Donal O'Sullivan said post-mortem examination results revealed that while most of the soft tissue was gone, there was a large number of skeletal injuries. "This man was badly beaten. A weapon appears to have been used in the nature of a hammer," he said. "He met his death in a violent manner". Before his remains were found, a search was carried out on 15 September 2023 of Mr Long's home, and a car, as well as a bucket with cleaning products were seized. Blood was found, which matched to Kieran Quilligan. Concluding his opening address to the jury, Mr O'Sullivan said that "I don't have direct evidence, an eye witness saying I saw Niall Long or Luke Taylor beat him to death. I don't have that. "The case is for the most part circumstantial - a man goes missing on 1 September, found on 29 January, most likely he died on 1 September." The trial continues before Ms Justice Lankford, who indicated on Monday that it could last until the end of the month. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: BlackRock and Brevan Howard tokenized funds launch on Sei: check SEI price outlook
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-and-brevan-howard-tokenized-funds-launch-on-sei-check-sei-price-outlook/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T16:14:55Z
Full Content:
Global investment giants BlackRock and Brevan Howard have announced the launch of their tokenized funds on the Sei network, leveraging Kaios’s advanced infrastructure. Announced on October 8, 2025, the move highlights an accelerating institutional adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The debut introduces BlackRock’s BUIDL and Brevan Howard’s BH Digital Liquidity Fund to the Sei ecosystem, facilitated by Kaios’s institutional-grade platform. Conventional funds under this initiative are transformed into on-chain digital assets, enabling 24/7 compliance with DeFi protocols. BlackRock. Brevan Howard. Live on Sei. The most powerful names in global finance are coming to Sei via @KAIO_xyz — beginning with BlackRock's ICS US Dollar Liquidity Fund and Brevan Howard's Master Fund, now live. RWAs Move Faster on Sei. ($/acc) pic.twitter.com/fXaTgQvx1c — Sei (@SeiNetwork) October 8, 2025 Sei’s architecture ensures robust handling of high-volume transactions while maintaining enterprise-level security. Mr. Olivier Dang, COO of KAIO, commenting on the announcement “This launch marks another major milestone in institutional blockchain adoption. By using the Sei Network, we’re bringing composable access to leading fund strategies entirely onchain. It’s the foundation for real-time, programmable, financial infrastructure built for the next era of capital markets.” Justin Barlow, Executive Director at the Sei Development Foundation, in his statement, also stated, “The integration of KAIO’s onchain infrastructure with the Sei Network is another important step toward the goal for Sei to become the institutional settlement layer for all digital assets. Sei’s high-performance rails enable a seamless experience for trading money market funds onchain–one that is superior to the experience of trading those funds in the real world.” This collaboration addresses longstanding pain points in asset management, such as settlement delays and high costs. By embedding KYC/AML protocols and secure custody solutions, Kaios ensures regulatory alignment, paving the way for broader institutional inflows into tokenized RWAs. The debut of these high-profile funds is poised to catalyze demand for the SEI token. As institutional activity surges, network usage is expected to rise, enhancing SEI’s deflationary mechanics and staking yields. SEI is trading at near $0.28, with a 4% weekly loss amid broader crypto market profit taking. Short-term forecasts anticipate modest recovery, targeting $0.40-$0.50, bolstered by Sei’s growing network, partnerships. Medium-term outlooks predict SEI reaching $1, with the all-time high of $1.14 allowing for further upside. The price trajectory hinges on sustained partnerships and regulatory tailwinds like potential SEC approvals for staking yields. An $18 million token unlock is a challenge that could introduce supply pressure. Sei’s staking ratio and recent 50% weekly surges suggest resilience. This launch cements Sei’s role in institutional blockchain innovation, with SEI’s price outlook tilting positive amid heightened utility and capital inflows.

Title: The Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: BITCOIN HOLDERS HESITANT TO EXPLORE BTC DEFI : Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi), also known as BTCFi, has been touted as the next wave of innovation for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. However, research suggests bitcoin holders themselves are barely engaging. Some 77% of bitcoin holders have never tried a BTCFi platform, according to a survey of more than 700 respondents across North America and Europe by BTC mining ecosystem GoMining. Just over 10% reported having experimented once or twice, while only 8% said they actively use BTCFi services for yield or lending. The survey highlights a stark disconnect between the sector’s promise and its actual reach. “There’s an enormous appetite for these opportunities, but the industry has built products for crypto natives, not for everyday bitcoin holders,” said GoMining CEO Mark Zalan in a statement. That appetite shows up in the data: 73% of respondents expressed interest in earning yield on their BTC through lending or staking, while 42% want access to liquidity without selling. Yet hesitation dominates. More than 40% said they would allocate less than 20% of their holdings to BTCFi products, underscoring the sector’s trust and complexity problem. — Jamie Crawley Read more. ETHEREUM FUSAKA UPGRADE ON HOLESKY TESTNET GOES LIVE: Ethereum’s next upgrade, Fusaka, just moved closer to going live on the main blockchain after a successful test run on the Holesky test network last week. The Fusaka hard fork comes only a few months after Ethereum’s major Pectra upgrade and is designed to make things cheaper for institutions using Ethereum. One of the changes it introduces is PeerDAS, a feature that lets validators check only part of the data needed instead of full chunks (“blobs”), which helps cut costs for both layer-2 networks and validators. Test networks like Holesky act as practice grounds where developers can safely test new code before it reaches the real chain. Holesky, launched in 2023, was particularly important because its validator setup closely mirrors Ethereum’s mainnet. But over the past few months, Holesky has started showing signs of age and reliability issues. Fusaka is the last upgrade the network will see before it shuts down — two weeks after Fusaka goes live on mainnet. The next two testnet runs are scheduled for October 14 and 28. After those are complete, Ethereum developers will lock in a date for Fusaka’s full mainnet launch. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. DOUBLEZERO MAINNET GOES LIVE: A new project wants to give blockchains their own “fast lane” on the internet. The DoubleZero Foundation announced that its highly anticipated mainnet-beta is live. DoubleZero is a network built to speed up how blockchain validators talk to each other. Instead of relying on the public internet, which can sometimes be slow and unpredictable, Solana validators can now connect through DoubleZero’s fiber routes, which let users transact faster. In simple terms, DoubleZero is like a private highway system for blockchains. While normal internet routes are designed to be cheap and broad, they aren’t built for the split-second coordination thousands of blockchain nodes need. DoubleZero says its network reduces lag and makes it easier for validators to process transactions and stay in sync, which could improve both performance and reliability for end users. The project has already seen early adoption. When it went live, 22% of staked SOL is plugged into the DoubleZero network (as of publication is at 25%.) Big industry names like Jump Crypto, Galaxy, RockawayX, and Jito are contributing fiber links and engineering resources, betting that faster internet infrastructure will pay off as blockchain applications scale. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. BEE MAPS RAISES $32M IN FUNDING ROUND: Bee Maps, the decentralized mapping project powered by Hivemapper, has raised $32 million in fresh funding to expand its global contributor network and scale its infrastructure, it announced this week. The round was led by Pantera Capital, LDA Capital, Borderless Capital and Ajna Capital, marking one of the largest financings in the decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) sector this year. Bee Maps is an application on the Hivemapper network, which is one of the largest decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) focused on mapping data on Solana. Hivemapper enables drivers to contribute data through AI-enabled dash cams, which detect real-time changes on roads (like new signs on the roads, detours, or construction zones), ensuring digital maps can update quickly to stay accurate. Bee Maps leverages this infrastructure by rewarding contributors with its native token, $HONEY, for collecting street-level imagery. The raise highlights strong investor appetite for Bee Maps’ vision of real-time, AI-powered maps. In recent months, Bee Maps has teamed up with major players including Lyft and Volkswagen’s robotaxi program to bring its mapping-data to their platforms. The fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features and boost contributor incentives tied to $HONEY. – Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

Title: BlackRock dominates all ETFs with $3.5bn haul: ‘that’s how hungry the fish are’
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/blackrock-beats-all-etfs-with-near-4bn-haul/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T15:54:20Z

About us Copy link BlackRock investors are relentless. Larry Fink’s firm led exchange-traded fund flows across every sector last week, topping the list with $3.5 billion in flows into its Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. That’s 10% of all net inflows into ETFs. In second and third place came Vanguard and State Street. Their flagship S&P 500 trackers, SPLG and VOO, hauled in $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. What’s impressive, however, is that both are getting lapped by a two-year-old. BlackRock’s IBIT has been around since January 2024, while Vanguard’s SPLG is 20 years old, and State Street’s VOO has been around for 15 years. Still, BlackRock wasn’t alone in its feeding frenzy. Every single Bitcoin ETF took in cash last week, with a total of 43,100 Bitcoin worth about $4.8 billion, according to Coinglass. “That’s how hungry the fish are,” said Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst. “Two steps forward mode. Enjoy while it lasts.” Moreover, flows into Bitcoin ETFs are nearly on par with 2024, with just under three months still to go. Year-to-date, inflows are now at $48.3 billion versus last year’s $48.5 billion, according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares. Since its inception, BlackRock Bitcoin investors have been insatiable. The fund is now nearing $100 billion in assets under management, making it the most profitable of all BlackRock ETFs. Loads of that capital comes from investors who had to wait a decade before the SEC greenlit a Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product. Now that it’s here, almost two years in, investors can’t get enough of it. And lately, conditions have been favouring even more exposure to crypto’s top asset. The “sustained high appetite” is driven by several factors, Butterfill told DL News. For one, the Fed is starting to cut interest rates — which tends to favour risky assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum — while the US government shutdown is forcing investors to find protection. “The ongoing U.S. government shutdown impasse shows no clear path to resolution,” said Butterfill. “This increasingly projects an image of ineffectiveness and raises questions about US creditworthiness.” Off the back of BlackRock’s voracious appetite and the confluence of macro factors came a new all-time high for Bitcoin. The crypto topped $126,000 on Monday for the first time. BlackRock’s $3.5 billion intake is nothing short of impressive. Notably, that figure represents more capital than the entire crypto venture capital funding for the first quarter of 2024 by a wide margin. Back then, VCs ploughed just over $2.2 billion into crypto startups, according to DefiLlama. With some of the recent developments in corporate Bitcoin adoption, there are plenty more bullish signs flashing. Take crypto treasuries. They’re the firms that buy and hold tokens to bolster their balance sheets, hoping to ride the coattails of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s historic price appreciation. Currently, the top 100 Bitcoin treasuries hold approximately 1 million Bitcoin, valued at around $127 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. And that’s just Bitcoin. Ethereum treasuries have been even more aggressive than their Bitcoin counterparts, accumulating more than $25 billion in barely six months.

Title: Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC:GRLT) Advances Tokenization Strategy with Gaia Platform

October 08, 2025 11:35 ET | Source: Primior Holdings Primior Holdings Irvine, California, Oct. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC:GRLT), a Southern California–based real estate development and investment firm, today announced progress on its tokenization strategy led by its flagship platform, Gaia, and confirmed that Gaia is set to begin beta testing on November 1, 2025. Interested participants can join the waitlist now for early access and to be the first notified at primior.com/gaia. Tokenization—the representation of real-world assets on a digital ledger—is emerging as one of the most transformative trends in global finance. While institutions such as BlackRock are advancing tokenization of public assets like stocks and bonds, Gaia is positioning itself to lead in tokenizing private markets—including private equity, private credit, and real estate. By lowering barriers to entry and enabling more flexible investment structures, Gaia is designed to change how capital is raised across private markets. Mission-Aligned GrowthGaia’s mission is democratizing real estate investing for all. With global real estate estimated to exceed $600 trillion, even a 1% market share represents a $6 trillion opportunity. Gaia aims to lead the tokenization of real estate by improving access, liquidity, and efficiency for investors and sponsors alike. Development Platform: GP-Led Execution Backed by USP & Institutions Alongside Gaia’s progress, Primior’s development platform continues to advance substantial projects where Primior acts as the General Partner (GP) and is fully responsible for end-to-end execution—from site acquisition and entitlements through design, capital stack structuring, construction, lease-up, and asset management. The company is currently developing more than $100M in projects, which are capitalized by USP and other institutional investors. USP (United States Property) is Primior Group’s flagship tokenized real estate fund. USP is a security token representing ownership in the fund; holding USP provides exposure to a diversified portfolio of U.S. real estate. The development pipeline managed by Primior as GP supplies high-quality opportunities that can be aggregated and managed within tokenized structures like USP, aligning tangible assets with modern digital ownership rails.
