Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Investor activity in US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surged sharply on Oct. 6, mirroring BTC‚Äôs continued price gains and growing institutional interest. According to data from SoSoValue, the twelve approved funds collectively absorbed about $1.2 billion in inflows. This is their second-largest single-day haul since launching in 2024 and the strongest performance this year. Much of that demand concentrated around BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which pulled in nearly $967 million in fresh capital and nearly $5 billion in trading volume. IBIT is now on the verge of crossing the $100 billion assets-under-management threshold, an unprecedented milestone for a digital-asset product. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that IBIT has already produced an estimated $244 million in annual revenue for BlackRock, surpassing the earnings of the firm‚Äôs other long-established funds. That profitability reflects how deeply institutional money has begun to integrate Bitcoin into mainstream portfolio strategies. Meanwhile, the latest wave of inflows extends a broader pattern of strength that the financial investment vehicles have registered recently. Last week alone, Bitcoin ETFs attracted around $3.2 billion in net new capital, marking the second-highest inflow on record. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Singer Burke and its RIA, SB Capital Management, will join Mercer‚Äôs Regis Group ultra-high-net-worth practice. October 7, 2025 Mercer Global Advisors has purchased a Los Angeles-based wealth manager and tax consultancy specializing in entertainment and creative professionals. Denver-based Mercer, which oversees more than $83 billion in assets, will have Singer Burke‚Äôs RIA, SB Capital Management, and Singer Burke Zimmer & Kogan, an accounting, tax, business and financial consultancy, join its ultra-high-net-worth-focused Regis Group. That practice, which it acquired in 2022, is a specialized team within Mercer focused on clients with $25 million or more in investable assets, currently accounting for approximately $20 billion of the firm‚Äôs total assets. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the fastest growing part of our firm,‚Äù Mercer President Daniel Gourvitch said. ‚ÄúIn the Regis Group, we have a number of specialties‚Äîprivate market investors, technology executives, specialists with business owners who are selling their business.‚Äù Now, Singer Burke will bring expertise in working with media, entertainment and creative professionals to Mercer, which Gourvitch said will become a resource for advisors throughout the firm when working with such clients. ‚ÄúIt creates an anchor focused on creative professionals in the UHNW space, but also can help across all our segments,‚Äù he said. Singer Burke was founded in 1972 by Sandy Singer and grew into a 60-person firm well-known in Hollywood as a wealth and tax management firm for industry professionals such as producers, writers, actors and composers. The firm is now led by partners Matthew Burke, Richard Singer (Sandy‚Äôs son), Elaina Kogan, Stephanie Connor Arkof and Amitha Harichandran. Related:Beacon Pointe, BIP Wealth, Raymond James, Unveil 850M+ Deals The group was seeking a partner who would provide a ‚Äúprofessional management team, enterprise-scale operations and technology, and a wider set of client services including estate planning,‚Äù according to the announcement. Gourvitch said Mercer will also benefit from Singer Burke‚Äôs tax and business management side, as it will scale those services at Mercer for high-net-worth families. ‚ÄúMercer tax and estate has about 200 professionals in it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis will deepen our bench, obviously, with UHNW clients and also add a set of specific management services applicable to the clients.‚Äù Gourvitch joined Mercer in 2022 from BlackRock, where he was a managing director and global head of platform for its Aladdin business. He said one of the reasons he joined the RIA was to help build a wealth manager with the capabilities of a large, bank-owned firm, but with a fiduciary mindset. ‚ÄúWe have the boutique core of an RIA without the trade-offs,‚Äù he said.

Title: How ‚Äòabsurd‚Äô momentum drives BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF toward $100B

The demand for BTC ETFs surpassed ETH ETFs in the past 30 days. IBIT is set to reach $100 billion AUM in under 450 days ‚Äî faster than any ETF in history. It has led to strong ETF inflows, fueling a spot-market demand that could further rally BTC. BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin [BTC] Trust ETF (IBIT) has smashed records and is now on track to hit $100 billion assets under management (AUM) milestone. It will become the fastest ETF to hit that target and currently the most profitable product across the BlackRock ETF lineup. With less than a two-year-old, IBIT‚Äôs explosive growth is ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In fact, IBIT raked in $244 million in annual revenue based on the press time AUM of $97.8 billion. Source: X In 2024, IBIT closed the year with $51 billion in AUM. At the time, the average BTC price was approximately $93,000. Although the Q1 2025 headwinds and tariff wars dragged AUM to $47 billion, it has rebounded to over $97 billion as of October. That‚Äôs about $50 billion added this year. Source: Soso Value If this pace of ETF inflows continues for the rest of Q4, IBIT could cross the $100 billion mark by October. Reacting to IBIT‚Äôs growth, ETF Store founder Nate Geraci added that the leading ETF took five years to cross $100 billion. ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs largest ETF, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, took 2,000+ days to hit that mark. IBIT is about to do it in < 450 days. Easily fastest ever.‚Äù Source: Bloomberg That being said, the overall BTC ETFs inflows rebound in H2, led by IBIT, have surpassed collective Ethereum [ETH] ETF inflows. According to CryptoQuant, in the last 30 days, BTC ETFs absorbed $4.61 billion in inflows while ETH ETFs lagged behind with $1.05 billion. CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartunn noted that the shift implied a likely rotation from ETH to BTC. Source: CryptoQuant The shift could stall the ETH/BTC rally seen in Q3. Meanwhile, the strong BTC ETFs and Spot market demand lifted BTC price to a new all-time high $126.1K. At press time, however, it had slipped slightly below $124K. With key liquidity pools at $118K, $120K, and above $127K to $130K, these could be key price targets to watch in the near term.

Title: Morgan Stanley Recommends a 4% 'Opportunistic' Crypto Portfolio Allocation

U.S. banking titan Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee (GIC) recommends an allocation of up to 4% of portfolios to cryptocurrency, according to an Oct. 1 note. The 4% allocation is at the top end of GIC's recommendations, pertaining to investors seeking "opportunistic growth," according to the note, shared on X by Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley on Sunday. Investors seeking balanced growth or market growth should allocate 2% and 3% respectively. However, for those seeking wealth conservation or income, the allocation should be 0%. The GIC described cryptocurrency as "a speculative and increasingly popular asset class that many investors, but not all, will seek to explore," adding that its commentary is focused primarily on bitcoin BTC$123,051.33, which it said is "akin to digital gold." For comparison, BlackRock and Fidelity, which both offer crypto investment through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) both recommend an allocation of about 2%, where other ETF providers Grayscale and VanEck have offered recommendations of 5% and 6%. For many in the crypto industry, that major financial institutions such as Morgan Stanley and BlackRock recommend any allocation at all is a sign of how far cryptocurrency has come since the days when certain banking execs labelled it a "fraud".

Title: U.S. Bitcoin ETFs Log $1B Inflows Again, a Level That‚Äôs Marked Local Tops Six Times Before

The U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a $1.2 billion net inflow on Monday, marking the seventh occasion that inflows have exceeded $1 billion, according to Farside data. The majority of these inflows came from BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which attracted $970 million. Historically, when inflows reach around $1 billion, it has often coincided with a short-term top in bitcoin‚Äôs price. The first instance occurred on March 12, 2024, when bitcoin peaked at around $74,000 two days later on March 14. The next two instances were in November 2024, when bitcoin surged above $100,000, with large inflows appearing just before the rally concluded in December. On Jan. 17, another $1 billion inflow preceded a local top near $109,000 on Jan. 20. Similarly, on July 10 and 11, consecutive $1 billion inflows were followed by a short-term peak of $123,000 on July 14. On Monday, bitcoin climbed above $126,000, so it remains to be seen whether a new high will form in the coming days, with bitcoin around $124,000. Meanwhile, Senior Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas noted that IBIT is now BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF, with assets under management just shy of $100 billion, generating an estimated $244.5 million in annual revenue. The next closest fund by revenue is the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF. Balchunas also highlighted that IBIT is approaching $100 billion in AUM in just 435 days, whereas the next-fastest ETF to reach that milestone, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), took 2,011 days.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs draw $1.18B in a day, near historic record amid rally
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-etfs-draw-1-18b-in-a-day-near-historic-record-amid-rally/

US. spot Bitcoin ETFs log $1.18 billion inflows, second-largest ever. Bitcoin hits record high above $126,000 before easing slightly. Institutional buying through ETFs fuels rally amid ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù optimism. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States registered their second-largest day of inflows ever on Monday, coinciding with Bitcoin‚Äôs surge to a new record high above $126,000. Data from Farside Investors showed that the 11 US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in a combined $1.19 billion in a single day, trailing only the $1.37 billion inflows recorded on November 7, 2024, following Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential election victory. Monday‚Äôs surge brought total inflows for October to $3.47 billion in just four trading days. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted on X that Bitcoin ETFs have now amassed approximately $60 billion in cumulative inflows since their launch last year ‚Äî a reflection of sustained institutional interest in Bitcoin exposure. The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the pack with an extraordinary $970 million in inflows on Monday. The fund has now attracted $2.6 billion since the start of October and is nearing a historic milestone. According to Nova Dius President Nate Geraci, the BlackRock ETF is close to crossing the $100 billion mark in assets under management (AUM), holding approximately 783,767 BTC valued at about $98.5 billion in Bitcoin and cash. ‚ÄúThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF took more than 2,000 days to reach $100 billion in assets, while IBIT is on the verge of doing it in under 450 days,‚Äù Geraci observed, highlighting the unprecedented pace of capital accumulation. Only 18 out of over 4,500 trading ETFs have surpassed $100 billion in AUM, he added. Other major beneficiaries included the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which saw $112 million in inflows, the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) with $60 million, and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) with $30 million. Bitcoin‚Äôs rally has been heavily driven by institutional participation through ETFs, allowing large investors to gain exposure without the need for direct custody. Analysts suggest that retail participation remains limited, underscoring the role of institutional capital in the current bull phase. The latest rally has also been supported by what traders term the ‚Äúdebasement trade‚Äù ‚Äî a shift toward non-sovereign assets such as Bitcoin and gold amid the ongoing US government shutdown, which has delayed key economic data and heightened policy uncertainty. The move into Bitcoin reflects a broader sentiment among investors seeking protection against potential monetary easing and inflationary pressures. After touching an all-time high of $126,186 on Monday, Bitcoin pulled back slightly due to profit-taking but remained firm. On Tuesday, the cryptocurrency traded flat at around $123,427.9. US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $3.2 billion in net inflows in the week ended October 3 ‚Äî the second-largest weekly haul since their inception ‚Äî including $985 million on October 3 alone. Seasonal optimism, commonly referred to as ‚ÄúUptober,‚Äù has also contributed to the market‚Äôs buoyant tone. Historically, October has been a strong month for Bitcoin, and investors appear to be positioning accordingly. Despite minor pullbacks, analysts note that the confluence of ETF demand, macroeconomic uncertainty, and seasonal strength continues to reinforce Bitcoin‚Äôs upward trajectory.

Jennie O\u0027Sullivan A book of condolence in memory of the late educationalist, social advocate and former City Councillor, Don O'Leary, has opened at Cork City Hall. Mr O'Leary died on Friday aged 68 after a long illness. He was the director of the Cork Life Centre for 18 years. The centre offers an alternative one-to-one relationship-based education for young people. Jailed for three years in the late 1980s for membership of the Provisional IRA, Mr O'Leary was elected a member of Cork City Council in 1999 for Sinn F√©in. Taoiseach Miche√°l Martin said that Mr O'Leary was passionate about education and had made a significant contribution to creating learning opportunities for young people for whom conventional education did not always suit. "He believed in the dignity of every individual, and the capacity of every individual to grow". Lord Mayor of Cork Councillor Fergal Dennehy said that "by listening to, respecting and supporting young people, using the Servol Life Centre model, Don guided hundreds of young people, many facing challenges, to a place where they could visualise a future for themselves, where they could self-motivate and could continue their education. "Perhaps most importantly, he gave them the keys to their future. "Those who met and knew him, will remember his warmth, humour and unshakeable belief in the potential of every young person. "His legacy will endure not only in the centre he helped create, but in the lives transformed by his dedication". Mr O'Leary was buried yesterday at St Michael's Cemetery, Blackrock, following requiem mass at the Church of the Resurrection in Farranree. ¬© RT√â 2025.

Shares of the local arm of South Korea's LG Electronics were allotted at the upper end of the ‚Çπ1,080 to ‚Çπ1,140 price band, an exchange filing showed late on Monday. The initial public offering comes during the second-busiest quarter on record for Indian listings, with firms set to raise up to $8 billion. LG Electronics India had planned for a listing by May after filing for an IPO last December, but delayed the share sale citing market volatility. Blackrock invested 971.6 million rupees, Singapore's wealth fund 1.71 billion rupees and Norway's wealth fund 1.05 billion rupees. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority was allotted shares worth 1.02 billion rupees. Domestic mutual funds were allotted about 49% of the shares set aside for anchor investors, with SBI and HDFC funds among the biggest buyers. Together, anchor investors will buy about 30% of the 101.8 million shares on offer at the IPO. Anchor investors are large institutional investors, such as mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds, who are allotted shares before the subscription opens for retail and other investors. These investors are subject to a mandatory lock-in period after listing, in which they cannot sell their shares. LG Electronics India's three-day share sale opens for other investors on October 7. The firm is India's second largest appliance maker and competes with Whirlpool and Samsung , in the domestic market. Its parent firm is looking to make India its global manufacturing hub, for its competitive labour costs and strong domestic demand, an executive told Reuters last week.

For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. The conventional wisdom holds that the battle for Asia's crypto hub is a contest between Singapore and Hong Kong. Both cities have English as an official language and use Western-inspired common law in their court system. But during Token2049, executives weren't debating whether Singapore or Hong Kong would win the title of Asia‚Äôs crypto hub. Instead, they were talking about how Japan, once written off as overregulated, had quietly become the region‚Äôs most credible market for real trading volume, staking infrastructure, and institutional growth. ‚ÄúJapan had no regulation for a long time, don't forget, that's where crypto basically happened, and then it went super stringent, and nothing happened for a long time," Konstantin Richter, the CEO of Blockdaemon, told CoinDesk during Token2049. "But people kept on chiming away, and now they actually have a regulatory infrastructure that‚Äôs institutionally scalable and about ready to pop. Whereas here [in Singapore], it was a free fall, and now they're starting to build up regulation.‚Äù Singapore moved fast and then tightened. It opened its doors early to crypto firms, building a reputation as Asia‚Äôs sandbox for innovation. That worked, until it didn‚Äôt. The collapse of FTX and other failures exposed weak consumer protections, prompting the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to swing toward heavy supervision in 2024. The result: higher compliance costs, mandatory custody segregation, external audits, and slower licensing. Those that don't like it have to leave, even if they aren't serving Singapore-based customers. It's a lot of work for a relatively small market. ‚ÄúSingapore was so crypto-friendly that everyone wanted to come here,‚Äù Richter said. ‚ÄúThen it built up, things happened, and suddenly you‚Äôre like, wait a minute, we do need more stringent rules.‚Äù Japan, by contrast, did its hard regulatory work years ago. Following Mt. Gox (2014) and Coincheck (2018), Japanese regulators had already imposed strict licensing, segregation, and onshore custody rules long before FTX imploded. By 2025, instead of tightening, Japan is opening slightly: allowing institutional staking, setting a pathway for crypto-backed ETFs, and clarifying how firms can offer yield. Unlike Singapore‚Äôs innovation-first, regulate-later approach, Japan‚Äôs regulators wrote detailed rules for custody, segregation, and security years ago. Exchanges must hold client assets separately and use domestic validators, creating the kind of environment institutional investors prefer. Richter said Asian clients, particularly in Japan, are willing to pay for institutional-grade infrastructure, a contrast, he noted, to Europe, where customers are typically more price-driven. The shift isn‚Äôt just regulatory. Japan's almost invisible yield ‚Äì the Bank of Japan only ended negative rates last year ‚Äì makes staking unusually attractive: a 3 % ETH yield is 30 times higher than domestic treasury returns. That‚Äôs why Blockdaemon and other node operators see Tokyo as the next major destination for institutional staking flows. Derivatives exchange BitMEX is also taking notice. In a recent interview with CoinDesk, BitMEX CEO Stephan Lutz said the exchange had just moved its data center to Amazon Web Services' facility in Tokyo to be closer to where the action is. Japan‚Äôs crypto framework, once criticized for being too strict, now gives it a clear edge: predictable oversight, investor protection, and rising institutional yield. Now, the question is, how will the usual hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore compete? BTC: Bitcoin surged past $126,000 in a ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù of macro tailwinds. Yet this latest breakout above $125,000 came largely from non-institutional demand. With ETF inflows paused and retail traders fueling momentum through high perpetual funding rates, BTC‚Äôs resilience above prior highs suggests whales are holding steady and scarcity narratives are deepening. ETH: Ethereum traded around $4,705, extending its recent strength on renewed interest in on-chain fundamentals, upgrade optimism, and rotation from BTC to altcoins, as BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) added 179,251 ETH last week, bringing its holdings to 2.83 million tokens worth $13.4 billion, in a bid to control 5% of Ethereum‚Äôs supply and solidify its position as the second-largest listed crypto treasury after Strategy. Gold: Gold traded around $3,960, nearing Bank of America‚Äôs long-held $4,000 target, but the bank‚Äôs analysts now warn the metal looks overbought and could face a Q4 consolidation after a 50% yearly rally, even as longer-term charts still leave room for gains toward $5,000‚Äì$7,000 if the bull cycle continues. Nikkei 225: Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 hit another record high Tuesday, boosted by a Wall Street tech rally and strong chip stocks following the OpenAI-AMD deal, extending gains after Sanae Takaichi‚Äôs election as Japan‚Äôs next prime minister, which fueled optimism over pro-growth policies.

The wave of political uncertainty in the developed world kept investors largely pinned towards gold. Persistent bets on more interest rate cuts by the U.S. FED also benefited metal markets.

Comex Gold surged nearly 2% in the previous session, driven by renewed safe-haven demand amid the US government shutdown, escalating geopolitical tensions, and a softer dollar index. Prices in the spot market edged closer to record highs around the $3,970 mark. The short-term outlook remains constructive as long as the $3,900 support level holds. In the domestic market, prices are trading above the Rs 120,000 level, which is a bullish sign for prices.

Shares traded at Rs 1,023.80 on the NSE, down 2.51% Gold active futures reached a new high, hitting $4000 (~ Rs 120,900), as financial markets became increasingly unsettled due to the US government shutdown and a French political crisis. The political upheavals in Japan and France are escalating fiscal worries and fuelling the gold rally. ¬∑ After unsuccessful attempts to come to an agreement with political parties about budget spending, which prevented efforts to control the biggest fiscal deficit in the euro area, Sebastien Lecornu resigned as the prime minister of France. The financial markets have also been shaken by Sanae Takaichi‚Äôs almost certain promotion to the position of prime minister of Japan. ¬∑ This week, the US government shutdown continued, and the White House threatened to lay off a large number of federal employees. Additionally, this has prevented investors from accessing crucial information required to evaluate the state of the US economy, which further muddies the Fed‚Äôs decision-making process. The Fed‚Äôs latest interest rate cut and the expectation of more have helped, and central banks and gold-backed exchange-traded funds have been eager buyers. Technical Triggers ¬∑ Gold has achieved the target of $4000 (~Rs 120,900) today. This rally can show more upward spikes, but one needs to be very cautious at this level. We can also see sharp sell-offs, as the psychological target is achieved. If Gold falls below $3850 (~Rs 117,000), we can say the top has been made, and a correction will follow Tata Capital IPO Day 2 live updates: The ‚Çπ15,512-crore Tata Capital IPO, the largest public issue of the year, opened for subscription on October 6 and close on October 8.

Title: Bitcoin Prices Reach Latest High As Multiple Factors Create ‚ÄòPerfect Storm‚Äô

ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin prices rallied to a fresh, all-time high on Monday, October 6, breaking previous records as the digital currency benefited from what one market expert described as a ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù of bullish factors. ‚ÄúInstitutional inflows and Fed rate cuts along with a weakened dollar create the perfect storm for demand in Bitcoin - a hedge against currency debasement,‚Äù independent cryptocurrency analyst Armando Aguilar stated via email. Aguilar commented on how the U.S. government shutdown, which began Wednesday, October 1, has fueled robust demand for both bitcoin and gold, which many view as safe-haven assets in times of political uncertainty. ‚ÄúAs the U.S. Government has shut down, investors have rotated capital from U.S. assets in favor of Gold and Bitcoin, resulting in higher demand in safe-haven assets, driving prices of both these assets to historical ATH levels,‚Äù said Aguilar. He certainly wasn‚Äôt the only analyst to highlight the impact of this event, as the YouTuber who goes by Wendy O also focused on this particular development. ‚ÄúThe US government shutdown is a significant factor contributing to the price increase of Bitcoin,‚Äù she stated via email. ‚ÄúBitcoin is notably seen as a hedge against economic and government uncertainty and is intended to be used as a hard asset, similar to gold.‚Äù Several market observers emphasized the growing role that institutional investors are playing in the markets for the world‚Äôs most valuable cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúInstitutional demand for Bitcoin has accelerated, as more Digital Asset Treasury Companies have emerged to create Bitcoin strategic reserves, causing an accelerated demand for Bitcoin,‚Äù noted Aguilar, ‚ÄúNot to mention the increased Bitcoin ETFs demand from endowments, Sovereign wealth funds and other corporates.‚Äù The YouTuber who goes by Wendy O also offered some insight on this situation, emphasizing the fact that the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol IBIT, was able to reach $80 billion in assets under management faster than any other exchange-traded fund in history. Several media outlets reported on this milestone back in July, which Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, mentioned via a post on X (formerly Twitter). ‚ÄúIt seems that we can further attribute Bitcoin‚Äôs growth to the demand of the BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF,‚Äù said Wendy O. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, also offered his perspective, emphasizing that both ‚Äúcontinued spot ETF inflows‚Äù and ‚Äúrenewed institutional demand‚Äù have been major contributors to bitcoin‚Äôs recent rise above $126,000. The U.S. dollar has been having a rough year, having declined close to 10% since the start of 2025, as measured by the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). The DXY started the year at roughly 108.49, and declined to as little as 96.63 last month, according to MarketWatch data. At the time of this report, the DXY, which measures the strength of the greenback relative to six major fiat currencies, was approximately 98.12, additional MarketWatch figures reveal. Aguilar spoke to this weakness, stating that ‚ÄúYTD, the U.S. dollar has depreciated ~10%, while Gold and Bitcoin have been some of the best performing assets YTD.‚Äù Comex futures for gold recently climbed to nearly $4,000, attaining an all-time high, according to Google Finance data.

Share this article BlackRock and Fidelity‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $5.5 billion in trading volume today, highlighting continued institutional interest in crypto assets. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT has emerged as a dominant force in spot Bitcoin ETFs, driving the majority of recent inflows and controlling significant liquidity as of early October 2025. The asset manager holds a notable portion of Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating supply through its ETF product. Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC is actively contributing to capital cycling among spot Bitcoin ETFs, reflecting broader institutional accumulation strategies. In late September 2025, the investment firm demonstrated aggressive rotation of capital within the sector as institutional adoption of Bitcoin through spot ETFs continued to gain momentum.

Title: Grayscale Adds Staking Rewards To Ethereum And Solana Trust ETFs In Major Industry First

Grayscale has debuted staking to its Ether and Solana investment products, becoming the first-ever crypto fund issuer to feature staking rewards via U.S.-listed spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs). Grayscale announced on Monday that it has introduced staking functionality to its Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), the second-biggest such fund on Wall Street with $4.82 billion in net assets, as well as its Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH), describing the development as ‚Äúanother first-mover milestone‚Äù for the company. ‚ÄúGrayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (Ticker: ETHE) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (Ticker: ETH) have become the first U.S.-listed spot crypto ETPs to enable staking,‚Äù the company said in a Monday announcement. Today, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (Ticker: $ETH) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (Ticker: $ETHE) have become the first U.S.-listed spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETP) to enable staking, another first-mover milestone for the firm. Grayscale Solana Trust (OTCQX:‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/45963Bn9UW Staking has also been enabled for the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL), which is awaiting regulatory approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to be converted into an exchange-traded fund. If approved, GSOL could become one of the first spot Solana ETPs with staking. Staking is key to how proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum and Solana function. Users help validate transactions and keep the network secure by staking their funds and earning tokens in return. By activating staking, Grayscale gives investors exposure to ETH and SOL, while earning rewards from the blockchain networks without directly holding or managing the underlying assets. Grayscale indicated that it will stake assets passively via institutional custodians and a diversified network of validator partners, aiming to help secure the protocols while supporting long-term network resilience. In a statement, Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg said staking in the ETH and SOL funds was ‚Äúexactly the kind of first-mover innovation‚Äù that the company was designed to deliver. ‚ÄúAs the #1 digital asset-focused ETF issuer in the world by AUM, we believe our trusted and scaled platform uniquely positions us to turn new opportunities like staking into tangible value potential for investors,‚Äù Mintzberg added. Grayscale plans to roll out staking to additional products ‚Äúas the digital asset ecosystem evolves.‚Äù The key selling point could help Grayscale close the gap with BlackRock, whose Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs currently dominate the flourishing sector.

IBIT now generates more revenue for BlackRock than funds that have been operating for decades. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has approached $100 billion in assets under management, making it the firm‚Äôs most profitable ETF despite its launch just 435 days ago. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted on Oct. 6 that IBIT now generates more revenue for BlackRock than funds that have been operating for decades. The age disparity stands out sharply in BlackRock‚Äôs top 10 revenue generators. At one year old, IBIT outearns the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, which has been operating for 25 years and holds $121.8 billion in assets. The iShares MSCI EAFE ETF and the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, despite managing $68.4 billion and $701 billion, respectively, also trail IBIT in profitability over 24 years of operation. IBIT charges a 0.25% fee on assets, generating approximately $244.5 million in annual revenue at current levels. The fund‚Äôs profitability stems from both its substantial asset base and relatively high fee compared to BlackRock‚Äôs Core S&P 500 ETF, which charges zero basis points. Balchunas also shared that IBIT sits $2 billion away from the $100 billion threshold and is on track to shatter the record for the fastest ETF to reach that milestone. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF currently holds that record at 2,011 days. IBIT will complete the journey in roughly one-fifth of that time. The Bitcoin ETF‚Äôs velocity extends beyond individual fund comparisons. IBIT and BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) pulled in $10 billion in monthly inflows as of Oct. 5, ranking third and fourth among all ETFs for monthly flows. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs collectively pulled in $3.3 billion in the week ending Oct. 3, pushing year-to-date inflows to $24 billion and lifetime flows to approximately $60 billion. The $60 billion mark represents a new high-water mark for the product category since launch in January 2024. Bitcoin hit new all-time highs following a surge in ETF inflows, briefly crossing $125,500 on Oct. 6. The cumulative flow chart shows a steady acceleration from $12 billion in March 2024 to $40.25 billion in February 2025, followed by a jump to $59.54 billion by October 2025.

Title: Cathie Wood's ARK Bets on Tokenization With a Stake in BlackRock-Backed Securitize

ARK Invest, the asset management firm led by CEO Cathie Wood, is leaning into the tokenization boom by taking a stake in tokenization specialist Securitize as Wall Street races to bring assets onchain. The ARK Venture Fund (ARKVX), ARK's closed-end, actively managed fund that invests in public and private companies, held 3.25% of its assets in Securitize, making the firm the fund's eighth largest position following artificial intelligence (AI) companies X.AI and Anthropic, according to the fund's latest disclosure dated September 30. Based on the fund's $325.3 million in net assets under management as of September 30, ARK‚Äôs stake in Securitize should be valued at roughly $10 million, according to CoinDesk's calculation. ARK's investment comes as tokenization emerges as one of the hottest trends in crypto, bringing traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and stocks onto blockchain rails. Global banks and asset managers are exploring tokenization to cut settlement times, broaden investor access and keep markets open around the clock. It's potentially a huge opportunity: the tokenized asset market has grown 112% to $33 billion year-to-date, RWA.xyz data shows, and could swell to $18.9 trillion by 2033, Ripple and BCG projected earlier this year. "ARK Invest‚Äôs strategic investment reflects growing conviction among leading institutional investors that tokenization will fundamentally transform capital markets," Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said on Tuesday in a statement announcing ARK's investment in his firm. Securitize, founded in 2017, is one of the early pioneers of the tokenization space. It issued $4.6 billion in tokenized assets working with traditional finance giants such as BlackRock, Hamilton Lane and Apollo. It is also known as the issuer behind BlackRock's tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) that's leading the tokenized U.S. Treasury sector with $2.8 billion in assets. The firm is also active in equity tokenization, creating on-chain shares of listed wallet provider Exodus in 2022 and entering into an agreement with ether ETH$4,505.20 treasury firm FG Nexus (FGNX) to introduce its common and preferred stock to the Ethereum blockchain. ARK's investment follows Securitize's $47 million fundraising round last year, led by BlackRock and Hamilton Lane (HLNE), with ParaFi Capital and Tradeweb Markets (TW) also participating.

Title: Grayscale adds staking feature to Ethereum, Solana ETF products ‚Äì Details!

An update like this could open multiple possibilities for crypto products in the United States. Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE, ETH, and GSOL. Move will broaden investor access to on-chain rewards, while introducing yield-bearing crypto exposure to investors. On 6 October, Grayscale Investments, one of the world‚Äôs largest digital asset investment platforms, introduced staking for its Ethereum and Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) products ‚Äî A move that marks a first for the U.S Crypto ETF market. The company announced that Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH), and Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) have become the first U.S.-listed spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) to enable staking. The update allows investors to gain exposure not only to the spot prices of Ether and Solana, but also to the networks‚Äô staking rewards ‚Äî Traditionally earned by users who lock their tokens directly on-chain. According to Peter Mintzberg, Grayscale‚Äôs CEO, ‚ÄúStaking in our spot Ethereum and Solana funds is exactly the kind of first-mover innovation Grayscale was built to deliver.‚Äù Grayscale will stake its ETH and SOL ETF holdings through institutional custodians and a diversified network of validator providers. The process will be passive, meaning investors do not need to hold crypto or manage validators themselves. Instead, the funds will earn staking rewards, which are then expected to remain within the fund, potentially enhancing its net asset value (NAV) over time. The ETHE fund is Grayscale‚Äôs flagship Ethereum product, designed primarily for institutional and long-term investors. On the contrary, the ETH Mini Trust offers a lower-fee, retail-friendly version. According to data from Sosovale, ETHE is the second-largest Ethereum ETF, valued at $4.82 billion. ETH Mini Trust ranks fourth, valued at $3.31 billion. Source: Sosovalue The GSOL trust, currently traded over the counter, has also activated staking and could become one of the first Solana Spot ETPs with staking if its exchange listing is approved. Until now, U.S Spot crypto ETFs have provided exposure only to the underlying asset‚Äôs price. By enabling staking, Grayscale has effectively introduced yield-bearing crypto exposure into traditional finance ‚Äì A feature that could pressure competitors like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark to follow suit. The move will also broaden investor access to on-chain rewards, eliminating the technical risks associated with self-custody, validator management, and slashing penalties. For long-term holders, it would introduce an additional return component that mirrors the yield mechanics found in decentralized finance (DeFi). The addition of staking is notable given the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs cautious position on yield-generating crypto products. Grayscale‚Äôs structure ‚Äî where staking rewards remain within the fund rather than distributed ‚Äî may have been key to regulatory acceptance. Grayscale‚Äôs latest move could redefine how investors interact with crypto, bridging the gap between DeFi and Wall Street.

Grayscale has introduced this functionality to its Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), the second-largest such fund on Wall Street with assets of $4.82 billion, as well as its Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH). The firm, which filed its staking addendum with the SEC on Monday, will rely on institutional custodians like Coinbase and a ‚Äúdiversified network of validator providers‚Äù to stake its Ethereum. Staking has also been activated within the Grayscale Solana Trust, which is awaiting regulatory approval to be turned into an ETF. The move is a significant development, given that institutional investors have only been able to capitalize on ETH's price gains until now. Ethereum made an ambitious upgrade to a proof-of-stake blockchain in 2022, meaning validators voluntarily lock ETH away and receive rewards for taking a role in securing the network. It‚Äôs a much less energy-intensive approach than the previous proof-of-work consensus model, which Bitcoin and some other chains still use. Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum exchange-traded products were among the first to hit the traditional financial market, with its trust-style product ETHE dating back to 2017. Last year, after Ethereum spot ETFs gained SEC approval, the firm successfully converted its products into spot Ethereum ETFs in July. The absence of staking rewards in ETFs have been cited as a key factor in the slower adoption of Ethereum funds since they launched in the summer of 2024. Data from SoSoValue shows the total net assets in Bitcoin ETFs currently stands at $164.5 billion‚Äîequivalent to 6.7% of its market capitalization. Ethereum ETFs lag behind with net assets of $30.5 billion, 5.6% of this cryptocurrency's valuation. However, demand has been growing in recent months‚Äîdriven by ETH's outperformance in the crypto market. Ethereum has surged by 156% over the past six months, compared with BTC's gains of about 50%, and set a new all-time high price mark shy of $5,000 in September. In a statement, Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg said staking was "exactly the kind of first-mover innovation" that the company was designed to deliver. ‚ÄúAs the #1 digital asset-focused ETF issuer in the world by AUM, we believe our trusted and scaled platform uniquely positions us to turn new opportunities like staking into tangible value potential for investors," he added. Grayscale says it plans to roll out staking to more of its products "as the digital asset ecosystem evolves." The unique selling point could help Grayscale close the gap with BlackRock, whose Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominate the market. Crypto exchange-traded products just capped off a record week, pulling in a total of $5.95 billion worth of investments last week, according to CoinShares. That tally included $1.48 billion worth of inflows into Ethereum funds, with both Bitcoin and ETH funds rebounding after being in the red the previous week.

Title: PLUME Rises 25% as Network Registered by SEC as Transfer Agent for Tokenized Securities
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/06/plume-network-registered-by-sec-as-transfer-agent-for-tokenized-securities
Time Published: 2025-10-06T15:00:22Z
Full Content:
Plume Network, a modular Layer 2 blockchain dedicated to real-world assets (RWAs), is now an SEC-regulated transfer agent, streamlining the issuance, transfer, and management of tokenized securities. The network's native token (PLUME) rose by 25% following the announcement as daily trading volume rose by 186%, according to CoinMarketCap. As a registered transfer agent, Plume will now manage digital securities and shareholder records directly onchain, supporting interoperability with the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) settlement network, according to the press release shared with CoinDesk. Further, it will facilitate a range of use cases, including onchain IPOs, small-cap fundraising, and registered funds. Most notably, the technology aims to reduce tokenization timelines from months to mere weeks via smart-contract automation. Plume's registration provides a much-needed regulatory infrastructure for institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity and Apollo seeking compliant on-chain asset transfers. "At Plume, we believe transfer agent regulation exists to protect investors‚Äô rights as shareholders. With this fully onchain transfer agent protocol, we are streamlining the issuance of digital securities with a built-in partnership with regulators,‚Äù said Chris Yin, CEO and Co-Founder of Plume. "The crypto industry has been searching for a viable bridge between DeFi‚Äôs speed and TradFi‚Äôs safeguards. With the issuance of this license places Plume as the ideal solution for this search," Yin added. A transfer agent in the traditional sense is a financial institution that maintains official records of a company's shareholders, manages ownership changes, issues stock certificates, and handles dividend and interest payments. A blockchain transfer agent, such as Plume, performs similar functions on-chain by leveraging distributed ledger technology, offering a secure, immutable and transparent digital record of asset ownership and transfers. Plume‚Äôs achievement comes after its active collaboration with regulatory bodies, including its contributions to discussions surrounding the GENIUS Act. The announcement follows SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce‚Äôs remarks last week expressing the regulator‚Äôs openness to engaging with issuers of real-world asset tokenization projects. Plume's regulated transfer agent is operational, which allows interested funds to engage with Plume‚Äôs infrastructure with immediate effect, even as broader regulatory frameworks continue to evolve. Building on this foundation, Plume plans to launch its initial product offerings, involving Nest protocol vaults, in the first quarter of 2026. Within Plume Network, Nest is one of the significant protocols focused on staking mechanisms for real-world asset (RWA) protocols. Nest allows fund managers to create vaults backed by regulated financial instruments. Users can then deposit stablecoins into these vaults to earn yield in a permissionless way from the underlying real-world assets. Plume said that it has already garnered interest from SEC-registered investment funds (40 Act funds). And while regulatory challenges, such as asset custody issues, present hurdles, the company anticipates these will diminish as the SEC proposes new rules through 2026 and finalizes them by 2027. The 40 Act funds are publicly offered, pooled investment vehicles, such as open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and unit investment trusts, registered under the Investment Act of 1940. The timing aligns with a broader market shift toward onchain securities and positions Plume at the forefront of this transition. "The license enables Plume to support the migration of offchain securities into compliant digital forms, especially 40 Act funds‚Äîthe traditional backbone of the U.S. asset management industry representing over $39 trillion," the firm told CoinDesk. Plume is also seeking additional licenses, including Alternative Trading System (ATS) and broker-dealer registrations, to develop a fully compliant onchain capital market infrastructure for 40 ACT funds.

Title: US shutdown and weak jobs data drive record $6B crypto inflows

Investors turn to digital assets as US government shutdown and weak jobs data raise fiscal stability doubts. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. A US government shutdown and the weak jobs report have pushed digital asset investment products to their strongest weekly inflows on record. According to the latest CoinShares report, crypto-related investment products attracted $5.95 billion in inflows last week, pushing total assets under management (AUM) to an all-time peak of $245 billion. The rally did not emerge from retail excitement or online speculation. Instead, it stemmed from macroeconomic unease following the US government shutdown and disappointing employment data. Investors appeared to interpret both as warning signs about the country‚Äôs fiscal resilience and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs policy direction. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, explained that the inflows reflected a delayed investor reaction to the Federal Open Market Committee‚Äôs recent rate cut and current US government events. According to him: ‚ÄúWe believe this was due to a delayed response to the FOMC interest rate cut, compounded by very weak employment data, as indicated by Wednesday‚Äôs ADP Payroll release, and concerns over US government stability following the shutdown.‚Äù This resulted in a wave of capital seeking refuge in assets perceived as both liquid and resilient. The CoinShares report suggested that investors appear to be treating digital assets not as speculative plays but as macro hedge instruments that respond to fiscal turbulence and liquidity shifts. As expected, Bitcoin absorbed most of last week‚Äôs inflows, capturing a record $3.55 billion in fresh capital. This is its strongest week in history. Notably, the 12 US-based Bitcoin ETF providers, including BlackRock, accounted for roughly $3.2 billion of that total, which is their second-strongest weekly performance since launch last year. Conversely, short Bitcoin products saw no flows for the week, signaling renewed investor confidence as prices approach new highs. BTC price reached a new all-time high of more than $125,000 during the weekend. This move highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring role as the market‚Äôs liquidity anchor and a preferred hedge in uncertain times. Ethereum also turned a corner during the period. After weeks of redemptions, the asset drew $1.48 billion in new capital, lifting its year-to-date total to $13.7 billion. Notably, this is nearly triple its total inflows for last year. At the same time, Solana-focused funds hit an all-time high of $706.5 million, pushing their 2025 tally to $2.85 billion, while XRP saw $219.4 million amid anticipation of new spot investment products. These inflows show that crypto markets are no longer reacting to hype but to macro signals, including liquidity trends, rate policy, and institutional sentiment.

Title: Grayscale Becomes First to Add Staking to US Spot Ethereum ETFs
URL: https://www.coinspeaker.com/grayscale-becomes-first-to-add-staking-to-us-spot-ethereum-etfs/
Time Published: 2025-10-06T13:34:40Z

¬© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Grayscale introduced staking for its US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs, ETHE and ETH, in a first-of-its-kind development in the US market. Digital asset manager Grayscale Assets Management announced its plans to introduce staking for its existing spot Ethereum ETFs. This is the first of its kind development in Ethereum ETFs, and comes despite the ongoing US shutdown. ETH $4 484 24h volatility: 4.6% Market cap: $541.85 B Vol. 24h: $50.73 B price is showing strength once again as it approaches the $4,600 mark. In a significant and first move in the crypto space, digital asset manager Grayscale announced the launch of a staking facility for its US-listed spot Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH). The latest decision comes as the Ethereum price bounces back and is eyeing a breakout to new all-time highs. With these staking features, Grayscale aims to provide investors with exposure to the long-term value growth of the Ethereum network. At the same time, it will preserve the funds‚Äô primary objectives, with ETHE and ETH providing spot Ether exposure. Grayscale noted that ETHE and ETH are not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and are therefore not subject to the same regulations or protections as 40 Act-registered ETFs and mutual funds. On the other hand, other Ethereum ETFs from US issuers, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest, still need to obtain SEC approval for the staking feature. This is a crucial decision as introducing staking will further amplify the yields for investors, driving greater institutional inflows. In addition to Ethereum ETFs, Grayscale has also introduced staking to its Solana Trust (GSOL). This will provide investors with a traditional brokerage route to earn SOL $221.3 24h volatility: 4.2% Market cap: $121.00 B Vol. 24h: $9.11 B staking rewards. The firm has filed with the U.S. SEC to convert GSOL into an ETF under the 1933 Act. However, this is not the first Solana staking ETF currently available on the market. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF (SSK), which is regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, has recently begun trading. It offers direct spot SOL exposure alongside rewards generated from on-chain staking. Since its launch in July, the Rex Osprey Solana staking ETF has grown its assets under management to $404 million. The decision comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market is navigating the ongoing US government shutdown. Market analysts believe that this could further delay the decision for several crypto ETFs, scheduled for October.

Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (27) appeared before the Central Criminal Court, sitting in Cork, charged with the murder of Mr Quilligan. Both defendants are charged with the murder of Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1, 2023, and January 29, 2024, at an unknown location within the State. The charge is brought contrary to Common Law. Niall Long (left) and Luke Taylor (right). Photo: Provision. The two men entered not guilty pleas when arraigned before Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford and a jury of ten men and two women at Cork Courthouse, Angelsea Street. Long is formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon, Cork Taylor is of no fixed abode and previously of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork. Both men only spoke during the hearing to confirm their not guilty pleas. Ms Justice Lankford was told by Donal O'Sullivan SC, for the State, that the case is expected to be quite lengthy and could last for between three and four weeks. Jurors were told they need to be available for the case until at least October 28. The hearing could feature up to 126 witnesses including Garda√≠ and householders as well as forensic, technical and medical personnel. It will also involve a substantial amount of CCTV security camera footage. Mr Long is represented by Ray Boland SC while Mr Taylor is represented by Brendan Grehan SC. Both defendants had previously been granted free legal aid. The jury was informed that the case will be formally opened by Mr O'Sullivan on Wednesday. No details of the case beyond the charge were outlined in court. Mr Quilligan was the focus of a major Garda missing person investigation from September 2023 when he was last seen in public in Cork city. His body was discovered almost five months later. Garda√≠ launched a murder investigation following the discovery of Mr Quilligan's remains and on receipt of the findings of a post mortem examination. Mr Quilligan was 5‚Äô7" in height, of medium build and with brown/grey hair and blue eyes. He also had a large and distinctive tattoo on the side of his head. When last seen Mr Quilligan in September 2023 was wearing an orange T-shirt, blue Under Armour tracksuit pants and black Nike runners. The Garda investigation involved 851 separate lines of inquiry, 412 statements and over 250 exhibits as well as hundreds of hours of CCTV footage.

Title: Bitcoin Spot ETFs‚Äô Rising Strength Challenges Dominance Of Spot Market Trading, A Pivotal Shift Ahead?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etfs-rising-strength/
Time Published: 2025-10-06T13:30:04Z
Full Content:
As the price of Bitcoin pushes near its all-time high, several areas involving the crypto king, especially the Spot ETFs, are starting to turn remarkably green once again. With the Spot ETFs recording bullish closes, this renewed momentum is beginning to challenge the spot market trading. The historic Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are returning to their bullish state as the market recovers. A recent research by Darkfost, a market expert and CryptoQuant author, shows that BTC spot ETFs are quickly gaining traction in the cryptocurrency investment market. While gaining serious traction, the BTC spot ETFs appear to be challenging and heavily drawing attention away from direct spot market trading. Such development implies that these products may be becoming the ideal gateway between traditional finance and digital assets due to their regulated accessibility, institutional confidence, and increasing inflows. According to the expert, the market is currently in a period where ETFs are becoming increasingly popular compared to the spot market. This is changing the way that institutional and individual investors are exposed to Bitcoin, indicating a fundamental shift in the dynamics of the market. When examining trading volumes, without taking into account derivatives, the spot market continues to dominate by a wide margin. However, it is clearly evident that ETF volumes are growing substantially. As a result, Darkfost believes it is highly relevant to monitor the ETF flows in those days. Generally, volumes have ranged between $1 billion and $2.5 billion between May 2024 and November 2024, excluding the initial launch period of spot BTC ETFs. Meanwhile, these days, they are more in the range between $2.5 billion and $5 billion. Darkfost highlighted that this increase in volume is probably due to the robust expansion of Bitcoin spot ETFs, especially in the United States. With this growth, ETF volumes are already catching up to spot volumes, which might signal the start of a paradigm shift if the trend keeps getting stronger. In the midst of this paradigm shift, the expert stated that ETFs have made cryptocurrency more accessible to a wider range of investors, particularly in the US. While ETFs may have taken away liquidity from the spot market, the funds have also absorbed a sizable portion of Bitcoin. As ETFs are also well-structured instruments for institutional investors, these BTCs are still being traded like any other crypto asset, but under a different framework. Another crucial aspect highlighted by Darkfost is that these BTC holdings become less reactive. This development is driven by the fact that supply is currently controlled by large asset management companies such as BlackRock and Fidelity. Instead of using Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) or market panic, these companies manage based on supply and demand dynamics. In the meantime, Darkfost noted that all of this supports the notion that there is a significant shift taking place in the Bitcoin market. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: It‚Äôs Time for Soft Secession

Clara JefferyNovember+December 2025 Issue Edmon de Haro Edmon de Haro In 2013, venture capitalist Tim Draper launched a ‚ÄúSix Californias‚Äù ballot initiative. The upshot was that with some 40 million people, more than the population of the 20 smallest states combined, California was too big, too diverse, to be ‚Äúefficiently‚Äù governed. So why not, Draper argued, break it up into six new ‚Äústartups,‚Äù a.k.a. states? Instead of two senators, we erstwhile ‚ÄúCalifornians‚Äù would get 12. Draper‚Äôs scheme was part of a long tradition‚Äîsince California was admitted to the Union as part of the Compromise of 1850, there have been more than 220 proposals for it to divide or secede‚Äîbut derided as a Silicon Valley ploy to create a libertarian deregulation zone. (Tellingly, the Bay Area state was to be named ‚ÄúSilicon Valley.‚Äù) And aside from the feasibility of making it happen, state and federal constitution-wise, people worried that it would cleave four rich populous states from two poorer rural states (fair) and weaken Democrats‚Äô voting share in the Senate (in retrospect, nah). Draper‚Äôs measure gleaned valid signatures from some 753,000 people‚Äîmore, it must be said, than the populations of America‚Äôs three smallest states‚Äîbut in California, that wasn‚Äôt enough to get on the ballot. After the 2016 election, which put the anti-majoritarian provisions of the US Constitution very much front of mind, Draper came back with a simpler proposal‚Äîthree Californias, or Cal 3. This initiative got enough signatures to head to voters, but the day before the 2018 ballots were to be printed, the state Supreme Court blocked the measure‚Äîwhat about things like existing water treaties, the justices worried‚Äîand Draper eventually gave up. While his motives were murky, Draper tapped into something now excruciatingly felt. The assignment of two senators per state, no matter its population, was always a deeply flawed (and deeply racist) proposition. But the unfairness has only gotten more acute. As my colleague Ari Berman has noted: ‚ÄúIn 1790, the country‚Äôs most populous state, Virginia, had 12 times as many people as its least populous, Delaware. Today, California has 67 times the population of Wyoming. Fifteen small states with 41 million people combined now routinely elect 30 GOP senators; California, with 39 million residents, is represented by only two Democrats.‚Äù The Golden State is the fourth-largest economy in the world but doesn‚Äôt have political clout proportional to its population, let alone to our status as a global cultural, technological, and agricultural juggernaut. In case it‚Äôs not obvious why I‚Äôm taking a leisurely drive down a byroad of California electoral history, let‚Äôs review some of the abuses and usurpations that President Donald Trump has visited upon us. California, and the country, cannot await the outcome of the midterms to repel Trump‚Äôs siege on democracy. More drastic action is required. The most vicious of those abuses has been over immigration. On June 6, at the urging of his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, ICE escalated raids in California, hitting farms, factories, construction sites, and schools, separating families and detaining undocumented people, legal residents, and even citizens. Federal agents arrested and hospitalized David Huerta, the head of one of the state‚Äôs most powerful unions. When protests erupted, Trump jumped at the chance to federalize the National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom‚Äôs wishes‚Äîsomething that hasn‚Äôt been done since LBJ acted to protect civil rights protesters from segregationists. Border czar Tom Homan threatened to arrest Newsom, which Trump agreed was a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù idea. When a reporter asked for what crime, Trump responded that his ‚Äúprimary crime is running for governor‚Äù and called protesters ‚Äúinsurrectionists.‚Äù Speaker of the House Mike Johnson chimed in that Newsom should be ‚Äútarred and feathered.‚Äù Then Trump sent Marines into LA. When California Sen. Alex Padilla‚Äîwho was voted for by more Americans than 18 GOP senators combined‚Äîtried to ask Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem questions at a press conference, federal officials knocked him down and cuffed him. One-quarter of California‚Äôs population are immigrants, and the continual attack on them‚Äîand anyone who is brown‚Äîis a moral injury that plays out in our streets and our feeds day after day after day. But the direct assaults on California are by no means limited to raids and those protesting raids. Trump has dragged his feet about providing federal aid to address the devastation of LA‚Äôs wildfires, saying he‚Äôd release it only if we pass a voter-ID law; taken our own National Guard off fire lines; and made bizarre claims about sending us water for the fires from the Pacific Northwest. He‚Äôs canceled our car efficiency and emissions rules, attacked our renewable energy plan, and zeroed out federal money for rooftop solar and high-speed rail. He‚Äôs revoked federal grants to UCLA over spurious charges of antisemitism, then gave the school a list of demands, including a $1 billion settlement and the end of ¬≠gender-affirming care in its hospitals. Amid all of that came Trump‚Äôs demand that Texas engage in midcycle redistricting to give the GOP five extra congressional seats that he says it‚Äôs ‚Äúentitled to.‚Äù Newsom, both legitimately enraged and sensing an opportunity to help his presidential ambitions, has rallied California Democrats to mount a ballot initiative to temporarily set aside its nonpartisan redistricting commission and draw congressional maps to counterbalance Texas‚Äô scheme. We will vote on that initiative in November, and my bet is it will pass. But California, and the country, cannot await the outcome of the midterms to repel Trump‚Äôs siege on democracy. More drastic action is required. Unfortunately, especially as Trump berates generals and admirals on ‚Äúthe enemy within‚Äù and suggests they use US cities as ‚Äútraining grounds,‚Äù it‚Äôs all too easy to imagine a world where the commanders of California‚Äôs military bases are compelled to choose sides. (If you think such scenarios are out of the realm of possibility, ask yourself why he and Pushup Pete Hegseth have been purging the brass.) Our boundaries of oceans and mountains and deserts, our copious natural resources, and our technological prowess make a return to an independent California Republic more feasible than it might be for other states. But in advance, and hopefully in lieu, of that, it‚Äôs time to start applying our economic muscle. When Trump first said he was gutting federal funding to California‚Äôs public universities, a system that is the envy of the world, Newsom responded: ‚ÄúCalifornians pay the bills for the federal government. We pay over $80 BILLION more in taxes than we get back. Maybe it‚Äôs time to cut that off, @realDonaldTrump.‚Äù Remember when Mitt Romney called 47 percent of Americans ‚Äútakers,‚Äù layabouts who fed off the ‚Äúmakers‚Äù that he claimed to represent? (We do, since Mother Jones‚Äô own David Corn broke that story, arguably changing the course of the 2012 election.) This persistent GOP talking point is especially odd when you consider the residents of 19 mostly blue states pay more to the US Treasury than they get in federal benefits; to Newsom‚Äôs point, none pays more than California. (This includes our undocumented residents, who pay billions in federal taxes and receive no federal benefits.) We‚Äôre mostly happy to do it because we believe in things like Social Security, public education, pandemic preparedness, and research institutions. But why should we sit by while you take our money, defund our priorities, and shit on our values? California can‚Äôt claim no power in Congress, like DC‚Äîhome to 700,000 people, more than either Vermont or Wyoming‚Äîcan. But it‚Äôs time to think outside of the electoral box and start flexing our considerable leverage. We are the nation‚Äôs largest agricultural state‚Äîgrowing more than a third of the country‚Äôs vegetables and ¬≠three-quarters of its fruits‚Äîand the fifth-largest food producer in the world. We produce the most milk and the most wine, copious amounts of rice and cattle, and, crucially, 90 percent of US avocados. Other states may be poster children for farms, but we‚Äôre No. 1. Hollywood is a $47.2 billion industry exerting, for better or worse, immeasurable global cultural power. The $623 billion tech sector is even mightier. Were California to secede, almost 15 percent of America‚Äôs GDP would go with it, and the US could slip behind China as the world‚Äôs biggest economy. Short of actual secession, what could California do? It could learn from the Jimmy Kimmel showdown and lead a financial ‚Äúcountervalue‚Äù rebellion, using ‚Äúthe full weight of blue states‚Äô market power, cultural influence and legal authority to raise the stakes of Republican red-state aggression,‚Äù Democratic strategists Arkadi Gerney and Sarah Knight wrote in the Washington Post, by imposing ‚Äúregulatory and economic costs that bite hard enough to make the constituents of even the most insulated legislator feel the pain.‚Äù We could start by disinvesting our pension funds from red-state companies like AT&T, American Airlines, ExxonMobil, and Tesla. ‚ÄúThe 15 blue trifectas (states where Democrats control the governor‚Äôs mansion and both houses of the state legislature), with their larger state budgets and more generous pensions, have state investments that total almost 75 percent more than the 23 red trifectas,‚Äù they note. If that seems a reach, consider that Texas effectively got BlackRock to drop its ‚Äúwoke‚Äù investment and governance policies by blackballing it. Blue states could lure away techies, doctors, nurses, and electricians with relocation bonuses. We could institute tax and other incentives to pull new factories and data centers away from red states. We could selectively terminate professional licensing reciprocity. We could ease commerce between friendly states and make it difficult for unfriendly ones. Economic retribution is just part of a broader constellation of tools that law professors Jessica Bulman-Pozen (Columbia) and Heather K. Gerken (Yale) call ‚Äúuncooperative federalism‚Äù and others call ‚Äúsoft secession.‚Äù It‚Äôs not, writes Substacker Chris Armitage, ‚Äúthe violent rupture of 1861, but something else entirely. Blue states building parallel systems, withholding cooperation, and creating facts on the ground that render federal authority meaningless within their borders.‚Äù Some of this is already underway. Led by California‚Äôs Rob Bonta, the attorneys general of blue states have been having almost daily Zoom calls to plot strategy and file briefs and suits. Democratic governors have devoted tens of millions to hire lawyers for those fights and banded together to oppose Trump‚Äôs threats to send troops to their states. In early September, California, Oregon, and Washington created the West Coast Health Alliance to formulate their own vaccine standards and distribute shots, no matter what lunacy Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unleashes. Hawaii signed on a day later. Other blue states are honing similar coalitions. Unified action could further preserve what the federal government is destroying, law professors Aziz Z. Huq (University of Chicago) and Jon D. Michaels (UCLA) wrote in the Los Angeles Times. Blue states could create ‚Äúlarge regional research consortia; re-create public-health and meteorology forecasting centers servicing member states; and finance pandemic planning.‚Äù (A proposal to do much of this is underway in Sacramento.) With the Justice Department doing little more than acting as Trump‚Äôs goon squad, states could also ‚Äúmobilize interstate criminal task forces to track and prosecute corruption by politicians, ¬≠lobbyists and government contractors (who invariably, when violating federal laws, run afoul of myriad state laws, too).‚Äù Ditto consumer and environmental investigations‚Äîthe cost of which could be offset by fines, even as they lay the groundwork for federal prosecutions if America is ever restored to sanity. But we need to be clear-eyed: Such a restoration may not come in time. So far, this year has been marked by a collective action problem. Media conglomerates, law firms, universities, banks, CEOs‚Äîtoo many powerful institutions and individuals have failed to meet the moment. This is why people all over the country, desperate for pushback against Trump‚Äôs autocracy, have embraced Newsom‚Äôs redistricting plan, whatever their broader opinions of him. With Trump provocatively sending troops into blue cities, and using recision and the shutdown to claw back congressionally appropriated funds from blue states, it‚Äôs time to turn the tables on him. Soft secession, powered by the presidential ambitions of multiple blue-state governors, could, should it come to that, be the proving ground of a new confederacy. Hopefully the threat of CalExit or a new Union will be enough. But that extreme measures might be necessary to ensure that American democracy shall not perish from the Earth is becoming more self-evident with every passing day.

(Bloomberg) -- Som Seif, the entrepreneur bent on disrupting Canada‚Äôs financial industry, has found himself at the center of an unprecedented showdown with the country‚Äôs top markets watchdog. The asset management executive is a consummate marketer ‚Äî a skill that helped him build a firm that was one of Canada‚Äôs early winners in exchange-traded funds, sell it to BlackRock Inc., then start another, Purpose Investments Inc. But that knack for self-promotion has caught the attention of the Ontario Securities Commission, which now alleges that Purpose made false or misleading statements about its use of environmental, social and governance factors in investment decisions. The regulator, in its first enforcement action against greenwashing, also went after Seif himself, saying he failed to stop the claims ‚Äî and laid out potential penalties that would, at the extreme end, see him banned from being a senior executive in Ontario‚Äôs investment industry. Purpose, with about C$26 billion ($18.6 billion) of assets under management, is hardly a global player. But its founder has a public persona in Canada created through years of television appearances and in-flight ads, and that makes him a high-profile target. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a longstanding perception in industry that Canadian securities regulators as a whole are relatively weak on enforcement,‚Äù said Doug Sarro, a law professor at the University of Ottawa who previously worked at the OSC. With this filing, Sarro believes Ontario‚Äôs watchdog is trying to ‚Äúdeliver on their new head of enforcement‚Äôs vision of more impactful, high-visibility enforcement.‚Äù That head is Bonnie Lysyk, Ontario‚Äôs former auditor-general, who‚Äôs known for a bombshell report on a land development scandal that rattled the government of Premier Doug Ford. Several industry players expressed surprise that the commission went after Purpose, which voluntarily stopped making certain ESG claims in 2023. During the heyday of ESG fund releases between 2020 and 2022, sustainability expert Tim Nash said he saw marketing ‚Äúthroughout the industry that I felt was pushing the boundaries of greenwashing.‚Äù The founder of Toronto-based Good Investing said he welcomes enforcement in this realm, but ‚Äúit does feel to me that there is a little bit of a target on Purpose.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhile this case is the first ESG-related enforcement action brought by the OSC, the issue at the heart of it relates to false and misleading statements,‚Äù the regulator said in an email. Seif and Purpose are contesting the claims, with their first hearing set for Monday. ‚ÄúWe remain confident about our position and look forward to the proceedings,‚Äù Purpose said in a statement. True to form, Seif is also making his case to the court of public opinion in a video, saying the OSC is going after his firm for taking a ‚Äúgenuinely innovative‚Äù approach to ESG at a time when no regulatory guidelines existed. In an interview when the allegations were first unveiled, Seif argued the regulator is seeking to score political points, not protect investors. ‚ÄúA regulator is using their position for political greenwashing goals, as opposed to going after people who cause real investor harm.‚Äù ‚ÄòESG Always‚Äô Seif, an engineer by training who got his start in finance as an investment banker with Royal Bank of Canada, rose to prominence on Toronto‚Äôs Bay Street by building Claymore Investments Inc., one of Canada‚Äôs first standalone ETF providers. After Claymore was sold to BlackRock in 2012, Seif founded Purpose Investments. It‚Äôs now part of his broader firm, Purpose Unlimited Inc., which has received financial backing from the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and the digital investments unit of Allianz SE. Seif has long advocated for innovation in the financial industry and beyond, and sits on the boards of Wealthsimple Inc. and an entrepreneurship charity. Purpose, meanwhile, launched Canada‚Äôs first physical Bitcoin, single-stock and high-interest-savings ETFs, and also has private-asset and retirement-focused products. What it doesn‚Äôt offer is standalone ESG funds. Instead, ‚Äúwe had the ambition of embedding ESG considerations as a factor across all of our investment processes,‚Äù Seif said in a video uploaded to LinkedIn after the OSC released its allegations ‚Äî eliciting a supportive comment from a former senior securities regulator. Ontario‚Äôs securities regulator, however, says Purpose‚Äôs ambition was more about marketing than action. Its case takes issue with at least 19 statements that Purpose or its leader made about ESG between September 2019 and March 2022, including on Purpose‚Äôs website and in media interviews. For example, the company said one of its principles was ‚ÄúESG Always‚Äù ‚Äî a slogan it changed to ‚ÄúESG Conscious‚Äù in 2023, following an OSC review. All but one of the 19 statements came before January 2022, when Canadian securities regulators published their first ESG-specific guidance. The regulator alleges that Purpose didn‚Äôt consider ESG in making investment decisions for many of its funds and didn‚Äôt even have a formal policy. Less than 35% of assets under management in 2019 considered ESG, the OSC added, despite Purpose saying the percentage was 75%. The watchdog included a range of potential remedies in its filing, from procedural changes to a permanent registration ban. Monetary penalties could be as high as C$5 million for each of five alleged violations. The regulator won‚Äôt necessarily seek all of those sanctions. ‚ÄúOnce the merits of the case have been decided, the OSC will set out specifically what it is seeking to the Capital Markets Tribunal ‚Äî and this will be informed by a number of considerations, including the Tribunal‚Äôs decision, reasons, and factual findings,‚Äù said spokesperson Andy McNair-West. Some securities lawyers say the maximum penalties look too severe for the nature of the infraction. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think most of it is proportionate,‚Äù said Amanda McLachlan, a partner with law firm Bennett Jones in Toronto. Cases in which Canadian regulators have permanently banned people from the capital markets include the Bridging Finance Inc. case, in which investors are estimated to have lost at least C$1 billion due to fraud, and the Sino-Forest Corp. scheme, when a Canadian-listed Chinese forestry company collapsed after it was found to have wildly misstated its assets. The OSC‚Äôs filing against Purpose doesn‚Äôt allege any investor losses. Enforcement Push The OSC‚Äôs action comes after the regulator ‚Äúhas had some high-profile decisions come out that have either not gone well for them or have been critical of enforcement efforts,‚Äù McLachlan said. In 2022, the OSC‚Äôs case against three former executives of CannTrust Holdings Inc. fell apart in the middle of a trial, resulting in an acquittal. In November, the Capital Markets Tribunal dismissed the OSC‚Äôs case against Cormark Securities Inc. and others regarding illegal distributions, calling the allegations an ‚Äúoverreach.‚Äù McLachlan said it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising that the OSC brought a greenwashing case, given that it completed 128 fund reviews across 41 managers between January 2022 and March 2024. Ambiguous ESG materials have led to multimillion-dollar fines in the US. Invesco Advisers Inc. agreed last November to pay $17.5 million to settle allegations that it misled clients about the share of companywide assets under management that integrated ESG factors into investment decisions. Under the Trump administration, however, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to end climate-related reporting requirements, leading to a rollback of such rules worldwide. But while there may be less focus on climate and diversity, Canadian securities regulators have emphasized they‚Äôll still go after misleading statements. Regardless of the outcome of the Purpose case, a regulator ‚Äúis putting out there that they‚Äôre going to be reviewing disclosure very carefully,‚Äù said Barbara Hendrickson, managing partner of BAX Securities Law in Toronto, who previously worked at the OSC. ‚ÄúIt sends a message to the market that they should clean up their existing disclosure if it doesn‚Äôt comply with the guidance.‚Äù --With assistance from Paula Sambo.

Title: Bitcoin Price Hits An All-Time High, But Here‚Äôs What Really Matters
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/10/06/bitcoin-price-hits-an-all-time-high-but-heres-what-really-matters/

ByDan Runkevicius, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin‚Äôs price just hit an all-time high at $124,688, pushing its market cap past $2.47 trillion. As Wall Street debates whether it‚Äôs a risk-on or risk-off asset, BlackRock says it‚Äôs something else entirely. Before we go any further, let‚Äôs get one thing out of the way. Bitcoin is not a currency in the way that the dollar or peso is and it is unlikely to ever become a currency in the way that some advocates imagine it to be. A decentralized means of exchange is a lovely democratic idea, but no government (left or right) seems to prefer a decentralized currency to run its books, which would reduce the government‚Äôs power over both monetary and fiscal policy. A good example is the Great Depression. In 1931, the U.S. experienced of the worst financial crisis in history. But, unlike today, the Fed‚Äôs hands were mostly tied. It couldn‚Äôt print more dollars to prop up the economy because the currency was linked to gold. So President Franklin Roosevelt passed Executive Order 6102, later dubbed the ‚ÄúGreat Confiscation.‚Äù In short, it forced Americans to turn in their gold and sell it to the government at well below market rates. Banning bitcoin today would be a political walk in the park compared to the Great Confiscation and some measures that other governments have taken in the past, like the way that Argentina briefly restricted citizen bank accounts in 2001. That‚Äôs because a smaller percentage of the population owns bitcoin, even today, than owned gold or bank accounts in the previous examples. But that doesn‚Äôt mean bitcoin is worthless. Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt compete with paper money. It competes with insurance against paper money. So the real story behind bitcoin‚Äôs rise today isn‚Äôt the price but how quickly institutions are adopting it and how much it‚Äôs grown out of a speculative asset label into something of a ‚Äúhedge.‚Äù Last month, BlackRock stopped just short of naming bitcoin a risk-off asset, calling it a unique ‚Äúdiversifier." First, bitcoin has a relatively low correlation with stocks. It has little to no exposure to the macro variables that drive traditional assets. And it‚Äôs well positioned for global monetary instability because it‚Äôs not tied to any jurisdiction. Perhaps more interestingly, bitcoin has risen in six out of six major global crises within 60 days since 2020 ‚Äî more often, and at a much higher rate, than gold. ‚ÄúIn most instances, including with the recent global market sell-off of April 2025, bitcoin has recovered back to its prior level within days or weeks, and in many cases has rallied further as a recognition of the positive potential impact of such disruptive events on bitcoin‚Äôs fundamentals begins to predominate,‚Äù wrote BlackRock analysts. So even if bitcoin never becomes a global reserve currency or daily transaction currency, it can still carry a lot of perceived value as a ‚Äúunique diversifier,‚Äù "store of value," or a digital alternative to gold. After all, gold is not a legal tender (with few exceptions), you generally don‚Äôt buy anything with it. Gold‚Äôs industrial and jewelry applications make up just a sliver of demand. Yet private investors, institutions, and central banks still hold $26 trillion worth of it, just in case. And, as we see the price of bitcoin continuing to rise, some may argue that the same dynamic is unfolding with digital gold as well.

Title: Morgan Stanley‚Äôs new investment guidance could channel up to $80B into Bitcoin

Morgan Stanley now likens Bitcoin to digital gold and advises up to 4% allocation for growth portfolios. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Global Investment Committee has issued new guidance encouraging investors to dedicate a small but deliberate portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin. The bank‚Äôs analysts now view the world‚Äôs largest crypto as a ‚Äúscarce asset similar to digital gold,‚Äù recommending an allocation of 2% to 4% depending on risk appetite. Given that Morgan Stanley‚Äôs GIC oversees strategy for about 16,000 financial advisors managing roughly $2 trillion in client wealth, even modest adoption could introduce tens of billions in new inflows to Bitcoin. Consequently, the bank‚Äôs recommendation could translate to as much as $40 to $80 billion in potential fresh investment into BTC. Exhibit 12: GIC Recommendations for Maximum Cryptocurrency Allocations in Multiasset Portfolios According to the guidance, investors with Opportunistic Growth portfolios (i.e., those comfortable with greater volatility) can hold up to 4% in Bitcoin or similar digital assets. Meanwhile, those with Balanced Growth strategies are advised to keep exposure below 2%, while portfolios focused on preserving capital or generating income should avoid crypto entirely. Still, GIC cautioned that Bitcoin could experience sharper swings during macroeconomic stress, though it acknowledged that the asset‚Äôs volatility has significantly reduced in recent years. Nonetheless, this decision reflects a shift in tone from the firm‚Äôs earlier caution, when crypto exposure was limited to select high-net-worth clients. Under that framework, qualified investors with at least $1.5 million in net worth and a high risk tolerance were allowed to invest in Bitcoin. Morgan Stanley‚Äôs recommendation perfectly illustrates the broader reappraisal of digital assets within the traditional financial ecosystem. The bank‚Äôs view now aligns with that of BlackRock, which argued that allocating up to 2% of a diversified portfolio to Bitcoin is a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù approach for long-term investors. Similarly, billionaire investor Ray Dalio has argued that a small Bitcoin position can function as an inflation hedge, comparable to gold, due to its finite supply. Industry observers see these shifts as a cultural turning point that would spark further adoption and growth for the emerging asset class. Samuel Grisanzio, chief marketing officer at Wolf Financial, said: ‚ÄúThe shift from ‚Äòstay away‚Äô to ‚Äòflexibly allocate‚Äô in traditional wealth management language is absolutely massive for adoption honestly.‚Äù That evolution follows growing client demand since the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. Those products unlocked easier access to the asset and helped propel its price past $125,000, reinforcing Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a legitimate component of modern wealth strategies and a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy.

Meet the 25 newest inductees to Business Insider's annual list of young people who exemplify the drive and creativity needed to succeed in one of the most competitive industries in the world. After a slow start to the year amid uncertainty over tariffs, geopolitical risks, and recession fears, dealmaking is regaining momentum. Bankers and private-equity investors are finding their stride, driving major IPOs, carve-outs, and buyouts. Here are some top dealmakers to watch. Jack Levendoski is riding the rebound in M&A after a rocky start to the year. An executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, he has worked on some of 2025's largest technology transactions, including Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk and Xero's $2.5 billion purchase of Melio. After a choppy first half marked by rate uncertainty and geopolitical risk, he says the market now "feels extremely busy." He's used to big-ticket transactions: In 2022, Levendoski was part of Twitter's $44 billion sale to Elon Musk, a transaction that unfolded under global scrutiny. "The pace at which that all happened, the level of public scrutiny‚Äö it was pretty amazing," he told Business Insider. He also worked on Squarespace's $6.9 billion take-private with Permira in 2024, Savvy Gaming Group's $4.9 billion acquisition of Scopely in 2023, and the merger of World Wrestling Entertainment and UFC, valued at about $21 billion. Levendoski's father worked in oil and gas, and the family moved often, living in Louisiana, London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia. "Growing up where the environment was always changing and kind of always finding your feet and figuring it out," he says, adding that it also gave him an appreciation for different viewpoints and the ability to adapt quickly. That flexibility has been essential across more than $300 billion in deal value he has advised on. Artificial intelligence has been a recurring theme in recent deals, in how companies are valued and in how bankers operate. Being an early adopter has given Levendoski "quick answers to hard questions that perhaps before required significant research," he said. After starting his career at Chevron, where he worked as a facilities engineering project manager, Levendoski joined JPMorgan in 2016, supporting capital projects and offshore oil and gas projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Having benefited from mentors early on, he now tries to do the same for others: "I saw the value that it created for me, and so I've tried to play that forward." Mary-Grace Papatheodorou worked on her first IPO in 2012, as an analyst on Jefferies' equity capital markets desk. She remembers watching in awe as the woman running Manchester United's equity syndicate negotiated prices and stake sizes with hungry investors. "I remember thinking to myself at the time, wow, that's the coolest job I've ever seen," Papatheodorou told Business Insider. She went right up and asked if she could join the equity syndicate team. Years later, she thinks that directness was a secret weapon that has helped propel her up the ranks. Today, she's a managing director on Morgan Stanley's global capital markets' equity syndicate desk. "I have to ask investors to step on price or to accept smaller or larger allocations to move the demand. You have to ask ‚Äî the worst that can happen is someone says no, and at least then you know your answer," she said. "It's tough to put yourself out there, but it's a lot worse not to." Papatheodorou spent nearly 10 years at Jefferies before joining Morgan Stanley in 2021. She managed the equity syndicates of some of this year's highest-profile IPOs, including Figma, Chime, and CoreWeave. Her role, she admits, is "incredibly high pressure." Her calls on price, sizing, and risk can dictate how a stock trades the very next day. Making those calls is also part of the fun, she said. Like the markets, her job is always evolving. She doesn't get a lot of sleep when IPO season is in full swing. Now on maternity leave after giving birth to her first child in August, she's embraced a similar routine. "Having a child is a little bit of a different animal, but equally as demanding as some of our clients," she joked. As a principal investing in sports teams for Blue Owl, Lamar Cardinez is living a version of his dreams he didn't know was possible. Cardinez had ambitions to play professional football, but when that didn't happen, he pivoted to working in sports ‚Äî interning at Madison Square Garden and joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee. That led him to the National Football League's rotational program, where he worked in media, business development, and strategy. He planned to climb the ladder there, then realized that the work he was most interested in was reserved for those with finance backgrounds. Encouraged by longtime NFL executive and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Eric Grubman, Cardinez pursued an MBA at Cornell before landing in investment banking at Guggenheim Securities. Then came a fateful call from Dyal Capital Partners (soon to become Blue Owl). The firm had just launched HomeCourt Partners, a fund partnership with the National Basketball Association, to buy minority stakes in teams. It was a "no-brainer" for him, he said. Cardinez joined in 2021, shortly after the fund's first investment in the Phoenix Suns, then valued at $1.55 billion. He later worked on the franchise's $4 billion sale to mortgage magnate Mat Ishbia in 2022 and has since contributed to four more NBA deals ‚Äî a period during which the average value of an NBA team nearly doubled, according to Blue Owl. He sources potential deals by "hanging around the hoop" and getting to know the league's hundreds of minority investors and would-be buyers. His team spent two years engaging with Alex Rodriguez's consortium before striking a 2024 deal for the Minnesota Timberwolves. Cardinez's skill in underwriting sports teams as they turn from "vanity and trophy assets" to money-makers is built on his operational knowledge of sports and his financial expertise. His blueprint for valuation has since been replicated across sports leagues and geographies, the firm said. Golf was Jackie Shepherd's training for Wall Street. She was a competitive player from age 7 through college, where she earned a full-ride scholarship and was a two-time captain of the University of Minnesota team. Though she dreamed of turning pro, Shepherd carried over her patience and precision to a career advising companies on breaking out parts of their business. "Golf is all about strategy," she said. "I think a lot of that really translated over to the separations work that I do, where it's very detailed, you really have to get into the weeds, it's hyper strategy focused ‚Äî and these are really long lead time transactions." Shepherd is a vice president in Morgan Stanley's Separations and Structured Solutions group, which specializes in helping companies transform subsidiaries into standalone entities. She has advised on about $250 billion worth of corporate spin-offs, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks into Versant Media Group. She says it's a "unique way" for Comcast to become more focused on where the future of media is going. The goal with the deals she works on is to "disentangle" businesses that don't make sense together but are strong and "have agendas that they want to do on their own." Shepherd started her career in accounting on EY's international tax team, where she first saw the work of investment bankers up close. "I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two," she said. "I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas." She restarted her career in M&A and was recruited as an analyst by Goldman, where she found her mentor, Michael Kagan; she later followed him to Citi and Morgan Stanley, which she joined in 2023. Shepherd still plays golf, and her goal is to play on all seven continents. Asia was checked off last summer: "My golf clubs have seen a lot of airline miles." In 2022, Florian Plath got a call from one of his bosses at JPMorgan Chase with an assignment: Join the deal team on Broadcom's $90 billion acquisition of VMware, one of the largest tech acquisitions in history. It was a pivotal and fast-moving experience for the banker, who's since advised on other multibillion-dollar transactions, including Altair's $10.6 billion sale to Siemens and Altium's $6 billion sale to Renesas. Earlier in his career, he worked on Maxim Integrated's $29 billion all-stock merger with Analog Devices ‚Äî one of the largest semiconductor transactions on record. Plath started at JPMorgan as an intern in the London office. Today, he is an executive director and top advisor in its mergers and acquisitions group, working with leading technology clients. Reflecting on these deals, Plath said the constant across them is how quickly teams must mobilize and solve problems in dynamic markets ‚Äî especially those as ever-changing as the tech sector. He has observed that strategic corporate buyers, after a quieter stretch, have recently begun revving the engine of dealmaking activity again ‚Äî especially around AI and software ‚Äî while private equity sponsors continue to search for bargain buys. Plath is based in San Francisco, and the native of Germany has studied in Asia and lived in London, so he's formed a global worldview. He moved to California in 2018. "Right from the start, I knew I wanted to, at some point if the opportunity arose, to live and work in the US," he said, pointing to its position as the leading capital market. His international upbringing, he added, "further sparked my interest in global markets." At JPMorgan, he has also served as a staffer ‚Äî the linchpin for team coordination ‚Äî for the North America analyst and associate program, working hand-in-hand with junior bankers on the front lines of deal teams. An avid runner who also enjoys golf and tennis, he credits sports with keeping him grounded in a high-pressure business. "For me, it has always been a team sport," he said, "doing what's right for our clients, the firm, and the employees." From working as a Radio Disney DJ through middle and high school to graduating in the top 5% of her Harvard Business School MBA class as a Baker Scholar, Natalie Lamberton has long been a high achiever with an entrepreneurial streak. It makes sense she's found success at GTCR, the Chicago-based private equity firm where she became one of its youngest directors. "I can chase whatever opportunities I like, which is motivating," she told Business Insider. As an associate in 2016, she played a key role in GTCR's $500 million investment in Lytx, a global leader in video telematics, together with a firm partner. Two years later, GTCR sold a stake in the company, whose valuation had more than tripled to $1.7 billion, to a Clearlake Capital‚Äîled investor group. Lamberton joined GTCR after starting her career at Goldman Sachs in leveraged finance. She's since worked on over a dozen deals, including the 2023 acquisition of Once For All, a construction supply chain platform. She helped bring on a new CEO ‚Äî a key part of GTCR's playbook ‚Äî and later spearheaded its 2024 expansion into Spain with the acquisition of Nalanda. Returning from parental leave after the birth of her first child in March, Lamberton is focused on vertical software across government technology, supply chain, and workforce tools ‚Äî and how AI can help portfolio companies achieve their goals more efficiently. "It helps us accelerate our development road map materially," she said. Her father, a salesman in the industrial sector, taught her to approach challenges with curiosity rather than a fear of failure. That has allowed her to walk into situations with the mindset of "why not try to apply myself and see what happens." Lamberton nearly pursued theater before choosing Wharton for undergrad. The ‚Äúcalculated risk taker‚Äù in her decided a career onstage wasn‚Äôt the right fit. She'd love to get back into it at some point, but right now her performances are reserved for her 6-month-old daughter in their kitchen. Infrastructure has become one of Wall Street's hottest bets. Investors are pouring billions into everything from power grids and data centers to roads and airports, fueling the AI boom and energy transition while upgrading aging assets. Investor assets in private infrastructure funds have soared to $1.5 trillion in 2024 from $500 billion in 2016, according to McKinsey. Meet some of the names you should know as the space continues to gain momentum. The data center industry has become a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity that has transfixed Wall Street. Aman Mittal, a managing director at Moelis & Company, is helping the storied advisory firm establish itself as a leading player in the mergers and acquisitions, investments, and debt deals that are fast shaping the sector. The 35-year-old advised the data center company Core Scientific on its announced $9 billion sale to CoreWeave and worked with Apollo on its deal to buy a majority stake in the data center developer and operator Stream Data Centers. He also helped another large data center platform, Prime Data Centers, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake in it to institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen. And that was just over the summer. In the past three years, Mittal has worked on more than 15 data center-related transactions with a total deal value exceeding $25 billion. Mittal got his start studying electronics and communications engineering in his home country of India before getting an MBA at the NYU Stern School of Business. He began as an analyst at Bain & Company in technology, media, and telecom, before moving to Evercore to advise in those sectors. In 2022, he joined Moelis to help lead its growing practice in the booming digital infrastructure space, particularly data center deals. Mittal said that he keeps his focus straightforward: knowing his clients and anticipating the solutions that match their business needs. "The idea is that you need to know what is important to the company and the company needs to feel comfortable about sharing their constantly changing objectives with you," Mittal said. "My position is like: this is what you're doing, and this could become better if you do this also." Mittal starts his day by jotting down three Post-it notes outlining his priorities. He ends every day with a call, "that is not related to my immediate tasks." "I'll just reach out to someone I have not talked to in three months or six months," Mittal said. "To reconnect with potential possibilities." A demanding career on Wall Street requires resilience, a quality that Arting Chang had mastered before she landed in the industry. As an eighth grader, her father's investment banking job moved her and her family from Taiwan to California. Before that, her family had lived in Shanghai and Tokyo. The frequent moves taught her to be adaptable in a way that helped her career. "I think I have a way of talking to myself very kindly and giving myself encouragement to be like ‚Äî you know how to do this, you've done this, you've been in more chaotic environments," she said. Now a vice president at Advent International, a private equity firm that manages $94 billion, Chang has emerged as a young star in its industrials team. She helped lead Advent's $1 billion acquisition of LayerZero Power Systems, a producer of data-center power equipment, earlier this year. Chang co-launched Advent's first dedicated data-center sourcing effort. The team built a bottom-up model of how growth would unfold, assembled a bench of executives, and networked with regional, niche bankers so that they'd come to her when deals arose. The introduction to LayerZero came through a relationship at Citizens Bank, months before a formal sale process began. Chang said she's a "big proponent of always getting on the ground." At AEA Investors, where she worked before Advent, she spent a year in Dallas helping prepare retailer At Home for its IPO. While digging into LayerZero, time at the Ohio headquarters revealed an opportunity for an expansion that became central to the deal. She still visits monthly for board meetings. Off the clock, Chang is a regular at Barry's Bootcamp, a restaurant lover, and a proud collector of 50-plus statement blazers. She sits on the steering committee for Advent's LGBTQ+ employee resource group and is the youngest board member of Out for Undergrad, a nonprofit that helps LGBTQ+ college students explore careers in finance and other competitive industries. When Mohini Chakravorty joined Blackstone Infrastructure in 2019, the team had around $5 billion in assets and only a handful of staff. Five years later, a team of around 100 manages $64 billion ‚Äî and she's had a front-row seat to explosive growth that has shaped her career. "It's been just a wild ride. It's really rare to see that kind of growth and that kind of rapid evolution," Chakravorty said. Chakravorty's first stop after Wharton was Bank of America, where she followed her older brother into investment banking. It wasn't surprising to anyone, as he'd always been a role model, she said, but she quickly found herself drawn more to private equity. Since joining Blackstone, Chakravorty has contributed to more than $16 billion in transactions across the infrastructure sector. One key moment came when she helped acquire a stake in Phoenix Tower International in 2022, the biggest private cellphone tower platform in Europe and the Americas. Chakravorty credits much of her success to keeping a positive attitude, even when making rapid and stressful judgment calls. She remembers when, minutes before a key meeting, her team identified a downside scenario they needed to review. Even with the time crunch, Chakravorty helped create a straightforward analytical approach to quantify the potential problem, which became the focus of the discussion. The same composure came into play when she helped acquire the largest yacht and marina servicing company, Safe Harbor Marinas, for $5.6 billion on a "very accelerated" timeline earlier this year. Much of Chakravorty's job involves relationship-building, which comes easily since she's a natural extrovert. Chakravorty also focuses on showing other young women who are interested in investing that there's room for them in the profession. "The advice that I tell myself and give to young women is to run towards what scares you. Facing challenges head-on helps you break down some of those roadblocks," she said. Benson Kane was in seventh grade in Weston, Connecticut, when the 2008 financial crisis hit, and he remembers being fascinated by the underpinnings of the unfolding calamity. "All of a sudden, this big event happened and I was interested in understanding what this was and how it had such a massive impact on the broader world," Kane said. Throughout middle and high school, his interest in debt and credit persisted. He avidly followed Elliott Investment Management's efforts in the news to collect on its investment in Argentine bonds that the country had defaulted on. After studying finance at Brigham Young University, Kane joined Angelo Gordon in 2020, which became part of TPG in 2023. He's now a vice president on its credit solutions team. The group focuses on extending debt and providing other capital solutions to companies that often face financial distress or complex business challenges. Kane focuses on companies in the chemicals and materials manufacturing sectors, as well as those involved in energy infrastructure, including power plants and pipelines. "I love complex problems, trying to figure them out," Kane said. In 2023, for instance, Kane, 29, worked on a $1 billion-plus loan provided to Trinseo, a materials company, funded by TPG, Oaktree Capital, and Apollo. "We were able to provide liquidity to a company in need of it and that wasn't able to get it from other sources, and we were able to preserve the business," Kane said, explaining that the company and others like it in the materials and chemicals industries had been hit by a downturn in demand post-pandemic. Kane is excelling in a newer world of distressed credit where, he said, there is often a more congenial relationship between lenders and borrowers. "We're working in a much more collaborative fashion, trying to be solutions providers, a little bit less sharp-elbowed maybe than the past," Kane said. "Relationships matter, reputations matter. People want to work with people that are good to work with in terms of company." The growth of private markets has reshaped Wall Street, turning private equity, credit, and secondaries into some of the most dynamic parts of finance. Behind the growth is a new generation of talent driving major buyouts, capital raises, and fund innovations. Meet the rising stars helping define the strategies and structures that will shape how trillions of dollars flow through global markets. Private credit's first iteration was all about lending to companies that do not have access to traditional bank financing. Now, private credit 2.0 ‚Äî the shift to customizing loans for investment-grade companies ‚Äî is on the rise, and Madelaine O'Connell is helping write the playbook. O'Connell is a managing director in HPS' $25 billion private high-grade business. Her team designs creative alternatives to issuing a plain-vanilla bond, such as helping a Fortune 500 company finance a new project through a joint venture ‚Äî keeping the debt off its balance sheet while giving investors, like insurers, a steady return. She thinks the industry has "just scratched the surface" of structuring bespoke deals that can't be found in the public bond market, she told Business Insider. "Every transaction we work on has nuances that have definitely pushed me personally to think outside the box," she said. O'Connell began her career at Citi in the securitized products division before Goldman Sachs tapped her and her then-boss to help rebuild its private placement franchise, which had been dormant since the 1990s. She said the effort was like a "de-risked startup," integrating with investment-banking teams, winning trust deal by deal, and building relationships on the buy side. She led the team from 2020, and by the time she left in 2024, it was lending to fund managers and lending against esoteric assets like media rights. They were also early to financing data centers ‚Äî something that was cutting-edge at the time, she said. The explosive growth in private credit was "very much the thesis" behind her move to HPS, which the $12.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock acquired in July, giving her team even more firepower. A lifelong dancer, O'Connell began teaching fitness classes at Boston College and even led 6 a.m. Pilates sessions while working as an investment banker. She still teaches online occasionally when travel allows. "Working out is just as important to my mental health as it is to my physical health," she said. In Knut Kirchhoff's nine years of working in private credit, the segment has grown to become one of the hottest places for young job seekers in finance. As a leader of the analyst and associate recruiting efforts for Blackstone's Credit and Insurance team, he's seen this transformation firsthand. At a Georgetown recruiting event that drew more than 100 students, Kirchoff had nonstop conversations about private credit and "lost my voice by the end of the night," he said. A Norwegian who attended Boston University for college, Kirchoff began his career on Citi's leveraged finance team. He quickly became fascinated with the world of debt, and after two years, he realized he wanted to move to the buy side. His interest was piqued by a few successful deals that Blackstone Credit (then GSO) did with Citi during a period of energy price volatility in 2015. When he joined Blackstone in 2016, the firm's credit unit had roughly $80 billion in assets. It has since swelled to over $400 billion, becoming the firm's largest and fastest-growing business. "The first deal I did was $125 million," Kirchoff said. "Now we're doing billion-dollar deals almost every single week." Last year, Kirchoff helped create the professional services vertical, lending to consulting and accounting firms. The team, which Kirchoff now leads, has made over $10 billion in credit investments. The deal that catapulted his career occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kirchoff was tapped to work on lending to cruise lines. As some deals were launching, the leading managing director went on paternity leave, leaving Kirchoff to step into a leadership position. "I had been promoted four months earlier and was working from home, and now had the responsibility of a team under me," Kirchoff said. He led diligence on the deal and brought it through the investment committee. Blackstone's purchase of the cruise line debt "ended up being a really good transaction for the firm," Kirchoff said. Patrick Kearney has developed a specialty for buying airlines and packaging companies during his eight years at Apollo. It's a product of Apollo's "generalist" model, the principal told Business Insider, which has new hires rotate through different business units and industries. His first deal was the 2018 acquisition of Sun Country Airlines, and aviation has been a constant since. Airline ownership allows Kearney to flex his business-building muscles ‚Äî navigating Trump's tariffs, investing in more aircraft, and modernizing operations at a portfolio company, Atlas Air. "There's never a dull day when you own an airline in terms of the problems that you have to solve," he said. And even though he's based in the firm's flagship private equity arm, he still works closely with Apollo's ground-breaking credit team. "We don't have any walls at Apollo," he said about the firm he joined in 2017 after spending two years at Moelis & Company. Credit and equity teams share research, insights, expertise, and even deals. The credit side can help make equity investments possible when financing is tight, such as with the firm's 2022 $5.2 billion take-private of cargo airline Atlas Air, Kearney said. "We financed Atlas when the financing markets, frankly, were not open," Kearney said. Kearney's work on the 2022 acquisition of Novolex and the 2025 combination with Pactiv, both food packaging businesses, is another example of his ability to grow companies. When Kearney and his team initially considered Novolex, they evaluated what the combined business would look like with Pactiv, given their complementary products. It didn't pan out, but at the end of last year, Novolex announced it would acquire Pactiv, with the deal expected to close this year. "It's rare to have something like that in your original investment committee dialogue and actually have it come to fruition," Kearney said. The first deal of Alex Park's career was far from the sleek software buyouts he's versed in now ‚Äî it was a Chapter 11 bankruptcy for a school bus company that he happened to use as a kid. "Buses were stolen out of the parking lot in Staten Island, and I actually had to work with the local police force to try and locate these buses," he laughed. That experience sparked his interest in working in credit: "I wanted to see what a healthy and growing company looked like." That realization carried Park from restructuring at Rothschild to Ares Management, and ultimately to Thoma Bravo, where he joined the credit team shortly after its inception in 2019. Now a principal, he's helped the credit team invest more than $8 billion across about 100 transactions. Miami-based Park is "incredibly proud" of sourcing and leading financing for Blackstone's acquisition of Irth Solutions in 2021 and Warburg Pincus' financing of Softeon in 2023 ‚Äî two "best in class" SaaS companies, he said. "Everyone wants to lead deals for these sponsors," Park said. While Thoma Bravo's credit team has been well established, it's "still relatively new" compared to some players, he noted. Outside of investing, Park has played a key role in fundraising, including helping to complete the $3.6 billion Credit Fund III, the platform's largest pool of capital to date, in early 2025. He credits his career success to a "chip on my shoulder" work ethic, a love of building relationships, and especially a commitment to mentorship. In fact, a banker from Rothschild, Brendan Fox, who took him "under his wing," is on his team at Thoma. He said a number of colleagues "played such a formative role in shaping me that I always wanted to pay that forward going forward." Today, Park leads recruiting for the credit team, creating an "open-door" culture for juniors: "I want you to feel comfortable asking me anything and everything ‚Äî no dumb questions." When Joe Slevin started specializing in the resale market of private equity stakes in 2015, it was a niche that "barely existed," he told Business Insider. Now, secondary deals are on the rise ‚Äî with a record $103 billion worth of activity completed globally in the first six months of 2025, according to Jefferies. UK-native Slevin started his career as a JPMorgan investment banker in London, then sought "an area of finance where there was huge growth potential," that was "off the beaten path." He joined Coller Capital, a pioneer in what was then the nascent secondaries industry. After three years on the buy side, Slevin returned to banking to advise investors on secondary transactions at PJT Partners and Guggenheim Partners because, he said, he preferred being "at the center of things between all the stakeholders in a transaction." He said his time on the buy side made him a better advisor since he had to bring "extremely nuanced" deals through investment committees. In 2021, he joined Jefferies to cofound their Private Capital Advisory team, which now has more than 120 members and advises investors on selling some of their private portfolios to other investors and fund operators on spinning out select assets into new funds. In the first half of this year, the PCA team advised on over $31 billion in secondary transactions. Slevin focuses on deals led by private equity or credit operators, recently working with ONCAP, Gryphon Partners, and Trinity Ventures. The most well-known version of this is a continuation fund, which is set up to buy one or more assets they already own ‚Äî giving liquidity to investors who need it while continuing to wring returns out of assets. This segment of the industry has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, as private equity distributions have fallen short of expectations. Earlier this year, Slevin moved to Los Angeles from New York to expand his team's geographic reach, focusing on West Coast private equity and venture capital operators. About four years ago, Josef Menasche was working at a boutique secondaries firm on a deal alongside Goldman Sachs bankers. He came away convinced that his industry, which deals in sales of private fund stakes, was headed for change. "My whole thesis was big banks are going to dominate this space eventually," he said. So he called Goldman and said, "Hey, you should just hire me because we already had a great working dynamic on this deal. Wouldn't it be better if we were actually working together?" He joined the bank's secondaries business at the end of 2021 and today is a managing director and global cohead of secondaries advisory. He said 2025 has been a turning point, following several years of caution among investors regarding capital commitments. "The level of creativity that we've seen in 2025 has been really, really exciting to work with," he said ‚Äî a sign that the market is picking up. His team has executed transactions across infrastructure, real estate, private equity, and venture capital. The highlights include a $3.1 billion single-asset continuation vehicle ‚Äî allowing a private equity firm to extend its investment in a company ‚Äî with New Mountain Capital for Real Chemistry. "Half of it was providing the distribution to original investors, half was actually primary capital for future M&A, which is pretty unusual," he said. "The fact that they're willing to put so much fresh money into the new M&A through another business is pretty unusual. It's a general sign of people feeling good about the world." His team has just over a dozen bankers, compared with about 150 at its largest competitor, he said. Clients often tell him: "You give us very different advice to other bankers, and it seems to work out well for us." Menasche studied chemistry at Cambridge. He found the lab environment too slow and shifted into finance. Early experience at secondaries-focused boutique Campbell Lutyens gave him a foothold in the industry. "I think fundamentally, if you just pick what you're interested in, you will do well," he said. ‚Äã‚ÄãReading the tea leaves of geopolitics, policy, and markets has never been more important. These rising macro minds spend their days researching and understanding global risks and opportunities ‚Äî whether to arm clients with insights for critical decisions or to pull the trigger on trades themselves. Citadel portfolio manager Adam Theriault-Shay's obsession with digging into obscure corners of global markets and conducting on-the-ground research to get satisfying answers sets him apart in a world fixated on data and artificial intelligence. It has also helped him earn a rates-and-currencies trading book of more than $1 billion before the age of 30, managing risk in line with that of macro hedge fund veterans. As a math student at MIT, Theriault-Shay was thorough and never took the easy way out, according to professor Bjorn Poonen. Theriault-Shay once encountered a confusing passage in the class textbook, written by one of the world's most renowned mathematicians. Poonen said that while most students might have skipped over it, he flagged it ‚Äî and with good reason, it turned out: "There was an error in the book!" He applied to intern at quant hedge fund D.E. Shaw and stood out among an "extremely competitive applicant pool," one person who interviewed him said. After graduating in 2019, he started at Shaw full-time in its macro unit, researching and trading currencies and emerging-market rates, especially in Asia. "He has this inner, deep desire to figure out the truth and figure out what's really going on in markets," a former colleague said, adding that Theriault-Shay would get almost "giddy" about esoteric aspects of the market. Theriault-Shay had a penchant for disappearing down rabbit holes in individual countries and companies and resurfacing with insights sharp enough to nudge the group's thinking on some of its currency positions ‚Äî an impressive feat for a junior, they said. Theriault-Shay was poached in 2021 by Citadel, joining as an associate PM in the group run by vaunted bond basis trader Jon Tipermas. Within two years, he was promoted to portfolio manager and now runs a small team. Theriault-Shay thrives on shoe-leather research, traveling to Asia multiple times a year to inform his trades. "He loves being on the ground and getting a sense of the local flavor and talking to people in Asia about markets," the former colleague said. Citadel declined to comment or make Theriault-Shay available for an interview. Just days into her new role as chief of staff to Larry Fink, Catherine Kress is already feeling the faster pace, she told Business Insider. The post puts her at the center of the world's largest asset manager ‚Äî gatekeeper to BlackRock's cofounder and CEO, and offers what excites her most: "unparalleled exposure" to global business leaders and policymakers. Kress long knew she wanted a career at the "intersection of geopolitics, policy, economies, and markets." Until recently, she was BlackRock's head of geopolitics and research, unpacking issues from the AI race to trade protectionism and sharing them at conferences, boardrooms, and in meetings with major C-suite leaders. She helped turn the $12.5 trillion firm's first geopolitics team, led by former US national security advisor Tom Donilon, into a permanent fixture within the BlackRock Investment Institute. When she applied to be Donilon's advisor, she called it a "dream job" ‚Äî even asking her husband to confirm the posting was real. Demand for her team's insights surged after the COVID pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as clients "realized national security and resilience concerns were increasingly taking priority or at least on par with pure cost efficiency and market objectives," she said. A psychology and anthropology major at the University of Notre Dame, she conducted fieldwork in Sierra Leone and pursued graduate research in Angola's energy sector at Oxford as a Clarendon scholar. She thought she might pursue a Ph.D. until a mentor urged her to apply her work in the private sector. Before joining BlackRock in 2018, she worked closely with Ian Bremmer, the political scientist and the founder of Eurasia Group, where she led training sessions on integrating geopolitical risk thinking with investing. She credits academia with teaching her to ground every view in facts, "never shooting from the hip," and for instilling in her the confidence to brief everyone from investors to world leaders. Now, as Fink's chief of staff and a mother to two young boys, she's entering what she calls the "culmination" of her career. A decade ago, while living in New Delhi and before he had ever set foot in the US, Nikunj Jain spent his free time Googling which colleges offered the best computer science programs. Now, after graduating from the University of California-Berkeley in two and a half years, he's the head of Asia research for Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund with $98 billion. Jain credits his rapid journey to the upper echelon of finance to a mix of persistence, strong familial support, and internal mentors, including the firm's co-chief investment officer, Karen Karniol-Tambour. From New York, Jain helps Bridgewater steer its coverage of all things Asia, where its flagship fund trades securities and its China-based funds have become a go-to investment for the country's elite. It's the type of day-to-day excitement and challenge that drew the 27-year-old to finance in the first place. After graduating, he studied machine learning, taught undergraduates math, interned for Apple, and worked for the Department of Defense, but found the Bay Area "a little slower than I would have liked." A friend suggested quantitative finance, leading him to apply to Bridgewater, the systematic investment manager founded 50 years ago by billionaire Ray Dalio, which has returned 26.4% in its flagship fund through September this year. He spent time focused on equities and fixed income, but in his current role, geography is the only boundary. His 15- to 20-person team, depending on the subject matter of the day, synthesizes activities across Asia into trading signals for Bridgewater's strategies. Jain sees macro investing as the culmination of answering "one of the toughest intellectual challenges." Asian markets, in particular, can be a puzzle thanks to relatively less reliable economic data. Jain's team stays on top of the latest shifts with a blend of quantitative know-how and "old-school macro investing practices," such as on-the-ground research and knowledge. Bridgewater has offices in Singapore and China, and Jain tries to visit the continent often. Seven years in, Jain says he has found a home in the industry: "I love the world of investing." From running multibillion-dollar books to navigating volatile markets, these young standouts are central to how their firms make money and manage risk. At hedge funds specifically, the battle for talent remains fierce. Some declined to make their stars available for interviews. When COVID shut down the world in 2020 and Manhattan offices emptied as workers isolated at home, distressed credit trader Jake Woodson was on a skeleton crew that never left Goldman Sachs' trading floor. It felt unusual at the time, but having the opportunity to navigate once-in-a-lifetime swings in airlines, retailers, and car-rental companies was "a blessing in disguise," says Woodson. "You can end up learning in a few weeks, or a couple months, more than in certain years," Woodson said. A couple of years later, he was promoted to his current role as head of US distressed credit trading. Shortly after, he navigated the 2023 banking crisis, generating tens of millions in profits for the firm ‚Äî a seminal moment in his career. Woodson's unlikely path started at the University of British Columbia ‚Äî hardly a recruiting target for US investment banks. There, he pulled off an impressive feat: he became the first varsity football player ‚Äî and second athlete ever ‚Äî admitted to the school's Portfolio Management Foundation, an intensive training program founded in the 1980s, in which a select group of students help manage a multimillion-dollar endowment. He started full-time at Goldman in 2014 in investment-grade credit, though he knew he eventually wanted to trade riskier securities. A year later, he jumped at an opportunity to work in junk bonds under Thomas Malafronte, who's now a PM at Millennium. Woodson earned a reputation as a reliable, insightful, and generous trading partner. He's "trustworthy and honest" and "people love working for and with him," one buy-side client said. "You'd rather be respected than liked, but he does things the right way and is in a special category where he's both," said Malafronte. Woodson presses his team of around 10, including traders and researchers, not just to identify mispricings, but to figure out what's behind the inefficiency ‚Äî a forced seller or herd bias against a business model or company? (Goldman declined to comment on team head count.) "When things seem too obvious, they probably are," he added. Under his leadership, Goldman's US distressed team has ranked third in industry league tables for the past two years and is ranked No. 2 so far in 2025, according to Vali Analytics. Ilya Katz, the new portfolio manager for Citadel's Ashler Capital unit, has spent his short career investing for several billionaires. Katz, who has two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, started at Steve Cohen's Point72 in 2016. He worked as an analyst for a team trading healthcare stocks ‚Äî including companies that manufacture medical devices ‚Äî that managed a book of more than $2 billion, according to his LinkedIn profile. He joined Cowen as the firm's head of healthcare data in 2019, prior to TD Bank's acquisition of the New York-based financial services company. He then rejoined the buy side, trading for London billionaires Ian Wace and Paul Marshall at their self-named megafund. There, Katz worked under healthcare portfolio manager Vijay Shankaran, who managed money for the firm's Eureka fund, a person familiar with the asset manager told Business Insider. He started as an analyst, blending quantitative tools with fundamental research to find opportunities in therapeutics and medical technology companies. He was given his own sleeve of capital to run under Shankaran, this person said, managing some of Marshall Wace's billions before being poached by Ken Griffin at the end of last year. Now at Ashler, Citadel's equities unit, his pod naturally focuses on the healthcare space, where he's been able to lean on his science background: He has a master's in biotechnology and an undergraduate degree from Penn's competitive Wharton program in economics. Even in the ultra-competitive world of multistrategy hedge funds, where every portfolio manager and analyst seemingly has an Ivy League degree and a sterling r√©sum√©, Katz stands out. One word an Ashler colleague used to describe the under-30 trader: savant. Christian Woo likens his work to building a Formula 1 car engine: The technology team provides the raw materials, the traders are the drivers, and his job is designing the machinery that makes everything run faster. At Bank of America, Woo is a managing director and who leads the credit systematic trading strategies team. They conduct quantitative research and develop a credit market-making algorithm, which handles smaller electronic inquiries and spreads risk from big client orders. Since joining in 2019, Woo has helped grow the bank's algorithm-based electronic trading volume in investment-grade credit fivefold. He said that it's been gratifying to see everyone's work "compound" as it continues to expand, especially since he was involved from the very beginning. Woo's team designs the algorithms that enable traders to quote bonds autonomously, manage risk after large portfolio trades, and process thousands of trades simultaneously ‚Äî a leap from just a few years ago. That progress also reflects a broader market trend as Woo points out: Today, more than half of all corporate bond trading is done electronically, up from roughly 20% a decade ago. Honolulu isn't a traditional Wall Street launchpad, but his father, a wealth manager, exposed Woo to markets early, bringing him along to meet with clients across the Hawaiian islands. After starting on Citi's credit trading desk in 2015 in New York City, where he's based, he moved to Bank of America in 2019 and dove into electronic credit trading. He credits his drive to his mother, a nurse and healthcare worker who threw herself into every endeavor ‚Äî including her passions such as pickleball and her stint in entrepreneurship. "She goes all in on things and commits very hard, and it's something I find that I do, as well," he said. He approaches his work the same way: tackling problems with curiosity and persistence. A mantra from Einstein has guided his career: "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." In the cutthroat world of hedge funds, especially at the multistrategy giants that have come to rule the industry, there's not much upside for portfolio managers to be a sounding board for others. Colleagues, much less people at rival funds, can be slow to share wisdom or hacks for fear of losing their own edge. Everyone is, more or less, competing against everyone else at all times. It's one of the reasons John Huh stands out. Huh, a portfolio manager at $14 billion Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, is a talented investor and a strong mentor for younger colleagues, according to those who know him. After graduating from New York University's Stern School of Business in 2012, he worked at Wells Fargo in equity research and then moved to the buy side in 2015. He joined Point72 in 2016, when it was trading its founder's cash and before it officially reopened to outside investors. He worked as an analyst covering stocks in the telecommunications, media, technology, and internet sectors through the firm's 2018 relaunch, and left the following year to join Schonfeld. Huh worked under Simon Silverston as an associate portfolio manager before being promoted at the end of last year to run his own team. Still specializing in technology, media, and telecommunications, Huh is a go-to source for many young stockpickers at the firm with questions or problems, according to one individual who works at the New York-based manager. Wall Street is constantly looking for an edge, which means firms are always racing to create new products and tools that give them ‚Äî and their clients ‚Äî an advantage. Whether it's reimagining how bonds are traded or bringing complex products like CLOs and tokenized funds to a broader investor base, these rising stars show how fresh ideas can quickly scale into breakthroughs that reshape markets. Sarah Naylor wanted to be in the room where decisions were made. After six years in investment-grade bond sales at big banks, she knew that room was usually reserved for senior staff. So when Citadel Securities tapped her in 2024 to help launch its corporate bond trading business, she jumped at what she called a "once-in-a-career" opportunity. Her readiness for that leap traces back to a turning point a few years in at Citigroup, which she joined in 2016 after graduating from Colgate. A senior salesman covering a major asset manager departed, and Naylor was asked to temporarily oversee the account. Lacking experience, she compensated with preparation ‚Äî studying the client's portfolio and grilling traders for insights. Citi's standing improved, and she kept the account permanently. The episode shaped her philosophy to be an "internal expert" on her client. "I try to hold myself to the standard that anytime anyone internally has a question pertaining to my client, I should have the answer," Naylor said. One of her mentors at Citi, Sam Berberian, recruited her to Citadel Securities after he joined as head of credit trading in 2023. She joined the buildout in early 2024 and quickly found herself "in the room," weighing in on key decisions. One objective for the team has been tackling the "gray market," the window when newly announced bonds trade before official issuance. Citadel Securities views that period as critical for clients, but historically inefficient, since banks can't immediately resell the bonds they've issued, and pricing is often fragmented and handled over the phone. Naylor pitched Berberian an idea: a tool that would stream live data and pricing from Citadel Securities. Working across teams, Naylor helped propel that idea to reality this September with the launch of the "Gray Trading Panel" on Bloomberg terminals. The impact has been swift, she said. A large asset manager executed its first gray market trade, block trades increased, and market share ticked up. "I have learned more in the last 18 months than I had in my entire career combined," Naylor said. Jessica Shill didn't know she'd be working with niche CLO ETFs when she took a job with Janus Henderson in August of 2019. But shortly after she joined, that became a focus, bringing a traditionally opaque product for institutions to mainstream investors. Her team has grown to more than 20 people, and she's now a portfolio manager of three ETFs overseeing a combined $24.3 billion in assets. "Launching and management of the ETFs are definitely the keystone moments of my career," Shill said. She recently helped launch and develop the strategy of Janus' first tokenized fund ‚Äî which has gathered nearly $800 million in assets since its June debut ‚Äî and thinks blockchain will help asset management become more efficient. Shill credits her success to her diligence, such as rotating out of a bond as soon as she becomes uncomfortable holding it, and believes that the best choices are often the hardest ones. She's worked through "some pretty turbulent markets," like COVID, and thinks her ability to raise capital and willingness to "grind out sales" during that time helped prove her chops to management. "I am a firm believer in measure twice, cut once. Honestly, at work, it turns into measuring three or four times and cutting once," Shill said about her process for evaluating each bond. "As long as you're never trying to cut your corners, over time, you become confident." Shill, who didn't grow up in a family with Wall Street ties, said finance has been a good fit in part because it's "intellectually stimulating." The Maine native studied at Bryn Mawr College and spent two years at Wells Fargo before joining Janus in Denver. Since she works market hours but lives on Mountain Time, Shill begins her days early and typically has some time after work. In the summer, she'll often go for a bike ride before cooking dinner for herself and her husband and, no matter the season, reading for a bit before going to sleep.Interactive development by Randy Yeip.Corrections: October 6, 2025 ‚Äî An earlier version of this story misstated Joe Slevin's age.

Mumbai: A recent regulatory change proposing banks enter into acquisition financing could potentially disrupt the fast-growing private credit industry in pricing and deal-picking, and over the long term transform the way deals are structured, according to sector experts. The Reserve Bank of India, as part of its Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies released alongside the monetary policy statement on October 1 proposed allowing banks to fund corporate buyouts. At a broader level, the RBI‚Äôs proposal is ‚Äúvery proactive and progressive" and is expected to go a long way in reducing the cost and enhancing availability of capital pools for individuals and corporates, said Bhavdeep Bhatt, chief executive officer of Northern Arc Investments. Private credit growth has been strong in 2025. Total private credit deployment touched $9 billion across 79 deals in the first half of calendar 2025‚Äîa 53% jump from the first half of 2024 and close to three times the value for the latter half of 2024, a report by EY in August noted. The biggest of deals was the $3.1 billion raised by Porteast Investment of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group‚Äîthe biggest onshore private credit transaction in India to date. Indian private credit players include Kotak Alternative Asset Management, 360 One, Avendus Capital, and Edelweiss Funds, among others; international players include Blackrock, Blackstone, KKR, Abudhabi Investment Authority, and several others. A key factor for the growth of the private credit market in India until now has been the RBI‚Äôs restrictions on banks providing acquisition finance, said Geeta Chugh, managing director, sector lead, financial services ratings at S&P Global Ratings. Longer term impactThe proposed entry of banks, with their relatively larger balance sheets and readiness to lend amid muted corporate growth, could potentially result in lower yields, looser terms, and weaker collateral structures. In some cases, enforcing collateral or ensuring debt coverage may be weaker than with traditional bank loans, other experts told Mint. Still, in the short to medium term, the overall impact on private credit funds is expected to be small, given the limited ability and skill sets of banks to fund complex deals and the flexibility at private credit firms on with customisations and value-addition. Private credit funds command superior returns because they offer customised funding structures‚Äîtailored for complexity, risk, scale and quick turnarounds. Bound by tight regulations, banks often lack flexibility and are likely to be limited to larger, simpler, and less risky transactions, said Ashwin Patni, head, wealth management services, Julius Baer. Most takers for private credit deals are mid-market corporates who require a nimble approach. Also Read | Buy now, pay later is surfing the private credit wave "Acquisition financing is just a small slice of the private credit pie, so any minor capital shift toward banks will not impact the broader opportunity set," said Patni. But, the crucial difference could be in how deals are structured with the entry of banks. Cost of fundingBanks with their lower cost of funds will have the advantage of lower pricing, something that private credit funds cannot compete with, experts said, adding that the latter will also then have to look at what value proposition they offer clients. Private credit currently prices at 14-17% IRR, and if banks are permitted to finance acquisitions, they could come in at a materially lower cost‚Äîaround 10‚Äì12% all-in, given their access to low-cost deposits, said Atul Thakkar, executive director, Anand Rathi Investment Banking. Raghunath T, senior portfolio manager at Vivriti Asset Management, believes that this pricing dynamic is sustainable given that investor allocations to private credit have grown regardless of rate or liquidity considerations and driven by consistent outperformance compared to public debt markets. What‚Äôs more is that the deal flow for private credit funds is diversified across sectors, he said, adding that typically, sectors with M&As and extraordinarily high growth seek credit solutions from private credit funds. ‚ÄúToday, a lot of infrastructure platforms across renewable energy, transportation and high-growth segments like electronics manufacturing and logistics are contributing to a large share of the deal flow," Raghunath said. Red flagsDespite the proposed RBI norms expected to open up capital for acquisition financing, some market participants remain sceptical and warn that this comes with a higher risk of bank exposure to certain corporates.

While bank loans would likely carry tighter covenants and security packages compared to private credit, the only risk factor is the need for the central bank to set an overall limit on how much exposure each bank can take on in the private credit segment, said Thakkar of Anand Rathi Investment Banking. Others worry that if banks are allowed to finance acquisitions, it could lead to indirect promoter funding through backdoor loans, and without clear rules, acquisition finance might be misused. Regulators would likely require strict monitoring to ensure funds are not for equity buybacks or share pledges. ‚ÄúThe systemic risk is limited right now because private credit is still a small slice compared to total bank lending," said Vishal Bansal, partner, debt and special situations, EY India. Risks such as asset quality deterioration could emerge if funds loosen standards to win deals or liquidity mismatches crop up if investors want to exit before loans mature, he cautioned. But Nilesh Dhedhi, MD & CEO, Avendus Finance Private Ltd ruled out systemic risks pointing to the fact that private credit assets under management (AUM) is not even 1% of total banking AUM. Besides, he said: ‚ÄúPrivate credit looks at risk‚Ä¶ mostly in micro terms rather than macro terms [as banks do].

Title: Ardian to buy Energia in bet on AI boom - report
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1006/1536997-energia-sale-reports/

French investment firm Ardian is buying one of Ireland's largest energy utilities Energia Group in a deal that values the firm at more than ‚Ç¨2.5 billion, betting on a power supplier poised to serve the surging artificial intelligence industry. Ardian has agreed to buy Energia Group from infrastructure investment firm I Squared Capital. I Squared Capital had acquired the company in 2016 for ‚Ç¨1 billion. The companies said today's deal will have no impact on Energia's customers, employees, partners or suppliers, adding that Energia remains committed to delivering on its strategy and supporting Ireland's sustainable energy future. The deal underscores surging investor interest in data centres that cater to the booming market for AI tools and power their growing adoption across the globe. BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners is nearing a deal to acquire Aligned Data Centers that could value the data centre operator at around $40 billion, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week. Energia represents Ardian's first deal in Ireland. Energia owns onshore wind farms with a capacity of 358 mega watts, supplies gas and electricity to over 898,000 clients and employs 1,117 people, according to its website. It supplies about 17% of the island of Ireland's total electricity requirements and 20% of its total wind power. "Energia's focus remains on transforming Ireland's energy system by deploying renewables and other low carbon solutions at scale, while continuing to deliver secure and affordable energy to our domestic and commercial customers. We are grateful for I Squared‚Äôs support over the past nine years and the strong, future-ready platform we have built together," its CEO Ian Thom said. "Ireland is at a pivotal point, with rapid electrification, growing demand from new technologies, and global investment in digital infrastructure all accelerating. Energia is ideally placed to meet these needs, and with Ardian's long-term backing, we‚Äôre excited to continue scaling our business to help power this next phase of Ireland‚Äôs growth for our customers, partners and employees," he added. "We are proud to be investing in Energia, which marks Ardian‚Äôs first investment in Ireland. The company has demonstrated its market leadership in Ireland and Northern Ireland over many years and has ambitious plans to grow, driven by secured capital projects and increasing energy demand," Juan Angoitia, Ardian's co-head of infrastructure Europe and senior managing director said. "Ardian is a highly experienced investor in essential infrastructure and European utilities. We have been impressed by Energia's strong growth and resilience in the context of a volatile energy market, and look forward to sharing our expertise to further develop its renewable generation portfolio, flexible capacity and enhance the efficiency of the whole company, " he added. ¬© RT√â 2025.

Title: US Govt Shutdown Clouds Economic Outlook: What Keeps Equities Buoyant? Ben Powell Explains

The ongoing US government shutdown has so far been overshadowed by the ‚ÄúAI megaforce,‚Äù which continues to provide huge tailwinds for equities, said Ben Powell, Chief Investment Strategist for the Middle East and Asia-Pacific at BlackRock. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to say how long this will persist. Sometimes it lasts longer than a week,‚Äù Powell told NDTV Profit in an interaction, adding that economists are ‚Äúflying blind‚Äù without the usual flow of data. ‚ÄúLast Friday should have been weekly initial jobless claims numbers, job reports data, nonfarm payrolls data‚Äî but we did not have any numbers. The implication is that it makes life difficult for all of us, and critically for the US Federal Reserve. The Fed no longer has access to cutting-edge data,‚Äù he said. Powell noted that the lack of updates was "not at all helpful for people trying to assess the economic outlook." The US government shut down after President Donald Trump and Congress failed to reach a funding agreement by Oct.1 deadline, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees facing furloughs and forcing many offices to close. During a shutdown, federal agencies cannot spend money beyond essential emergencies, meaning all ‚Äúnonessential‚Äù functions are suspended until Congress restores funding. The disruption has already delayed the release of payroll data, deepening uncertainty around the economic outlook. Still, swap traders remain confident that the Federal Reserve will push ahead with another quarter-point interest rate cut in October, according to Bloomberg report. Meanwhile, the US government shutdown continued with unions representing hundreds of thousands of federal workers asking a judge to immediately block any mass firings by the Trump administration, the report further added. On the other hand, gold rose to another record ‚Äî closing in on the $4,000 an ounce mark ‚Äî as the US Federal government shutdown dragged on. "Rates traders are still pricing in a quarter-point cut for the end of the month, which will benefit gold further as it doesn‚Äôt pay interest," Bloomberg report added.

Title: India Well-Positioned For Equity Upside; Bitcoin, Gold Strong Hedge, Says BlackRock's Ben Powell

At a time when global investors have been cautious, India's equity market stands out as one of the most promising opportunities for investors in the coming quarters, according to Ben Powell, Chief Investment Strategist for the Middle East and Asia-Pacific at BlackRock. ‚ÄúIndia has an important part to play in portfolios going forward,‚Äù Powell said, adding that the country‚Äôs macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong despite headwinds from global trade dynamics. ‚ÄúIt has had a few quarters buffeted by U.S. trade dynamics. Looking forward, I am optimistic about Indian equities. There seems to be a general lack of enthusiasm from global investors, and I think that presents opportunities for us as investors to pick our spots,‚Äù he said. Powell added that India's macro environment looks good while the economy is supported by low inflation and the room for the Reserve Bank of India to issue further rate cuts. "The Indian economy continues to be resilient from a macro context. Inflation is pretty low, thus giving the RBI room for rate cuts. That‚Äôs a good starting point for Indian equities to do better in the coming quarters,‚Äù he said. Powell's comments on India comes against the backdrop of the US government shutdown and an uncertain macro environment. But despite the immediate headwind linked to the US government shutdown, Powell believes the AI-driven "megaforce" will be supporting the markets. ‚ÄúThis kind of confusion has been overwhelmed by the ongoing AI megaforce, which continues to be a huge tailwind for markets,‚Äù he said, adding that investors should also think about hard assets such as copper, given the energy demands that will come with large-scale AI and electrification trends. Powell went on to talk about portfolio diversification, adding that gold and Bitcoin, which recently touched the $125,000 mark for the first time, could be excellent hedges against ongoing volatility. ‚ÄúCommodities can play a part in a well-diversified portfolio,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHaving a 2% exposure to Bitcoin, for example, could make sense. The same goes for Gold."
