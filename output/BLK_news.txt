We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dogs of the Dow Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against the other dividend stocks. Dividend-focused investors are often drawn to stocks with high yields, shaping their strategies around acquiring such investments. A notable approach is the Dogs of the Dow (DOD) strategy, which involves selecting the 10 highest dividend-yielding stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) each year. This method operates on the belief that these so-called "Dogs" are either undervalued or out of favor. By targeting these stocks, investors hope to benefit from potential price appreciation while also securing a steady stream of dividend income. The strategy is based on the idea that these high-yield stocks are merely temporarily undervalued and are likely to recover shortly. Numerous financial experts have provided detailed explanations of the strategy to help investors develop a thorough understanding of it. Robert R. Johnson, professor of finance at the Heider College of Business at Creighton University, spoke about the Dogs in one of his interviews with Business Insider. Here are some comments from the analyst: “The underlying premise behind the strategy is mean reversion. The [Dogs of the Dow] is based on the theory that stocks can be over or undervalued, but over the long run those that are undervalued will 'revert to the mean.” Dow stocks are typically not inexpensive without reason. These companies rarely face the risk of going out of business, and their high yields often result from falling out of favor. According to a report by Forbes, historically, the Dogs have delivered strong long-term performance, but their recent results have been mixed. While they lagged behind the broader market in 2019, 2020, and 2021, they surged ahead in 2022, only to underperform again in 2023.

Michael O'Higgins found that over a 26-year period, a theoretical portfolio made up of high dividend-yield stocks from the Dow Jones delivered an annualized return of 17.9%. This performance exceeded the Dow Jones Industrial Average's annualized return of 13% during the same timeframe. A study in the International Journal of Trade, Economics, and Finance analyzed various versions of the DOD strategy and found that they consistently outperformed the DJIA on a risk-adjusted basis. The research explored three DOD variations: Dow-10, Dow-5, and the "Small Dogs of the Dow," while incorporating recent market events like the 2001 dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial crisis, and the subsequent recovery. The study revealed that all three strategies delivered better investment performance than the DJIA between 1996 and 2006. Notably, the traditional Dow-10 portfolio achieved a total return of 406.6% during this time, surpassing the DJIA’s return of 355.6%. Despite the strong performance of the Dogs, analysts caution investors to approach this strategy with care. Kevin Simpson, founder and chief investment officer at Capital Wealth Planning, made the following comment in one of his interviews with CNBC: “The idea here is that just because they’re ‘Dogs of the Dow’ — some of them really are dogs — and you have to be careful and selective as a stock picker.” Our Methodology: We began with a pool of 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and identified dividend-paying stocks from this selection. As a majority of the stocks in the index offer dividends, we specifically picked the 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 17. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Even though there is a looming threat of future curbs, some Asian hedge funds are betting big on Chinese tech companies, according to Reuters. Companies such as Xiaomi and Baidu are increasingly favored due to their innovations in artificial intelligence. Global investors may have been holding back because of the US’s ban on advanced chip exports. Yet, many others are optimistic about the opportunities in Chinese firms and the AI products that they are developing. Their valuations are lower than their US peers, and their large language models have been demonstrating rapid advancements.

The US has been tightening its restrictions on China’s access to advanced chips used in AI because of national concerns. As a result, China has been focusing on carving its own path for boosting the appeal and performance of its AI models. This includes relying on open-source technology and developing their own super-fast software and chips. Chinese companies are developing open-source, or open-weight, LLMs. Developers can download them and build on top of them for free without having to obtain stringent licensing requirements from the inventor. “In the last year, we’ve seen the rise of open source Chinese contributions to AI with really strong performance, low cost to serve and high throughput”. In the latest innovations in artificial intelligence technology, China’s leading search engine company Baidu has launched a text-to-image generation tool for its ad clients. The company also plans to release AI glasses early next year as well as inaugurate its robotaxi service outside mainland China. Timothy Wang, chief investment officer at Monolith, predicts China’s homegrown AI-powered products and services are poised to grow in the coming year. Hedge fund manager Sean Ho, CIO of Triata Capital which manages $770 million in assets, said about Chinese advancements in AI: “We are seeing breakthroughs in AI software, such as text-to-video generation and multimodal AI…The high rankings of Chinese AI models on open-source platforms like Hugging Face reflect their ambition to lead globally, a trend that is unlikely to be derailed by ongoing tech conflicts”.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Important Stocks that Jim Cramer is Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where RH (NYSE:RH) stands against the other important stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about. Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the latest market volatility and said using too many AI algorithms, data points and correlations could be useful for short-term traders but for investors, these tools could blur your long-term vision. “I think as investors we're putting on mental shackles if we behave like this. Remember back in my hedge fund, our whole goal was day trading, was to scalp pennies from the flow. That's a lot of risk for not much reward. It's better to zero in on dollars for the big picture. That's what I want you to do.” Jim Cramer said that the market is currently oversold and this happened twice before in 2024. These moments, according to Cramer, proved to be some of the best entry points to pile into stocks in hindsight. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. For this article we watched Jim Cramer's recent programs and listed some of the stocks he commented on. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 39 Discussing home furnishing retailer RH (NYSE:RH) latest quarterly results, Jim Cramer praised the company’s CEO Gary Friedman: “I would tell you that in a market where the worst housing markets in three decades have been pulled off, there’s finally a lot of his European expansion that’s good. In America, it’s been turning well ahead of where I thought it was going to be even last quarter. My hat is off to him. There’s a gigantic short position now, some of it’s set to convert, but Gary bought so much stock, and people just felt he was rolling the dice. But Gary knew his business, and I think he’s a delight. I think he’s a competitor like none other, and congratulations.” RH (NYSE:RH) revenue in the recently reported quarter rose year over year while the company saw a 120.9% surge in adjusted operating income. During the earnings call, management disclosed that RH gained market share by 15-25 basis points in Q3 and expects to achieve another 25-45 basis points in gains during Q4. The housing market remains weak, so how was the company able to pull this off? The company is expanding to new products to support its outlet business and successfully launching new categories for baby, child, and teen products. RH anticipates that their contract, outlet, baby & child, and teen businesses will continue to drive business growth in FY25. Polen U.S. Small Company Growth Strategy stated the following regarding RH (NYSE:RH) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We exited four positions during the quarter, including SiTime, AppFolio, RH (NYSE:RH), Doximity, and Alight. We sold our position in furniture retailer RH due to our concerns over the company’s higher-than-average leverage in an uncertain economic environment. We also see the long-term growth outlook as less clear as the U.S. market matures and international expansion is nascent. We do not believe the valuation reflected this risk and envisioned opportunities for better returns elsewhere.” Overall, RH ranks 10th on our list of the important stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of RH, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: New judge to preside over 1MDB's US$346mil suit against Rosmah
URL: https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/12/19/new-judge-to-preside-over-1mdb039s-us346mil-suit-against-rosmah
Time Published: 2024-12-19T09:44:00Z
Full Content:
Thursday, 19 Dec 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: The US$346mil lawsuit filed by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and 10 other companies against Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, alleging the use of misappropriated 1MDB funds to purchase luxury goods, is now under the jurisdiction of High Court Judge Wan Muhammad Amin Wan Yahya. The development was confirmed by lawyer Villasha Anbalagan, who represents all the plaintiffs, comprising 1MDB and the 10 companies. "Today was the first case management before the new judge, Justice Wan Muhammad Amin Wan Yahya. The court has fixed Feb 7 next year for the parties to update the status of the suit,” she said in a WhatsApp message following the proceedings conducted via Zoom. Last month, High Court Judge Justice Leong Wai Hong, a former partner at Messrs Skrine, recused himself from presiding over the lawsuit after granting Rosmah's application, citing his connection to the law firm. Rosmah’s recusal application raised concerns over a conflict of interest, as Skrine is representing 1MDB in a civil suit filed against her husband, former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, and several 1MDB officials. Before Justice Leong, the case was presided over by High Court Judge Justice Adlin Abdul Majid, who dismissed Rosmah’s initial recusal application on Sept 9, on the grounds stating that she failed to provide evidence of a real danger of bias. ALSO READ: New judge to hear Rosmah’s case However, Justice Adlin’s consequent transfer to the High Court’s Intellectual Property Division, led to Justice Leong taking over the case. The lawsuit, filed on May 9 this year, involves 1MDB and its five subsidiaries-1MDB Energy Holdings Limited, 1MDB Energy Limited, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Limited, Global Diversified Investment Company Limited, and SRC International Sdn Bhd. The five other companies are Affinity Equity International Partners Limited, Alsen Chance Holdings Limited, Blackrock Commodities (Global) Limited, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Limited, and Brightstone Jewellery Limited. The plaintiffs have named Rosmah and a woman identified as Shabnam Naraindas Daswani, also known as Natasha Mirpuri, as the first and second defendants, respectively. They are seeking a court order demanding Rosmah pay US$346,010,489 or an amount deemed appropriate by the court. The plaintiffs are also seeking declarations that the first to sixth plaintiffs hold rightful ownership of the luxury items, which are purportedly in Rosmah’s possession.- Bernama Related stories: New judge to hear Rosmah’s caseRosmah still faces multiple court casesRosmah fails in bid to recuse judge from hearing 1MDB's RM346mil suit against herRespect court's decision to acquit Rosmah, says ZahidRosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Rosmah still faces multiple court casesRosmah fails in bid to recuse judge from hearing 1MDB's RM346mil suit against herRespect court's decision to acquit Rosmah, says ZahidRosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Rosmah fails in bid to recuse judge from hearing 1MDB's RM346mil suit against herRespect court's decision to acquit Rosmah, says ZahidRosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Respect court's decision to acquit Rosmah, says ZahidRosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Rosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Tags / Keywords: 1MDB , Wan Muhammad Amin Wan Yahya , Leong Wai Hong , recusal application , granted , Villasha Anbalagan Report it to us.

Title: What Makes Green Brick Partners (GRBK) the Top Stock for Billionaire David Einhorn?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire David Einhorn. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) stands against the other best stocks to buy according to Billionaire David Einhorn. The markets are broken and getting worse. That’s the stance held by billionaire investor David Einhorn, who insists we are in a secular destruction of the professional asset management community. The sentiments come against one of the longest bull runs that have resulted in valuations in the equity markets getting out of hand. While the S&P 500 is at record highs after a 30% plus gain year to date, Einhorn views the markets as fundamentally broken. Passive investors with no opinion or concern about value have been the main drivers pushing the market higher while shunning underlying fundamentals. According to Einhorn, passive investors increasingly buy into market indexes by default, propping growth stocks at the expense of value stocks. READ ALSO: Billionaire Daniel Sundheim’s Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and Billionaire David Tepper’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading into 2025. Likewise, the billionaire hedge fund manager laments that value investors are increasingly marginalized. “And so effectively instead of the valuation becoming the signal, the valuation people were just noise and everybody else is sort of the signal. And this is why I think we have a structurally dysfunctional market, a bit of a broken market, and essentially a perpetual erosion of value as a strategy, as you would,” Einhorn said in an interview with CNBC. The sentiments underline the growing concerns that value stocks are becoming increasingly cheaper and cheaper relative to their underlying fundamentals. That’s in part because investors are turning their attention to indexes and growth stocks, resulting in overstretched valuations. Increased focus on growth stocks at the expense of value stocks has resulted in one of the most expensive stock markets in decades. Amid the premium valuations, David Einhorn insists there is still some value to unlock by focusing on value stocks trading at discounted valuations. By focusing on value investments, Einhorn has generated strong long-term returns through Greenlight Capital, the hedge fund he founded in 1996 with $900,000 from family and friends. Likewise, Greenlight Capital rose to prominence at the height of the financial crisis, as Einhorn sensed a window of opportunity to generate some returns by shorting the stock of Lehman brothers. Similarly, it was on the news in 2002 as it shorted Allied Capital, a transaction that was validated in 2002 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Since 1996, Greenlight Capital has averaged 13.1% in annual returns compared to 9.5% gains for the S&P 500. The outperformance comes from Einhorn emphasizing the balancing of long- and short-term exposure in investments. Likewise, he advocates monitoring industry risks and obtaining insurance against foreseeable macro threats. Additionally, stock picking has always been essential as one of Einhorn's key investment strategies of integrating considerable picture awareness into successful portfolio management strategies. Diversification as one of the ways of spreading risks is also Einhorn’s key investment strategies. “Having my eyes open to the big picture doesn’t mean abandoning stock picking, but it does mean managing the long-short exposure ratio more actively, worrying about what may be brewing in certain industries, and, when appropriate, buying some just-in-case insurance for foreseeable macro risks even if they are hard to time,” Einhorn said. To make the list of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire David Einhorn, we scanned Greenlight Capital’s investment portfolio. We then settled on the hedge fund’s largest holdings analyzing why they stand out and the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in them. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on Greenlight Capital's stake value. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Title: What Makes Alight Inc. (ALIT) a Favorite Stock for Billionaire David Einhorn?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire David Einhorn. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alight Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) stands against the other best stocks to buy according to Billionaire David Einhorn. The markets are broken and getting worse. That’s the stance held by billionaire investor David Einhorn, who insists we are in a secular destruction of the professional asset management community. The sentiments come against one of the longest bull runs that have resulted in valuations in the equity markets getting out of hand. While the S&P 500 is at record highs after a 30% plus gain year to date, Einhorn views the markets as fundamentally broken. Passive investors with no opinion or concern about value have been the main drivers pushing the market higher while shunning underlying fundamentals. According to Einhorn, passive investors increasingly buy into market indexes by default, propping growth stocks at the expense of value stocks. READ ALSO: Billionaire Daniel Sundheim’s Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and Billionaire David Tepper’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading into 2025. Likewise, the billionaire hedge fund manager laments that value investors are increasingly marginalized. “And so effectively instead of the valuation becoming the signal, the valuation people were just noise and everybody else is sort of the signal. And this is why I think we have a structurally dysfunctional market, a bit of a broken market, and essentially a perpetual erosion of value as a strategy, as you would,” Einhorn said in an interview with CNBC. The sentiments underline the growing concerns that value stocks are becoming increasingly cheaper and cheaper relative to their underlying fundamentals. That’s in part because investors are turning their attention to indexes and growth stocks, resulting in overstretched valuations. Increased focus on growth stocks at the expense of value stocks has resulted in one of the most expensive stock markets in decades. Amid the premium valuations, David Einhorn insists there is still some value to unlock by focusing on value stocks trading at discounted valuations. By focusing on value investments, Einhorn has generated strong long-term returns through Greenlight Capital, the hedge fund he founded in 1996 with $900,000 from family and friends. Likewise, Greenlight Capital rose to prominence at the height of the financial crisis, as Einhorn sensed a window of opportunity to generate some returns by shorting the stock of Lehman brothers. Similarly, it was on the news in 2002 as it shorted Allied Capital, a transaction that was validated in 2002 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Since 1996, Greenlight Capital has averaged 13.1% in annual returns compared to 9.5% gains for the S&P 500. The outperformance comes from Einhorn emphasizing the balancing of long- and short-term exposure in investments. Likewise, he advocates monitoring industry risks and obtaining insurance against foreseeable macro threats. Additionally, stock picking has always been essential as one of Einhorn's key investment strategies of integrating considerable picture awareness into successful portfolio management strategies. Diversification as one of the ways of spreading risks is also Einhorn’s key investment strategies. “Having my eyes open to the big picture doesn’t mean abandoning stock picking, but it does mean managing the long-short exposure ratio more actively, worrying about what may be brewing in certain industries, and, when appropriate, buying some just-in-case insurance for foreseeable macro risks even if they are hard to time,” Einhorn said. To make the list of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire David Einhorn, we scanned Greenlight Capital’s investment portfolio. We then settled on the hedge fund’s largest holdings analyzing why they stand out and the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in them. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on Greenlight Capital's stake value. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Greenlight Capital’s Stake Value: $87.66 Million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40 Alight Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) is a technology company that provides cloud-based integrated digital human capital and business solutions. It offers employee well-being, integrated benefits administration, healthcare navigation, and optimization services for cloud platforms. The stock is down by about 16.05% for the year; its sentiments in the market hurt by lower volumes and reduced commercial activity. The winding down of the Hosted business operations has also weighed significantly on its operations. Nevertheless, Alight Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) has moved to strengthen its long-term prospects through cloud migration transformation. Consequently, it is on course to receive $75 million in annualized savings as it focuses on technology-rich benefit services business. Expectations are high that Alight will return to robust growth and could see double-digit annual recurring revenue bookings growth. In its third quarter, revenue was only down by 0.4% to $555 million, as recurring revenue accounted for 91% of the total revenue. On the other hand, contracted revenue was up by 9%. Gross profit increased to $174 million from $166 million delivered last year in the same quarter. However, net loss increased to $44 million from $40 million a year ago. Alight Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) uses AI and machine learning to improve its business. Their AI engine, Alight LumenAI, enhances the Alight Worklife platform, making HR and financial tasks easier. This helps attract and keep clients by predicting patterns and spotting problems early. Alight is a leader in HR technology, benefiting from businesses wanting better employee experiences and streamlined HR processes. Polen U.S. Small Company Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Alight, Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We exited four positions during the quarter, including SiTime, AppFolio, RH, Doximity, and Alight, Inc. (NYSE:ALIT). Our position in Alight, a benefits outsourcing and business process-as-a-service company, was an unsuccessful investment. We decided to move on due to activist pressure that led to a breakup of the business. We were dissatisfied with both the plan and the new standalone business. This culminated with the CEO leaving and uncertainty over the company’s long-term strategic direction. As a result, we felt it was time to move on with better investment ideas in our pipeline.” Overall, ALIT ranks 8th on our list of best stocks to buy according to Billionaire David Einhorn. While we acknowledge the potential of ALIT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Can China Shield the Biggest Uninsured Economy From Floods?
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2024/12/19/805422.htm
Time Published: 2024-12-19T07:51:30Z

The rivers and canals that meander through Hemudu in southeastern China are a vital source of life and community — they provide income for fishermen, an after-school hangout spot for kids, and define the town’s landscape. But when it rains, those waterways become a liability. “This area floods every year,” says Zheng, a long-time resident who lives less than a mile away from a river. Over the past decade and a half, Zheng has seen floodwater repeatedly threaten the ground-floor grocery store that he runs and his home above. But with his income “barely enough to make ends meet” and a grandson to look after, the 60-year-old says relocation isn’t an option. He’s tried but failed to insure his property. “Insurance companies turned us down because they said they’d have no chance to make money,” says Zheng, who asked not to be identified by his full name for fear of reprisal. “No one would take such a risk.” Zheng is one of hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens whose homes and livelihoods have grown more precarious on a rapidly warming planet. Of the 20 most climate-vulnerable regions, 16 are on Chinese soil. Yet the world’s second-largest economy is among the least insured. Only about 10% of Chinese families have a home insurance policy, according to industry estimates. That figure is nearly 90% in the US. China’s government knows it has to do something about that gap, which Swiss Re AG estimates amounted to $273 billion in uninsured losses over the last decade. Officials first started seriously discussing the need to build an insurance system after the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake killed almost 90,000 people and cost an estimated 845 billion yuan ($116 billion). But uptake has been slow, and now climate change is making insurance increasingly unattainable all over the world. Part of the problem is cultural. Many Chinese people have traditionally relied on the government and family members in times of trouble, rather than market-based financial products. “Insurance as a service has not been widely accepted in China,” says Tian Ling, a professor at Wuhan University’s Economics and Management School. “If it’s up to Chinese individuals, very few people would buy catastrophe insurance. That leaves the government no choice but to purchase it for their citizens.” As China’s government faces pressure from the public to show it’s taking steps to protect people from more extreme weather, the nation’s top-down economic management style is colliding with an insurance industry upended by global warming. Officials have started buying policies that cover entire cities and provinces. But local authorities are short on cash, meaning the coverage they can afford is far from what’s needed, even as rising climate risks cause premiums to surge. The decade-long initiative instead risks downplaying how exposed people really are and could even backfire by making it harder to unlock national funds in times of crisis, since these regions are ostensibly covered by the private market. In 2014, the government of Ningbo, which oversees Hemudu, stepped in to buy citywide catastrophe insurance to cover residents like Zheng. A typhoon had wreaked havoc on the city the year before, prompting thousands of people to protest what they saw as insufficient disaster relief. It was one of the first experiments in what would eventually become a nationwide trial covering tens of millions of people in 74 cities and 15 provinces. Unlike Zheng’s failed attempt to buy his own coverage, insurers found the Ningbo government was a client they couldn’t refuse. Participating providers have lowered their prices so the government can afford it because the program is too important to fail, according to people familiar with the arrangement who requested anonymity to discuss private details. Ningbo officials secured a discount of several million yuan on the annual premium for the three-year policy signed in 2021, one of the people said, even though the initial, higher price was based on the city’s growing climate risks calculated using scientific models. Catastrophe insurance is not a lucrative business in Ningbo, according to an executive at PICC Property and Casualty Co. Ltd., a top Chinese insurer that has been part of the program since 2014. “We are not after financial returns,” the executive said, asking not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak to the media. When it comes to serving the government, “the political consideration outweighs anything else.” The Ningbo government and PICC did not respond to questions about the catastrophe insurance program. There is a potential risk for foreign investors backing the Chinese insurers that have been drawn into the programs. PICC has insured catastrophe risks for other provinces including Hebei, Sichuan and Zhejiang. China Life Insurance Co. Ltd., Asia’s biggest insurer, has sold policies to Henan’s government and Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd. is among those supporting the technology hub Shenzhen. All three companies are listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Citigroup Inc. and BlackRock Inc., for example, hold 11% and 6% of PICC’s shares, respectively, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chinese insurers don’t publish detailed profit breakdowns to establish how much these government deals have affected their bottom lines. But their experience in Ningbo in 2015 gives some indication. A consortium led by PICC lost about 56 million yuan due to a string of calamities that year, according to a 2022 analysis done by the insurer, Ningbo University and the local government. The disasters put the program “at risk of bankruptcy,” the authors noted, and “sounded an alarm about its future liabilities.” Yet a growing number of local authorities have struck similar deals with insurers, covering longer periods of time. Wang He, chair of the China Association of Actuaries, has spent years studying the country’s catastrophe insurance problem. The ongoing local trials aren’t sustainable without broader publicly funded mechanisms to support communities after disaster, he says. “Catastrophe risk management falls within the realm of public management,” says Wang. A lack of understanding of that “public nature” in China has led to “a simplistic approach of delegating the job to the insurance industry, which is ill-equipped to shoulder the entire responsibility.” Without a wider protection system, flood victims like Zheng don’t have much recourse. In 2015, after Ningbo started its catastrophe insurance program, the shopkeeper received the first payout of his life. It was 1,000 yuan ($140), even though the water destroyed thousands of yuan worth of bottled water, snacks and everyday essentials such as toothbrushes that he could no longer sell. Located some 150 miles south of Shanghai, Ningbo is a land of historic relics and modern skyscrapers. The 7,000-year-old city owes much of its prosperity to the East China Sea, which once helped Ningbo carve out a spot on the ancient Silk Road and continues to make it a vital trading hub. But the bustling coastal region is also a magnet for natural disasters. The city, home to nearly 10 million people, has been battered by more than 40 storms over the last two decades.While that first payout in 2015 left the insurers who sold the policy in deficit, the government was pleased with the 78 million yuan its residents received. It was almost twice what the government had spent on premiums. The apparent success convinced officials to turn the one-year pilot into a three-year deal. It also turned Ningbo into a shining example of how to deploy catastrophe insurance. Bureaucrats from all over China flocked to the city to learn how to replicate the program at home. But local governments across the country face the same dilemma as Ningbo. They’re trillions of yuan in debt and grappling with an economic slowdown that’s seen China’s government add a sweeping package of stimulus measures. There isn’t enough cash to dole out when disaster strikes; even investing in insurance policies can be a stretch. In 2021, when record rain battered Henan province in central China, killing nearly 400 people, relief spending ballooned to 100 million yuan in a matter of days. China said last year that it will issue 1 trillion yuan in special Treasury bonds to raise funds for future calamities. The central government typically allocates relief funds after an area is hit by destructive weather, but how much trickles down to individual households depends on how local authorities decide the money should be spent. China’s top leaders signaled this month that the nation will increase public borrowing and spending in 2025, but officials have so far been reluctant to directly hand out cash or significantly widen the social safety net. President Xi Jinping has warned against falling into a trap of “welfarism” or “feeding lazy people.” All that makes catastrophe insurance an appealing solution. Still, the policies are pricey because they guard against extreme risks and premiums are rising quickly as reinsurers brace for higher climate damages. The World Bank estimates that China will lose as much as 2.3% of its economic output to weather perils made worse by global warming by the end of this decade. The Ningbo Model — as the insurance program was dubbed by the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily — has been held up as a win-win answer because it enlists the private sector to lessen the financial burden on the state and payments are quicker without having to deal with government red tape. But it also has some less appealing characteristics. Unlike traditional insurance, where payouts are commensurate with actual losses, Ningbo has a “parametric insurance” policy that only delivers compensation when certain thresholds are hit. A home inundated with, say, 7 inches of water might not meet the requirement for a payout if the trigger requires floodwaters to reach 7.8 inches. There’s also a cap on each payment. If their house collapses, a family only stands to receive a maximum payout of 10,000 yuan in a given year. An average house in Ningbo is worth 23,000 yuan per square meter. Since the program started, eligible households have received under 660 yuan each on average, less than 1% of the annual disposable income for the city’s residents. The insurers behind Ningbo’s program have gradually raised the upper limit for payouts, but how far they can go comes back to how much the government can afford in premiums. Ningbo is home to China’s second-busiest cargo port and a petrochemical industry worth $72 billion, helping it to weather China’s economic woes better than many of its neighbors. Even so, local officials rejected an informal proposal to turn its current three-year policy into a five-year arrangement, due in large part to concerns over the government’s ability to commit to the program long term, according to one of the people familiar with the deal. In recent years, the government has also added clauses to the policy that likely wouldn’t pass muster in the West. Starting from 2021, participating insurers are required to channel a chunk of their underwriting profits to Ningbo’s disaster relief fund if the city avoids major damages during their time of service. That, together with the push to raise compensation levels, has forced the insurers to operate on razor-thin margins, even in good years. The practice is “not widely used in commercial markets,” says Christopher Au, climate practice lead for Asia Pacific at insurance broker WTW. But because insurers can tap the relief fund under some circumstances if payouts exceed what they’ve collected in premiums, Au says the arrangement can also potentially help spread out their risk and reduce the volatility of profits and losses from year to year. To keep climate-induced losses at bay, Ningbo has improved its early-warning system for typhoons and moved some residents out of floodplains. But the insurance program is remains a cosmetic addition to the city’s arsenal of protection measures. All told, it offers a maximum coverage of 500 million yuan per year for natural catastrophes. A 2022 study published in Nature estimates that climate change will increase the frequency of super typhoons in Zhejiang province, where Ningbo sits, causing damages as high as 36 billion yuan on average every eight years by the end of the century. The intention was always for government-funded insurance to eventually translate into a more robust private market. In theory, as beneficiaries of the public program grew more familiar with the idea of insurance, they would start buying policies of their own. Yet less than 40% of Ningbo residents surveyed for the 2022 analysis expressed interest in purchasing their own catastrophe insurance. Local governments will likely remain the driving force behind any catastrophe insurance in China for the coming years, says Wang Xujin, executive director of the Insurance Society of China, an industry group. One way to keep premiums manageable for local governments is to scale up the program across the country, spreading risk over vast areas with different climate risks. That’s easier said than done. For one, some poorer local governments simply don’t have the resources to spare. It will also be extremely difficult to convince officials in lower-risk areas to split the bill with those that are more highly exposed, he says. There have been attempts within the central government to set up a national catastrophe insurance program, says Wuhan University’s Tian. But none of the talks have borne fruit. “The discussions always circle back to one issue,” she says. “Who pays?” Wang He, from the China Association of Actuaries, says he’s concluded there’s only one solution. China needs to build a “new national system” that establishes a disaster relief fund for the whole country financed by the central government and other financial instruments such as catastrophe bonds. Until then, Chinese officials are eager to point to the growing insurance program as evidence that they’re taking action. Ningbo’s government has touted it as a “shock absorber” for the economy that will help boost social stability. In Shiqiao, a canal-side suburb of Ningbo, a tailor surnamed Lin is mollified that the state is at least trying to do something about the constant flooding. Like Zheng, she also received an insurance payout of 1,000 yuan after waist-deep water inundated her home in 2022 and soaked a stockpile of new solar-powered water heaters she had planned to sell. “The 1,000 yuan is far from enough to cover my losses,” she says. “But it’s better than nothing.” Photograph: Ningbo has a parametric insurance policy that only delivers compensation when certain thresholds are hit.

Title: How did BlackRock’s ETF acquire the first blockchain municipal bond? – Details

By reducing costs and increasing transaction speed, BlackRock ETF’s adoption marks a pivotal step toward integrating blockchain into mainstream finance In a groundbreaking move, BlackRock’s ETF has purchased the first-ever municipal bond issued through blockchain technology. This marks a significant milestone for both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency industry. This development could reshape how bonds are issued and traded. It showcases blockchain’s growing potential in mainstream financial markets. BlackRock’s Municipal Income Bond ETF acquired the inaugural blockchain-issued bond from the Franklin Township in Ohio. The bond was created using Provenance Blockchain, an open-source platform designed for financial assets. This transaction sets a precedent for leveraging decentralized technology in municipal finance. “This transaction demonstrates the transformative potential of blockchain technology in improving efficiency and transparency in bond issuance,” said Franklin Township Treasurer, Amy Parker. The $15 million municipal bond will fund infrastructure projects within the township, including road and public works upgrades. The bond eliminates intermediaries by using blockchain, reducing issuance costs and increasing transaction speed. The acquisition by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, highlights blockchain’s increasing adoption in institutional finance. Historically, municipal bonds were issued through traditional financial intermediaries, which often added complexity and costs. Blockchain streamlines this process by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions. “Blockchain’s integration into municipal bonds opens the door for a more efficient and secure financial ecosystem,” said Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO. This move could encourage more institutions to explore blockchain for financial instruments, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Adopting blockchain in municipal bonds could redefine the financial landscape, making it more accessible and transparent. Analysts believe this innovation could encourage smaller municipalities to consider blockchain-based bonds, especially since reduced costs make it more viable for low-budget projects. Additionally, investors stand to benefit from greater transparency. Blockchain’s immutable ledger ensures real-time tracking of bond transactions, enhancing accountability. “This technology democratizes access to investments while ensuring greater security and compliance,” noted David Treat, blockchain lead at Accenture. While this transaction is a significant step forward, adopting blockchain-based bonds will require further regulatory clarity and infrastructure development. BlackRock’s involvement provides credibility, signaling that blockchain is now integral to traditional finance rather than being confined to cryptocurrencies. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 As more institutional players recognize blockchain’s value, the divide between conventional finance and crypto continues to narrow. This convergence could pave the way for a future where blockchain underpins a broader range of financial products. In the words of Amy Parker, “This is just the beginning of a new era in finance where technology drives inclusivity and efficiency.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Is RingCentral (RNG) Among Billionaire Paul Singer’s Top Long-Term Stock Picks?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire Paul Singer’s Top 12 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) stands against other Billionaire Paul Singer’s long-term stock picks. The world’s “most feared investor,” Paul Singer, needs no introduction. He has built a reputation on Wall Street for his aggressive and litigious tactics that often generate significant shareholder value. While the 79-year-old billionaire investor is not as flashy or public as other activist investors, he has built a reputation for exploiting weaknesses in various asset classes. Singer’s initial approach to investing was to target companies and even governments while purchasing extremely distressed debt. Therefore, he is best known as a “vulture capitalist” as a result of this tactic. Since then, he has diversified into a number of investment strategies, such as activist investing, portfolio management, and commodity trading. READ ALSO: Billionaire Daniel Sundheim’s Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and Billionaire David Tepper’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading into 2025. Elliott Management is the investment firm that Singer founded in 1977 with $1.3 million. It has grown to become one of the most successful and feared activist hedge funds, with about $19 billion in portfolio value. The firm serves as the management affiliate for hedge funds Elliott Associates L.P and Elliott International Limited. The firm boasts of an annual average return of 14% since inception. Likewise, it has only lost money in the two years since its inception. Elliott Associates is one of the most tracked hedge funds and it employs an activist investment strategy. It also acquires significant though minority stakes in underperforming and distressed companies or assets with a view of unlocking long-term value. In addition, the firm strives to influence company management through strategic initiatives such as cost cuts, management changes and business sales to maximize shareholder value. Singer’s investment firm also purchased distressed sovereign debt from nations like Argentina and Peru in the 1990s. The investments resulted in multi-million dollar repayments following years of legal disputes. In 2016 Singer received a $2.4 billion payout after warring with Argentina’s government over bond payments. A 2018 article in The New Yorker magazine called him a “doomsday investor” for his strategies, including corporate debt plays in companies. Paul Singer’s investment record speaks for itself. His hedge fund, Elliott Management, returned 5.9% in 2022 as the S&P 500 went down 19%. Nevertheless, the firm underperformed in 2023, turning 4.3% compared to a 24% gain for the S&P 500. The underperformance came as Singer remained cautious amid concerns that The US economy was staring at an “extraordinarily dangerous and confusing period”. In addition to the high interest rates, the billionaire hedge fund manager raised concerns about the overstretched valuations and prospects of paltry returns in the real estate and financial services sector. Fast forward, the equity market has continued to edge higher in 2024. The S&P 500 is already up by more than 30%, with valuations in various counters getting out of hand. Nevertheless, macroeconomics shows improvement following the Federal Reserve’s bid to cut interest rates and steer the economy into a soft landing. As the Co-Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chief Investment Officer of Elliott Management, Singer has diversified his holdings as one of the ways of shrugging heightened volatility. Consequently, billionaire Paul Singer’s top 12 long-term stock picks are spread across the basic materials, services and utilities segments. There are also healthcare, energy, and financial services holdings. To make the list of billionaire Paul Singer’s top 12 long-term stock picks, we scanned Elliott Management’s investment portfolio. We then settled on stocks the hedge fund has held for two years and more. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on Elliott Management’s stake value. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NYSE:RNG) offers cloud communications, video meetings, collaboration, and contact center software. Its main product, RingCentral Message Video Phone, unifies communication across different modes. The stock has risen 22.64% this year due to an expanding product lineup and new partnerships. RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) has inked new alliances with Vodafone and Cox Communications. The successful introduction of new products like RingCX and strategic partnerships demonstrate RingCentral’s continued dedication to expansion and innovation in the communications industry. In addition, RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) is also leveraging artificial intelligence to strengthen its product line, attracting more deals on the subscription front. The business unveiled new features for its AI-powered RingCX, such as sophisticated AI-based coaching insights for managers and supervisors and a real-time AI-powered assistant for agents and supervisors. The strategic partnerships and innovations catalyzed RingCentral, Inc.’s (NYSE:RNG) solid third-quarter results on November 7, 2024. Revenue was $609 million, representing a 9% year-over-year increase. The increase came as subscription revenues increased 10%. RingCentral also increased its monthly average recurring revenue by 9% to $2.48 billion. Overall, RNG ranks 7th on our list of Billionaire Paul Singer’s long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of RNG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: The Boeing Company (BA): The Best Aviation Stock According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Aviation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) stands against the other best aviation stocks. Aviation stocks are the shares of firms in the aviation industry, such as airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and airport operators. The global lockdowns triggered by the pandemic caused significant disruptions to the travel industry. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), air travel worldwide decreased by 60% in 2020 as a result of the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. There were only 1.8 billion passengers flying through 2020, down from almost 4.5 billion in 2019, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), while seating capacity dropped by about 50% in 2020. Despite these challenges, the airline industry has regained stability as lockdowns have lifted and normalcy has returned. Verified Market Size estimated that the global airline market will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.21% from 2024 to 2031, from a 2023 valuation of $569.02 billion to $732.66 billion. The industry is mostly driven by the development of fuel-efficient aircraft and the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States claims that the implementation of SAF could cut aviation emissions by as much as 80%, supporting the industry’s sustainability objectives and reducing operating expenses. Currently, airlines are facing record demand. According to AAA, nearly 80 million people were anticipated to travel by road and air this Thanksgiving, with the number of travelers exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Seat occupancy on airplanes has increased from 74% in 2003 to 84% in the first ten months of this year. The seat occupancy rate jumped from 69% in 2004 to 79% this year, even during slower months like January. According to the Consumer Price Index, airfares rose by more than 10% between July and October as a result of the limited availability. Reduced competition and flight cuts by budget carriers, such as a 10% holiday reduction, have further reduced availability, raising prices and reducing the number of reasonably priced options. U.S. Airlines and Aircraft Leasing Analyst Jamie Baker of J.P. Morgan claims, “Our prevailing thesis is that demand for premium and international air travel continues to lead the market.” The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that airlines will transport about 5 billion passengers by 2024. According to IATA’s 2024 forecasting, airlines should report net earnings of $30.5 billion this year, up from $25.7 billion in December. It was estimated that the industry’s overall revenues would increase by over 10% to a record $996 billion. The projected profit “is a great achievement considering the recent deep pandemic losses,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said while addressing the annual general assembly of the trade association in Dubai. According to IATA, which has more than 300 members and accounts for 83% of all air traffic globally, North American airlines are expected to generate about half of all profits in 2024, with a projected surplus of $14.8 billion, while European airlines are expected to see an increase in profits of between $8.6 billion and $9 billion. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), industry revenues will exceed $1.007 trillion, a 4.4% rise from 2024, and cross $1 trillion for the first time in 2025. It is projected that the number of passengers will reach 5.2 billion, which would be another significant milestone in the industry’s post-pandemic recovery. Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General stated: “Looking at 2025, for the first time, traveler numbers will exceed five billion and the number of flights will reach 40 million. This growth means that aviation connectivity will be creating and supporting jobs across the global economy. The most obvious are the hospitality and retail sectors which will gear up to meet the needs of a growing number of customers. But almost every business benefits from the connectivity that air transport provides, making it easier to meet customers, receive supplies, or transport products. On top of this, growth in aviation also contributes to achieving almost all the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” We sifted through holdings of Airline ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 Aviation stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. We have used the stock’s Revenue Growth Rate (year-over-year) as a tie-breaker in case two or more stocks have the same number of hedge funds invested. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 52 The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is a major defense and aerospace company. Commercial aircraft, military, space, and security, and global services are its three business segments. Boeing’s commercial jets division competes with Airbus in the development of aircraft that can seat more than 130 people. The company’s defense, space, and security division competes with Lockheed, Northrop, and numerous other companies to produce military aircraft, satellites, and weapons. Global Services provides aftermarket assistance to airlines. The confidence in the overall demand for aerospace products is further strengthened by Boeing’s substantial backlog, which spans many years of manufacturing for the most popular aircraft. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is in serious financial trouble, having lost $6.17 billion in Q3 2024 and almost $8 billion so far this year. The firm’s losses have been made worse by production slowdowns, supply chain delays, and a recent seven-week labor strike that put a halt to important programs. Nonetheless, the business’s $500 billion backlog, which amounts to more than seven years’ worth of sales, suggests that there will be a strong demand for its commercial aircraft in the future. Kelly Ortberg’s appointment as CEO offers fresh leadership to enhance operational effectiveness and reset investor expectations. Continued execution of its defense programs, as well as backlog fulfillment, could support recovery and future growth. Fidelity Dividend Growth Fund stated the following regarding The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Overweighting The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) also worked against the fund. The stock returned about -16% the past three months, sliding considerably in late July, as Q2 financial results for the aerospace giant came up well short of Wall Street’s expectations amid bigger-than-anticipated losses in both its commercial aviation and defense businesses. In July, the firm named former Rockwell Collins CEO Kelly Ortberg as its new president and CEO in an effort to move past ongoing production issues, cost overruns and delivery delays.” Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey’s database. It owns 5.58 million shares worth $848.85 million as of Q3. Overall, BA ranks 3rd on our list of the best aviation stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of BA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How Vera Wang’s ‘I Do’ With WHP Signals More Changes for Fashion Dealmaking

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The brand management giants are fast, well-funded and poised to get much bigger. Deputy Managing Editor From micro to macro, the fashion industry learns everything it needs to know where buyer meets seller. At the store, it’s all about the consumer, what they’re looking for, what’s hot, how they want to tell their own personal story and fill up their closets. It’s much the same with fashion companies, which often look to grow by snapping up new brands. Acquisitions when made from a position of strength can signal who’s in ascent — and lately it’s the brand management companies doing the buying. Related Articles Human Resources Marquee Brands Taps Former Authentic Exec Natasha Fishman as Chief Marketing Officer Fashion Scoops Bryson DeChambeau Signs On as a Reebok Golf Ambassador Just ask Vera Wang. You May Also Like This week she agreed to sell her famed brand to WHP Global. The deal was a reminder — if one were needed — of just how potent the business of owning intellectual property has become. Already this year, WHP has cut deals for Rag & Bone and Express. Meanwhile, its still-bigger competitor Authentic Brands Group added Champion to its mammoth stable while Marquee Brands bought the intellectual property of Totes Isotoner. Separating a brand from its operating structure is a business model that is still viewed somewhat skeptically by many in fashion, who wonder how sustainable the approach is and whether IP firms are ultimately something like the end of the line for distressed brands. Yehuda Shmidman, cofounder, chairman and chief executive officer of WHP, disagrees and said the brand management firms are not in just the distressed business anymore. “I know that that perception is out there,” Shmidman told WWD on Wednesday. “There’s been a sea change from the 1.0 version of this industry to where we are today, which is absolutely at a minimum 2.0 if not 3.0, 4.0.” Shmidman has lived and breathed that change, having started working at industry pioneer Iconix Brand Group almost 20 years ago. “I was there and I was a part of it and I was working day and night in it,” he said. “The business model was centered around sort of going into graveyards, digging up distressed brands, dead brands, resurrecting them in sort of cheap and deep ways. That was the 1.0 model. There are many, many examples. You can go back in history 20 years and just look at the brands that were dumped into Kmart or wherever.” That now is the province of liquidators, he said. “The brand management space has become something completely different and it’s taken years, it’s taken several decades, but where we are today is we actually do not at all ever buy distressed brands,” he said of WHP. “The thesis of WHP Global is about investing in strong brands that were in companies that for a variety of reasons have decided that they have not yet been able to expand. “We are not buying the Vera Wang IP because it’s distressed,” he said. “It’s the opposite. The Vera Wang brand is actually really, really strong.” Shmidman said the top three brand management players — Authentic, WHP and Marquee — account for about $50 billion in retail sales today and are on their way to $100 billion in five years. The sector has grown from $0 to $50 billion with a very specific step and repeat. “We bought an Italian soccer brand called Lotto. We own the IP globally, we brought it to the United States. We did a big deal with Dick’s Sporting Goods. Lotto is now in Dick’s in every store,” Shmidman said. While not exactly new, it’s an approach that’s gaining a lot of momentum. David Shiffman, who is head of consumer retail at Solomon Partners and worked on the Vera Wang deal, said the investment bank has worked on numerous sizable deals with the brand management companies over the past several years. “Historically, a lot of these businesses used to get sold to private equity firms. Private equity doesn’t play as much in the retail space anymore,” he said. “As such, the brand management companies have bought a number of these businesses. They’re not interested in holding inventory or having working capital. They own the intellectual property and then they seek to license it out by geography or by channel or by product category or by price point.” And that is an approach that private equity is ready to get behind. “It’s not a new business model, but it’s an innovative business model with great scale and reach,” Shiffman said. “You can get great synergies by continuing to bolt on more and more businesses. The combination of the ability to grow it, the high margins and free cash flow generation, the diversification as a result of owning a portfolio, I think that’s really interesting to PE.” The big money is all over the sector. WHP is backed by Oaktree Capital Management, Ares Management and BlackRock. Authentic is backed by General Atlantic, BlackRock, CVC Capital Partners, and Leonard Green & Partners. And Marquee is backed by Neuberger Berman. That in turn means the companies have a lot of dry powder as they look for deals. “The most sophisticated investors in the world have tuned in and given us the ability to deploy unlimited capital, essentially, into the strategy of growing amazing brands through the technique of licensing,” Shmidman said. He described this as a kind of golden age for brand management. “Right now is the time, though, right now you either have the platform or you don’t,” Shmidman said, noting the biggest players all do have big networks to leverage. “Brands are for sale. They’re not always for sale. They’re for sale right now. And you need capital, which is very hard to get. And we have it. Long story short, for the people who say, ‘I’ve seen the movie before,’ I say to them, ‘You guys keep worrying. We’ll keep winning.’ “I see it in my pipeline, there are so many brands for sale,” he said. “In fact, there are more brands than buyers. So we’re going to end up buying a few, our competitors are going to buy a few, we’re all going to win in 2025.” It could be a trend that is not so much about fashion, but the broader world. Scott Markman, who is CEO of branding agency MonogramGroup and has worked with private-equity owned brands for years, said: “Consolidation is in every major business sector in the world, in America, and this is not unique to fashion. “Regardless of what Vera Wang thinks or doesn’t think or the retailers … or the supply chain … it’s going on across the entire economy. You either stiff arm it and say, ‘I’m not going to do this,’ or join the crowd. There’s no stopping this. It’s happened with food, it’s happened with cars. “Five years from now, if I’m the next Wang, I’m probably already thinking about that exit. I just know this is coming.” The Bottom Line is a business analysis column written by Evan Clark, deputy managing editor, who has covered the fashion industry since 2000.

Title: Jack Boyle’s undoubted promise ensures a quick rise to prominence

By his own admission, it’s been a whirlwind start to Jack Boyle’s campaign. A good preseason was followed by selection for the Emerging Ireland tour (only to be forced to withdraw through injury) before inclusion in the Irish squad for the Autumn Nations Series and then his Champions Cup debut away to Bristol. Now he is in line for his fourth start of the season against Connacht at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday (kick-off 5.30pm). That Andy Farrell and co. included the 22-year-old loosehead in the Irish squad as an additional training panellist after he missed the Emerging Ireland tour is a clear indication of their belief in Boyle’s undoubted promise. It also whets his appetite. “You hear lads speaking about it so much, always ranting and raving about it, how much they love the environment and it’s the people in there, coaches, players, backroom staff, that make it special. Getting a taster is something that makes me hungry to try to get back there.” Boyle could come up against someone he now knows better after that Autumn Series, namely Finlay Bealham, as he did back in October at the Dexcom Stadium. “Finlay is an incredible player,” says Boyle. “He’s a great man as well. I got on very well with him but it’s up to us to get our process right and to stamp our authority on the game and we’re looking to have a go at set-piece time as well. We’re not just there to give it a dead duck. We’re properly ready to give it a go.” Coming up against Bealham is all part of the learning curve, which seems particularly steep and never-ending for young props, albeit Boyle is making good progress. He has always stood out as a rare prospect due to his strength and power, ever since his two first-half tries set St Michael’s on their way toward beating Gonzaga in the 2019 Leinster Schools Senior Cup final, which was a precursor to him being an ever-present in the Ireland Under-20s Grand Slam-winning side in 2022. Boyle had started playing mini rugby at Old Wesley, where there is a strong family connection through uncles, notably Eric, and his cousin Stephen, who played for Leinster Youths. He was a backrower until being converted into a prop when he was 15 at St Michael’s, and he cites Andy Skehan and Emmet MacMahon as major influences. “Coming out of a school like Michael’s or Blackrock, because they’re so strong and you’re so well coached, you’re probably a step ahead.” The quasi-professional set-up in St Michael’s was to his liking. “I suppose if you want to pursue a career in it you have to love it,” he reasons. “And maybe there’s some things like newsletters and things, but it’s all noise, really. When you’re 13, 14, 15, all you really care about is playing.” His 15-year-old brother, Herbie, is also causing waves in the St Michael’s Junior Cup team in the back row. Yet, a little surprisingly, Boyle had to work hard on his own renowned strength. “Naturally I wouldn’t be that heavy. I’ve always struggled to put on weight, [but] I want to play at a weight where I still feel I can be dynamic around the pitch. I don’t want to put on weight and it’s bad weight. “Dave Fagan, rest in peace, poor fella, he was really good over two years in the sub academy. He got my strength numbers right up, got everything up and then it was up to me to get eating more or less. But strength-wise it was a pretty big grind for a few years.” Nor can schools rugby properly prepare a young prop for senior rugby due to the restrictions on scrummaging, which has made his time in the AIL with UCD even more invaluable. “The big thing is time in the saddle, especially as a frontrower coming out of school where it’s not full scrums; it’s not a full contest. You’re pretty much thrown in the deep end, tighthead more than loosehead, out of school. The AIL is that stepping stone usually. “But the other thing is getting reps against the likes of Tadhg Furlong or Rabah Slimani here. You learn from the best in the business too on the professional side of it.” Boyle actually rooms with Slimani who, as the first Frenchman to ever play for Leinster, has extra novelty value. And the younger man has a balanced take on the IRFU’s decision to prohibit the provinces from importing foreign frontrowers henceforth. “You have to always back yourself. I feel like if I’m playing well then, I deserve to play, but at the same time if they’re bringing in the likes of Rabah Slimani, you need to try and get as much information out of him as possible. “I know he’s at tighthead now, but you don’t look at it in the way of ‘he’s blocking whoever’. You have to learn off him. He’s there to help you as well. It’s not just to block you.” In addition, of course, Boyle could hardly have a more experienced duo of looseheads to learn from than Andrew Porter and Cian Healy. “He’s unbelievably special in the group,” Boyle says of Healy. “I think we’ll only acknowledge it when he’s gone, he’s added so much to the younger lads coming through, not only around set-piece stuff, but off field, recovery, that kind of thing as well. “We’re in a very special and unique situation in club rugby, to have the likes of those four or five front-rowers to learn off.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Is Air Transport Services (ATSG) the Best Aviation Stock According to Hedge Funds?

The most obvious are the hospitality and retail sectors which will gear up to meet the needs of a growing number of customers. But almost every business benefits from the connectivity that air transport provides, making it easier to meet customers, receive supplies, or transport products. On top of this, growth in aviation also contributes to achieving almost all the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” We sifted through holdings of Airline ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 Aviation stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. We have used the stock’s Revenue Growth Rate (year-over-year) as a tie-breaker in case two or more stocks have the same number of hedge funds invested. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 16 Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG), a leading provider of aircraft leasing and air transportation services, specializes in medium wide-body freighter aircraft. Through its varied companies, it provides a distinctive Lease+Plus aircraft leasing possibility within the aviation industry. The North American and European markets account for the majority of the company’s sales. It is among the best airline stocks, having increased by more than 32% so far this year. In the third quarter of 2024, Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG)’s free cash flow improved dramatically, going from a negative $51.6 million to $86.4 million. Operating cash flow increased 15.35% year over year. Additionally, the business declared a final deal to be bought out by alternative investment firm Stonepeak for all cash for about $3.1 billion. Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG)’s leasing division benefited from strong demand, with four Boeing 767-300 freighter leases signed in the third quarter. However, third-quarter profitability was impacted by higher expenses and fewer block hours flown. By the end of 2024, the firm intends to sign three additional leases for freighters owned by CAM and expects significant benefits in its ACMI Services division as a result of contractual price increases. On November 5, 2024, Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG) announced that it had entered into an acquisition agreement with Stonepeak for $22.50 per share. Truist analyst Michael Ciarmoli increased the firm’s price target for the business from $15 to $22.50. In a research note, the analyst informed investors that Stonepeak’s implied take-out multiple for the deal is 20% lower than peers’, but this is likely justified given recent operating performance, pilot union contract unknowns, and greater exposure to older freighter platforms as opposed to newer passenger variant aircraft. John Osterweis’s Osterweis Capital Management was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey’s database at the end of Q3 2024. It owns 29 million shares worth $29.80 million as of Q3. Overall, ATSG ranks 10th on our list of the best aviation stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of ATSG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ATSG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Sun Country Airlines (SNCY) the Best Aviation Stock According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Aviation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sun Country Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNCY) stands against the other best aviation stocks. Aviation stocks are the shares of firms in the aviation industry, such as airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and airport operators. The global lockdowns triggered by the pandemic caused significant disruptions to the travel industry. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), air travel worldwide decreased by 60% in 2020 as a result of the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. There were only 1.8 billion passengers flying through 2020, down from almost 4.5 billion in 2019, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), while seating capacity dropped by about 50% in 2020. Despite these challenges, the airline industry has regained stability as lockdowns have lifted and normalcy has returned. Verified Market Size estimated that the global airline market will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.21% from 2024 to 2031, from a 2023 valuation of $569.02 billion to $732.66 billion. The industry is mostly driven by the development of fuel-efficient aircraft and the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States claims that the implementation of SAF could cut aviation emissions by as much as 80%, supporting the industry’s sustainability objectives and reducing operating expenses. Currently, airlines are facing record demand. According to AAA, nearly 80 million people were anticipated to travel by road and air this Thanksgiving, with the number of travelers exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Seat occupancy on airplanes has increased from 74% in 2003 to 84% in the first ten months of this year. The seat occupancy rate jumped from 69% in 2004 to 79% this year, even during slower months like January. According to the Consumer Price Index, airfares rose by more than 10% between July and October as a result of the limited availability. Reduced competition and flight cuts by budget carriers, such as a 10% holiday reduction, have further reduced availability, raising prices and reducing the number of reasonably priced options. U.S. Airlines and Aircraft Leasing Analyst Jamie Baker of J.P. Morgan claims, “Our prevailing thesis is that demand for premium and international air travel continues to lead the market.” The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that airlines will transport about 5 billion passengers by 2024. According to IATA’s 2024 forecasting, airlines should report net earnings of $30.5 billion this year, up from $25.7 billion in December. It was estimated that the industry’s overall revenues would increase by over 10% to a record $996 billion. The projected profit “is a great achievement considering the recent deep pandemic losses,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said while addressing the annual general assembly of the trade association in Dubai. According to IATA, which has more than 300 members and accounts for 83% of all air traffic globally, North American airlines are expected to generate about half of all profits in 2024, with a projected surplus of $14.8 billion, while European airlines are expected to see an increase in profits of between $8.6 billion and $9 billion. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), industry revenues will exceed $1.007 trillion, a 4.4% rise from 2024, and cross $1 trillion for the first time in 2025. It is projected that the number of passengers will reach 5.2 billion, which would be another significant milestone in the industry’s post-pandemic recovery. Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General stated: “Looking at 2025, for the first time, traveler numbers will exceed five billion and the number of flights will reach 40 million. This growth means that aviation connectivity will be creating and supporting jobs across the global economy. The most obvious are the hospitality and retail sectors which will gear up to meet the needs of a growing number of customers.

(see more details here) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15 Revenue Growth Rate (year-over-year): 17.35% One of the Best Airline Stocks, Sun Country Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNCY), operates low-cost carriers. The company runs in two segments: Cargo and Passenger. Scheduled service and charter are the two internal passenger groupings in the passenger segment. Air cargo services are offered by the Cargo segment. The passenger segment generates the lion’s share of revenue. With a record third-quarter revenue of $249 million, Sun Country Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNCY) had a 0.24% YoY increase. Despite obstacles like the Crowdstrike outage and hurricanes that affected operations, cargo revenue grew by 11.9% year over year, while charter revenue grew by 7.0%. For the ninth consecutive quarter, the business was profitable, with GAAP diluted EPS of $0.04 and adjusted EPS of $0.06. The price objective for Sun Country Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNCY) was increased by Barclays from $20 to $24 on November 14, 2024. According to the firm, airline fundamentals will “turn sharply positive” in 2025 and would probably lead to a “much more favorable market perception for the group,” which might allow for significant share price growth for the leaders in the industry, such as Delta, United, and Alaska. In a research note, the analyst warns investors that a “powerful rally in airline equities looking into next year” may be fueled by the convergence of strengthening airline fundamentals and market optimism. The “winners will keep winning,” according to Barclays. As capacity growth slows in 2025, low-cost carrier rivalry shifts and the “moats grow deeper for the winners in the industry,” the company argues that airlines offer substantial upside potential. Paul Reeder And Edward Shapiro’s PAR Capital Management was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey’s database at the end of Q3 2024. It owns 2.5 million shares worth $28 million as of Q3. Overall, SNCY ranks 11th on our list of the best aviation stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of SNCY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Two directors of Epic Games, Tencent resign amid antitrust investigation
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/19/two-directors-of-epic-games-tencent-resign-amid-antitrust-investigation
Time Published: 2024-12-19T04:22:24Z

The US Department of Justice says it expressed concerns directors’ positions on two company boards violated Clayton Act. Two directors of Fortnite creator Epic Games who were appointed by Chinese tech company Tencent Holdings have resigned their positions in the wake of an antitrust investigation in the United States. The US Department of Justice said in a statement on Wednesday that it had “expressed concerns” that the directors’ positions on both the Epic and Tencent boards were in violation of the Clayton Act because Tencent owns Riot Games, a Los Angeles-based video game developer and e-sports organiser. Section 8 of the Clayton Act “prohibits directors and officers from serving simultaneously on the boards of competitors, subject to limited exceptions”, according to the Justice Department. “Scrutiny around interlocking directorates continues to be an enforcement priority for the Antitrust Division,” said Deputy Director of Civil Enforcement Miriam R Vishio of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. Epic Games and the US Justice Department did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. “Our relationship with Epic has always centred on making great games and delivering great experiences for players and developers. We look forward to continuing to work with them on this shared vision,” Tencent said in an emailed statement. Beyond Fortnite, Epic Games is also known as the developer of the Unreal Engine, a groundbreaking 3D video game engine. The North Carolina-based Epic Games is privately held, but Tencent holds a minority stake in the company among its “equity investments” in other video game and media companies, according to the Justice Department. Other Epic Games investors include Sony, Disney, Fidelity and BlackRock. Tencent, one of the largest multimedia companies in the world, is incorporated and domiciled in the Cayman Islands but has its headquarters in China’s Shenzhen. The Justice Department’s statement did not mention any national security concerns around Tencent or its Chinese ownership, in contrast to the US government’s approach to other Chinese tech companies, such as ByteDance, which owns the social media platform TikTok. The video-sharing app is due to be banned in the US from January 19 if its Chinese owner ByteDance does not sell the platform. Following the investigation, Tencent decided to “amend its shareholder agreement with Epic to relinquish its unilateral right to appoint directors or observers to the Epic board in the future,” according to the Justice Department. The statement also said that despite the resignation of the two unnamed directors, “no company or individual has admitted to liability in connection with this investigation”.

Title: Report: Perplexity Closed $500 Million Funding Round in Early December

Perplexity AI reportedly closed a $500 million funding round earlier this month. The round tripled the artificial intelligence (AI) startup’s valuation to $9 billion, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Dec. 18), citing an unnamed source. Reached by PYMNTS, Perplexity declined to comment on the report. The company’s backers include SoftBank, Nvidia and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the report. Perplexity AI started 2024 with a valuation of $520 million. During the summer, it was valued at $3 billion. HSBC Innovation Capital said Monday (Dec. 16) that 42% of U.S. venture capital was invested into AI companies in 2024 — up from 36% in 2023 and 22% in 2022 — and that as of 2024, 20 AI companies have each raised $2 billion or more. “Venture capital has always gravitated toward transformative industries, but the level of consolidation we’re seeing within one category is unprecedented,” HSBC U.S. Innovation Banking Head Dave Sabow said in a Monday press release. BlackRock said Dec. 7 that it expects 2025 to be a big year for infrastructure and cybersecurity, with the AI boom playing a major role in those investments. “It’s still very early in the AI adoption cycle,” Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, told CNBC. Perplexity said in November that it launched an AI-powered shopping assistant in the U.S. and plans to expand it to additional markets. The new Buy With Pro is available to Perplexity Pro users and helps shoppers both research and purchase products. In October, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas said that the AI search company is serving over 100 million queries per week and aims to boost that figure to 100 million queries every day. Srinivas also said in October that Perplexity wants to form revenue-sharing partnerships with news publishers. He added that the company could supply publishers with chatbots that would respond to users’ queries on the publishers’ websites, using their content to provide answers. His comments came two days after Perplexity was sued by two News Corp-owned publishers that allege that the company’s AI search engine uses their copyrighted content to answer users’ questions and takes traffic that otherwise would have gone to the publishers’ sites. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Deutsche Bank to develop Ethereum layer-2 blockchain to tackle TradFi compliance issues

Project Dama 2 aims to address regulatory concerns by offering secure layer-2 blockchain solutions for financial institutions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Deutsche Bank is building a layer-2 blockchain based on Ethereum to solve the regulatory hurdles financial institutions face using public blockchains, Bloomberg News reported on Dec. 17. The platform, dubbed Project Dama 2, represents the German banking giant’s attempt to harness blockchain technology’s potential while minimizing risks associated with public ledgers, which can often inadvertently transact with sanctioned entities or criminals. The project, unveiled in November as a pilot, is designed to streamline asset servicing. It leverages ZKsync’s zero-knowledge proof (zkp) technology to offer cheaper and more efficient transactions. Moreover, using zkp will enable enhanced privacy and customization for institutional users developing on Deutsche Bank’s proprietary blockchain. Crypto firms Memento Blockchain and Interop Labs are aiding the platform’s development. Notably, Project Dama 2 is part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian, which signals a growing interest among traditional financial players in blockchain-based asset servicing and tokenization solutions. JPMorgan executed its first transaction on a public blockchain in late 2022, also as part of Project Guardian, while Visa is exploring the tokenization of fiat currencies for traditional banks. Meanwhile, traditional finance giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have tokenized money funds with a combined market cap of over $1 billion. Public blockchains offer immense efficiency for regulated lenders. Ethereum is the favored infrastructure by institutions, as it dominates 81% of the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). However, the report pointed out that these benefits come with uncertainty over who validates transactions, the possibility of transaction fees reaching sanctioned entities, and the risk of unforeseen blockchain hard forks that could disrupt operations. The solution found by Deutsche Bank was adding its own layer-2 blockchain to the mix. Boon-Hiong Chan, Deutsche Bank’s Asia-Pacific industry applied innovation lead, stated: “Using two chains, a number of these regulatory concerns should be able to be satisfied.” As a result, Project Dama 2 connects to Ethereum while allowing the bank to sidestep some of the alleged risks inherent in public blockchains. By creating a curated list of transaction validators and offering tools to give regulators exclusive “super admin rights,” the bank hopes to provide a more secure and compliant blockchain experience.

Title: Is Gannett Co., Inc. (GCI) the Best News and Digital Media Stock to Buy?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gannett-co-inc-gci-best-210247453.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best News and Digital Media Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to look at where Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI) stands against other news and digital media stocks to buy now. Digital experiences comprise a significant part of consumers’ lives in today’s digital age. According to Deloitte, consumers spend an average of eight hours engaging in online activities every day, which makes up about half of their waking hours. These trends are more prominent among Gen Z and millennials, who spend around nine hours on average on online activities every day. In contrast, Gen X and boomers spend around seven and six hours on average daily, respectively. Around 7 in 10 respondents claim that they go online daily to use social media, carry out general web browsing, or communicate with their friends and family. 74% of Gen Z and millennials check their social media several times every day, with 20% of Gen Z checking their feeds at least every hour. In contrast, 57% of Gen X and 39% of boomers check their social media multiple times a day. 61% of consumers surveyed said that they interact with digital media daily by consuming entertainment (watching movies, sports, or television) on a streaming service. Similarly, around 48% said they listen to a podcast or music daily. A study by Deloitte shows that US households spent around $760 on average on acquiring connected devices in 2024, down from $800 in 2023. Consumer technology spending fell between 2022 and 2023, primarily due to pandemic-driven supply chain disruptions, higher inflation, and slower economic growth. However, estimates show that this spending is expected to bounce back, experiencing a 1% growth in revenue in 2024 and an extra 4.4% growth in 2025. Deloitte’s 2024 Connected Consumer Survey corroborates this claim, as it shows that 28% of respondents have plans to increase their device spending in 2025, up from 9% in 2023. In contrast, around 23% of people are planning to reduce their device purchase spending, up from 7% in 2023. This trend is attributed to the ongoing financial pressures on US consumers. Recent Pew Research Center surveys show a falling number of US adults who follow the news closely. Consumers for several older types of news media, such as local television stations, public radio, and newspapers, are dwindling as well. However, audiences for a few particular media brands are increasing, including newer digital platforms such as podcasts and social media. According to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey, nearly 50% of all US adults claimed that they sometimes get news from social media. Although those who use social media to get news like various things about it, such as speed, convenience, and preciseness, some consumers express concerns about the practice. They claim news attained from social media isn’t always accurate, is seldom low in quality, and tends to be politically biased. Inaccuracy is increasingly becoming the most disliked aspect of social media news, going from 31% who said the same to 40% in the past five years. Similarly, an Ernst & Young (EY) report on key entertainment and media trends for 2024 showed that consumer dissatisfaction with paying for unused television channels was leading to the rise of streaming services. Such services allowed households to personalize their content and reduce costs simultaneously. Media companies are now facing the challenge of maintaining a profitable balance between traditional cable and linear broadcast networks and streaming platforms. Digital media companies are also employing artificial intelligence to regulate their operations, boosting incremental growth and productivity. However, risks regarding the implementation of GenAI persist. These include intellectual property protection, creative industries’ job security concerns, and privacy and accuracy challenges. To compile our list, we consulted online sources and ETFs to select 15 top news and digital media stocks. We then chose the top 12 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey’s database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in them. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28 Gannett Co. (NYSE:GCI) is a diversified media company that operates through the Newsquest, Domestic Gannett Media, and Digital Marketing Solutions (DMS) segments. The Domestic Gannett Media segment operates USA TODAY. The company operates the Newsquest segment in the UK, which comprises more than 220 digital news and media brands across its portfolio. This includes over 150 weekly and daily newspapers and over 70 magazines. Gannett Co. (NYSE:GCI) also offers digital advertising and marketing solutions. The company’s digital revenue categories saw strong growth in fiscal Q3 2024. As a result, its total digital revenues surpassed 45% of total revenues, marking an all-time high for the company. It also generated around $20 million of free cash flow, showing a 168% increase compared to 2023. Gannett Co.’s (NYSE:GCI) audience also experienced growth in fiscal Q3 2024, surpassing 200 million average monthly unique visitors for the first time in the company’s history. This reflects a 7% growth compared to 2023. The primary drivers of audience growth for the company in fiscal Q3 2024 included political events, the kickoff to football season, and the Paris Olympics. The company’s digital-only subscription business is also bringing new highs. Its revenue surpassed $50 million in fiscal Q3 2024, and the average digital-only revenue per unit (ARPU) exceeded $8. Investors are bullish on the stock as this segment suggests considerable upside for the company through both pricing and volume growth. Fiscal Q3 2024 marked the company’s second consecutive quarter of year-over-year subscription growth, along with another quarter of sequential growth in digital-only paid subscriptions. Miller Deep Value Select Strategy stated the following regarding Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “During the quarter, our two largest positive contributors were Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI), whose market share price up 20% and United Natural Foods (UNFI), with a market share price up 31%. Gannett continues to make progress with their long-term transformation to a digital media company. Management expects digital revenues to become more than 50% of company sales over the coming year which would support the company’s return to annual revenue growth. In September, the DOJ presented a very strong case against Google for their Ad Tech business. Gannett’s anti-trust case against Google is very similar to the DOJ case, and we believe it remains overlooked by the marketplace. Gannett is being represented by Kellogg Hansen who won the two largest anti-trust verdicts ($1.2B and $1.3B) and were also successful in defending the appeals of those verdicts. While it is impossible to know with certainty the outcome of Gannet’s legal case, we find it interesting that Kellogg Hansen’s only compensation is tied to Gannett having success in winning their case. This is an important indication of alignment to us. In a scenario where Gannett wins a verdict in the neighborhood of the amount they are seeking, it may mean a windfall greater than all the net debt on the balance sheet. Assuming, as we do, that the current share price has not priced in such a development, the result would be a share price below two times normalized Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA). Compared with The New York Times, which currently trades at greater than nineteen times EV/EBITDA, a valuation at half of that multiple on normalized EBITDA would support an equity market cap more than $4B for Gannett. While there are risks of temporary setbacks with multi-year transformations, the current market valuation framework appears to remain focused on the company’s historical secular growth challenges. The biggest near-term risk would be unexpected weaker trends in print advertising, creating greater near-term secular revenue headwinds. A successful transformation, positive anti-trust case verdict, and potential non-core asset sale could lead to significant upside over time. We believe the shares remain significantly mispriced at only .3 times revenue and greater than 40% normalized free cash low yield.” Overall, GCI ranks 10th on our list of the best news and digital media stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GCI to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GCI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NASDAQ:CZR) stands against the other best entertainment stocks to buy according to analysts. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the international entertainment and media industry was valued at $2.51 trillion in 2023. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% to reach $3.55 trillion by 2028. Growth in the entertainment industry is driven by the rapid adoption of subscription models, the evolution of live events, and the use of augmented and virtual reality technologies.

A report published by FTI Delta earlier this year highlighted some significant trends and challenges in the media and entertainment industry. As per the report, the live entertainment sector has experienced a robust recovery, with global spending on live music in 2023 increasing by 49% compared to 2019. Major sports leagues, including the NFL, NBA, MLS, NHL, and IndyCar, have not only recovered but surpassed pre-pandemic attendance levels. The post-pandemic recovery within the industry has not been uniform. For instance, the filmed entertainment industry faced severe challenges in late 2023 due to strikes by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and SAG-AFTRA. These disruptions led to a more than 70% decline in production and marketing expenditures, compounding existing issues from early 2023 when studios were already tightening budgets. As a result, spending in 2023 was down approximately 35% from 2022, reflecting a struggling market. The report anticipates recovery for filmed entertainment post-strike to be more subdued than previous rebounds, with projections of about 25% year-over-year growth in 2024. On the bright side, the report highlighted a significant growth trajectory for United States TV and connected TV (CTV) advertising, emphasizing the transformative impact of CTV on the advertising landscape. The combined US TV and CTV ad spending is projected to approach $100 billion by 2027, with CTV being the primary driver of this growth. In 2024 alone, CTV advertising is expected to increase by $5.5 billion, representing a 22% year-over-year growth. The surge in CTV advertising is largely attributed to the rise of premium ad-supported streaming services. In addition to a robust performance expected within the advertising segment, the gaming sector remains resilient. The video game industry achieved a CAGR of 9.2% from 2019 to 2022. Despite a 6.3% decline from the peak surge during the COVID-19 pandemic, console sales in 2022 remained 18% higher than pre-pandemic levels, indicating strong ongoing demand for gaming hardware. As per the report, the overall outlook for the video game market remains positive, with expectations of above mid-single-digit growth throughout the next year.

To compile the list of the 10 best entertainment stocks to buy according to analysts, we used the Finviz stock screener and our previous articles. Using these two sources we aggregated an initial list of entertainment stocks sorted by their market capitalization. Next, we checked analysts’ upside potential for each stock and shortlisted stocks with an analyst upside potential of at least 25%. Lastly, we ranked our stocks in ascending order of the analysts’ upside potential. We have also added the number of hedge funds holding each stock sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database. Please note that the data was collected on December 13, 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Analysts’ Upside Potential: 41.85% Number of Hedge Funds: 67 Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) is a major company in the casino and entertainment industry in the United States. It owns and operates over 50 casinos across the United States, primarily under well-known brands like Caesars, Harrah’s, and Horseshoe. The company runs hotels connected to its casinos, providing approximately 44,900 hotel rooms. It also hosts numerous live events such as concerts and shows at its properties, enhancing the overall guest experience beyond just gaming. In the third quarter of 2024, Caesars Digital, the online gaming and sports betting division of Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR), showcased growth and performance. The segment reported $303 million in net revenues, marking a 41% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This reflects a strong demand for digital gaming and sports betting services. The segment also achieved a record adjusted EBITDA of $52 million, a significant rise from just $2 million in Q3 2023. Moreover, within the digital segment, the Caesars Palace app has been growing as a key contributor to overall iCasino revenues, highlighting the effectiveness of its mobile strategy. Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) has launched the Horseshoe Casino brand in multiple states including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, with plans to expand into Ontario and New Jersey by year-end. It is one of the best entertainment stocks according to analysts. Choice Equities Capital Management stated the following regarding Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) and GENI – Both Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and Genius Sports Limited operate in and around the entertainment, casino and gaming space. Caesars is a bit more well-known and discussed in brief below. Caesars Entertainment is the owner of a strong casino and entertainment brand, with a diverse portfolio of properties strategically focused on both physical and digital growth. The company’s leadership in the U.S. casino and resort industry is underpinned by its expansive footprint, including marquee properties on the Las Vegas strip, new and existing regional casinos in growing markets, and its growing Caesars Sportsbook platform. With the ongoing recovery in leisure and travel post-pandemic, combined with the secular tailwinds in online sports betting and iGaming, Caesars is well-positioned to capture growth across multiple segments. Recently emerging from a sizeable multi-year investment cycle, shares of Caesars look attractive on a mid-teens yield of forward cash-flows. Some recent refinancings and a share buyback highlight the improved look of the company’s financials.” Overall, CZR ranks 4th on our list of best entertainment stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CZR to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CZR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer Crowned PayPal (PYPL) as the New King of FinTech: Why It’s Poised for Big Gains

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the Jim Cramer Just Discussed These 13 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently. As the Federal Reserve exits the year by having continued its interest rate cuts, Wall Street is wondering what 2025 will hold for markets. Inflation is a key concern among investors, and many believe that the Fed might have to update its models that determine the rate cuts. This update will account for any potential uptick in inflation and one which might be spurred by tariffs imposed by the incoming Trump Administration. In a fresh episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer commented on what might happen once the interest rate cuts intensify and how these effects might tie in with Trump's strategies. Cramer doesn't "understand that people want to be very concerned about the future after the cut, I really am not buying any of this." According to him if the tariffs go through then the CPI can rise which will lead the Fed to not cut interest rates. But, if the tariffs don't materialize or if "they're targetted tariffs, and we get break in housing, I mean we just saw Tol Brothers, I know it's only one million dollar house and not a hundred and fifty, but it starts somewhere. And we get some more apartments come in and we have big inventories from more than Ford." In the event the CPI rises, Cramer believes that "A year we'll be sitting here and saying well, okay we had this blip up inflation but that's over." As a result, he believes that it is important to focus on "what the President-elect is gonna do. Why do we have to focus so much on what's going to happen next year for the Fed when they actually have to react to what the President does?" Cramer also believes that the US needs more workers. Commenting on Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son announcing $100 billion in investments at Trump's Mar-e-Lago resort, Cramer stated "I think the most important thing is we don't have the workers for this stuff." He added "The idea that we get the workers, and we do not have a good birth rate, robust birth rate, we do not have enough workers, we're gonna have immigration reform. You know you wanna create jobs, what you need are people to fill them and we don't have it." Another matter that's caught Cramer's attention when it comes to the President-elect is Trump's remarks about taking on healthcare benefit managers once he assumes power. During a press conference at Mar-e-Lago, the President-elect shared that Americans were "paying far too much,. . . .much more than other countries" for healthcare. He added "We have a thing called the middle man, you know, the middle man right? The horrible middleman that makes more money frankly than the drug companies. And they don't do anything except they're a middleman." Trump says that his team will "knock out the middle man [AND HE'S] going to be very unpopular after that." According to Cramer, "I think that what, if President-elect Trump follows up about knocking out the middleman, he will. He will because these companies will eventually lose their support in Congress," as "when you have that kind of come together over them, you don't wanna be in that business." Cramer commented on the impact the President-elect's comments had and can have on the pharma benefits management industry. According to him "these companies are not, uh, without their friends. And by the way, they all resent the middlemen. Cardinal's had a lot to be able to be a little bit more forward about what can be done. McKesson is considered to be a company that has done a lot to be able to make it so smaller drug stores get product." Craner added that "the drug will all give you some great data which shows you that they are not the cause of the inflation. But they always are willing to finger, uh, United Health," and as for the environment surrounding healthcare benefit managers, "right now, I've never seen it this bad for them."

For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 90 PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a financial technology company that enables users to access alternative banking systems to make transactions. Its exposure to consumer payments means that the firm relies on economic health and spending to boost transaction volume for higher commissions. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s 400 million users worldwide not only provide the firm with a wide moat but also a sizable user base to monetize. The firm is currently leveraging user data to generate advertising revenue. Cramer believes that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the best plays in the financial technology sector: "Well, I was going to give you one that, that David introduced me to, that is, I'm crowning the new king of fintech, Paypal. Breaking out here. No, no, Barclays just joined this and pattern says basically this is better than all the others. And I think, PayPal spewing cash, this guy Alex Chriss is doing a terrific job of, February meeting, everybody will know it then. Kind of like when Marvell, everyone should have known, when Matt Murphy goes and buys a million dollars worth it's not idle. Overall, PYPL ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer just discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of PYPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Three Predictions For 2025
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/18/three-predictions-for-2025
Time Published: 2024-12-18T17:45:49Z

No one can argue with 2024 being a breakthrough year for crypto. BTC and ETH ETFs launched, BlackRock spearheaded bitcoin adoption, a pro-crypto president was elected and BTC broke the 15-year all-time-high, to name a few. But the inflection point for crypto still awaits. Here are three predictions for 2025 that can help spark it: You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. 1. DeFi is about to skyrocket DeFi is becoming more complex, much like traditional finance, in terms of its product suite. We’ve already seen this trend emerging with the adoption of products like Pendle, Ethena, EtherFi and Lombard. In 2025, DeFi usage will explode, with a wave of adoption for products such as options, swaps, and other derivatives like the interest rate swap market — the latter’s market size is at 465.9 trillion USD in TradFi. Moreover, new institutional players are entering the crypto ecosystem, nurturing a new category: On-chain finance. Participation is no longer limited to buying blue-chip cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. These market participants also actively expand on-chain market depth by using tools such as lending markets and liquidity provision with RWA-backed digital assets, i.e. stablecoins. Securitize and BlackRock are great examples of companies pushing the frontier on this front. DeFi is almost back to its all-time-high, Source: https://defillama.com/ 2. Stablecoins will continue to grow as the crypto killer use case Stablecoins aren’t just another crypto product; they’re poised to become the digital backbone of the global financial system. Tether is the most profitable crypto company with a $5.2 billion profit in H1 2024, surpassing BlackRock. The political landscape is shifting dramatically in favour of stablecoins, with Operation Choke Point 2.0 coming to an end. They are finally being viewed as a national asset that can strengthen the dominance of the U.S. dollar and address growing public debt. This shift also paves the way for major banks and payment companies like Visa and Mastercard to expand their efforts in the sector, especially when you consider Stripe’s acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1 billion (the biggest acquisition in crypto ever) and rumors of Revolut launching its stablecoin. Stablecoins market cap is at an All-Time-High already at about $200 billion, Source: https://defillama.com/stablecoins 3. The race for retail adoption ETFs will be key drivers for new capital to enter crypto. BTC ETFs are here, and soon we’ll see the success of Ethereum ETFs. After SOL’s undeniable growth over the last year, the SOL ETF will either catch the momentum and become a reality in the first half of 2025 or will delay until 2026 or later. We’ll also see major Web3 social platforms compete with the LensChain mainnet launch and Farcaster’s further expansion. As the pie grows bigger, we can end up with the "Twitter/X and Facebook of crypto" platforms. Notably, “Super Wallets” took off in Q4 2024. They aim to offer a comprehensive alternative to centralized exchanges for new users. The leading players are Infinex, launched by Kain Warwick, and DeFiApp, launched by seasoned builders in DeFi. Both are working on UX problems, something we have never done very well as an industry. Bonus prediction: MiCA will power crypto expansion in Europe Crypto regulations provide the foundations for new projects. They lay the groundwork for clear rules and guidelines of organizational structure. MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) attempts to bring just that with an aim to increase the importance of EUR-related assets. This could potentially bridge crypto innovation between the U.S. and Europe.

Title: Is The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC) the Best Cash-Rich Dividend Stock to Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) stands against the other cash-rich dividend stocks. Cash remains a critical asset, as companies with strong cash reserves tend to attract investors regardless of the economic climate. A robust cash position allows businesses to enhance shareholder value through activities such as paying dividends, buying back shares, or pursuing strategic acquisitions. That said, cash has underperformed compared to other assets, but with yields at their highest in years and economic and inflation uncertainty, many people have chosen to keep their extra funds in money markets, certificates of deposit, high-yield savings accounts, and Treasury bills. A survey conducted in July by Empower found that 49% of Americans felt more secure holding cash than other investments. The survey, which polled 1,009 US adults, also found that cash made up more than 27% of respondents' portfolios. However, financial experts like Luis Alvarado, global fixed income strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, generally recommend keeping only 3% to 5% of a portfolio in cash for emergencies and liquidity needs. Also read: 10 Best Mid-Cap Dividend Aristocrats To Buy The US financial markets are currently supported by an enormous pool of liquidity, with substantial funds held in money market accounts and other short-term investments. According to T. Rowe Price, US money market funds alone managed nearly $6 trillion in assets as of mid-December 2023—an increase of over 60% since December 2019, just before the onset of the pandemic. As of the week ending December 4, a record $6.77 trillion is held in money market funds, according to the Investment Company Institute. This amount is nearly half a trillion dollars higher than the funds held in September before the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut in four years, followed by another in November. A report from treasury advisory firm Carfang Group noted that corporate cash reserves have steadily grown since the pandemic began. The ongoing strength of the economy has enabled companies to set aside more funds and earn returns on short-term investments. As of Q1 2024, US corporations increased their cash holdings to an all-time high of $4.11 trillion, driven by a robust economy and relatively high interest rates, which enhanced returns. This represents a 12.6% increase from the same period last year and $1.28 trillion more than pre-pandemic levels. Despite market volatility driven by high interest rates and geopolitical tensions, corporate financial health has remained strong, showing resilience in the first half of the year. According to Bloomberg data, nearly 1 in 10 non-financial companies in the broader market—over 30 firms—earned more in interest income than they spent on debt expenses in the first quarter. While this figure has remained consistent with the previous year, the interest income generated by these companies has increased by approximately 60%. Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy for Bank of America Corp.’s securities business, made the following comment about the situation: “Corporates are earning more money by holding cash. Many companies are comfortable with where the economy is as well as with elevated cash levels because they are getting a return for it.” Wells Fargo suggested that income investors might consider dividend-paying stocks, noting that US large-cap companies have amassed over $2.4 trillion in cash on their balance sheets and could opt to start or increase dividend payouts. Our Methodology: For this article, we began by using a stock screener to find companies with a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio below 15. From this list, we selected companies with a market capitalization of at least $20 billion. Next, we focused on companies with the highest trailing twelve-month operating cash flows, ranking the stocks in ascending order based on their TTM operating cash flows. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A closeup of an assembly line worker inspecting a newly produced jar of condiments and sauces. Operating Cash Flow (TTM): $4.15 billion The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) ranks sixth on our list of the cash-rich stocks that pay dividends. The American food company specializes in a wide range of snacks and beverages. The company delivered mixed earnings in the third quarter of 2024, despite having fallen short of investor expectations since its 2015 merger. In the third quarter of 2024, reported $6.38 billion in revenue, reflecting a 2.85% decline compared to the same period last year. However, the company’s gross profit margin improved by 20 basis points to 34.2%. Kraft Heinz continued to prioritize investments in marketing, research and development, and technology to deliver value-driven solutions for consumers and drive future revenue growth. These efforts are supported by its proven ability to optimize operations and maintain strong cash flow. In addition, the company remains committed to growing its established and emerging food and beverage brands on a global scale. Mairs & Power also highlighted efforts made by The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “We added The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) to the Fund in the quarter. Kraft Heinz is a leading global food company which possesses a portfolio of iconic brands, including its eponymous ketchup brand. The company has been undergoing an operational transformation focused on driving efficiency gains in supply chain, manufacturing and distribution. These efficiency gains have fueled increased investments in technology, automation, innovation and marketing, which should ultimately drive more consistent organic revenue growth and high single digit earnings per share growth. We expect above-average long-term returns, buoyed by consistent free cash flow generation, opportunistic share repurchases and an attractive 4-5% dividend yield. A modest current valuation affords an ample margin of safety.” Income investors can find reassurance in the company’s strong cash position and set aside other concerns. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) reported a solid cash generation in its latest quarter. Year-to-date operating cash flow rose to $2.8 billion, a 6.7% increase from the same period last year. Free cash flow totaled $2 billion, reflecting a 9.7% year-over-year growth. In addition, the company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends over the first nine months of the year. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has an attractive dividend yield of 5.17%, as of December 16. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3 2024. In addition, Arrowstreet Capital increased its stake in the company by 31% during Q3. Overall, The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) was included in 38 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, as per Insider Monkey's database, with a total stake value amounting to over $12 billion. Overall KHC ranks 6th on our list of the cash-rich dividend stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of KHC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KHC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 2025 Predictions: Bitcoin, Sovereigns And Macro

BATH, UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 05: In this photo illustration a novelty Bitcoin token is ... [+] photographed on a US Dollar bank note, on November 5, 2023 in Bath, England. Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine, cryptocurrency analysts say millions of US dollars has so far been donated to the Ukrainian war effort through anonymous Bitcoin donations, with the Ukrainian government, and many NGOs and volunteer groups all advertising their Bitcoin wallet addresses online. However, fears have also been raised that the use of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, maybe used by the Russian government to circumnavigate the tough economic sanctions that have been imposed. (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images) There’s a new incoming administration in the U.S. that has promised a lot of changes to the status quo in 2025. Because of this, the global financial ecosystem should look very different by the end of the year. Based on plans that have already been announced, and considering the knock-on effects that they will have, we can start to paint a picture of what that future could look like, and draw some predictions of what is to come. Here are my top 5 Bitcoin and macro predictions for the year ahead, and how they could impact markets: Bitcoin will reach the price equivalent of 50 Oz of gold: Gold currently trades at $2,650/oz, and bitcoin trades at $106,000. At the time of writing, it takes ~40 Oz of gold to buy one bitcoin. I believe bitcoin will continue to appreciate in gold terms, and will reach a price equivalent to 50 oz of gold. At current gold prices, this would equate to a BTC price of $132,500. In other words, Bitcoin will increase in value as measured in gold, not just as measured in dollars. I expect to see a slew of portfolio recommendations coming out of ETF issuers’ research desks and registered investment advisors, recommending a portfolio allocation for bitcoin. Not dissimilar to the one that was recently published by Blackrock. The recent report from Blackrock about bitcoin stated “investors may prefer to use it tactically to hedge against specific risks, similar to gold.”. If you are a fully allocated investor looking to rotate into a bitcoin position, you may be inclined to downsize your gold position to make room, as you’re investing the “digital” version of it. At least one G20 country will propose a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: While everyone in the Bitcoin community is rightfully excited about the potential of the U.S. creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, the geopolitical dominos have started falling, and they will continue to fall whether the U.S. pulls the trigger or not. Countries like El Salvador and Bhutan already have bitcoin reserves, and their reserves have appreciated materially over recent years. Healthy financial reserves that are uncensorable and have no counterparty risk means more geopolitical leverage for a nation state. Others will want to replicate this success. There are several recent examples of presidential candidates running on a “Bitcoin” platform in countries like Suriname and Poland, and there’s been Bitcoin Reserves proposals already submitted in countries like Brazil and Japan. I believe at least one more G20 country will announce plans for a Bitcoin Strategic reserve during 2025. Bitcoin Miner Crackdown: As countries begin to understand the strategic significance of stacking bitcoin, they will turn their heads into how it is produced, and will learn that underutilized or underproductive energy sources can be tapped into to generate bitcoin. In parallel, they will look at those currently mining bitcoin domestically for public private partnerships. I expect to see the creation of regulatory bodies to oversee bitcoin mining in several countries. I also expect to see some countries aggressively going after “unregistered” miners that don’t comply with their regime or rules. We saw this happen in Venezuela last year, we could see similar behaviour in other countries throughout 2025. U.S. Dollar Stablecoin Surge: Between Circle and Tether combined, they hold approximately $136 Billion in U.S. debt today, which makes them the 18th largest holder of U.S. debt in the world. USD stablecoins can grow into very large buyers of U.S. debt at a time when the Federal Reserve is desperately looking to deleverage its balance sheet (i.e. they need to sell some of their bond holdings). And they are always looking for buyers to roll over their debt. I expect the Trump administration to recognize this and quickly move to regulate U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins like Circle and Tether to solidify them as a sort of strategic partners that can help the U.S. drive further penetration of the U.S. dollar, and be active buyers of U.S. national debt. This environment should allow for the market capitalization for USD-pegged stablecoins to more than double from ~$200 B today to ~$500 B by the end of 2025. The Euro will trade below par to the USD: There are many layers to this reasoning and prediction, but let’s focus on macro and crypto drivers for now. Generally speaking, the EU is growing at a much slower rate than the U.S. in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) terms. Year to date, the EU has grown by +0.8%, whereas the U.S. has grown by +2.8%. Because of this, analysts predict that the EU will have to cut interest rates more aggressively than the U.S. Federal Reserve during 2025. This will put pressure on the Euro. Further, looking at it from a crypto lens, the highly anticipated MiCA crypto regulatory framework will become active in the EU on December 30th 2024. While there are positives to having regulatory clarity for the industry, along with clear investor and consumer protections for users, the ruleset can be complex and expensive for a young startup to comply with. In parallel, the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. has signalled a pro-crypto shift in the U.S. regulatory bodies, and it has reinvigorated a conversation among founders in the space to relocate back to the U.S. or set up operations in the country. This could draw future innovation and investment from Europe in the crypto sector, adding to further weakness in the Euro. While the Euro has traded above the U.S. dollar over the last 20 years or so, I would not be surprised to see another multi-year period where it trades below the U.S. dollar. That’s my top 5 for 2025. We’ll keep an eye on markets and I’ll be back next December to see how we did! One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: 2025 Predictions: Bitcoin, Sovereigns & Macro
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mauriciodibartolomeo/2024/12/18/2025-predictions-bitcoin-sovereigns--macro/

BATH, UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 05: In this photo illustration a novelty Bitcoin token is ... [+] photographed on a US Dollar bank note, on November 5, 2023 in Bath, England. Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine, cryptocurrency analysts say millions of US dollars has so far been donated to the Ukrainian war effort through anonymous Bitcoin donations, with the Ukrainian government, and many NGOs and volunteer groups all advertising their Bitcoin wallet addresses online. However, fears have also been raised that the use of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, maybe used by the Russian government to circumnavigate the tough economic sanctions that have been imposed. (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images) There’s a new incoming administration in the U.S. that has promised a lot of changes to the status quo in 2025. Because of this, the global financial ecosystem should look very different by the end of the year. Based on plans that have already been announced, and considering the knock-on effects that they will have, we can start to paint a picture of what that future could look like, and draw some predictions of what is to come. Here are my top 5 Bitcoin and macro predictions for the year ahead, and how they could impact markets: Bitcoin will reach the price equivalent of 50 Oz of gold: Gold currently trades at $2,650/oz, and bitcoin trades at $106,000. At the time of writing, it takes ~40 Oz of gold to buy one bitcoin. I believe bitcoin will continue to appreciate in gold terms, and will reach a price equivalent to 50 oz of gold. At current gold prices, this would equate to a BTC price of $132,500. In other words, Bitcoin will increase in value as measured in gold, not just as measured in dollars. I expect to see a slew of portfolio recommendations coming out of ETF issuers’ research desks and registered investment advisors, recommending a portfolio allocation for bitcoin. Not dissimilar to the one that was recently published by Blackrock. The recent report from Blackrock about bitcoin stated “investors may prefer to use it tactically to hedge against specific risks, similar to gold.”. If you are a fully allocated investor looking to rotate into a bitcoin position, you may be inclined to downsize your gold position to make room, as you’re investing the “digital” version of it. At least one G20 country will propose a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: While everyone in the Bitcoin community is rightfully excited about the potential of the U.S. creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, the geopolitical dominos have started falling, and they will continue to fall whether the U.S. pulls the trigger or not. Countries like El Salvador and Bhutan already have bitcoin reserves, and their reserves have appreciated materially over recent years. Healthy financial reserves that are uncensorable and have no counterparty risk means more geopolitical leverage for a nation state. Others will want to replicate this success. There are several recent examples of presidential candidates running on a “Bitcoin” platform in countries like Suriname and Poland, and there’s been Bitcoin Reserves proposals already submitted in countries like Brazil and Japan. I believe at least one more G20 country will announce plans for a Bitcoin Strategic reserve during 2025. Bitcoin Miner Crackdown: As countries begin to understand the strategic significance of stacking bitcoin, they will turn their heads into how it is produced, and will learn that underutilized or underproductive energy sources can be tapped into to generate bitcoin. In parallel, they will look at those currently mining bitcoin domestically for public private partnerships. I expect to see the creation of regulatory bodies to oversee bitcoin mining in several countries. I also expect to see some countries aggressively going after “unregistered” miners that don’t comply with their regime or rules. We saw this happen in Venezuela last year, we could see similar behaviour in other countries throughout 2025. U.S. Dollar Stablecoin Surge: Between Circle and Tether combined, they hold approximately $136 Billion in U.S. debt today, which makes them the 18th largest holder of U.S. debt in the world. USD stablecoins can grow into very large buyers of U.S. debt at a time when the Federal Reserve is desperately looking to deleverage its balance sheet (i.e. they need to sell some of their bond holdings). And they are always looking for buyers to roll over their debt. I expect the Trump administration to recognize this and quickly move to regulate U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins like Circle and Tether to solidify them as a sort of strategic partners that can help the U.S. drive further penetration of the U.S. dollar, and be active buyers of U.S. national debt.

Title: Is Jantzi Social Index ETF (XEN) the Best Canadian ETF to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Canadian ETFs to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Jantzi Social Index ETF (TSX:XEN) stands against other best Canadian ETFs to buy. After a slow start in 2024, the Canadian stock market saw a strong third quarter, fueled by domestic rate cuts and a recovery in global markets. Year-over-year headline inflation has cooled to align with the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2%. As a result, policymakers have implemented four consecutive rate cuts, with an additional 50 basis point reduction anticipated in December. With the central bank expected to keep cutting interest rates to support the economy, stock market strategists are cautiously optimistic that the rally will continue. In this context, Brent Joyce, chief investment strategist at BMO, shared the following: “The environment is very attractive for equities. It’s been this trifecta of better global growth, interest-rate-sensitive companies themselves, and the interest rate sensitivity of dividends. These were headwinds for the two years that rates were going up, [but they] have flipped into tailwinds for the Canadian stock market now that rates are falling.” While most stocks are influenced by global factors, many companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange are also cyclically driven, meaning their performance is closely tied to the economy and the business cycle. Given the strong connection between the US and Canadian economies, stable growth in the US has provided a boost to Canadian equities. On that front, Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis Research, advises clients to allocate 5% of their equity portfolio to Canadian stocks, making it the second-largest weighting after the 69% recommended for US stocks. The S&P/TSX Composite Index is on track to have its best year since 2009, having set new records 42 times this year and risen 21.09% year-to-date, closely following the S&P 500’s 27.58% gain. Hayes highlighted the broad rally and noted that the market is largely driven by energy and financial stocks, which offer the highest trailing and forward earnings yields, contrasting with the tech sector’s lower yields. On the other hand, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump rattled the markets earlier in November with a proposal to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, aimed at addressing drug trafficking and border issues, along with a 10% tariff on imports from China. This decision had an immediate impact on Canada’s energy sector, which experienced a 2.2% decline amid concerns that rising US crude production would meet domestic demand. At the same time, the Canadian dollar dropped to its lowest level against the US dollar since May 2020, sparking worries about potential inflationary pressures on imports. While the future remains uncertain, the Canadian ETF industry, which began with the world’s first ETF launched in Canada in 1990, has shown notable resilience over the past 30+ years, and continued growth is expected in the years to come. Despite the market volatility this year, Canadian ETFs have managed to navigate the challenges effectively and are well-positioned for another strong year. With only a couple of weeks remaining in the year, the industry is on track to surpass the previous annual record of $58 billion set in 2021. Moreover, following recent data from IFIC showing Canadian ETF sales reached their third-best month ever in October, a new report from research firm ETFGI highlights additional gains in November, along with impressive year-to-date figures. The firm reported net inflows of US$7.5 billion in November, slightly down from the C$8.2 billion reported in IFIC’s October report, but still a strong performance that contributes to the 29th consecutive month of net inflows. Our Methodology We have selected the top Canadian ETFs to buy and hold based on their 5-year performance as of December 10, listed in ascending order for clarity. Additionally, we’ve highlighted the top holdings of each ETF to provide valuable insights for potential investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stocks 5-year Share Price Performance as of December 9, 2024: 47.29% The iShares Jantzi Social Index ETF (TSX:XEN), managed by BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited, is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of the Jantzi Social Index. The fund focuses on stocks of companies recognized for socially responsible business practices. Over the past year, XEN delivered a total return of 24.93%, with an average annual return of 6.11% since inception, including dividends. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) is one of the ETF’s largest holdings. In the third quarter of 2024, the company achieved record-breaking results, producing 863,000 ounces of gold at cash costs of $921 per ounce, meeting its annual projections. The strong performance was driven by operational efficiency and cost control, enabling the company to return approximately $700 million to shareholders and reduce net debt by $1 billion, lowering it to $490 million. Revenue grew by 31% to $2.2 billion, while adjusted EBITDA increased by 64% to $1.26 billion. On November 21, Jefferies initiated coverage of Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM), assigning a Hold rating and an $85 price target. The firm praised the company’s robust operational performance, cost management, and high-quality asset portfolio. Additionally, margin expansion is expected as Agnico Eagle develops underground ore sources at its Canadian Malartic and Detour Lake mines, which will provide access to higher-grade materials. Overall, XEN ranks 8th on our list of best Canadian ETFs to buy. While we acknowledge that XEN, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XEN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A person with a cell phone who is looking for new stocks 5-year Share Price Performance as of December 9, 2024: 45.75% The Fidelity Canadian High Quality ETF (TSX:FCCQ) aims to mirror the performance of the Fidelity Canada Canadian High Quality Index. As of December 9, it holds net assets of $214.4 million and has a management expense ratio of 0.39%. This ETF focuses on equity securities from large- and mid-cap Canadian companies, emphasizing higher-quality profiles compared to the broader Canadian equity market. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) holds the largest position in this Fidelity ETF. On December 4, Loop Capital upgraded the company’s stock from Hold to Buy, citing its innovative use of artificial intelligence to enhance merchant tools and optimize internal operations. The brokerage also raised its price target to $140, representing a 23% potential upside. Loop Capital emphasized that these AI-driven advancements are enabling Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) to grow revenue faster than expenses, improving operating and free cash flow margins. With consistent annual sales growth exceeding 20%, the company is well-positioned to enhance profitability and valuation further. Additionally, Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) reported record-breaking Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) sales of $11.5 billion, a 24% increase from the previous year. This robust performance suggests the company is on track to meet or surpass consensus expectations for fourth-quarter Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) growth, currently forecasted at 23.5%. Rowan Street Capital, an investment management company, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) has been an incredibly rewarding investment for those lucky enough to get in early after the company’s initial public offering (IPO) in 2015. The shares have delivered a return of 2,600% or 42% annual. Its revenues have grown at 49% per annum since the end of 2014 from $105 million to estimated $8.6 billion in 2024. The massive e-commerce market is a huge opportunity, as the company’s growth indicates. As you tell from the chart below, revenues are forecasted to grow above 20% for the next 3 years. Keep in mind, Shopify has been around for more than a decade — and it’s still growing at these high rates. Overall, FCCQ ranks 9th on our list of best Canadian ETFs to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of FCCQ, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Important AI Announcements for Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other important AI announcements for investors. Blue Whale Growth, the investment fund supported by billionaire Peter Hargreaves, has reduced its holdings in major US tech firms, mentioning concerns over their substantial AI-related spending. Financial Times reported that fund manager Stephen Yiu highlighted a significant reduction in Microsoft shares, which dropped out of the fund’s top ten holdings for the first time since 2017. He noted that the return on invested capital for the company might decline due to AI investments and hinted at potentially exiting the stock entirely if AI costs exceed cash generation. The “Magnificent Seven” tech giants have faced growing scrutiny over their rising capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, with Wall Street increasingly wary about returns. Yiu has also reduced stakes in Meta and previously exited Amazon and Alphabet, expressing concerns over AI-driven spending outpacing profitability, the report states. While the fund remains optimistic about Nvidia, which now represents around 10% of its portfolio, Yiu expressed less confidence in the other six companies. He also supports Broadcom, benefiting from AI infrastructure development. According to the report, Blue Whale Growth, managing £1.3 billion, has returned 24% this year, outperforming peer funds, but has reduced its exposure to US tech stocks significantly compared to benchmarks.

In stark contrast to the caution seen in Western markets, Southeast Asia’s emerging economies are racing to establish themselves as key players in the global AI landscape. According to CNBC, the region benefits from a youthful, digitally savvy population and growing government support for AI initiatives. While Singapore has already made significant strides in AI adoption, other countries, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia, are also accelerating efforts to harness AI for a range of industries, from agriculture to manufacturing. This growing focus on AI offers immense potential for economic growth, creating new jobs and boosting productivity. However, as these countries ramp up their AI strategies, they face challenges related to infrastructure, digital literacy, and the need for skilled workers. As experts point out, the AI race in Southeast Asia is not just about adoption but about tailoring technology to the region’s unique needs. Despite the hurdles, the region is positioning itself as a promising center for AI innovation, and many expect that ASEAN’s commitment to AI could help its economies thrive in the global tech ecosystem. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son is making a bold move to accelerate AI development globally. Son plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, with a significant focus on artificial intelligence and related infrastructure. His goal is to create 100,000 AI-related jobs before the end of President-elect Donald Trump’s term, as reported by Reuters. Known for his strong advocacy for AI, Son has already made notable investments in AI companies such as OpenAI and Graphcore, further signaling his commitment to the sector’s growth. This massive investment, paired with Southeast Asia’s rising AI ambitions, highlights the growing global momentum behind artificial intelligence. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 235 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is focused on developing products that promote global connectivity and communication. The company is making significant investments in AI, applying it to its language models and integrating it into its AR/VR technologies. Meta (NASDAQ:META) has urged California’s attorney general to block OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit company, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. In a letter, Meta argued that allowing OpenAI to shift its business model could set a troubling precedent, enabling startups to enjoy nonprofit benefits until reaching profitability. Meta warned that this could lead to unfair advantages for investors, who would receive the same financial gains as those in traditional for-profit ventures while also benefiting from tax breaks intended for nonprofits. Overall, META ranks 3rd on our list of important AI announcements for investors. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We recently compiled a list of the Top 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other AI stocks. There is a growing concern in Silicon Valley that the progress around artificial intelligence is slowly “losing steam”. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa explores whether AI progress is slowing, and what it means for the industry. Early signs of struggle are bubbling up in major tech names. As highlighted by Bosa, the first sign of things slowing down has been a lack of progression between models. OpenAI has led the pack in AI advancements, with each of the new models of ChatGPT exponentially better than the last.

However, the initial vision is being scaled back. “While Orion’s performance ended up exceeding that of prior models, the increase in quality was far smaller compared with the jump between GPT-3 and GPT-4, the last two flagship models the company released, according to some OpenAI employees who have used or tested Orion”. The same roadblocks have been happening to other AI models, such as that by Anthropic. Just like OpenAI, Anthropic is also witnessing a timetable slip for the release of its long-awaited Claude model called 3.5 Opus. "The AGI bubble is bursting a little bit. It's become clear that 'different training approaches' may be needed to make AI models work really well on a variety of tasks." Even some of the big tech giants aren't enthusiastic about the progress AI has been making. Speaking during the New York Times annual DealBook summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center, Sundar Pichai stated how generative AI won’t be changing lives in 2025— at least, not more than it already has. “I think the progress is going to get harder. When I look at [2025], the low-hanging fruit is gone. The hill is steeper ... You’re definitely going to need deeper breakthroughs as we get to the next stage”. However, if progress is plateauing, it has to do with scaling laws. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei states that the scaling laws are a misnomer. He emphasizes that while these patterns have historically guided AI development—suggesting that increasing data and computational power leads to improved AI capabilities—they are not guaranteed to continue indefinitely. As such, AI companies have been turning to synthetic AI, i.e. data generated artificially. The Information reports that Orion was produced based on synthetic data. However, the problem has been that low-quality data, in turn, leads to low-quality performance. As such, with leading tech companies poised to unveil new models over the next eighteen months, their pace of progress—or lack thereof—has the potential to dramatically redefine the dynamics of the competition.

Title: Swiss fintech startup tiun raises $2.5 million to modernise media monetision

tiun, a fintech helping media providers to attract, engage and convert younger audiences, is today announcing a $2.5 million pre-seed funding round led by Founderful. The funds will kick-start their efforts to become Europe's preferred way to pay for online media. 0 18 December 2024 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. In particular, the tiun team is focused on onboarding new business partnerships and integrations with third-party payment methods i.e. digital wallets. These will simultaneously provide media platforms with exposure to previously untapped audiences while also allowing a new generation of users to access and pay for media by “tiuning in”, offering more convenience and flexibility while being more secure.The tiun team believes that consuming and paying for online content should be simple and that users shouldn’t need to create a new account, give up personal information, provide credit card details and subscribe - every time they find a new media platform. Especially among young users, the tedious process of registering and subscribing is not considered “convenient” anymore. tiun offers media companies easy-to-integrate solutions that allow a new means of authentication and payment to provide world-class user experiences that drive millions of users, and increase customer spending and engagement.Swiss VC firm Founderful led the round, which also included Blue Wire Capital and a16z scout Maximilian Lehmann, among other angel investors. tiun was founded in early 2023 by the experienced co-founder trio Nikolaos Christoforakos, Christian Heiduschke and Sandro Zweig. Ex-BlackRock Zweig previously led a fintech product development agency that boasted Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank amongst its clientele. Christoforakos provides tiun with expertise in go-to-market strategies having previously helped scale teams at the likes of Amazon and Moss. Lastly, Heiduschke has almost a decade of experience in building scalable, robust SaaS products, having originally achieved a Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering from ETH Zurich. Born out of a shared frustration at being hit with paywalls the team quickly agreed there must be an alternative, more user-friendly way of charging for media, which doesn’t require the repetitive surrendering of personal data, and began work on a solution. tiun Co-founder Nikolaos Christoforakos explains, “There’s a clear disconnect between the modern way we expect to consume media and how media is bought and paid for today. The subscription model was invented to bring convenience to consumers, preventing them from having to pay for every item they wanted to consume. This worked too for the media providers, who got consumer loyalty in return - so the model grew exponentially. That same experience can in today’s world often be a hindrance for a young user to convert and become a loyal customer. tiun intends to build that bridge by working closely with media businesses, in a way which will significantly benefit both consumers and media businesses.”tiun enters the market at a time the news media industry is in financial freefall. A lack of revenue is causing significant layoffs throughout the industry. Estimates by the Press Gazette suggest that 2,500 media jobs have been cut in the US and UK this year alone. Big-name takeovers in the US haven’t yet solved the problem, either. Over the past decade, Jeff Bezos, Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong, and Marc Benioff bought The Washington Post, LA Times, and Time Magazine, respectively. Despite their backing, those three publications alone lost an estimated $150 million in 2023. tiun builds the infrastructure that allows younger audiences to connect their wallet with an online service in a few clicks to access and pay for media, allowing them to pay for the time they consume. Pascal Mathis, Partner at Founderful, says, "The internet has become the dominant way by which people consume media. Be it television, printed media, the radio, or physical CDs, one by one the internet has triumphed by facilitating a smoother, simplified user experience. The one area online media has failed to address, however, is effective monetization, deterring users with inconvenient and fragmented methods. Tiun removes these hurdles, creating seamless connections between consumers and providers. We're thrilled to support the team in solving this challenge at such an early stage."The tiun team sees vast potential in the solution in all kinds of media beyond written news, including streaming, and gaming. The company has already onboarded 50+ media titles across Central Europe, which are making use of the infrastructure.The tiun infrastructure can track activity and end the session if there is no movement after a given time, preventing users from overspending. To incentivize uptake, tiun limits the amount media providers can charge users to a maximum of 20% of what a monthly subscription would cost. Once those limits are reached, the remainder of the month is free. The data and insights gathered by the platform can be used to inform media strategies to ensure media is as engaging as possible. Bertie Highmore, Head of Investments at Blue Wire Capital says, “The tiun team have extensive experience in - and demonstrated ability for - building, launching and scaling digital platforms. Strong appetite has already been shown for their product, which solves one of the biggest emerging issues in online media. We’re excited to be on board, and are looking forward to what will be a huge next twelve months for them.”The tiun team is delighted to raise its initial funding round to develop a first-of-its-kind solution to modernize the way online media providers charge for their services. The team will share a series of exciting updates in the coming year.

Title: Ardonagh Reaches $14 Billion Valuation With Stone Point Investment

The deal will see Greenwich, Connecticut-based Stone Point become a “significant minority shareholder” in Ardonagh, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information wasn’t public. Stone Point’s stake will likely be in the 15% to 20% range in the secondary equity sale, which valued Ardonagh at 16 to 17 times its annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, one of the people said. Ardonagh was last valued at $7.5 billion when Abu Dhabi Investment Authority invested in the firm in late 2021. It is majority-owned by private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners. Private credit specialist HPS Investment Partners, set to be acquired by BlackRock Inc., owns a minority stake in Ardonagh. The deal is the latest in insurance broking that signals large-scale transactions are heating up in the industry, with both private equity and strategic buyers hunting for assets in the fragmented market. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co agreed to buy AssuredPartners in a $13.45 billion deal this month, its largest-ever acquisition. In September, Marsh McLennan agreed to buy McGriff Insurance Services in a $7.8 billion cash transaction, also its biggest. Founded in 2017 from the combination of broker Towergate and four other entities, London-based Ardonagh has become one of the world’s 20 largest brokers in recent years. It generated pro-forma income of $1.9 billion in 2023. Over the past three years alone, Ardonagh bought 13 businesses in markets including Brazil, Spain and Italy. This year, it bought Australia’s PSC Insurance Group for an implied equity value of A$2.3 billion ($1.5 billion), taking it private and combining it with its Envest business. Private Credit Ardonagh is also a large borrower in the $1.6 trillion private credit market, having secured what was the largest-ever loan from a group of private credit funds in 2020. Last year, Ares Management Corp. provided a direct-lending package worth about £1 billion ($1.3 billion) to support the sale of its personal insurance business to Markerstudy. Ardonagh’s latest funding is likely to prompt speculation about any next steps Howden Group, another major UK insurance broker, might take to boost growth. The company, founded by David Howden 30 years ago, has long been considered a likely candidate for an initial public offering. The firm had an enterprise value of $13 billion in 2022. It is owned by 5,200 employee-shareholders, private equity firms General Atlantic and Hg, Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec as well as the Howden Foundation.

The United States is gearing up to be the leader in artificial intelligence technology. However, other nations are also intensifying their efforts to compete in this rapidly advancing field. To challenge the United States’ dominance in this critical technology, Russia has recently pledged to participate in the global race for artificial intelligence actively. READ ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm and Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings Speaking at Russia’s flagship AI conference last week, President Vladimir Putin said Russia would develop artificial intelligence with BRICS partners and other countries. According to Putin, the new AI Alliance Network would include national associations and development institutions in the field of AI from BRICS countries and other interested states. He also claimed that the country must participate equally in the global AI race. “Russia must participate on equal terms in the global race to create strong artificial intelligence. It is precisely the advanced solutions that Russian scientists are currently working on. We invite scientists from all over the world to join in the collaboration”. Russia has been subject to Western sanctions which have been directed to restrict the country’s access to technologies it needs in the war against Ukraine. As a result, some of the world’s major producers of microchips have halted exports to Russia, limiting its AI ambitions. Reuters reports how Russia’s dominant lender Sberbank, who is currently leading the AI development in Russia, admits that the microchips underpinning AI development are the trickiest hardware to replace. In this regard, it noted how national AI associations from BRICS members Brazil, China, India, South Africa, Serbia, Indonesia, and other non-BRICS countries, had joined the AI Alliance Network. The network will be working toward joint research in technology and AI regulation, offering opportunities for AI products to be sold in other member countries’ markets. Currently, the leading AI powers of the world are the United States and China. It goes without saying that Russia’s alliance with China has the potential to significantly reshape the future landscape of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, the US is also gearing up to continue leading in AI. President-elect Donald Trump has already appointed an AI and Crypto Czar. Trump is also set to repeal President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that uses advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On December 13, Reuters reported that The Trump transition team wants the incoming administration to drop a car-crash reporting requirement opposed by Elon Musk’s Tesla. The requirement, if dropped, would weaken the government’s ability to investigate and regulate the safety of vehicles that come with automated driving systems. Tesla is going to benefit the most from the removal of this provision, as the company has reported more than 1,500 crashes to federal safety regulators under the program. This has led to multiple federal investigations. The recommendation to eliminate the rule came from a transition team that was responsible for producing a 100-day strategy for automotive policy. According to the team, the rule is considered a requirement for “excessive” data collection, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.

We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News You Shouldn’t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) stands against other top AI news you shouldn’t miss. The United States is gearing up to be the leader in artificial intelligence technology. However, other nations are also intensifying their efforts to compete in this rapidly advancing field. To challenge the United States’ dominance in this critical technology, Russia has recently pledged to participate in the global race for artificial intelligence actively. READ ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm and Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings Speaking at Russia’s flagship AI conference last week, President Vladimir Putin said Russia would develop artificial intelligence with BRICS partners and other countries. According to Putin, the new AI Alliance Network would include national associations and development institutions in the field of AI from BRICS countries and other interested states. He also claimed that the country must participate equally in the global AI race. “Russia must participate on equal terms in the global race to create strong artificial intelligence. It is precisely the advanced solutions that Russian scientists are currently working on. We invite scientists from all over the world to join in the collaboration”. Russia has been subject to Western sanctions which have been directed to restrict the country’s access to technologies it needs in the war against Ukraine. As a result, some of the world’s major producers of microchips have halted exports to Russia, limiting its AI ambitions. Reuters reports how Russia’s dominant lender Sberbank, who is currently leading the AI development in Russia, admits that the microchips underpinning AI development are the trickiest hardware to replace. In this regard, it noted how national AI associations from BRICS members Brazil, China, India, South Africa, Serbia, Indonesia, and other non-BRICS countries, had joined the AI Alliance Network. The network will be working toward joint research in technology and AI regulation, offering opportunities for AI products to be sold in other member countries’ markets. Currently, the leading AI powers of the world are the United States and China. It goes without saying that Russia’s alliance with China has the potential to significantly reshape the future landscape of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, the US is also gearing up to continue leading in AI. President-elect Donald Trump has already appointed an AI and Crypto Czar. Trump is also set to repeal President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI. Trump plans to repeal Biden’s AI order to reduce regulatory constraints, fostering rapid innovation and maintaining the U.S. edge in the global AI race.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cardio Diagnostics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDIO) stands against the other AI stocks. There is a growing concern in Silicon Valley that the progress around artificial intelligence is slowly “losing steam”. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa explores whether AI progress is slowing, and what it means for the industry. Early signs of struggle are bubbling up in major tech names. As highlighted by Bosa, the first sign of things slowing down has been a lack of progression between models. OpenAI has led the pack in AI advancements, with each of the new models of ChatGPT exponentially better than the last. READ NOW: 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm and Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings Unfortunately, the same can’t be said about today. OpenAI's highly anticipated model Orion was expected to be a ground-breaking system bringing us closer to AGI. However, the initial vision is being scaled back. “While Orion’s performance ended up exceeding that of prior models, the increase in quality was far smaller compared with the jump between GPT-3 and GPT-4, the last two flagship models the company released, according to some OpenAI employees who have used or tested Orion”. The same roadblocks have been happening to other AI models, such as that by Anthropic. Just like OpenAI, Anthropic is also witnessing a timetable slip for the release of its long-awaited Claude model called 3.5 Opus. "The AGI bubble is bursting a little bit. It's become clear that 'different training approaches' may be needed to make AI models work really well on a variety of tasks." Even some of the big tech giants aren't enthusiastic about the progress AI has been making. Speaking during the New York Times annual DealBook summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center, Sundar Pichai stated how generative AI won’t be changing lives in 2025— at least, not more than it already has. “I think the progress is going to get harder. When I look at [2025], the low-hanging fruit is gone. The hill is steeper ... You’re definitely going to need deeper breakthroughs as we get to the next stage”. However, if progress is plateauing, it has to do with scaling laws. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei states that the scaling laws are a misnomer. He emphasizes that while these patterns have historically guided AI development—suggesting that increasing data and computational power leads to improved AI capabilities—they are not guaranteed to continue indefinitely. As such, AI companies have been turning to synthetic AI, i.e. data generated artificially. The Information reports that Orion was produced based on synthetic data. However, the problem has been that low-quality data, in turn, leads to low-quality performance. As such, with leading tech companies poised to unveil new models over the next eighteen months, their pace of progress—or lack thereof—has the potential to dramatically redefine the dynamics of the competition.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Important AI Announcements for Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) stands against other important AI announcements for investors. Blue Whale Growth, the investment fund supported by billionaire Peter Hargreaves, has reduced its holdings in major US tech firms, mentioning concerns over their substantial AI-related spending. Financial Times reported that fund manager Stephen Yiu highlighted a significant reduction in Microsoft shares, which dropped out of the fund’s top ten holdings for the first time since 2017. He noted that the return on invested capital for the company might decline due to AI investments and hinted at potentially exiting the stock entirely if AI costs exceed cash generation. The “Magnificent Seven” tech giants have faced growing scrutiny over their rising capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, with Wall Street increasingly wary about returns. Yiu has also reduced stakes in Meta and previously exited Amazon and Alphabet, expressing concerns over AI-driven spending outpacing profitability, the report states. While the fund remains optimistic about Nvidia, which now represents around 10% of its portfolio, Yiu expressed less confidence in the other six companies. He also supports Broadcom, benefiting from AI infrastructure development. According to the report, Blue Whale Growth, managing £1.3 billion, has returned 24% this year, outperforming peer funds, but has reduced its exposure to US tech stocks significantly compared to benchmarks.

In stark contrast to the caution seen in Western markets, Southeast Asia’s emerging economies are racing to establish themselves as key players in the global AI landscape. According to CNBC, the region benefits from a youthful, digitally savvy population and growing government support for AI initiatives. While Singapore has already made significant strides in AI adoption, other countries, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia, are also accelerating efforts to harness AI for a range of industries, from agriculture to manufacturing. This growing focus on AI offers immense potential for economic growth, creating new jobs and boosting productivity. However, as these countries ramp up their AI strategies, they face challenges related to infrastructure, digital literacy, and the need for skilled workers. As experts point out, the AI race in Southeast Asia is not just about adoption but about tailoring technology to the region’s unique needs. Despite the hurdles, the region is positioning itself as a promising center for AI innovation, and many expect that ASEAN’s commitment to AI could help its economies thrive in the global tech ecosystem. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son is making a bold move to accelerate AI development globally. Son plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, with a significant focus on artificial intelligence and related infrastructure. His goal is to create 100,000 AI-related jobs before the end of President-elect Donald Trump’s term, as reported by Reuters. Known for his strong advocacy for AI, Son has already made notable investments in AI companies such as OpenAI and Graphcore, further signaling his commitment to the sector’s growth. This massive investment, paired with Southeast Asia’s rising AI ambitions, highlights the growing global momentum behind artificial intelligence. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Title: The Economics of Investor Engagement

Institutional investors such as mutual funds, pension funds, and exchange traded funds (ETFs) play a prominent role in today’s economy. According to the CFA Institute, institutional investors now hold over $70 trillion in investable assets and thus wield immense influence over the corporations they invest in. But how do these institutions actually exercise their power? The most nuanced and direct way for investors to interact with their portfolio firms is through shareholder engagement, where they communicate with corporate managers to share their perspective, suggest changes, or gather information. In a new study, we quantify the costs, benefits, and economy-wide impact of engagement by some of the largest institutional investors in the world. Engagement activities range from writing letters to CEOs and joining meetings to pressing for better governance or environmental practices. Unlike voting or selling shares, engagement is a private dialogue, making it a less-easily observed but potentially more powerful and nuanced tool. By addressing issues directly with corporate leaders, investors aim to improve company performance – and, in turn, the value of their investments. The institutions in our sample each employs a dedicated stewardship team that engages with hundreds or even thousands of portfolio firms every year. Despite its importance, we know surprisingly little about the economics of engagement. How much does it cost? What are the benefits? How much value does it create? Using novel data on investor engagement drawn from the yearly stewardship reports of eleven large institutional investors including BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, and T. Rowe Price, we quantify these economic forces for the first time. We find that institutional investors act as if spending $10,000 on engagement increases a company’s value by 0.3 basis points (bps), or 0.003 percent, on average. While that may sound small, when scaled by trillions of dollars in market capitalization and assets under management, the potential benefits are significant. However, engagement isn’t free; the stewardship team requires significant resources to research the issues and conduct meetings with corporate leaders. We find that both the costs and benefits vary depending on the firm being engaged. Smaller companies are slightly more expensive to engage with but offer much higher returns on engagement, an average 5.5 basis point expected increase in firm value. Yet institutional investors engage less with smaller firms because they hold smaller positions in those firms, limiting the potential payoff. We also find that engagement costs are higher for firms with entrenched management, where presumably resistance from leadership makes it harder to drive change. The economics of engagement also depend on the type of fund that is engaging. Active funds – those that try to outperform the market by actively picking stocks – are more likely to engage than index funds, which simply aim to match the performance of an index like the S&P 500. Surprisingly, this difference isn’t because active funds are inherently better at engagement. In fact, we find that active and index funds create equal amounts of expected value when they engage. Rather, it’s a question of incentives. Index funds charge lower fees, meaning they capture a smaller share of the value created through engagement. As a result, despite their larger positions and more diversified holdings, they engage less. Yet as passive investing continues to dominate the market, the role of these funds in engagement is becoming more pronounced. Index funds tend to hold larger stakes in companies simply because of their huge size, which increases their potential to create value when they do engage. Using simulations, we examined what would happen if passive investing continued to grow, reaching 90 percent of all mutual fund assets. We find that index funds would engage more often, driven by their even larger holdings, and generate substantial value for both their investors and society. Our estimates suggest that index funds have flat economies of scale: Tracking an index does not become more difficult as the fund grows. As a result, the continuing rise of passive investing increases the total societal benefits of their engagement. On the other hand, our estimates show that active investors face diseconomies of scale that limit their effectiveness as they grow. As an actively managed fund attracts more resources, it becomes harder to identify and act on profitable opportunities that move the needle. As Warren Buffett once said, “Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling. The highest rates of return I’ve ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. It’s a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money.” Smaller active funds can engage more selectively and effectively. In our simulations, active funds actually create more value for society when they shrink. At the same time, active fund managers and investors certainly don’t want their funds to shrink, and we might expect them to fight this trend, for example by lowering their fees or introducing new active investing options. Our findings add new dimensions to the debate about the future of investing and corporate governance. Engagement clearly has the potential to create significant value, but its benefits are unevenly distributed. Index funds, with their flat economies of scale, may increasingly fill the gap left by shrinking active funds, creating a system where the societal value of engagement could rise even if the payoff to individual funds and investors are smaller. The study also highlights the challenges of aligning private incentives with social benefits. While active funds are more motivated to engage under current fee structures, index funds generate broader social gains as they grow. This mismatch creates a tension between what’s best for active fund managers and their investors and what’s best for the economy as a whole. More broadly, our findings imply that engagement is a relatively hidden but powerful tool for increasing firm value – one that benefits not just large institutions, but the broader economy, too. As the balance between active and passive investing shifts, so will the dynamics of how institutional investors engage with the companies they own.

Ringgenberg at the University of Utah. It is based on their recent article, “The Economics of Investor Engagement,” available here. Your email address will not be published.
