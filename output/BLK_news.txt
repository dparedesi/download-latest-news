Come for the politics, stay for the snark. by Adam L Silverman| January 7, 202611:41 pm| 16 Comments This post is in: Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, Military, Open Threads, Russia, Silverman on Security, War, War in Ukraine I know it’s been a long, tragic, horrifying, day that has everyone one a fine edge, so I’m just going to run through the basics really quickly and call it a night. I do want to start with this excerpt from Lincoln’s speech at the Cooper Union: Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the Government, unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution as you please, on all points in dispute between you and us. You will rule or ruin in all events. Back to the topic at hand. Imagine that: US did NOT SIGN the Paris “letter of intent” that describes how peace in Ukraine will be monitored by the US while Europe provides troops etc – distancing itself from the EU. In fact, US hasn’t signed anything that the coalition of willing has agreed to.

And as usual, we’re not going to see it. However we’ve not got Jared’s sex pest convicted extortionist father involved in trying to shake down the Ukrainians: Now Kushner Sr is part of these “discussions”? US hasn’t signed a single document that the coalition of the willing signed yesterday. In particular, the one where US is mentioned to be “overseeing” potential ceasefire. Come on. Too many words to say that you discussed Blackrock owning UA assets. [image or embed] — Olga Nesterova (@onestpress.onestnetwork.com) January 7, 2026 at 10:51 AM I’m pretty sure that if you could explain what the Kushner family has become and then ask the Bielskys whether it was worth the risk to rescue Jared’s grandparents, they’d say no. President Zelenskyy did not make a daily address today as he was again traveling. In this case to a meeting of the Council of Europe where he made an address to that body. Video below, English transcript after the jump. 7 January 2026 – 21:44 Thank you very much! Mr. President – Nikos, thank you for today’s visit, for the invitation, and our conversation. First of all, what I want to say, we are grateful to Denmark for its presidency. And we respect its territorial integrity and sovereignty. And we appreciate the beginning of the Cyprus presidency. And we respect its territorial integrity and sovereignty. We are Ukraine, please respect our territorial integrity and sovereignty. And dear Mr. President – Nikos, Ursula, António, our friends, thanks for today’s meeting! Dear Maia! Presidents and Excellencies! I’m glad to be here as Cyprus begins its presidency of the Council of the European Union. And this is a presidency we all expect a lot from. For Ukraine, this moment is really very, very meaningful – just as it is for Cyprus – a member state that, unfortunately, remains divided, but committed to lasting peace – and is fully equal in Europe. And a country that may be smaller in size but has an equal voice in European institutions. This says a lot about what Europe truly is – that every nation matters, and every free country in Europe deserves to be part of our shared European home. And that is what makes Europe stable and peaceful. Ukraine also deserves this – to be an equal part of our common European home. And we hope that your presidency will be productive in moving us forward on this path. Nikos and I discussed this today. It is very important that Ukraine is among the priorities of the Cyprus presidency. And we are grateful for what the President has said – that we should aim to open negotiation clusters at the same time during your presidency – for both, of course, for both, Ukraine and our friends – Moldova. And this is a strong and positive ambition. And during your presidency, we hope to see the start of the implementation of the €90 billion support package for Ukraine – funding that strengthens our resilience, and with it, the resilience of all of Europe. And thank you again, Ursula, thank you, António, thank you for your support, and all the European leaders, for the decision, a very important decision – how to save Ukraine, it means how to save Europe. We need a practical mechanism that will allow these funds to truly help Ukraine. This mechanism must be designed not to create problems, of course, but to reduce the challenges we already face. And we are doing everything required on our side in the negotiation process, and we expect that no additional or excessive demands will be placed on Ukraine. At the same time, as Cyprus begins its presidency, peace negotiations have reached a new level of intensity. We work very, very actively – Ukraine, our European partners, and of course, the United States, and all members of our Coalition of the Willing – from Canada to Japan, from the EU to Australia. And it is possible – and we sincerely hope – that this war could end during your presidency. And of course, only if enough pressure is put on the aggressor. And we all understand how wars like this one – Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, our people, our children – come to an end. And when pressure is strong enough to exhaust the source of the war, peace comes. That pressure exists now, and the EU plays a key role in maintaining it. And I thank you for your willingness to help. Sanctions on Russia, support for Ukraine, strengthening our defense together – all of this works for peace, of course. And we have discussed – at the EU level, within the Coalition of the Willing, and in our bilateral work with Cyprus – that sanctions need to be upgraded. A new package is being prepared. And many steps are being taken to target Russia’s shadow fleet, and this will work. Every dollar Russia loses is a dollar that does not fuel the aggressor. It’s extremely important that we continue receiving support – both for our defense and for our diplomacy – equally from all parts of Europe. That’s why your support matters to us – your recent visit to Ukraine, Mr. President, and the unity we’re showing now, at the start of the Cyprus presidency. This year, one of the new European initiatives, very important – the SAFE program – must also prove its effectiveness. If it succeeds, Europe will become stronger. And in many ways, this depends on your presidency, Mr. President. And we hope that together with you – with Cyprus and with every EU country – we can work productively, of course. And I wish you a very successful presidency. I truly hope that during these months, Europe will become stronger, of course, and that people across our continent will feel that tomorrow can be safer, more stable, and better than today. I also deeply believe that together, we can help deliver one of the most important guarantees of peace and security – for our nation and for the whole of Europe – Ukraine’s membership in the European Union. Thank you so much.

He grew up within the overlap of the Cuban revolutionaries that emerged from the Bay of Pigs fiasco and then became central players in the narco-cartels. Rubio is where he is today because a carteled up local high net worth individual in Miami wanted his own state legislator and then US Senator. So Lil Narco was protected from the crimes he himself committed while others were sacrificed to the criminal justice system. Trump posted on his social network that without his involvement, Russia would now own all of Ukraine. And it seems he’s still bitter about not being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. [image or embed] — WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated.bsky.social) January 7, 2026 at 11:09 AM First, NATO Article 5 has only been invoked once. By the US after 9-11. And everyone in NATO provided some form of support. Second, the reason that the Russians don’t own all of Ukraine is because of the efforts of the Ukrainians with assistance from many others, including, but not limited to the US. Assistance, however, that does not, has not, and will not include actual military assistance as in having allies send their forces to come and fight alongside the Ukrainians. Third, what US assistance had been provided, which was always too little and far too often too late, has now essentially been stopped by Trump and his natsec team. “No new air defense systems have arrived from the U.S.; missiles are coming in bit by bit, but we want to speed it up.” – Zelenskyy. — WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated.bsky.social) January 7, 2026 at 8:14 AM Trump has had a wild day and evening on social media, I’m not going to get into the rest.

YY_Sima Qian January 8, 2026 at 12:13 am The Danish military says rules of engagement if the US tries to invade Greenland is shoot 1st, ask questions later. This is progress. Although they may want to place the US military personnel currently stationed in Greenland under surveillance. AlaskaReader January 8, 2026 at 12:14 am Thanks Adam YY_Sima Qian January 8, 2026 at 12:22 am Trump also claimed on Truth Social that he wants the defense budget to go from US$ 1T to US$ 1.5T. Leaving aside whether Congress will agree to fund such a massive increase (& I hope the Congressional Dems will be united in opposing such an increase), most of the pathologies the US military & MIC suffer from cannot be solved by shoveling more units of exchange into the machine. More funding can increase pay, that could help w/ recruitment & retention. More funding can boost stockpiling of spare parts, & that could help w/ equipment availability. Beyond that, the US faces real constraints in industrial capacity & human capital. Unless those bottlenecks are eased 1st (which takes years, if not decades), more money just means faster price inflation for weapons & munitions. See cost of tertiary education in the US. Spending 5% of GDP while the PRC spends < 2%, from a position of significant disadvantage in industrial capacity (weapons manufacturing accounts for 25% of all US manufacturing, vs. 4% in the PRC) & human capital, is also a recipe for a Soviet like decline. The bond market might also balk at taking on so much more debt, though you can bet the reactionaries will also leverage the “necessity” of military spending to gut social welfare further. The late stage Soviet Union vibes keep getting stronger & stronger. Adam L Silverman January 8, 2026 at 12:26 am @Westyny: You’re welcome. Adam L Silverman January 8, 2026 at 12:26 am @YY_Sima Qian: Saw that. Adam L Silverman January 8, 2026 at 12:26 am @AlaskaReader: You’re welcome. Adam L Silverman January 8, 2026 at 12:26 am @YY_Sima Qian: They could just revoke the lease on the base and deport the US personnel there. Aziz, light! January 8, 2026 at 12:27 am Deleted. Adam L Silverman January 8, 2026 at 12:27 am @YY_Sima Qian: That was one of those other wild posts on social media I alluded to, but decided not to cover. Along with whatever instructions he’s issued by EO to defense contractors. YY_Sima Qian January 8, 2026 at 12:34 am @Adam L Silverman: That’s the next rung up the escalation ladder. Also, I think the US still brings critical capabilities to monitor Russian naval & air activities going into North Atlantic, I am not sure Denmank or European NATO is ready to just take over those capabilities & responsibilities. Europe is indeed between a rock & a hard place, so we have the farcical situation of Europe desperate trying to keep the US engaged in Ukraine, but also desperately trying to keep the US out of Greenland. As you’ve written repeatedly, Trump does not want to engage in Ukraine. Perhaps it is time Europe comes to grip w/ that fact, & stop trying to placate Trump. If Trump is willing to continue to sell US made weapons & munitions to Europe, for Europe to then donate to Ukraine, that is probably the best that can be hoped for. YY_Sima Qian January 8, 2026 at 12:35 am @Adam L Silverman: Yeah, for now it is just sh*t posting from Trump. Jay January 8, 2026 at 12:48 am Thank you, Adam.

Title: Why WisdomTree pulled its XRP ETF just as institutional demand peaked
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/why-wisdomtree-pulled-its-xrp-etf-just-as-institutional-demand-peaked/
Time Published: 2026-01-08T02:00:41Z

WisdomTree used Rule 477 to avoid a public SEC setback, raising deeper questions about regulatory pressure. In the first week of 2026, XRP has taken center stage, becoming one of the most talked-about assets in the market. Analysts are calling it the “hottest trade” of the year, as it quickly outpaced Bitcoin’s early gains thanks to strong ETF inflows and its appeal as a less crowded alternative. But just as the momentum reached a fever pitch, a sudden regulatory U-turn has reminded investors that institutional adoption is rarely a straight line. According to an RW filing with the U.S. SEC, WisdomTree has formally withdrawn its registration statement for the WisdomTree XRP Fund (Form S-1). While “withdrawal” might sound like hitting a simple delete button, invoking Rule 477 serves as a strategic legal safeguard. Under the Securities Act of 1933, this rule lets an issuer pull a registration statement before it becomes effective and before any securities are sold. In this case, WisdomTree withdrew its Form S-1, originally filed on 2nd December 2024. By asking the Commission to withdraw “all exhibits and amendments,” WisdomTree has also reset its regulatory clock. This move also stops the SEC from issuing a formal “order of stop” or a public rejection, outcomes that could create a lasting negative precedent for the firm’s future crypto ambitions. It noted, “The Trust is requesting withdrawal of the Registration Statement because it has determined not to proceed at this time with the offering covered by the Registration Statement.” In the meantime, it can be said that WisdomTree’s retreat aligns with the standards set by BlackRock, though there’s no clear evidence to support that. Despite the frenzy of the 2026 altcoin ETF rush, BlackRock has remained absent from the XRP and Solana [SOL] race, appearing content to maintain its dominance solely within the Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] markets. This comes at a time when XRP ETFs are breaking records. On the 6th of January alone, XRP ETFs recorded $19.12 million in net inflows, with Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ recording $7.35 million in inflows, followed by Canary’s XRPC with $6.49 million and Bitwise with $3.54 million. Yet, despite a Cumulative Total Net Inflow sitting at a staggering $1.25 billion, the asset’s price action tells a different story. At press time, XRP slipped to $2.25, marking a 4.9% drop in just 24 hours. However, while some institutions are pulling back, others remain historically bullish. In a significant note to clients last year, Standard Chartered issued one of the most aggressive calls for the altcoin, setting a bold price target of $8 by the end of 2026. Geoff Kendrick, the bank’s Head of Digital Assets Research, put it best when he said, “Improving U.S. regulatory clarity has made it easier for institutions to take exposure and has given Ripple and the XRP ecosystem room to build without constant litigation risk.” With an $8 target implying approximately 300% upside from current support levels, the stakes for 2026 couldn’t be higher.

Title: Outlook 2026: Chaos and Control

“Adde parvum parvo magnus acervus erit.” –Ovid Do you like the world around you? Are you eager to take another trip around the sun? Like it or not. Eager or not. The New Year is here… We intend to make the best of it. We suppose you do too. Where to begin? Silver delivered some excitement to close out the year. After skyrocketing past $80 per ounce, the grey metal (Ag) has been on a volatile ride between liquidity squeezes and midnight margin calls. Behind the scenes, naked shorting – the fraudulent move where big banks sell silver they haven’t even borrowed – pushed the financial system to the breaking point. When prices spiked, these paper bets got torched. To maintain solvency, it is suspected the banks took to the overnight repo market for instant cash to cover their short positions. This may have provided a temporary solution. But the Federal Reserve, via the overnight repo market, cannot print silver. It can merely extend credit. We believe the market disorder that hit the day after Christmas will return in the New Year. And it’s only a matter of time before one of the big banks will be caught swimming with its pants down. As we enter 2026, it’s quite evident that the global landscape stands at a precarious crossroads. From our vantage point in Southern Appalachia, we see the convergence of a bursting technological bubble, a seismic shift in geopolitical aggression, and a radical transformation of the very nature of money and securities. Through ongoing discussions with our friend Dick, we’ve distilled this down to roughly four themes we expect will dominate in 2026. These four themes are presented herein. And, as a special bonus for reading to the end, we’ve included a practical recommendation for off-grid survival. So put on your favorite work boots – the older the better – and grab a shovel. It’s time to dig into the New Year’s edition of the Economic Prism. First off… There will be a broad realization in 2026 that the rapid buildout of AI has been a giant waste of money. That the trillions of dollars in capital piled into data centers and chips has been set on fire. This realization will appear in the form of a mega, AI driven stock market crash and associated debt crisis and economic contraction. We’re not predicting the end of AI. We’re merely suggesting that AI is something much different than what’s been advertised. Without question, AI can and will support many useful applications. When integrated into processes and systems where outcomes are dependent on data and logically defined protocols, AI has demonstrated abilities to quickly complete tasks. However, returns from the development of AI enabled tools are nowhere near what’s needed to justify the capital being expended. A recent study from MIT, for example, found that 95 percent of enterprise AI pilots fail to deliver a measurable return on investment. AI tools and applications may ultimately become ubiquitous. But unless something dramatically changes with the technology, above and beyond addressing degradation and hallucinations, AI will never be a form of actual intelligence or a replacement for the human ability to ask questions, innovate, and invent. Robert Gore, at Straight Line Logic, explains: “At root, the problem is that although AI can answer a seemingly infinite number of questions, it can’t ask a single one. It can be programmed to spot and attempt to resolve conflicts within data, but it doesn’t autonomously ask questions. From birth, the human mind is an autonomous question generator; it’s how we learn. […]. Curiosity and questions are the foundation of learning and intelligence. Reading even a page of something interesting or provocative will generate questions. Generative AI ‘reads’ trillions of pages without an iota of curiosity. No one who either hails or warns of AI surpassing human intelligence (HI) has explained how it will do so while bypassing the foundation of HI.” This critical defect is why AI will not live up to the expectations placed upon it. Moreover, when the realization hits that AI isn’t the immediate productivity miracle promised, the $5 trillion valuations we’re seeing will evaporate. Since AI-related stocks drove nearly 80 percent of market gains in 2025, a tech correction will trigger a broad market crash. As capital dries up, companies will cut spending and jobs, leading to a sharp recession or depression. The central planners in government generally respond to economic depressions in three ways. Through printing massive amounts of money, starting or escalating wars, or fabricating a pandemic. The money printing serves to bail out the big banks while a burgeoning war or faux pandemic, with the right propaganda, distracts the population from the problems at home, while also justifying massive money printing. This leads us to our next theme for 2026… For years, the focus was on the Forever Wars of the Middle East. Then it was the ongoing proxy war with Russia via Ukraine. But as we head into 2026, the Trump administration has executed a massive strategic pivot. The new front line? Venezuela. White House advisor Stephen Miller recently set the tone for this new focus with intense rhetoric on the history of Venezuelan energy. He stated: “American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela. Its tyrannical expropriation was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property. These pillaged assets were then used to fund terrorism and flood our streets with killers, mercenaries and drugs.” By highlighting the nationalization of oil as a direct theft from the American people, the White House makes a moral and legal case for more aggressive intervention and gunboat diplomacy. Under Operation Southern Spear, the U.S. has moved a massive naval force into the Caribbean, including the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group. Over the last few months, the U.S. has conducted dozens of maritime strikes against what it says are narco-terrorist vessels. In reality, this strategic focus on Venezuela has little to do with drugs and has everything to do with Venezuelan oil exports to China. President Trump has effectively declared a maritime blockade, with the Navy now authorized to seize sanctioned tankers. This is because despite heavy sanctions, China remains the primary buyer of Venezuelan crude, importing roughly 570,000 barrels per day. By blockading these waters, the U.S. isn’t just targeting the Maduro government of Venezuela. It’s cutting off a critical energy artery for Beijing. The administration’s Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine essentially warns that the Western Hemisphere is closed to Chinese strategic investment. The New Cold War is about more than semiconductors and TikTok. The waters off the coast of Venezuela are now the location of the global power struggle between Washington and Beijing. China isn’t just a casual observer in Caracas. It is the country’s greatest financier. Over the last two decades, Beijing has poured over $60 billion into Venezuela, much of it structured as ‘oil-for-loan’ deals. When Stephen Miller talks about the “tyrannical expropriation” of American assets, he’s also pointing to who moved in after the U.S. left (i.e., China). By keeping the Maduro government afloat with infrastructure projects and debt extensions, China secured a strategic foothold in the Western Hemisphere – in what the U.S. traditionally considers its backyard. Operation Southern Spear is a direct shot at China’s energy security. The U.S. is now physically seizing tankers like the Centuries, which was intercepted in late December carrying nearly 2 million barrels of oil bound for China. By stopping these shipments, President Trump is forcing Beijing to choose between backing Venezuela and risking a direct naval confrontation or losing billions in invested capital and an important source of oil. As this escalates in 2026, it will provide cover for the U.S. government to, once again, radically change the form and feel of money, which is our next theme for 2026. Several weeks ago, we talked about how the GENIUS Act, which was signed into law by President Trump on July 18, 2025, requires stablecoins to be backed one-for-one by U.S. dollars or other low-risk assets, primarily short-term U.S. Treasuries. We noted that this policy commences the next shift in American money. If you haven’t been keeping up with this development, join the club. The idea of stablecoins becoming a de facto digital dollar, and creating massive new demand for U.S. Treasuries, sounds enigmatic. Perhaps this is why hardly anyone is talking about it. Quite frankly, we don’t like the idea and would rather ignore it. But, alas, this is happening whether we like it or not. And it will be a major theme in 2026. Stablecoins, as we understand them, are issued by private entities not by central banks. They are not a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Their issuance is driven by market demand, not monetary policy. When stablecoin issuers back their tokens with Treasury securities, they own the Treasury asset. Any interest payments from those Treasuries go to the issuer because the issuer holds the asset. In fact, the GENIUS Act prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest or yield directly to stablecoin holders as part of the stablecoin product. The GENIUS Act also requires a stablecoin issuer to publicly disclose reserves each month certified by executives. Larger issuers face additional auditing requirements. To add confusion, there are stablecoins that operate outside of the jurisdiction of the U.S. and are not compliant with the GENIUS Act. Tether, for example, issues a popular stablecoin called USDT and maintains a stable value pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. Tether, at the same time, has essentially told Uncle Sam and its GENIUS Act to pound sand. Rather than backing its tokens exclusively with U.S. Treasuries, as required by the Genius Act, Tether keeps a chunk of its reserves in bitcoin and precious metals. In Q3 2025, Tether was the biggest buyer of gold, buying more gold than any central bank. Also, rather than providing audits, per the GENIUS Act, Tether prefers quarterly attestations. And, because it’s headquartered in El Salvador, it doesn’t meet the US-based requirement. Does that mean that USDT is better or worse than the USDC stablecoin issued by Circle, which is based in the U.S. and fully compliant with the GENIUS Act? Perhaps Tether’s existence as an offshore international digital dollar that operates outside of the U.S. government’s control, and with some of its reserves in gold, is an advantage. This, too, could be its demise. Remember, the Trump administration’s objective with the GENIUS Act is to create a new source of Treasury demand funded by private issuers so that America’s massive debt can be financed and an explicit default can be avoided. This is a power preserving adaptation. Tether is out of line with this objective. We believe the next shock event – economic recession, war escalation, or another pandemic – will serve as a midwife to stablecoin implementation. People rarely change their financial habits when things are going well. It takes a shock to compel them from an old system into a new one. Stablecoins, for instance, could be the perfect vehicle for sending and receiving government stimulus checks. They could also provide refuge during a banking crisis, where people can hold their cash outside the traditional fractional-reserve banking system. This will also come with countless hazards. Systemic risks of a run on stablecoin reserves and how this spills over into the Treasury market are still unknown. In short, as with all financial assets, and especially the new, untested variety, if stablecoin adoption accelerates, diversification across various stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, is advised. Lastly, stablecoins factor into another one of our themes for 2026… Asset tokenization has been in the works for many years. If you recall, during the covid pandemic mania of 2020-21, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) of art or collectibles became all the rage. The use of blockchain technology to record ownership allowed NFTs to be bought, sold, and traded. This technological application caught the attention of the big financial directors. Not for art and collectibles, but for major financial assets. Larry Fink, the chairman and CEO of BlackRock, said in January 2024: “We believe the next step going forward will be the tokenization of financial assets, and that means every stock, every bond … will be on one general ledger.” Asset tokenization, in short, is the process of turning a real-world building, a stock, a bond, or a gold bar into a digital chip. And stablecoins are the money used to play the game. Before the GENIUS Act, big banks were hesitant to touch tokenization because they didn’t have a legal version of digital cash to use for settlement. The GENIUS Act created Payment Stablecoins (like the compliant version of USDC). Now, a bank like JPMorgan can tokenize a US Treasury bond and feel safe accepting a compliant stablecoin as payment, knowing the coin meets federal reserve and audit standards. What’s more, a tokenized bond using stablecoins can be issued without a single human accountant being involved. Imagine a corporation wants to borrow money. Instead of a traditional bank loan, they issue a Tokenized Bond on the blockchain. First, the corporation sets up a Smart Contract for the bond. The contract could say: “I am borrowing 1,000,000 USDC. I will pay 5 percent interest annually. Payments happen every 30 days.” In the traditional banking world, a bank would have to manually calculate interest for thousands of bondholders and mail checks or process wires. In the tokenized world, at midnight on the payment date, the Smart Contract takes a digital snapshot of every wallet holding the bond tokens. It instantly calculates how much interest each person is owed. The contract then automatically pulls the interest amount from the corporation’s stablecoin reserve and pushes it into the bondholders’ wallets in USDC. As we said at the outset, we don’t like the idea of stablecoins becoming a de facto digital dollar. Its advancement via the GENIUS Act is for the purpose of allowing the federal government to keep running up massive deficits. We consider this to be deceitful. We’d rather ignore it. But we can’t. The legislative framework is in place, and the big banks are moving forward. At this point we have more questions than answers. Namely, by tokenizing assets, which can then be traded, and can act as collateral, won’t the growth of money explode? What will this do to consumer price inflation, and the value of dollars people hold in their traditional bank accounts? There are also issues of privacy. The complete digitization of money and tokenization of assets comes with full system surveillance and tracking. How will a person’s spending be tracked? Will spending be tied to a social credit score with preprogrammed allowances and restrictions? Will the loss of financial privacy destroy what’s left of freedom and liberty for American citizens? What are the systemic risks inherent to building such a complex digital financial world? What happens if there’s a major black sky event where power and communications are disrupted for an extended period of time, whether from a geomagnetic storm, cascading grid failure, or a coordinated cyber-attack? No doubt, we’ll be monitoring and tracking the greater adoption of stablecoins and development of asset tokenization as they take shape throughout the year. We’ll look to adapt accordingly, while also maintaining diversification across both old money and new money systems. Certainly, maintaining wealth that is completely off-grid and outside of the banking system, like physical gold and silver, is of critical importance. Before we close, we’d like to leave you with one practical action you can take to prepare for war, inflation, or the breakdown of an ever-increasing complex digital world. Assuming you have food storage, and some basic backup power such as a simple battery storage system that can charge with portable solar panels, there is the critical, and often overlooked need for micronutrients. After two weeks, no matter how much protein and carbs you have, you need micronutrients for your brain and body, or you start losing mental clarity, strength, and a well-functioning digestive system. The simple solution is sprouting. When the time comes, the ability to be a ‘jar farmer’ to sustain health via sprouts will be essential. To get started, take a look at Sprout People. There you will find a great education section and a large variety of nutrients you probably never imagined could be sprouted.

Title: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP ETFs Are Back: Over $800 Million Signal Investor Return

Time Published: 2026-01-07T22:00:17Z
Full Content:
The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP ETFs are seeing renewed institutional interest to start the year, providing a bullish outlook for the crypto market. This development comes amid BTC’s rally above $90,000, with the flagship crypto now targeting new 2026 highs. SoSoValue data shows that the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP ETFs saw over $800 million in daily net inflows on January 5. The BTC ETFs took in $697.25 million, led by BlackRock and Fidelity’s fund. This inflow was notably the largest since the October 10 crypto crash, marking a huge positive for the Bitcoin price. Notably, BTC has reached a 2026 high above $94,000 amid these inflows, with sustained demand likely contributing to higher prices. Furthermore, the Ethereum ETFs recorded daily net inflows of $168.13 million, building on the $174.43 million inflows on January 2. The net inflows recorded on January 2 were the largest since December 9. These inflows of the ETH ETFs come as ETH staking demand rises, with the staking entry queue now over 200x larger than the staking exit queue. This is significant as the institutional and staking demand could both contribute to a supply shock for the ETH price. Meanwhile, just like the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the XRP ETFs also recorded significant inflows on January 5. These funds took in $46.10 million on the day, marking their highest flows in the last month. It is worth noting that these XRP funds have not recorded daily net outflows since they launched in November. This has likely contributed to XRP’s outperformance following Bitcoin’s rally above $90,000 to start the year. The altcoin currently boasts a year-to-date (YTD) gain of just over 20%, outperforming all crypto assets in the top 10 ranking except Dogecoin. In an X post, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the Bitcoin ETFs are coming into 2026 like a lion. This came as he noted that they had taken in over $1.2 billion in the first two trading days of the year, with every fund seeing considerable flows. Based on this, the Bloomberg analyst noted that they are on pace to take $150 billion in inflows in 2026. “If they can take in $22b when it’s raining, imagine when the sun is shining,” he added. Meanwhile, Balchunas stated that the total 2026 flows for these Bitcoin ETFs will depend on price. Although he noted it wasn’t a formal prediction, the Bloomberg analyst mentioned that they could take in between $20 and $70 billion in inflows if the BTC price underperforms. On the other hand, if BTC rises to around $130,000 and $140,000, Balchunas believes that the ETFs could record up to $70 billion in inflows this year.

Title: Trump to ban large institutional investors from buying up single-family homes

Posted on 01/07/2026 11:43:41 AM PST by ducttape45 Trump to ban large institutional investors from buying up single-family homes Trump said that he would discuss the announcement further at his speech in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is taking immediate steps to ban large institutional investors from purchasing additional single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has pushed homeownership out of reach for many Americans. In a post shared Tuesday afternoon, Trump said buying and owning a home was long considered “the pinnacle of the American Dream,” but claimed that record-high inflation under the Biden administration and congressional Democrats has made that goal increasingly unattainable, particularly for younger Americans. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,” Trump wrote. “But now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people.” Trump said he would move to prohibit large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes and urged Congress to codify the policy into law. “People live in homes, not corporations,” he wrote. Trump also noted that he would discuss the announcement at his speech in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. Large institutional investors now control a meaningful share of America’s single-family housing stock, a trend that has accelerated over the past decade. Research compiled from Zillow, Redfin, CoreLogic, and the American Enterprise Institute shows that institutional investors own roughly 3–4 percent of all US single-family homes, translating to more than 500,000 houses nationwide. While that may appear modest at the national level, the concentration is far higher in certain metro areas, particularly in fast-growing Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, and Charlotte. Investor activity surged following the 2008 financial crisis and spiked again during the pandemic-era housing boom. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency and Redfin data, investors accounted for 25–30 percent of home purchases in some markets during peak periods in 2021 and 2022. A significant portion of those purchases came from large corporate buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, many of which targeted lower-priced and entry-level homes suitable for conversion into single-family rentals. Housing analysts note that institutional ownership is disproportionately focused on the rental market, where growth has been strongest. CoreLogic estimates that the institutional single-family rental sector nearly tripled in size between 2012 and 2024. Studies from the Urban Institute and AEI have linked heavy investor activity to reduced housing supply for first-time buyers, faster price appreciation, and rising rents in markets with high corporate concentration.

The on the ground issue will aways be that that large investors have much more capital and can bid the price of a property up beyond the ability of the local purchaser. The irony is that much of the capital used to price the homes out of market tolerance comes from retirement funds which some of might have come from the exact community. 15 posted on 01/07/2026 12:10:34 PM PST by vg0va3 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: ducttape45 EXCELLENT!

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is taking immediate steps to ban large institutional investors from purchasing additional single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has pushed homeownership out of reach for many Americans. In a post shared Tuesday afternoon, Trump said buying and owning a home was long considered “the pinnacle of the American Dream,” but claimed that record-high inflation under the Biden administration and congressional Democrats has made that goal increasingly unattainable, particularly for younger Americans. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,” Trump wrote. “But now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people.” Trump said he would move to prohibit large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes and urged Congress to codify the policy into law. “People live in homes, not corporations,” he wrote. Trump also noted that he would discuss the announcement at his speech in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. Large institutional investors now control a meaningful share of America’s single-family housing stock, a trend that has accelerated over the past decade. Research compiled from Zillow, Redfin, CoreLogic, and the American Enterprise Institute shows that institutional investors own roughly 3–4 percent of all US single-family homes, translating to more than 500,000 houses nationwide. While that may appear modest at the national level, the concentration is far higher in certain metro areas, particularly in fast-growing Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, and Charlotte. Investor activity surged following the 2008 financial crisis and spiked again during the pandemic-era housing boom. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency and Redfin data, investors accounted for 25–30 percent of home purchases in some markets during peak periods in 2021 and 2022. A significant portion of those purchases came from large corporate buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, many of which targeted lower-priced and entry-level homes suitable for conversion into single-family rentals. Housing analysts note that institutional ownership is disproportionately focused on the rental market, where growth has been strongest. CoreLogic estimates that the institutional single-family rental sector nearly tripled in size between 2012 and 2024. Studies from the Urban Institute and AEI have linked heavy investor activity to reduced housing supply for first-time buyers, faster price appreciation, and rising rents in markets with high corporate concentration.

Trump also noted that he would discuss the announcement at his speech in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. Large institutional investors now control a meaningful share of America’s single-family housing stock, a trend that has accelerated over the past decade. Research compiled from Zillow, Redfin, CoreLogic, and the American Enterprise Institute shows that institutional investors own roughly 3–4 percent of all US single-family homes, translating to more than 500,000 houses nationwide. While that may appear modest at the national level, the concentration is far higher in certain metro areas, particularly in fast-growing Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, and Charlotte. Investor activity surged following the 2008 financial crisis and spiked again during the pandemic-era housing boom. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency and Redfin data, investors accounted for 25–30 percent of home purchases in some markets during peak periods in 2021 and 2022. A significant portion of those purchases came from large corporate buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, many of which targeted lower-priced and entry-level homes suitable for conversion into single-family rentals. Housing analysts note that institutional ownership is disproportionately focused on the rental market, where growth has been strongest. CoreLogic estimates that the institutional single-family rental sector nearly tripled in size between 2012 and 2024. Studies from the Urban Institute and AEI have linked heavy investor activity to reduced housing supply for first-time buyers, faster price appreciation, and rising rents in markets with high corporate concentration.

Research compiled from Zillow, Redfin, CoreLogic, and the American Enterprise Institute shows that institutional investors own roughly 3–4 percent of all US single-family homes, translating to more than 500,000 houses nationwide. While that may appear modest at the national level, the concentration is far higher in certain metro areas, particularly in fast-growing Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, and Charlotte. Investor activity surged following the 2008 financial crisis and spiked again during the pandemic-era housing boom. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency and Redfin data, investors accounted for 25–30 percent of home purchases in some markets during peak periods in 2021 and 2022. A significant portion of those purchases came from large corporate buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, many of which targeted lower-priced and entry-level homes suitable for conversion into single-family rentals. Housing analysts note that institutional ownership is disproportionately focused on the rental market, where growth has been strongest. CoreLogic estimates that the institutional single-family rental sector nearly tripled in size between 2012 and 2024. Studies from the Urban Institute and AEI have linked heavy investor activity to reduced housing supply for first-time buyers, faster price appreciation, and rising rents in markets with high corporate concentration.

President Trump wants to stop large companies and investors from buying single-family homes because it makes housing expensive and hard to buy for normal Americans. He says owning a home is part of the American Dream. Big real estate investors have bought many homes, pushing prices up. Trump will share more housing ideas at Davos.

Title: Trump says he’s banning institutional investors from scooping up single-family homes

President Trump said Wednesday he will seek to ban large investors from buying and then renting out single-family homes – in a bold attempt to tackle the US housing crisis. Trump did not say exactly how his plan would work, but it represents a major new initiative to lower the cost of homeownership after roughly a decade of large investors and private-equity firms buying up hundreds of thousands of single-family homes. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “It is for that reason, and much more, that I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations.” Trump said he would discuss the ban – along with other affordability efforts – at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. Shares in Invitation Homes, the largest renter of single-family homes in the country, plunged 6% after Trump’s announcement. Blackstone and Apollo Global Management also fell roughly 6% and 5%, respectively. Invitation Homes and Apollo Global Management did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. After the 2008 financial crisis sent home prices nosediving, major investment firms swooped in to buy up the leftover inventory – often purchasing properties in bulk at foreclosures. Housing advocates have argued that widespread corporate ownership can reduce supply and inflate prices, pushing homeownership even further out of reach. In early 2025, investors of all sizes – including a small sliver of larger firms – accounted for roughly 30% of single-family US home purchases, according to a report from CJ Patrick Co. But in certain cities, investment firms hold much larger chunks of what historically would be starter homes – accounting for more than 20% of all home sales in Houston, Miami, Phoenix and Las Vegas during the pandemic, for example. In 2024, institutional investors owned 25% of rental homes in Atlanta and 18% in Charlotte, according to a US Government Accountability Office analysis. Stephen Schwarzman’s Blackstone is among those hoovering up homes – last year controlling more than 230,000 units as the largest private-equity owner of US apartments, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group. A Blackstone spokesperson told The Post the company has been a net seller of homes for the past decade and its holdings are down by more than one-fifth. “That said, we believe our current portfolio is poised to continue to perform quite well and operate at the highest standards for residents,” the spokesperson added. These Wall Street bigwigs often come equipped with huge all-cash offers, making it difficult for first-time buyers to compete. These pressures – combined with falling construction rates and pandemic-era strains – pushed the national median single-family home price to $426,800 in the third quarter of 2025, according to the most recent data from the National Association of Realtors. It hit a record high of $435,300 over the summer. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily. In another troubling sign for America’s residential real estate market, the median age for a first-time homebuyer hit 40 years olds in 2025, according to the NAR. That’s up from 38 years old in 2024 and 33 in 2020. First-time buyers accounted for just 21% of all US home purchases in 2025 – a new record-low, the NAR said. It’s unclear if Trump’s ban on institutional investor homebuying is possible without congressional approval. “I understand the purpose is to remove corporate competition to keep home prices more affordable, and that is a good intention, but it will be very hard to execute,” Melissa Cohn, regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage, told The Post. Trump has sought to blunt Democrats’ election-year criticism of his economic records with a number of other proposals intended to lower costs — including using tariff threats to pressure pharmaceutical companies to lower their prices and vowing to do the same with oil and health insurance firms. He has also pressured the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates at a faster pace and called for streamlining construction rules. Advertisement

Title: Terrified Investors Are Bracing for an AI Bubble “Reckoning”

By Victor Tangermann Published Jan 7, 2026 1:08 PM EST Fears over a growing AI bubble that could wipe out the entire economy if it were to burst continue to mount. For many months now, investors and even tech leaders have openly been discussing the possibility — but if or when such a collapse could take place remains a subject of heated debate. Nonetheless, investors are already preparing for that type of major tech sell-off, the Financial Times reports. The reporting shows that plenty of fear and uncertainty remain over the untold billions of dollars being poured into wildly unprofitable AI ventures — a dynamic that’s seen AI companies’ valuations skyrocket to record heights, despite dubious prospects of ever turning a profit. Some are pulling back on their investments in major tech stocks, while others are outright betting on eventual drops in share prices. “Whether there are excesses… in the equity market on AI is no longer questionable, but to figure out which exact companies will be the losers and when this reckoning will happen is difficult,” fund management firm Amundi chief investment officer Vincent Mortier told the FT. One investment fund, Blue Whale Growth, sold its Microsoft and Meta stock in the second quarter of last year, with chief investment officer Stephen Yiu telling the newspaper that “we are concerned about the return on investment in some cases, while some of the valuations are insane — especially in private markets.” GQG Partners chair Rajiv Jain added that “AI’s massive cash burn remains elevated with very little profitability in sight.” His fund sold all of its Magnificent Seven — investor shorthand for Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia — holdings. “Though we had less exposure to a few Mag 7 names throughout 2025, we exited our remaining positions by early November because the risks of an AI bubble blow-up are growing, in our view,” he said. At the same time, many remain unafraid of an imminent collapse. “We don’t believe that we are in a bubble,” BlackRock international chief investment officer Helen Jewell told the FT, “but investors should prepare for a bumpy ride in 2026.” Despite plenty of concerns among investors, banks remain optimistic about future growth. Wall Street has predicted double-digit gains this year. The S&P 500 has surged a whopping 92 percent since October 2022, posting double-digit returns for three years in a row now. “2026 should be another strong year for AI stocks, with capex likely to surpass expectations,” JPMorgan’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a memo. Others are far more muted about the outlook. Three years on from OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT, some are starting to wonder how long the enormous hype surrounding AI can continue to be sustained. In a 2025 retrospective posted on Monday, Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio warned that the tech market is “now in the early stages of a bubble.” But a crash, some argue, may still be some ways away thanks to plenty of remaining excitement. “A bubble likely crashes on a bear market,” Cetera Financial Group chief investment officer Gene Goldman told Bloomberg. “We just don’t see a bear market anytime soon.” More on the AI bubble: AI Investors Furious at Suggestion That There’s an AI Bubble I’m a senior editor at Futurism, where I edit and write about NASA and the private space sector, as well as topics ranging from SETI and artificial intelligence to tech and medical policy.

Title: Jamie Dimon’s bombshell on proxy advisory delivers a body blow to the firms he called ‘incompetent’
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-asset-management-proxy-advisory-iss-glass-lewis-what-it-means/

Full Content:
In a break that shapes the architecture of shareholder power, JPMorgan Asset Management, which manages more than $7 trillion in client assets — severed all ties this week with proxy advisory giants ISS and Glass Lewis. It will now rely solely on an internal, AI-driven voting platform called Proxy IQ — the first such move by a major asset manager. It comes days after President Trump issued an executive order directing federal agencies to investigate proxy advisers, citing concerns that their influence on board votes, CEO pay, and ESG policies is driven more by political agendas than fiduciary duty. Together, Trump and JPMorgan waged a two-front assault on the proxy advisory industry — one political, one financial. Trump’s order adds regulatory firepower. Dimon’s decision delivers a market blow. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, relentless critic of proxy advisers, called these firms “incompetent” and their dominance “done with.” The bank’s full exit marks a direct challenge to a system many view as opaque and obsolete. Yet in dismantling the old gatekeepers, JPMorgan may be quietly installing itself as a new one. By replacing outside advisers with its own AI platform, it now controls the very machinery of shareholder voting it once condemned. What began as a crusade against centralized influence may be remembered as a corporate land grab. These developments underscore the rise of a more decentralized and digitally engaged electorate — part of a broader shift toward democratization of investing, as individuals gain real-time access to ballots and influence decisions once shaped by a handful of power brokers. This spring’s proxy season may not hinge on an activist’s letter, banker spreadsheets or hedge fund media blitzes … but instead on the quick, quiet clicks of individual investors — each with a few hundred shares — voting between Zoom calls and scrolling through message board threads. In March 2025, ExxonMobil moved to elevate individual investors — still shaped by its 2021 clash with Engine No. 1 — even without adopting default proxy instructions. In September, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a program that lets individual stakeholders automatically follow board recommendations, aiming to counter chronically low voting turnout and disproportionate influence of institutional and activist investors. And Exxon isn’t alone. Small investors blocked a share conversion at AMC in August 2023, triggering a lawsuit and court-approved settlement. The conversion and split took effect, revealing the persistence of a shareholder base once hailed as the company’s savior. At Disney in April 2024, Nelson Peltz’s proxy fight culminated in a vote that drew support from fans-turned-shareholders mobilizing around board accountability and creative direction. While Peltz lost, Disney revamped investor engagement. Main Street investors rallied behind Elon Musk’s billion-dollar pay package at Tesla in June 2024 and again in October 2025, circulating voting instructions and videos across social media. This outreach momentum carried into the subsequent vote. One important new mechanism drawing attention is pass-through proxy voting — allowing mutual fund and ETF investors to vote their shares directly instead of delegating authority to fund managers. It gives individuals direct control over votes attached to their assets. But it still only matters if they vote. Many independent shareholders skip proxy voting, as notices go unread. Engagement usually emerges in a contested election, as investors hold their ballots to see how the fight unfolds. As of March 2024, BlackRock expanded its Voting Choice program to U.S. individual investors in select funds, enabling direct proxy voting. This marked the first major rollout of pass-through voting within fund structures. Still, only 8% of BlackRock funds offer it, but it is increasing pressure across the industry as analysis grows around individual investor inclusion. But Waiting for Godot is a mistake. Regulation can tweak the system, but real change begins when investors are brought in early, understand the stakes, trust the process and choose to engage. Funds should … Implement full pass-through voting across all funds in 2026. BlackRock’s Larry Fink, Vanguard’s Salim Ramji, Fidelity’s Abigail Johnson, State Street’s Yie-Hsin Hung and J.P. Morgan’s Jamie Dimon can set standards now. Every individual investor’s capital carries its own vote. Boards in parallel should … Influence doesn’t begin with a proxy. It starts with a viral post that reframes a proposal in plain English, sharp YouTube explainer or social threads that turn legalese into a clear takeaway. This is where shareholder sentiment is formed and fortified. As proxy season approaches, the same question looms: Do we have the votes? This year, outcomes may hinge on stakeholders who rarely join investor calls. “Trust is like the air we breathe — when it’s present, nobody really notices. But when it’s absent, everybody notices.” — Warren Buffett The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.

Title: Popular collective crypto trading strategy is vulnerable to losses and insider exploitation, according to new research

About us Copy link A new academic paper warns that collective crypto trading schemes — which pool user funds and trade automatically with them — are inherently vulnerable to losing profits and being exploited by insiders, no matter how they are designed. These findings come from research by academics at Cornell Tech. In their research, they examined the fundamental trade-offs between profitability and economic fairness in such systems. The team of eight researchers who co-authored the January 2 paper found that these Collective Investment Algorithms, or CoinAlgs, posed unavoidable risks, regardless of whether they choose to keep their trading strategies private or opt for full transparency. “CoinAlgs can either be transparent, and risk losing profits; or be private, and open the door for unfair value extraction by insiders,” the researchers said. “Even in scenarios where a CoinAlg may seem benign, subtle backdoors can be inserted that lead to profits from adversaries.” Collective Investment Algorithms are not a new phenomenon. They have existed in the traditional financial world for years, and are used at asset management firms like BlackRock and Renaissance Technologies to execute trades across multiple client portfolios. But in crypto trading circles they’ve surged in popularity in recent years, supercharged by the proliferation of artificial intelligence. They promise to place institutional-grade investment strategies or specialised trading intelligence within the reach of retail investors, although these tools often lack the investor protections of regulated intermediaries. Many CoinAlgs operating across DeFi skew heavily towards speculative assets, with a preference for emerging tokens and highly volatile memecoins. The researchers used historical transaction data from Uniswap, the biggest decentralised exchange, to simulate a profitable CoinAlg that correctly predicts future asset prices. In this situation, they found that even minimal information leakage from a private CoinAlg Enabled significant value extraction by arbitrageurs, investors who exploit temporary price differences to make small but consistent profits. At the same time, those who use private CoinAlgs experience the additional risk of insiders using privileged information to conduct similar arbitrage or frontrunning trades to extract profits. Transparent CoinAlgs didn’t fare much better. They avoid issues of insider trading by ensuring all algorithmic trading models and data is open source and public. Yet this makes it even easier for arbitrageurs to extract profits from the CoinAlgs’s trades, with little ability for recourse. “Even moderate defensive strategies against arbitrage incur a significant cost of transparency and thus [eroding] profits,” the researchers said. Yet despite the issues, CoinAlgs are likely here to stay. Many investors are drawn to them because they advertise the ability to generate lucrative returns by outsourcing difficult investment decisions to AI algorithms. The interest in such products is only set to increase as companies like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google continue to pour money and resources into AI development. “CoinAlgs are an inevitable part of the financial landscape,” the researchers said. “The search for principled guardrails remains an important avenue for future work.” Tim Craig is DL News’ Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

Title: Ethereum Staking Queue Grows: What Does This Mean For ETH Prices Moving Forward?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As Ethereum (ETH) recently reclaimed key levels above $3,200, the dynamics within its staking system have shifted significantly. For the first time in nearly six months, the entry queue for staking Ethereum now exceeds the exit queue, a development viewed by many as a bullish indicator for ETH prices. Currently, a substantial 1.32 million ETH is waiting to be staked, with an average wait time of 23 days, while only about 3,000 ETH are queued for withdrawal, which takes merely an hour, indicating a net increase in locked ETH rather than unlocked coins. Analysts at Bull Theory suggest that historically, significant spikes in entry queues occur when investor confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential rises. In contrast, increases in exit queues are often associated with market fear or forced sell-offs. Presently, the landscape shows rising entry demand, decreasing exit pressure, and an overall increase in net lock-up, a combination that has frequently been observed before stronger bullish cycles for ETH. Compounding this positive sentiment is the current high level of network activity. Daily transactions on the Ethereum network are trending upwards, indicating that market participants are actively engaging with the platform rather than leaving it. Enhanced network usage leads to increased ETH burning, contributing to a supply crunch that further supports the asset’s value. According to the analysts, institutional investment is one of the notable drivers behind the current surge in staking. In just the past two weeks, BitMine – the public company with the largest Ethereum holdings – has staked around $2.58 billion worth of ETH, signaling a long-term commitment to the asset and suggesting growing institutional interest in the digital asset. This development comes ahead of potential catalysts that could further boost staking demand. While the BlackRock Ethereum staking ETF is still awaiting approval, its eventual green light could grant access to a broader pool of traditional capital, thereby enhancing the overall staking demand for ETH. Additionally, ETH has successfully broken out of a three-month downward trend. If it can reclaim levels between $3,500 and $3,600, the analysts predict that a substantial rally could follow. As of now, ETH has recovered by 11% in the past two weeks according to CoinGecko data, positioning the token just below these key levels at $3,270. This performance has even surpassed that of Bitcoin (BTC), which has recorded gains of just 6% in the same time frame. Taking into account additional factors such as the anticipated approval of the BlackRock ETF and the potential for regulatory clarity through the passing of the Market Structure Bill, also known as the Clarity Act, Ethereum appears to be in a strong position to experience a significant rally in 2026.

Title: Morgan Stanley Pushes Past Crypto Blues to Build its First Bitcoin ETF

Bitcoin ETFs just notched $697 million worth of inflows on Monday, their biggest gain since early October. Jamie Wilde Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Morgan Stanley has become the first big US bank to seek Securities and Exchange Commission approval for crypto ETFs, products it designed to track the prices of bitcoin and solana. The latest move by the Wall Street firm, which opened access to crypto funds for all its clients last fall after previously making them available only to high-net-worth investors, comes as the finance industry expands crypto offerings despite tepid interest from retail investors burned by a selloff last fall. It’s been two years since spot bitcoin ETFs were first listed in the US, and major financial companies including BlackRock and Fidelity have rolled out their own products since. Banks, however, have hung back from ETFs, instead directing their advisors to offer clients options from other companies. Bank of America yesterday started letting its advisors do just that. But Morgan Stanley’s move could tap into a rapidly growing opportunity: Bitcoin ETFs notched $697 million worth of inflows Monday, their biggest gain since early October. That’s before money started flowing out as the price of bitcoin slipped, dragging investor optimism down with it. This year, so far, seems like a turnaround: Cautiously Optimistic: As money poured into bitcoin ETFs, the price of bitcoin also rose, climbing about 6% for the year as of yesterday afternoon. While retail traders still seem hesitant to dive all the way back into crypto, ETFs offer an investing option with a degree of separation from the volatile assets. And institutional interest, which judging from recent news is still high, could signal brighter long-term prospects for the sector. Bitcoin, the No. 1 crypto by market cap, hasn’t recovered from a flash crash, chopping more than $1 trillion from the broader sector’s value. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs proved they’re still the go-to middlemen for Wall Street deals amid a near-record $4.8 trillion global M&A bonanza For the first time since 2018, the Wells Fargo stagecoach is rolling into a new year without the burden of a Federal Reserve asset cap. Forecasters predict gold’s rally will stretch through December 2026, although one analysis says there’s reason for caution. Despite a recent pickup in dealmaking, the industry is sitting on a backlog of at least 31,000 companies valued at $3.7 trillion. Commerce Department data released this week showed US GDP rose 4.3% in the third quarter, with the American consumer to thank for it. Standout deals included Union Pacific’s $88 billion purchase of Norfolk Southern and the $56.6 billion deal to take Electronic Arts private. Innovative as the tokenized funds may be for JPMorgan, the bank is actually chasing an existing trend on Wall Street. Bank of America analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings will grow 14% next year, and sees the index reaching 7,100. Morgan Stanley cut its rating of Tesla for the first time in two years on Monday to “equal weight,” which is equivalent to a hold. Connecticut claims Kalshi, Robinhood and Crypto.com don’t have the proper licenses to handle sports wagers in the state. As bitcoin struggles to recoup some of this year’s dramatic losses, ETFs based on Ethereum and Solana are gaining ground. © 2026 The Daily Upside

Title: Bitcoin ETFs come into year 'like a lion’: 600% surge at current pace

US spot bitcoin ETFs attracted over $1.2 billion in the first two trading days of 2026, with analysts projecting annual inflows could reach $150 billion. Cointelegraph in your social feed US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have started the year at an explosive pace that could, if maintained, see it blow out total inflows from 2025. “The spot Bitcoin ETFs are coming into 2026 like a lion,” said Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on Tuesday. He pointed out that there have been more than $1.2 billion in inflows in the first two trading days of the year, “with everyone eating,” meaning nearly all funds have seen inflows. The WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) was the exception. Balchunas observed that if this pace is maintained, it would mean $150 billion in annual inflows, which is around 600% more than the total inflow for 2025. “Told ya’ll if they can take in $22 billion when it’s raining, imagine when the sun is shining,” he said. Spot BTC ETFs in the US saw net inflows of $21.4 billion in 2025, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) taking the lion’s share. However, it marks a decline from the $35.2 billion net inflows seen in 2024. Monday’s whopping $697 million net inflow was the largest for three months as BTC prices returned to and remained above $90,000 again following a tumultuous fortnight to end 2025. Related: Investors funnel $32B into US crypto ETFs despite year-end pullback According to Fabian Dori, CIO at Sygnum, this renewed ETF demand is increasingly relevant for market structure. He noted that ETF demand is steadily absorbing circulating supply, pointing to a potential long-term demand shock, rather than short-term speculative flows. Momentum appeared to be cooling on Tuesday, however, with preliminary figures showing an increasing likelihood of an outflow day due to a large exodus from the Fidelity fund, pending data from BlackRock. Multi-trillion-dollar asset manager Morgan Stanley filed with the SEC on Tuesday to launch Bitcoin and Solana ETFs. This move places the Wall Street giant alongside BlackRock and Fidelity in the crypto ETF space. According to the filing, the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust is a passive investment vehicle designed to track Bitcoin’s spot price and will not use leverage or derivatives. “I like this move by them. It's smart,” opined Balchunas. “They have like $8T in advisory assets, and they already OK'd those advisors to allocate, so might as well be in their own branded fund vs paying BlackRock or someone else,” he added.

Title: Trump Admin Endorses Plan For ‘Binding’ Ukraine Security Guarantees

The U.S. on Tuesday joined a coalition of nations in committing to “binding” long-term security guarantees for Ukraine, marking the first time Washington has officially endorsed a specific security framework. The joint declaration, issued by major NATO allies, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. and U.S. negotiators, followed a high-level summit in Paris aimed at solidifying post-war security arrangements for Ukraine should a ceasefire with Moscow be reached. The five-point plan includes “binding commitments” to support Ukraine against any future Russian aggression. Zelensky, who has had a turbulent relationship with Trump, met with the president at Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 28. Following that meeting, Trump signaled that the deal to end the nearly four-year war is “95%” complete, and Zelensky said the U.S. would be offering long-term security guarantees. U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said after Tuesday’s Paris meeting that President Donald Trump is fully supportive of the security framework discussed by allies. “We have made significant progress on several critical workstreams, including our bilateral security guarantee framework and a prosperity plan,” Witkoff wrote on X. “We agree with the Coalition that durable security guarantees and robust prosperity commitments are essential to a lasting peace in the Ukraine and we will continue to work together on this effort.” (RELATED: Eurocrats Melt Down Over Trump Barring Censorship Police From US) Today, the US delegation met in Paris with the constituents of the Coalition of the Willing as well as the Ukrainian delegation to advance President Trump’s peace plan on Ukraine. The US delegation included Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, General Alex Grynkewich,… — Special Envoy Steve Witkoff (@SEPeaceMissions) January 6, 2026 The plan states that all parties have agreed to finalize binding commitments “setting out our approach to support Ukraine and to restore peace and security in the case of a future armed attack by Russia,” which may include “the use of military capabilities, intelligence and logistical support, diplomatic initiatives, adoption of additional sanctions.” Other elements of the plan include “critical long term military assistance and armament to the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” a “European-led” multinational peacekeeping force, as well “mutually beneficial” defense, intelligence, military training, and military cooperation with Ukraine. The draft statement also calls for a U.S.-led “ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism” to “address any breaches, attribute responsibility, and determine remedies.” “We stand ready to commit to a system of politically and legally binding guarantees that will be activated once a ceasefire enters into force, in addition to bilateral security agreements and in accordance with our respective legal and constitutional arrangements,” the members agreed in the “Paris Declaration.” UK and French leaders separately signed a declaration of intent to deploy troops to monitor Ukraine if a ceasefire is reached. Representing the U.S. alongside Witkoff were Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, General Alex Grynkewich, Ambassador Charles Kushner and White House advisor Josh Gruenbaum. “I think today was a very, very big milestone,” Jared Kushner told reporters. “This does not mean that we will make peace, but peace would not be possible without the progress that was made here today.” In addition to security guarantees, Witkoff also unveiled a post-war “prosperity agreement” to rebuild Ukraine’s economy. “It will aspirationally mean large, large possibilities for the Ukrainian people, for people coming home from war who will find wonderful jobs out there. We’re working with BlackRock, Larry Fink, in this endeavor, and we think it’s going to be very, very important for the people of Ukraine, and we believe that a robust economy correlates and works directly with these security protocols,” Witkoff said. Witkoff noted, however, that land disputes with Russia remain a sticking point in reaching a ceasefire.

Title: Trump Expands Tough 'Travel Ban,' Progressives Are Weirdly Quiet
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2026/01/06/trump-expands-tough-travel-ban-progressives-are-weirdly-quiet/

President Donald Trump has expanded his regulatory curbs on migration to 39 countries, and the new rules could slash the inflow of Islamic migrants by 40 percent, according to the pro-migration Cato Institute. Yet pro-migration advocates have been almost silent about the dramatic new rules, even though they staged frenzied 2017 protests against a “Muslim travel ban” when Trump imposed softer curbs in his first year in office. For example, the National Immigration Law Center issued a mere three-sentence condemnation when the new rules were first announced. The progressive passivity is notable, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “No question, and [the 2026 rule] is much broader too,” he added. Trump’s upgraded and expanded 2026 rule even blocks the spouses and kids of legalized migrants, The silence is dramatic and important because it shows how far Trump and his voters have successfully shifted the national debate over legal and illegal migration since he was first elected in 2016. The travel curbs come after Trump basically halted illegal migration through the southern border, reversed quasi-legal status for more than one million “inadmissible” migrants, and enforced popular laws requiring the fast-track deportation of millions of illegal migrants. He has also begun slowly curbing the kick-back-generating visa programs — such as the H-1B program — that prevent skilled Americans from raising the productivity and prosperity of ordinary Americans. Forty Percent Cutback In Muslim Migration The estimate of a 40 percent cutback comes from a business-backed, pro-migration advocate at the Cato Institute, who wrote: President Trump signed a new proclamation that bans nearly all legal immigration from about 40 countries, covering about one in five legal immigrants from abroad and nearly 400,000 legal immigrants over three years. Although it exempts some foreign workers and travelers from certain countries, this ban does not include any categorical exemption or waiver for spouses, minor children, or parents of US citizens or legal permanent residents, making it far harsher than his prior bans. … Overall, one in five (19 percent) of all legal permanent immigrant visas would be affected by the ban. That includes 33 percent of African immigrants and 42 percent of legal immigrants from majority Muslim countries. The curb will slow the inflow of Muslim migrants into major U.S. cities, including New York, where Muslim migrants played a key role in defeating other ethnic groups as they elected Muslim candidate Zohran Mamdani to the mayorship last November, according to the Washington Post: “We have built a neighborhood and community here,” said [Othman] Alahlemi, a Yemeni immigrant who looked up at a flag from his native country that hangs on a street once dominated by Italian immigrants. “We are going to have a bigger space, where we can also teach our children, and Muslims from all over will be coming here.” … [Mamdami] “used the word ‘socialist’ and that meant five fundamental things — the right to food, clothing, education, health and shelter,” said [M. Anwar] Khandker, who was especially drawn to Mamdani’s pledge of universal child care. “It’s economic sense, because Islam says the same thing.” Mamdani’s win was preceded by a national wave of threatening and violent demonstrations and attacks by Muslims — and younger progressive Americans — in the United States. Those Muslim assaults were prompted by Hamas’s jihad-style murder of more than 800 Jewish civilians on October 7, 2023. Muslims in many states repeatedly say they will use migration to win more power in the United States: Many prominent business leaders have stepped back from pro-migration advocacy in the wake of the anti-Israel frenzy, political shifts in other Islamic-influenced U.S. states, and amid Trump’s reelection and reforms. The quieter elites include Larry Fink, founder of the giant BlackRock investment firm, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook and Meta, investor David Sacks, and Palantir CEO Alex Karp. Similarly, many writers and advocates have stepped back from full-throated advocacy for migration. “A nation, fundamentally, is an exclusive club,” wrote Noah Smith, a virulently pro-migration advocate, just before the 2024 election. But Democrats should “change America’s immigration system to make it more congruent with the democratic will.” Jared Bernstein, an economic advisor to President Joe Biden, dropped any mention of migration in a New York Times article about how Democrats can reduce consumers’ costs. Even former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger stated the obvious just before he died in 2023: “It was a grave mistake to let in so many people of totally different culture and religion and concepts, because it creates a pressure group inside each country that does that.” It is also true that many elites continue to demand more migrants, even from Islamic communities that do not try to assimilate into America’s citizenship culture of reciprocal obligations and rights. “Minnesota’s Fraud Problem Isn’t Immigrants: It’s the vast size of the welfare state that corrupts them,” the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board wrote on January 2. Moreover, some elites who want curbs on Muslim migration also demand an increase in other non-Muslim migrants. That shift would not reduce migration’s huge economic burden on ordinary Americans The muted progressive response to Trump’s curbs likely has many causes, Krikorian told Breitbart News. The administration has justified the travel curbs by carefully documenting the rate at which travelers from many countries overstay their temporary visas, he said. “The travel ban has been much better explained by giving actual visa overstay rates … the rationale has been laid out more thoroughly and in a way that’s harder to caricature.” “There are so many other things going on that [issue] lost interest” for progressives, he added: Biden was so bad [on immigration], and his defenders so humiliated themselves, that there’s a hangover where the people who are opposing [Trump’s] immigration policies are looking for the most sympathetic cases to complain about, rather than more abstract policy issues … they’re chastened to some degree, but I don’t think they’ve changed their thinking. The evidence of a progressive rethink is thin, he said, adding “Here’s hoping, but I’m skeptical, and I’ll believe it when I see it.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: Witkoff, Kushner ink 5-point plan in Paris on Ukraine security guarantees

Full Content:
WASHINGTON — President Trump’s peace envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner signed onto a five-point plan with European leaders in Paris Tuesday to enhance “security guarantees” for Ukraine if it reaches terms to end Russia’s nearly four-year invasion. The joint statement by major NATO allies and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is vague on some details but represents a step forward, including specifying a “US-led ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism” that would “address any breaches, attribute responsibility, and determine remedies.” Other points pledge “critical long term military assistance” to Kyiv, a “European-led” multinational peacekeeping force, additional military aid and sanctions in the “case of a future armed attack by Russia,” as well as “mutually beneficial defence [sic] cooperation with Ukraine.” Key points remain unresolved, including Zelensky’s recent proposal for both Ukrainian and Russian forces to withdraw from frontlines in order to establish a demilitarized zone — as an alternative to agreeing to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s demand that Ukraine cede the north of Donetsk province. UK and French leaders separately firmed up their offer to dispatch troops to monitor the frontlines if a cease-fire is reached. Witkoff said in a statement that he and Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, would have further talks with Zelensky on Tuesday night and into Wednesday — teasing business pledges to rebuild Ukraine. “We think we’re largely finished with security protocols, which are important so that the people of Ukraine know that when this ends, it ends forever,” Witkoff said at a press conference alongside Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chanceller Friedrich Merz. “We also think critically that we are very, very close to finishing up as robust a prosperity agreement as any country has ever seen coming out of conflicts like this,” Witkoff said. “It will aspirationally mean large, large possibilities for the Ukrainian people, for people coming home from war who will find wonderful jobs out there. We’re working with BlackRock, Larry Fink, in this endeavor, and we think it’s going to be very, very important for the people of Ukraine, and we believe that a robust economy correlates and works directly with these security protocols.” Witkoff said that resolving land disputes with Russia remains a sticking point. “We heard President Zelensky and some of the other people here talking about land options. That will be the most critical issue,” he said. “And we’re going to be continuing with those discussions, and hopefully we’ll be able to meet or come up with certain compromises with regard to that.” Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.

Witkoff said the security framework discussed Tuesday was “meant to A) deter any attacks, any further attacks in Ukraine, and B) if there are any attacks, they’re meant to defend, and they will do both. They are as strong as anyone has ever seen… [Trump] does not back down from his commitments.” President Trump has sought to cajole Zelensky and Putin to reach a peace agreement throughout his first year back in power and has grown frustrated at points. Zelensky met with Trump on Dec. 28 at the president’s Palm Beach, Fla., residence — with Trump saying he was again optimistic. “You can say 95 percent, but I don’t like to say percentages. I just think we’re doing very well,” Trump said. “We could be very close. There are one or two very thorny issues, very tough issues. But I think we’re doing very well.” Advertisement

(REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz) Fred Lucas / @FredLucasWH Fred Lucas is chief news correspondent and manager of the Investigative Reporting Project for The Daily Signal. He is the author of “The Myth of Voter Suppression: The Left’s Assault on Clean Elections.” Send an email to Fred. FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL – The Securities and Exchange Commission could make it tougher for shareholders to challenge left-leaning corporate policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as environmental issues, a conservative watchdog group asserts. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins in November suggested making it easier for corporations to block shareholder proposals from being heard and voted on at annual shareholder meetings. Atkins, appointed by President Donald Trump in January and confirmed by the Senate in April, also suggested allowing the state where a company is based to decide what is appropriate for shareholder consideration. However, in a 10-page letter to Atkins shared with The Daily Signal, National Legal and Policy Center President Peter Flaherty argued that conservatives have successfully challenged DEI, and ESG–short for environment, social governance–policies at large, publicly traded companies. Atkins’ proposals could remove the very tools conservatives used to stop these policies, he added. “We share your concerns about the proliferation of proposals that appear to advance irrelevant ideological agendas. However, the solution cannot be to dismantle the mechanism itself,” Flaherty wrote. Specifically at issue is SEC Rule 14a-8, which is the mechanism for shareholders to submit proposals for a publicly traded company’s annual meeting. The rule also includes guidelines for a company to exclude the proposal from the annual meeting if it is determined irrelevant to the company’s business. Flaherty described the shareholder process as “an explicitly capitalist institution” when “properly constrained.”“It is voluntary, firm-specific, and mediated by the discipline of capital markets,” he wrote. Flaherty warned that the proposed changes to thwart more shareholder proposals would weaken the rights of ordinary investors and could effectively entrench the power of large investment institutions such as BlackRock. The National Legal and Policy Center has pointed to recent conservative victories in pushing corporations such as Target and Cracker Barrel to abandon leftist policies. Numerous other companies rolled back DEI policies in 2024 and 2025, according to Forbes. The policy change floated would also affect shareholder proposals coming from the left. Yet Flaherty argued that corporate managers are still largely inclined to push these policies, and shareholders need a tool to push back. “When Chairman Atkins suppresses the dissent of shareholders and makes corporate managers less accountable, he is not supporting our side,” Flaherty told The Daily Signal. “The managerial class is overwhelmingly liberal. They know each other, went to the same schools, and serve on each other’s boards.” “Taking on DEI, ESG, and stopping debanking are all part of the president’s agenda,” Flaherty added. “It’s a shame [Atkins] is undercutting our efforts.” In a speech at the University of Delaware in October, Atkins also suggested a shareholder proposal might not be proper for consideration if it isn’t permissible under state law. “State law governs whether a proposal is a ‘proper subject,’” Atkins said, adding that “it is appropriate for the agency to defer to those who practice Delaware law” to determine whether a proposal could be considered there. Then on Nov. 17, the SEC announced a policy change whereby it would acknowledge a company’s intent to exclude shareholder proposals, but would not make a ruling on it. Conservative watchdogs like Flaherty consider that effectively a rubber stamp for the company and a departure from the past, when the shareholder and company would submit legal arguments to exclude proposals and the SEC would decide. Audrey Barr, senior communications advisor for the SEC, declined to comment on the issues raised by Flaherty. Flaherty noted in the letter that providing more deference to states could give the state of Delaware enhanced influence, since so many companies are incorporated in the state. Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government. The Daily Signal’s own Tyler O’Neil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government. In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

Title: Martin and Xi say they read it as teens - but what is The Gadfly and who is its Cork-born author?

THE TAOISEACH’S MEETING with China President Xi Jinping yesterday threw up a surprise: it turns out the Chinese leader says he is a fan of an Irish novel. Xi credited the 1897 book The Gadfly – by Cork-born author Ethel Voynich – as sustaining him during his traumatic teenage years when his family suffered under a purge by the Communist Party leadership. Micheál Martin told Irish media yesterday that he and Xi found the book was common ground during his visit to Beijing, as the Fianna Fáil leader had also read it when he was a teenager. “It was unusual that we ended up discussing The Gadfly and its impact on both of us, but there you are,” Martin said. As a boy, Xi found himself cast out of any comforts enjoyed by his family after his father fell foul during a purge of supposed internal rivals by party leader Mao Zedong, with the future president reportedly having to sleep in a cave at points during his exile. However, what’s arguably more surprising about Xi’s recall of the book is that it didn’t come as all that much of a surprise to some observers. This is because The Gadfly carries a different weight depending on where you are in the world – having sold over 5 million copies in the Soviet Union alone. According to historian Donal Fallon, its author Voynich is one of a number of Irish writers who enjoyed broader readerships in the likes of China and the Soviet Union than you might first expect. “The Gadfly found its audience in different continents, not least China, and even finding an English language copy was sometimes tricky in the past,” Fallon told The Journal. Advertisement While it has remained little known to a general Irish audience, it did find itself cited by leftists at home as well as abroad – partly because of their educational value to socialists as much as their literary merit was. “The Gadfly also gets mention in the memoir of Peadar O’Donnell, Anti-Treaty Republican, who recalled ‘the Gadfly was being widely read in C Wing: It is a tale of Italian revolution with a ghastly execution scene’,” Fallon added, referring to O’Donnell’s time in prison in Ireland. A copy of the book. File photo Alamy Alamy The book follows a young Englishman who goes to 1840s Italy to study to become a priest but finds himself caught up in the radical politics of the era, while also navigating a relationship with another revolutionary. Born in 1864 in Blackrock in Cork as Ethel Lilian Boole, her family moved to Lancashire, England after her mathematician father George Boole died when she was an infant. (Boole’s name adorns a well-known building used to this day by students on the campus of University College Cork) Voynich was in her early 30s when The Gadfly was published, with speculation that it may have been partly inspired by her own involvement with similar revolutionaries. Historian Maurice Casey described Voynich to The Journal as a “one-woman node in a global network” in her own era, with her book’s citing by China’s leader speaking to Ireland’s global cultural influence. “Her comrades included Ukrainian and Russian socialists – and she married a Polish political exile,” said Casey, whose 2024 book Hotel Lux looked at the forgotten Irish radicals and their lives and loves in Russia during the rise of socialism. Casey added that for the book to arise in the exchange between Martin and Xi – both whom recalling reading it as teenagers – is a way of reminding us that The Gadfly’s success “lay in Voynich’s ability to portray common experiences of a revolutionary life”. This ranged from commitment to a cause, to sacrifice and even romance, Casey said, all features that may well have bolstered the nineteenth century novel’s appeal to any young person with an interest in politics, “whether surviving the Cultural Revolution in China or a teenager in Cork city during the 1970s”.

If you ask Gargi Pal Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment and portfolio strategist for its Americas division, the answer is yes — at least for now. For decades, bonds have acted as a buffer for the volatility of investors' stock positions. Your stock allocation would handle the growth, while the bond allocation would play defense by locking in a steady return and promising the chance to sell for a profit if the stock market went through a rough patch. An allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds has been a cornerstone of portfolio construction. But in 2022, the strategy didn't work. Inflation soared, causing the Federal Reserve to hike rates, torpedoing stocks. At the same time, long-term bond yields rose to match inflation expectations, crushing the value of bonds bought at lower interest rates. In other words, stocks and bonds sold off simultaneously, leaving portfolios in tatters. The same thing happened in early 2025. As President Donald Trump launched an ambitious trade war, rising inflation concerns pushed up bond yields and tanked stocks. Morningstar pointed out that it was the worst stretch for the 60/40 in 150 years. Every time William publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox!

In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. However, those days should be behind us now, Chaudhuri says. While she's bullish on the equity market in 2026, investors should once again be able to count on bonds as a hedge if things don't work out for stocks. "If we do see a shock, we think bonds can be that protection or that balance," Chaudhuri told Business Insider on Monday. One reason for that is that interest rates are starting the year higher than they were in 2022, giving them room to move lower. The Fed is also slashing interest rates, whereas it had been hiking them a few years ago. This has pushed the correlation between stocks and long-end bonds back into negative territory, where they move in different directions. As for where to put your money in the bond market, Chaudhuri said she likes the middle of the yield curve, where investors can still find attractive yields without having to necessarily take on the duration risk associated with the longer end of the curve. "We do think if you are allocated to that five-year part of the yield curve or even that 10-year part of the yield curve, you do have that negative correlation that's coming back, which we think can be a big difference, especially from previous sell-offs like in 2022 and 2025, she said. Meanwhile, in stocks, Chaudhuri said the value factor is attractive. "We don't think this is the end of the AI trade by any means, but one way in which we're talking about things a little differently in 2026 is there are opportunities beyond AI," Chaudhuri said. She continued: "If you just look at a stand alone basis of what you're getting in terms of earnings growth in that value sector, you're getting about a 12% expectation in earnings growth." Examples of funds that offer exposure to the trades above include the Schwab Intermediate-Term U.S. Treasury ETF (SCHR), the iShares 3-7 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEI), the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV), and the iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE).

Telegram’s H1 2025 revenue climbed 65% to $870 million, while Toncoin write-downs and $500 million in frozen bonds have added pressure. Cointelegraph in your social feed Update (Jan. 6, 1:20 pm UTC): This article has been updated with a statement from Telegram. Cryptocurrency-friendly messenger Telegram boosted its operating revenue in 2025 as it explores a potential initial public offering (IPO). Telegram’s revenues hit $870 million in the first half of 2025, up 65% from $525 million a year earlier, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing unaudited financial statements. About a third of that, or $300 million, came from “exclusivity agreements,” linked to earnings related to Telegram-connected cryptocurrency Toncoin (TON). The report also said that $500 million of Telegram’s bonds have been frozen in Russia’s central securities depository due to Western sanctions, the FT said, citing anonymous sources. Telegram posted a net loss of more than $220 million in H1 2025, compared with a $334 net profit in the first half of the previous year. The company targets $2 billion in revenue in 2025. The loss reportedly came from Telegram having to write down the value of its holdings in Toncoin, which lost 69% of its value in 2025, according to CoinGecko. “The company told investors it had sold more than $450 million in Toncoin in the year to date,” the report said. By publishing time, the amount would account for about 10% of TON’s market capitalization of $4.6 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Addressing the bond freeze in Russia, a spokesperson for Telegram said that $500 million figure refers to a bond issue from 2021. The representative noted that Telegram’s latest bond offering in 2025 excluded participation by Russian investors. “Telegram is not dependent on Russia or Russian capital and does not face bond-related issues due to sanctions,” the spokesperson said, adding: Telegram launched several bond offerings in recent years, including a $1.7 billion convertible bond offering issued in May 2025. The sale reportedly featured existing backers, including investment giant BlackRock and Abu Dhabi’s investment firm Mubadala. According to FT sources, Telegram bought back most of the bonds maturing in 2026. Related: ‘Mixed year for IPOs’ as crypto pulls down US IPO performance The report comes amid Telegram CEO Pavel Durov remaining under formal investigation in France over the platform’s alleged failure to address criminality, including child abuse content. In a recent call with some bondholders, Telegram reportedly said it continued to cooperate with authorities regarding Durov’s case and that it needed more resolution before the company could proceed with a public market listing. Cointelegraph also sought comment from Telegram on its 2025 financials and TON holdings, but the company did not address either in its response.

Title: Morgan Stanley files S-1s for Bitcoin and Solana ETFs in latest crypto push

The investment banking giant’s filings for Bitcoin and Solana ETFs follow an uptick in investor demand for regulated crypto investment vehicles, driven by the new year’s “clean-slate” effect. Cointelegraph in your social feed Update Jan. 6, 12:57 p.m. UTC: This article has been updated to include a paragraph on Morgan Stanley’s prior involvement with cryptocurrency funds. US investment bank Morgan Stanley has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch two cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), one tied to Bitcoin and the other to Solana, as Wall Street firms push deeper into regulated digital-asset products. The proposed Morgan Stanley Bitcoin (BTC) Trust and the Morgan Stanley Solana (SOL) Trust will function as “passive investment” vehicles that hold and track the performance of the underlying tokens, according to Tuesday’s filings with the SEC. The two funds seek to list their shares on public exchanges, which are usually specified in later 19b-4 filings, not the initial S-1 forms. If approved, the funds could bring new inflows to Bitcoin and Solana from Morgan Stanley’s over 19 million clients served through its wealth management division as of April 2025, according to the company’s shareholder letter. Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $1.1 billion in inflows during the first two trading days of 2026, as analysts pointed to renewed digital asset appetite due to the new year’s “clean-slate effect.” Related: Strategy kickstarts 2026 with $116M Bitcoin buy as Q4 paper loss hits $17B Morgan Stanley Investment Management is listed as the sponsor for both proposed trusts. CSC Delaware Trust Company is named as the Delaware trustee. Key service providers, including certain custodial arrangements, were not fully specified in the preliminary documents. Morgan Stanley said it will keep a “substantial portion of the private keys” in cold storage with a “remainder” held in hot wallets. The two funds won’t seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of the underlying asset, meaning that the sponsor won’t “speculatively sell” the spot tokens. Morgan Stanley has been deepening its involvement with the cryptocurrency industry along with other big financial institutions. In October, the wealth manager reportedly enabled its financial advisors to recommend crypto funds to clients with individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k)s, marking a significant policy shift from previously restricting access to high-net-worth individuals with over $1.5 million in assets.

It comes a day after the second-largest US bank, Bank of America, began allowing advisers in its wealth management businesses to recommend exposure to four Bitcoin ETFs, Cointelegraph reported on Monday. The move allows the bank’s wealthiest clients to gain exposure to Bitcoin ETFs, which can now be recommended by the bank’s over 15,000 wealth advisers across its Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank and Merrill Edge platforms. Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, enabled crypto ETF trading for its clients in December 2025, a year after BlackRock recommended an up to 2% Bitcoin allocation to its clients, as the first large financial institution to do so, Cointelegraph reported in December 2024.

What changed in the first week of 2026? Institutional capital is coming back, and it’s largely going through BlackRock. Following a choppy Q4 in 2025, where ETF volumes struggled to find a floor, the first week of 2026 has delivered a massive liquidity injection. On-chain data and fund flows confirm that BlackRock clients have snapped up 3,948 Bitcoin [BTC] worth $371.89 million and 31,737 Ethereum [ETH] worth $100.23 million. This signals that institutions don’t drop half a billion dollars unless they expect the market to strengthen. In fact, this kind of synchronized BTC + ETH accumulation often happens when institutions expect higher prices soon. On the ETF front, the 5th of January marked a rebound for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Data from Farside Investors shows an extraordinary $697.2 million in Bitcoin ETF inflows in a single day. BlackRock’s IBIT alone accounted for $372.5 million, over half of all inflows. Meanwhile, its Ethereum counterpart, ETHA, secured $102.9 million out of the sector’s $168 million total. This surge in capital coincided with a broader market recovery, pushing Bitcoin to $93,700.64 and Ethereum to $3,234.78. At the same time, corporate holders are also signaling renewed confidence. Strategy, despite suffering a steep 43% stock decline during the 2025 crypto downturn, remains the world’s largest public Bitcoin treasury with over 673,783 BTC. In fact, on the 4th of January, Michael Saylor reignited speculation when he hinted at further Bitcoin accumulation on X. Yet perhaps the most transformative development comes from Grayscale. On the 5th of January, the firm announced the first-ever U.S. spot crypto ETP payout derived from staking rewards for its Ethereum Staking ETF (ETHE). Investors received $0.083178 per share, with the distribution covering rewards accrued from October to December 2025. This introduces passive income to Ethereum holders within traditional brokerage accounts, shifting ETH from a purely speculative asset to a yield-generating one. These developments follow a dramatic year-end contrast between two of the market’s biggest players. During the holiday slowdown, BlackRock quietly shifted $214 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime to manage ETF redemptions. Meanwhile, on the other hand, Saylor’s Strategy moved in the opposite direction. On the same day, Strategy purchased 1,229 BTC worth $108.85 million, boosting its holdings to 672,497 BTC. All this combined signals that the weak hands are exiting and the strongest hands are accumulating, setting the tone for what may come next in 2026.

Title: XRP Surges Towards $2.20: Leading Monday Gains And Driving Crypto ETF Inflows

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In 2025, XRP emerged as the best-performing token among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies, outpacing gains from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). As the first week of 2026 unfolds, XRP has continued this upward trend, recording a 17% surge over the past week that has propelled its price back above the key $2.20 threshold. One of the prominent factors contributing to this surge is the strong performance of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which became a standout in the market by attracting $483 million over the past weeks. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant outflow of $1.09 billion, while Ethereum products faced a loss of $564 million. XRP funds not only achieved $483 million in inflows during December but also maintained a steady influx for 30 consecutive trading days. This streak finally ended on December 26 with the first day of zero inflows. Overall, since their launch in November, total inflows into XRP exchange-traded funds have amassed to $1.3 billion, marking the fastest adoption rate for any altcoin ETF to date. Looking ahead, reports suggest that the ETF landscape could be pivotal in shaping bullish scenarios for XRP. A potential filing by BlackRock for an XRP ETF could serve as a significant credibility boost, attracting conservative institutional investors to the space. BlackRock’s own $40 billion Bitcoin ETF exemplifies the capacity to mobilize capital effectively through its Aladdin platform connections. Additionally, the scaling of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin into banking and remittance services could generate ongoing demand for XRP as a critical bridge asset. There are also signs that the Federal Reserve could implement several rate cuts in 2026, which would lower the opportunity cost of investing in risk assets. Under such conditions, it is alleged that the XRP price might break through its all-time high of $3.84, potentially escalating toward the $4.00 to $5.00 range by year-end. When it comes to price action, market analyst Dark Defender, active on the social media platform X (previously Twitter), recently highlighted XRP’s price action by providing a three-month time frame update. The analyst noted that a newly initiated green candle in January exhibits a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI). According to Dark Defender, surpassing the $2.22 level is crucial for XRP. He further suggested that XRP could be on the brink of a significant surge, similar to silver, and pointed to ambitious targets such as $6 and even as high as $20 in the future. Achieving $6 would represent a notable 171% increase from current trading prices, while reaching the $20 mark would indicate a staggering 800% rise. While trading at $2.21 at the time of writing, the token is still facing $2.22 as the next major short-term resistance level, and is also trading at 40% below its all-time high.

Title: Ice warning may cause further disruption as cold snap continues

A fresh weather warning for icy conditions in Northern Ireland has come into force as the cold snap continues to cause disruption. More than 200 schools in Northern Ireland were closed on Tuesday and a number of Translink services were affected. The police warned that some roads in County Fermanagh were "impassable due to treacherous icy conditions" including Moybrone Road, Letterbreen and Tiravally Road, and Florencecourt. A yellow weather warning for ice ended at 10:00 GMT on Tuesday but a new one is in place from 18:00 until 11:00 on Wednesday. A fresh dusting of snow can also be expected in some areas. The Met Office has urged the public to take care on slippery footpaths and untreated roads. Tuesday's school closures were mainly in the north east, north west and west of Northern Ireland. Three schools in Northern Ireland are due to be closed on Wednesday. Bin collections in various council areas have been disrupted by the weather. In Derry and Strabane District Council all cemeteries remain closed on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Recycling centres there have reopened, with the exception of Spamont and Park. Sports pitches at Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council remain closed. Donemana sheep farmer Matthew Craig said it had been difficult to get about to feed his animals in recent days. "It's really been like an ice rink," he said. Craig is also balancing childcare and farming as daughters Anna and Beth have been off school, while their mum has been working. Brian Guthrie, the principal of Ebrington Primary School in Londonderry, had hoped to reopen on Tuesday but conditions did not allow it. "I spent a good bit of time on site yesterday, clearing pathways and so on to make it safe but, unfortunately, as the day went on it seemed more and more schools were making a call to close," he told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme. He said the Foyle Learning Community – a network of 13 schools, which includes Foyle College – made a decision to close, so he was left with no choice but to do the same. "It isn't an easy decision and I know it has an impact on parents, the children and learning and apologies for that but it's really about making sure our school community is safe." Emma Tsang has three children and lives in the Ballymoney area. A number of local schools were closed, including those attended by her children, as well as their childcare facility. Tsang said she respected the decision to close schools, as the safety of children and staff is paramount, but added it was "not ideal". "It's a difficult situation for working parents to organise alternative childcare at short notice," she said. St Brigid's Primary School in Tirkane in County Londonderry was among the closed schools. Its principal Ursula O'Hanlon said the snow and ice had not thawed, adding that she could not expect parents to get children to school when buses were not servicing local roads. "Nobody wants to be responsible for opening a school and hearing then that someone had an accident," she said. Paddy Lavery, a principal engineer at the Department of Infrastructure, said there were more than 300 staff members working to keep the main roads open and safe. Lavery said rural schools will always be a "difficulty" but there are special arrangements to treat some roads. They follow a scoring mechanism to decide where resources will be deployed. This includes assessing whether there has been a history of snow and ice around the school, if there is a bus with over 40 seats travelling to the school and the number of vehicles travelling to the school. Lavery said there is an application process for rural roads to be treated, adding that over 50 schools are treated under special arrangements. Hospital entrances are also treated under these arrangements. Scarlett,10, Alesha, 6, and Dan, 8, were playing in the snow in Cullybackey. "Well what I love about the snow is that I can get it and throw it at him [Dan]," Scarlett told BBC News NI. She added that they had sleighs at their granny's house which is "the best thing". Dan said he likes to throw snowballs at his sister and "push her down in the snow because I know she won't get hurt". Their father, Steven, said the children are "having a lot of fun" but they do love school. In County Down, the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team was deployed to help health workers and carers make essential calls to patients' homes. Volunteers used 4x4 rescue vehicles to transport carers to houses that are difficult to reach in icy weather. "A lot of the side roads and laneways and so on have become very treacherous," said Martin McMullan from the team. "There's obviously a lot of people living in our community now, particularly in the rural community, with quite acute care needs - not just the elderly." Northern Ireland's Commissioner for Older People, Siobhan Casey, called on people to check on elderly or vulnerable neighbours during the cold snap. NI Water urged people to be careful around its outdoor sites, particularly reservoirs and dams, where winter conditions can create hazards. Reservoir safety and compliance area manager Derek McKane said ice was "nearly always treacherous" and people should not attempt to walk or skate on iced-over reservoirs. "Reservoirs are not safe places to play at any time of year, but winter brings extra dangers," he added. A gust of 99mph is recorded in the Isles of Scilly as the storm brings heavy snow and rain to the UK. In England, GCSE students can receive results via an app for the first time in 2026. A BBC investigation finds building issues across city schools after a firm contracted to carry out repairs went into liquidation. Roads and rail services have been affected by heavy snow. According to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 59,733 women in NI are now on waiting lists. Copyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: Chinese EV maker BYD pulls ahead as Tesla sales slump

Chinese automaker BYD reported a nearly 28% increase in December sales, with total 2025 deliveries (BEVs and plug-in hybrids) reaching 4.6 million vehicles, while Tesla's 2026 projected sales are 1.6 millionÂ â down from 1.79 million in 2024. BYD offers a wide range of vehicles, including compact cars, sedans, SUVs, buses and commercial EVs, whereas Tesla's lineup is limited to the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X and the Cybertruck (with future models not yet mainstream). Analysts link Teslaâs sales decline partly to Elon Musk's political engagement, including controversial statements on European politics, immigration and diversity following his acquisition of X (formerly Twitter). A Yale University study estimated Teslaâs sales could have been 67% to 83% higher without Musk's political involvement, potentially adding 1â1.26 million vehicles. Musk's actions reportedly boosted sales of rival electric and hybrid vehicles by 17% to 22%. Once the benchmark for EV innovation, Tesla now faces growing competition from BYD, whose expanding product range and strong sales growth are reshaping the global electric vehicle market.

Once the benchmark for EV innovation, Tesla now faces growing competition from BYD, whose expanding product range and strong sales growth are reshaping the global electric vehicle market. The global electric vehicle (EV) market appears to be tilting in favor of Chinese automaker BYD, as Tesla struggles to maintain its once-dominant position. Tesla sold an estimated 480,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the third quarter of 2025 and around 400,000 in the fourth quarter. Total sales for 2026 are projected at 1.6 million units, down from approximately 1.79 million in 2024. In contrast, BYD sold roughly 1.7 million battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in 2024 and around 2.25 million in 2025, with total deliveries, including BEVs and plug-in hybrids, reaching 4.6 million vehicles in 2025. BYD, as per BrightU.AI's Enoch, is a Chinese multinational automotive manufacturer established in 1995. It initially focused on battery production before expanding intoÂ EVs and plug-in hybrids. BYD's diverse lineup includes compact city cars, premium sedans, large SUVs, hybrid models and electric buses and commercial vehicles, giving it a broad presence in markets worldwide. Meanwhile, Tesla's current portfolio consists of the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X and the Cybertruck in limited volumes, with vehicles like the Roadster and low-cost robotaxi-style EVs not yet available to mainstream buyers. Analysts: Musk's politics cost Tesla over a million sales Analysts suggest that Tesla's sales underperformance is partly linked to founder Elon Musk's high-profile political activities. Following his $44 billion acquisition of X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022, Musk increasingly voiced opinions on European politics, immigration and diversity initiatives, drawing criticism and controversy. A Yale University study published in October found that Tesla's sales would have been 67% to 83% higher without Musk's political involvement, potentially adding one million to 1.26 million vehicles sold. The study also concluded that Musk's actions boosted sales of other electric and hybrid vehicles by 17% to 22%. "This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be," the researchers wrote. "We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business." Musk further amplified his political engagement by backing President Donald Trump and Republican causes, including a reported $288 million contribution to Trump-aligned committees during the 2024 election cycle. After Trump's return to office, Musk was appointed to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which oversaw the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Once regarded as the benchmark for cutting-edge EV technology and environmental progress, Tesla now faces growing competition from BYD, whose expanding range and consistent sales growth highlight the shifting dynamics of the global electric vehicle market.

Title: Hilton called out by DHS after the department said ICE agents' reservations were canceled at an independently owned Hampton Inn

Time Published: 2026-01-06T01:27:36Z

The Department of Homeland Security singled out Hilton on X, saying a hotel in Minnesota canceled reservations belonging to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. According to a screenshot shared by DHS on Monday, a Hampton Inn in Lakeville, south of Minneapolis, said it was "not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property." "If you are with DHS or immigration, let us know as we will have to cancel your reservation," the screenshot said. Hilton said it doesn't own or operate the hotel. The company's shares were down nearly 2.5% on Monday. "This hotel is independently owned and operated, and these actions were not reflective of Hilton values," Hilton said in a statement to Business Insider. "We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologized for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies." "Hilton's position is clear: Our properties are open to everyone and we do not tolerate any form of discrimination," the statement said. Everpeak Hospitality, the owner of the hotel, said in a statement Tuesday that the incident was "inconsistent with our policy of being a welcoming place for all." "We are in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated," the statement said. "We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted." DHS did not respond to a request for comment. Hilton's largest known shareholders are Vanguard and BlackRock, which respectively own 10.6% and 8.5% of its common stock, according to the company's 2025 proxy statement. Hilton, like other global hotel chains, does not own most Hilton-branded hotels. Instead, most of its hotels are franchised — they're owned and operated independently or owned by a third party and operated by Hilton. Jump to

Title: Why Are The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Rising?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are rising today, with the flagship crypto rising to as high as $93,000. This market rally comes on the back of several factors, including the U.S.-Venezuela escalations, which have increased risk sentiment. In an X post, market commentator The Kobeissi Letter noted that risky assets seem to be gaining momentum despite the U.S. capture of former Venezuelan president Maduro. This suggests risk sentiment may be back after the year-end decline in 2025, which has contributed to the recent rise in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices. The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are also rising on the back of an increase in the M2 money supply, which now stands at $22.4 trillion, according to data from the St. Louis Fed. This is bullish for crypto assets as some of this liquidity is expected to flow into the crypto ecosystem. Meanwhile, the U.S. debt continues to rise, standing at $38.6 trillion, a development that is bullish for crypto as investors hedge against inflation by allocating to these asset classes. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the Fed has also been carrying out its Reserve Management Purchases (RMP), which experts such as James Lavish have described as a form of quantitative easing (QE), which is positive for the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has even predicted that BTC could rally to as high as $200,000 on the back of this move from the Fed. Meanwhile, the Fed has also been injecting liquidity into the economy through the New York Fed’s repo operations. Market analyst Ted Pilliows also suggested that the crypto bulls are back in control, which is why the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are rising. In an X post, he noted that BTC has large sell orders from the $92,000 to $95,000 level on Binance. Ted added that if bulls push BTC above the $95,000 level, there is very little resistance until $100,000, suggesting a rally to this psychological level could be on the cards. In another X post, the market analyst noted that the Coinbase Bitcoin premium is recovering, with institutional demand for BTC picking up again. SoSoValue data show that Bitcoin ETFs recorded a daily net inflow of $471.14 million on January 2, their largest since December 17. A sustained daily net inflow could lead to higher prices for BTC, which is also a positive for the Ethereum and Dogecoin prices. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $92,400, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: Diplomatic crisis between the US & Panama ends: Panama Canal remains under Panamanian administration
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2026/01/05/diplomatic-crisis-between-the-us-panama-ends-panama-canal-remains-under-panamanian-administration/
Time Published: 2026-01-05T18:04:08Z
Full Content:
President José Raúl Mulino declared the crisis “a thing of the past” in his New Year’s message to the National Assembly. He reaffirmed that the Panama Canal “remains and will remain under Panamanian sovereignty.” His remarks follow a period of intense diplomatic tension that began in early 2025, when U.S. President Donald Trump publicly threatened to reassert U.S. control over the strategic waterway, citing growing Chinese influence. Mulino stated that, through “a steady stance and time,” both sides had succeeded in restoring mutual respect and cooperation. He emphasized that Panama’s relationship with the U.S. is now based on collaboration, trust, and friendship, with particular focus on joint efforts to combat international crime. Tensions escalated immediately after Donald Trump returned to the White House on January 20, 2025. The U.S. president pressured the Panamanian government to revoke the contract of the Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports Group, which operates two key ports at the Canal’s Atlantic and Pacific entrances. Simultaneously, Washington demanded that U.S. ships transit the Canal without paying fees—a move Panama viewed as a direct challenge to its sovereignty. Chinese Objections and Port Management Despite the diplomatic détente with the U.S., the future of port management in Panama remains uncertain. In March 2025, CK Hutchison reached a preliminary agreement to sell 80% of its global port operations—including the two Panamanian ports—to a consortium led by BlackRock and Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), part of the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC). However, negotiations have stalled, reportedly due to opposition from Beijing, which seeks a substantial role for China’s Cosco Shipping in the new entity. At the same time, Hutchison’s concession agreement with Panama is being challenged in court as unconstitutional, with the Supreme Court expected to issue a ruling later this month. Canal Celebrates 26 Years of Panamanian Control On December 31, 2025, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) celebrated 26 years since control of the Canal was transferred from the United States to Panama in 1999. The Canal continues to be the backbone of Panama’s economy and a vital hub for global maritime trade. Official figures show that the ACP has transferred approximately $31.2 billion to the national treasury over the past 26 years, supporting public investment and government revenues. In November 2025, the ACP unveiled an ambitious long-term investment plan to maintain the Canal’s competitiveness, including projects in port infrastructure, energy logistics, and water resource management. Amid growing geopolitical rivalries, Panama seeks to balance relations with major powers while safeguarding control of one of the world’s most strategic maritime passages. Explore related questions

Title: Grayscale declares first Ethereum staking payout for US-listed ETF

Time Published: 2026-01-05T17:46:28Z

The cash distribution stems from staking rewards earned after the fund enabled Ethereum staking in October. Cointelegraph in your social feed Grayscale has declared a staking rewards distribution for its Ethereum Staking exchange-traded fund (ETF), the first time a US-listed spot crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) has scheduled a payout tied to onchain staking activity. Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) shareholders will receive about $0.08 per share from proceeds of the sale of staking rewards, with the payout scheduled for Tuesday based on holdings recorded at market close on Monday, according to a press release published on Monday. Grayscale activated staking for its Ethereum products on Oct. 6, with staking conducted through institutional custodians and third-party validator providers. The move made ETHE and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) the first US-listed spot crypto ETPs to gain exposure to Ether staking. Staking is the process of locking up cryptocurrency on a proof-of-stake blockchain to help validate transactions and secure the network in exchange for periodic rewards. In the case of Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust ETF, rewards are converted to cash and distributed to investors in dollars rather than being paid out in Ether (ETH). Grayscale’s funds operate outside the Investment Company Act of 1940, the primary statute governing US ETFs, a structure that permits staking but carries different regulatory protections as traditional US ETFs. Founded in 2013, Grayscale Investments is a digital asset manager that sponsors crypto investment products, with about $31 billion in assets under management, according to the company. The ETF was up around 2% in early-day trading, according to Yahoo Finance data. Related: Bank of America lets wealth advisers recommend Bitcoin ETFs While Grayscale is currently the only US-traded fund to issue payouts linked to Ether staking, several spot Ether ETFs from major asset managers are awaiting regulatory approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In March, Cboe BZX filed a proposed rule change with US regulators seeking approval to add staking to the Fidelity Ethereum Fund. The proposal would allow the fund to stake some or all of its Ether through third-party providers, and followed a similar filing submitted in February for the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. In November, BlackRock registered a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund in Delaware, an early procedural step toward launching a staking-enabled product that would sit alongside its existing spot Ether ETF. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which launched in July 2024, currently does not include staking. US spot Ether ETFs began trading in July 2024, making 2025 the first full calendar year in which they were available to investors. During the year, the funds attracted $9.6 billion in inflows. According to CoinMarketCap data, US spot Ether ETFs collectively manage about $18 billion in assets. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) is the largest by market cap at roughly $11.1 billion, followed by Grayscale’s ETHE with about $4.1 billion and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF at around $1.5 billion.

Title: Data Centers Continue to Vacuum Up the Investment Dollars — Is the Return Worth It?
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2026/01/data-centers-return-investment-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-05T14:48:49Z

© 2026 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy If 2025 will be remembered for anything — outside of the return of President Donald J. Trump and the rise of New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani — it will undoubtedly be the establishment of artificial intelligence across the American economy. And with this revolutionary technology has come the concomitant explosion of U.S. data center development — real estate assets solely capable of operating, and powering, the new landscape of AI technology. An S&P Global study from December, first reported by CNBC, found that more than $61 billion of new investment capital flowed into the data center space in 2025, which is just ahead of the $60.8 billion that entered the space in 2024. Ratings giant Moody’s expects global investment in new data centers will reach $2.2 trillion combined in the five years preceding 2028, while U.S. Census Bureau data forecasts that data center construction spending will surpass all U.S. office building construction spending by next year. One major player, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta (neé Facebook), estimated it spent between $70 billion and $72 billion in building out AI infrastructure in 2025, per third-quarter earnings. “Everything’s moving into data centers,” said Jay Neveloff, chair of U.S. real estate at HSF Kramer, the global law firm. “So, what I’m telling clients is, at some point, we’re going to be oversaturated with data centers, and I don’t quite know what the exit strategy is for being in the data center space. “Having said that, I think we’re really at the infancy of that industry,” he added With money flowing this quickly, and in such large amounts, into a single commercial real estate asset class — an untraditional one, by any measure, that fuses land, utilities, power and fossil fuels, big tech, local politics and Wall Street under one big umbrella — questions are starting to emerge as to whether a bubble is forming around AI data center spending. “The projections of data center development by major tech players are truly eye-popping,” said Chris Russo, vice president of the energy practice at Charles River Associates, an economic consulting firm. “But there’s a growing number of questions whether the projections are, in fact, real, and if the investments being made by Meta, Google, Microsoft, among others, can be justified by future revenue.” This concern about revenue and monetization lies at the heart of the data center development conundrum. For instance, OpenAI, the Silicon Valley firm that initiated the AI wave three years ago through its revolutionary ChatGPT large language model (LLM) application, is not merely one of the biggest players in the data center space. It’s an underwater one, as well. The fact is, despite the hype, OpenAI is currently generating the largest cumulative losses ever for any startup before turning a profit. A Dec. 4, 2025, study by Deutsche Bank economists found that OpenAI has revenue forecasts of $345 billion between 2024 and 2029, but it comes after $488 billion in spending on data center computer power. That means the firm will run a cash-flow of negative $143 billion. Patrick Wilson, a portfolio manager at CenterSquare Investment Management, said the largest hyperscale data center developments haven’t yet been able to monetize AI technologies, and that, at some point, capital expenditures will start to plateau if investors continue to spend like this. That would signal a risk to investors who are paying for enormous valuations without much in the way of consistent and long-term revenue streams. “At some point, by 2027 or later, the market will want to see some sort of path to monetization for a lot of this spending because the return on investment capital is so paltry, if not nonexistent,” Wilson said. “So I do start to get concerned.” Investors aren’t scared yet. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts found that publicly traded real estate companies increased investments into data centers by 15 percent last year, while research from Refinitiv, part of the London Stock Exchange Group, found that debt market players borrowed $100 billion for data center development in 2025. “2025 was a bit of the early stage of a gold rush, per se, with tons of new entrants, operators, capital providers and tenants,” said Andrew Kaskel, head of data centers advisory at Walker & Dunlop. “While there certainly were a lot of projects announced and funded, it’s really still the early stage of a big growth cycle.” But is it a bubble? Kaskel admitted that, sure, there’s always a chance we’ve entered into a bubble and that things will go south once interest rates rise and demand shifts, as has happened before, particularly during the 1999-2001 dot-com bubble. But this rush of data center development, and AI spending, is fundamentally different for one critical reason. “What we see, day in and day out, and across the data center space, is that the majority of the capital being allocated and invested is backed by the largest, most stable companies in the world, with the healthiest balance sheets on the planet,” said Kaskel. “It’s foundationally built upon really secure companies for the long term.” JLL research found that of the 8 gigawatts of U.S. data centers currently under construction, 73 percent is pre-leased, while vacancies are expected to remain below 5 percent into 2027, and likely hold closer to 2 percent. “Looking at the fundamentals, there is no bubble,” said Sean Farney, vice president of Americas data center strategy at JLL. “Ninety-seven percent of the existing product is utilized, we are the envy of every other industry on Earth. … So the fundamental demand for the product is there, and it’s only getting higher as supply is getting lower.” Even so, this same JLL research report concluded that data center co-location vacancy rates that sit near zero percent are “constraining economic growth and undermining national security,” and that the “restrictive market conditions are counterproductive over the long term.” So, while the money is there, questions abound and answers are few as to who wins and loses as U.S. data center development explodes — with all eyes on the uncertain path the hyperscalers might chart to monetization as the central metric of whether the hundreds of billions of dollars in investment capital will actually be paid back. “We’re a big believer in AI and data enters over the short term, the medium term and the long term,” said Rich Hill, global head of real estate research and strategy at Principal Asset Management. “But every single data center investor might not have a good experience.” Whole new ballgame To understand where data centers might be going, it’s important to understand what they are as an asset class, as like any piece of real estate there is nuance in the bricks and mortar. Since emerging out of the telecommunications building boom that laid the groundwork for the rise of the internet in the 1990s and 2000s, data centers have evolved today into an asset of three distinct classes. There are cloud data centers, which are used to power Americans who shop on Amazon, or search Google, or use their iPhones to save photos on an invisible cloud network. Then there are AI inference data centers, which power the large language models of ChatGPT. Finally, there are much physically larger (and prohibitively more expensive) generative AI data centers, or factories, which are a training model for future AI use — often referred to as “neocloud” — that is still unknown. Data centers within these three classes are either leased to hyperscalers, like Oracle or Meta, or are co-locations, meaning multi-tenant tenant spaces that could include up-and-coming cloud platforms like CoreWeave and Fluidstack. “There’s a lot of money going into generative AI data center development, and we view it as much more speculative, with not as much pre-leasing occurring,” said Principal’s Hill. “I’m not here to tell you if it’s good or bad, a bubble or not a bubble, but we think it’s a much better risk-adjusted return focusing on cloud and AI inference data centers.” Today there are 4,165 data centers in the U.S., an average of 83 per state. The nearest countries by count — the United Kingdom and Germany — have only 499 and 487, respectively, per Statista, a statistics website. Those numbers themselves suggest room for foreign competition on the data center front, and on AI, adding another level of uncertainty to the growth and demand in the U.S. Kristina Metzger, vice chairman at CBRE’s data center capital markets, said national core data center fundamentals are “fantastic,” with less than 2 percent vacancy, 80 percent of the development pipeline pre-leased, little to no speculative development, growing rents, and positive earnings (15 percent year-over-year), all on the back of cloud computing. But it’s the gen AI hubs that have given her pause, mainly due to questions on long-term use and overall business models. “What we’re now working through are new facets of the industry with these AI factories, and neocloud operating models, and those [business models] remain to be determined,” she said. “There isn’t the same overall story as there is in core data centers.” Dave Powell, a partner at law firm King & Spalding, specializes in data centers. He noted that there are numerous expensive questions associated with any data center development. For instance, is an end-user lined up? Is it a big tech firm or not? Will it be a hyperscale site or co-location? And, most importantly, is there a reliable source of power to make the investment pencil? “We really see that it’s all about power — electricity generation is reaching new heights … and with respect to electricity, it’s divided up by markets, and not all markets are created equal,” said Powell. “To develop a data center, you need reliable electricity, which should be relatively inexpensive, you need land, you need to be near a major metropolitan area with favorable, or non-penalizing, regulations from the local government.” Even after all these questions are answered, and the data center is finally built (in compliance with the maze of local zoning codes, of course), perhaps the biggest open-ended question is how investors will make money on an asset class whose tenants still haven’t figured out how to monetize the actual “data” propping up the multibillion-dollar “center.” “It’s a question we hear day in and day out: What is the exit and how do people ultimately get returns? And it’s still to be determined,” said Walker & Dunlop’s Kaskel. “Right now, so much of the capital is being invested on the construction and development side, and these projects are three- to five- to 10-year developments before they reach 100 percent stabilization.” Generational dollars Even amid a laundry list of uncertainties, money has poured into the space since ChatGPT came online in 2022. By 2025, even after years of Wall Street capital behind it, what pushed data centers to another level was the Trump administration’s support for the industry, primarily Trump’s announcement of a $500 billion private sector investment in the construction of 20 new data centers, collectively spanning 10 million square feet, on his first full day back in office. “We have a clear policy to support the data center builds and the recognition that data centers are part of a strategic advantage,” JLL’s Farney said of the nation at large. “[The industry] came into its own in 2025, where there was wide recognition, not just in [big tech] but in financial services, that AI is a critical component of the economy and the value-prop for every company on the face of the Earth.” The evolution of AI has come as the data center space has experienced its own metamorphosis in recent years when it comes to investment capital. Previously, data centers as an asset class were a long-term, buy-and-hold play by public real estate investment trusts (REITs), which don’t tend to sell. But the public REITs eventually realized that cash flows on data centers tended to plateau once they were leased, making them a dilutive investment for public market investors always under the gun to raise debt or equity to acquire more assets and generate quarterly returns. Cue the private equity music. The early 2020s saw Blackstone buy REIT QTS for $10 billion, American Tower purchase CoreSite for $10.1 billion, and KKR scoop up CyrusOne for $15 billion. In 2024 and 2025, the big deals continued. DigitalBridge and Silver Lake bought Vantage Data Centers, a hyperscale data center developer, in a $9.2 billion equity investment, while a consortium backed by NVIDIA, Microsoft, BlackRock and xAI purchased Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the largest deal to date. For many of these acquisitions involving the big-name hyperscalers, the money is chasing profits in the nebulous AI factory space, where many risks remain. “AI factories are quite sizable, so you’re looking at construction budgets north of $20 billion in many instances, so from an equity perspective that takeout remains to be determined, or if it’s something better suited for the public markets,” said CBRE’s Metzger. “There’s just some unknowns. None of these have delivered yet, so that process of overall monetization hasn’t taken place yet … and for some investors these might be very long-term holds.” One reason why investors have jumped so eagerly into the data center space, including the generative AI factory arena, is because of the valuations hyperscalers have experienced in the last five years, especially since AI went mainstream in 2022. Since December 2020, Google’s stock price has increased 258 percent; Microsoft’s has risen 119 percent; Meta’s 144 percent; Apple is up 105 percent; and Oracle’s stock price is 205 percent higher. “People have a general sense of a bubble, but for me it’s irrational investment behavior, and that can be both on the investment side, with capital going in, but also irrational valuations around the companies that are in there,” said CenterSquare’s Wilson. Wilson emphasized that before 2025, public REITs drove the capital into the sector. But today, with hundreds of billions of dollars required for development platforms, REITs are “incredibly small scale” compared to the private players, particularly the Big 4 Silicon Valley firms. He said Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were estimated to deploy $350 billion into the space through 2025 and are expected to invest another $511 billion in 2026. “There’s some thought it might go up, but it will get tougher and tougher to deploy starting in 2028,” he added. “A lot of the physical space will be taken up and installed, there’ll be tremendously tighter markets, and you’ll be going into the tertiary markets in North Dakota, Louisiana, west Texas, and so you do start to bump up against the level where capital expenditures plateau.” Snap, crackle and pop To even a true data center bull like JLL’s Farney, ever since Wall Street jumped into the industry in the early 2020s, the valuations for AI and data centers have been “bonkers,” but that doesn’t mean they’re dangerously priced. “Absolutely, there’s a bubble in equity pricing, along the entire value chain, but when it comes to the fundamentals of business, it’s in no way [a bubble],” he said. “No one can show me the demand is not there.” Sure, demand is all well and good, but industry experts like Chris Russo, who makes a living advising on data center economics, argue there are major, existential questions on how generative AI will be monetized. It could come in the form of all of corporate America adopting a gen AI Microsoft Co-Pilot, which is powered by ChatGPT, or life sciences firms adopting AI hyperscaler technology for research, or every white-collar business in the country automating its human workers as AI chatbots. But those remain theories, if not science fiction. “All of the investment in AI is to ultimately produce LLMs, or AI generative intelligence, but at some point people need to pay to use it as a product,” Russo said, emphasizing that revenue must appear in the flesh to justify investment. “If trillions of dollars are being committed in capital, then there needs to be trillions of dollars of capital to support it,” he added. “The money needs to come from somewhere, and where the money comes from right now is still questionable.” Right now, AI relies on a subscription model, where users pay per month. While the expectation is that large-scale corporate subscriptions will integrate these different AI technologies into their numerous businesses, the real bet is on AI getting intertwined into the everyday lives of ordinary Americans in myriad, unheard-of ways. “The hope is it gets embedded into a lot more areas of your life, and so as these things get better at image recognition, machine learning through visuals, it might integrate into wearables, and it could be embedded into autonomous vehicles diagnostics,” said Wilson. “That’s the thought, but we’re at this precipice, and, if anyone says they know where this technology is headed, call them crazy.” Another wild card in the entire narrative is the power struggle. The Electric Power Research Institute estimates data centers could account for anywhere from 5 percent to 9 percent of all U.S. electricity consumption by 2030. The Environmental and Energy Study Institute forecasts data center electricity demand will reach 130 gigawatts by 2030, and account for 12 percent of U.S. electricity demand. And some of the numbers now being forecast are not just jaw-dropping, but in some cases fanciful. CNBC reported the Electric Reliability Council of Texas projects 220 gigawatts of large data center developments have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030. Mike Hogan, senior adviser to Regulatory Assistance Project, a nonprofit think tank that advises on energy policy, noted that 225 gigawatts of new data center demand in Texas is almost six times the current peak load of the whole state, which is projected to be 40 gigawatts by 2030, and that the U.S. power grid is 900 gigawatts total. “It’s very, very difficult to imagine that all of that development is for real,” said Hogan, who noted many data center development contracts counted are duplicative across states, or speculative. “I’m far from alone in thinking that we’re in the middle of a bubble. But it’s also true that if only 10 percent of that comes through, it’s a significant amount of new load.” Russo, another skeptic, noted that, right now, data center developers are “almost indifferent to what energy costs,” because returns are currently so high, while the average American voter might not be so amenable to increased energy bills due to the wave of new data center deals. “Data centers are making clear one of the fundamental principles of markets: When something is scarce, it becomes expensive, and, at the moment, there is a very large demand for electricity from data centers and consumers, and that increases prices,” he said. “Everyone loves market incentives, but nobody likes the side effects of higher bills.” Even if the access to power for data center developers has immediate solutions — JLL’s Farney noted that large consumers are creating their own multistate natural gas arrangements, while also investing heavily into alternatives to existing grid technology via nuclear power, coal and solar — there is still the threat inherent in the technology itself. Unlike railroad infrastructure or telecommunication fiber optic cables, the chips built today that power data centers won’t be useful in five years, let alone 100 years, according to Russo. “The speed at which this technology depreciates — and a lot of the value is consumed very quickly — is astonishing compared to other industries,” he said. “It’s like developing an office building and replacing the plumbing and wiring almost immediately.” CenterSquare’s Wilson said the bubble threat to the market isn’t so much like the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, but more like the boom-and-bust cycle that occurred during the growth of the railroad industry in the 19th century. “I do think this is a huge inflection point in society going forward,” he said. “This isn’t a fad, but there will be, like there always is in bubbles, if we can call this a bubble, wreckage, and there will be losers.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

Share this article Bank of America’s wealth advisers will be permitted to recommend Bitcoin ETFs to their clients starting today. Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, told Yahoo Finance last month that the bank would officially kick off coverage for four Bitcoin ETFs, including Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), and BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), on January 5. The bank endorses a 1%–4% allocation to digital assets for clients across Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank, and Merrill Edge. With this move, Bank of America is joining Morgan Stanley in expanding access to digital asset investment products for its clients. The move is viewed as a meaningful change from the bank’s former conservative position on digital assets. Greater availability of Bitcoin ETFs through major financial institutions could draw new investors into the market and potentially boost overall demand.

Title: Ethereum has long talked a big game. Now it’s time for the second biggest blockchain to deliver
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2026/01/05/ethereum-2026-vitalik-buterin-fork-in-the-road/
Time Published: 2026-01-05T12:36:31Z
Full Content:
On Jan. 1, Vitalik Buterin announced a New Year’s resolution for the blockchain he devised way back in 2013. It’s time, he declared, for Ethereum to step up and deliver on its original mission: “To build the world computer that serves as a central infrastructure piece of a more free and open internet.” Buterin’s message is a timely one. For more than a decade now, Ethereum has offered the tantalizing promise of a global computer, available to anyone, that can be used to create decentralized alternatives to Big Tech’s data-gobbling monopolies. The blockchain popularized smart contracts, and has been a springboard for thousands of projects backed by billions of dollars. It has also spawned legions of mostly fly-by-night imitators. Despite all of this, the promise of Ethereum always seems just over the horizon. In recent years, the blockchain has come to resemble that can’t-miss sports prospect who can’t quite hack it in the big leagues. Instead of evolving into a popular global computer, Ethereum still feels like a sub-culture where cliques of insiders build esoteric applications for each other. In response, many in the crypto world started betting on other horses like Solana that promised to deliver practical results. Ethereum’s problem, ironically, has been its idealism. The blockchain has a core community that believes passionately in decentralization, and is mistrustful of anything resembling formal authority. That includes Buterin, who stepped back from his creation several years ago, preferring to let Ethereum find its own path forward. All of this is admirable, especially in contrast to many recent arrivals on the crypto scene, whose first and only concern is to make a buck. Unfortunately, it has also led Ethereum developers to dither in the face of obvious problems, including congestion and high gas fees. To be fair, the blockchain has made some important fixes—but only after allowing piggy-back chains, known as layer 2s, to siphon off large amounts of revenue and make the crypto landscape painfully complicated. Now, though, change could be in the air. In the last two years, both BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase have launched tokenized assets that settle directly to the main Ethereum blockchain. This is a testament to how Ethereum remains the gold standard for security and points to a future where it will be the backbone of global finance. The tokenized transactions also legitimize Ethereum’s claim to be a universal computer, and could spur the mainstream adoption of other decentralized applications for social media, identity, and more. For this to happen, though, the Ethereum community will require Buterin’s ongoing leadership. That’s why his New Year’s Day post is a welcome development. The piece reinforced the primacy of decentralization as Ethereum’s paramount value: “We’re building decentralized applications. Applications that run without fraud, censorship or third-party interference. Applications that pass the walkaway test: they keep running even if the original developers disappear.” But it also delivered a pragmatic piece of advice to the community seeking to build this decentralized future: Get on with it, already.

The company added the token will not be transferable and “cannot be exchanged for cash” but could become redeemable for Trump Media discounts. (FT) Memecoin misery: In a year that saw silver outperform every other asset, Bitcoin notched a 5% decrease in 2025. But the biggest losers of 2026 were memecoins with Dogwifhat down 91%, $TRUMP down 93% and Milei’s $LIBRA down 99%.

(WSJ) Ilya Lichtenstein, the mastermind behind the multi-billion dollar Bitfinex hack, is the latest crypto criminal to walk free. He now faces a fate many would regard as worse than prison—resuming domestic life with his rapper wife Razzlekhan. It was once fashionable for journalists to seize on price slumps in order to write sneering columns predicting Bitcoin’s demise. These “Bitcoin obituaries” persisted well after the currency’s viability became clear, but now appear to have finally faded altogether.

Title: Even the Wall Street Journal Doubts the Trump Seize-Venezuela-Oil Scheme

Full Content:
Alert readers immediately noticed the disconnect between Trump’s signature braggadocio and the more cautious remarks from the other members of Trump’s team after the kidnapping of Venezuela’s president Nicholas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. Trump skipped the narco-terrorism pretext despite a US indictment being the pretext for the abduction; he instead talked up having US companies exploit Venezuela’s reserves: “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.” But many observers quickly compared the Trump press conference to Bush’s “Mission Accomplished” moment as the Venezuela government not only remains in place but its acting president Delcy Rodriguez maintains that Maduro remains the country’s leader and that Venezuela will not cede to US colonialist demands. And perhaps being a smidge more realistic, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, by contrast, presented the US as having narrower aims, of simply removing Maduro, at the initial presser, and has been trying to square the circle of Trump being high on his show of force versus the fact that the US is not even remotely in control of Venezuela. From Politico: In the wake of the U.S.’s capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday made it clear that it is somewhat unclear what’s next for the Latin American country. His comments come as Democratic leaders continue to decry the administration’s actions in Venezuela and push for the White House to seek congressional approval for such military operations. In multiple interviews, Rubio emphasized that the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela but stopped short of explaining exactly what the U.S. role in the country will look like as both nations reel from Maduro’s arrest — and in the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s statement Saturday that the U.S. would “run” Venezuela for an indeterminate time. “We are at war against drug trafficking organizations, not at war against Venezuela,” Rubio told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Rubio added that oil sanctions will remain in place, and the U.S. reserves the right to issue strikes against alleged drug boats heading toward America. But while Rubio told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that the U.S. is not occupying Venezuela, he did not reject the idea that it could be a future option from the Trump administration. Trump, Rubio said, “does not feel like he is going to publicly rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that’s not what you’re seeing right now.” “What you’re seeing right now is a quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next,” he added. Many experts with knowledge of the region, such as Larry Johnson, have given repeated, long-form accounts of how much harder it would be to conquer Venezuela that Iraq, even before factoring in that our army is much smaller and weaker now than then. A short version of this line of argument from Modern War Monitor: Venezuela is heavily armed. Years of political polarization, along with an expanded role for security forces and pro-government colectivos, mean that weapons and combat experience are not in short supply. The country’s borders are long, porous and already used by guerrillas, paramilitaries, and criminal networks. To see what that might look like in practice, you don’t have to speculate; you can look next door. Colombia’s armed conflict, officially dating from 1964, pitted the state against FARC, ELN, and a web of paramilitary and criminal actors for decades. It persisted, in part, because armed groups could slip across borders, find safe havens, move contraband, and restock. Even with massive US funding under Plan Colombia and repeated “final” offensives, the state never achieved a clean victory; violence simply changed shape. Translate that pattern into a post-Maduro Venezuela run in practice by US–backed figures, and you can sketch the basic dynamic. There will be bombings of police stations and government offices, high-profile assassinations, and attacks on oil infrastructure. Kidnapping Americans or US contractors will become a lucrative tactic. Armed groups will drift across the Colombian and Brazilian borders and into the jungle or mountains when pressure grows. Even Sky News is reporting that men and women on the street are speaking out on behalf of the current regime: 🗣️ "The US is not interested in freedom or democracy, it is interested in our oil." Venezuelans gathered in Caracas to express their solidarity with Nicolas Maduro, who was captured by the United States following a series of airstrikes. Latest updates: https://t.co/4w875fZU8W pic.twitter.com/b5byRmj15m — Sky News (@SkyNews) January 4, 2026 So oil theater is signature Trump, of acting like empty bags have value. He talked up his “raw earths” deal with Zelensky, which still proved to be a difficult negotiation even with the US theoretically holding all the card by providing Ukraine with critical intel and targeting along with weapons, particularly air defenses. And that’s before getting to the fact that as of when the agreement was inked, over one-half of the “Ukraine” reserves were in Russian hands, and how much of Ukraine eventually winds up being formally part of Russia and/or in a rump Ukraine that is a Russian vassal is up in the air. Similarly, in the 28 to 20 point piece plan floating about, Trump’s negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner claim that one of two really key US demands involves joint ownership of the Zaporzhizhia nuclear power plant and the disposition of its energy. This idea is delusional. Russia deems Zaprozhizhia to be part of Russia and is not going to hand part of the nuclear facility to the US to make nice to Trump. We’ve already discussed that wringing more production out of Venezuela’s oil fields would require a long period of investment before any real payoff took place. And the precedent of Iraq, where we had occupied the country, bodes ill. Despite oil being seen as the most logical objective for the US invasion, it was years before oil producers started investing. Admittedly, the embargo is increasing pressure on the Venezuela government. Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA is cutting crude production because it is running out of storage capacity due to an ongoing US oil blockade that has halted exports, increasing pressure on the interim government https://t.co/eAelegFxHM pic.twitter.com/sIs9UqaQei — Reuters Business (@ReutersBiz) January 5, 2026 So why not stick with Plan A? Was this yet another manifestation of Trump’s extreme need to be seen as dominating world events? To create a distraction from the Epstein files and increasing certainty that Russia will secure a military victory in Ukraine, which will mean Trump lost? IMHO the initial apparent success of the Trump “Raid not invade” in Caracas almost assures that he will take Greenland when Ukraine is clearly toast. Not surprisingly, the mainstream media is raising eyebrows over Trump’s grandiose oil exploitation claims. It is true that the US has motive, in that our refineries are tuned so that 70% of the oil they process is heavier grades, despite the US producing light sweet crudes.1 And commentators have pointed out that after the US sanctioned Russia, cutting it off from its medium heavy crude. Even though Russian supplies purportedly represented only 3% of US imports and experts predicted that its loss would matter little to the US, Biden turned to Venezuela almost immediately after imposing the shock and awe sanctions, explicitly to replace Russian fuel. However, heavy and sour (as in sulfur-ridden) crude of the Venezuela sort is expensive to process. The current low oil price environment, driven by less-than-robust growth in much of the world,2 is an unfavorable backdrop, even before getting to perfectly reasonable big corporate concerns about safety and expropriation risk. Do not be fooled by Trump likely succeeding in having a flurry of meetings with big oil execs. There was also a lot of dog-and-pony showing for a Ukraine reconstruction fund, starting under Biden, that continued with Trump. Many misread the involvement of giant fund manager BlackRock, which had signed up only as an adviser and had not committed any money. We featured an OilPrice article in late 2025 that argued that it didn’t make economic sense for the US to try to seize Venezuela’s oil. First from our long intro: This article explains why Venezuela’s oil is not of much strategic value to the US and its infrastructure would take a lot of investment over a long time to bring up to snuff. Yet Trump has shifted his justification from narco-terrorism to, erm, retaking the oil and other assets, in going to war with Venezuela (recall a blockade is an act of war)… Recall that after the weapons of mass destruction justification for the Iraq war fell apart, the Administration then provided a series of pretexts, even as most observers argued that the oil was the reason. Iraq then had the world’s second largest proven reserves, and they were highly prized light sweet crude. And while the US still has substantial control over Iraq’s oil exports, the US were slow to invest in Iraq’s oil infrastructure. I cannot find the source, but I recall reading that the majors were not comfortable the US level of exploitation of the Iraqi resource…. A 2012 Aljazeera story intimated that the Western firms, even though they won the critical oil concessions after the war, had not done as well as they had hoped, confirming the idea that the exploitation of the Iraq resource was not handled in an expeditious manner…. But my impression is that the later theories, that Iraq was a stepping stone on the way to subjugating Iran, and the oil was at most a secondary objective, are on target. From the OilPrice article proper: The Wall Street Journal story flagged in our headline comes to similar conclusions. From Trump Wants to Unlock Venezuela’s Oil Reserves. A Huge Challenge Awaits: The Trump administration’s move to oust Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro…. will pave the way for U.S. oil companies to regain a foothold in the South American nation, President Trump said at a Mar-a-Lago press conference. “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” he said. But getting foreign companies to flock back to Venezuela will be a massive challenge. Chevron is the only major U.S. oil company there…. Other oil executives will be forced to gauge the stability on the ground in a country where the industry has fallen into disarray… The other obstacle facing Trump’s effort to put more of Venezuela’s viscous crude into the global market is that the world doesn’t have much of an appetite for more oil… The U.S. hasn’t detailed the mechanics of how it would bring more American oil companies into Venezuela to boost production. Analysts say it could facilitate a process that would allow companies to bid for oil and gas blocks and question whether European companies could also bid for the right to enter the country. As readers know, that assumes subjugation of Venezuela or cooperation that has yet to be in evidence. The article cited a statement by Chevron being “focused” on employee safety and “integrity” of its Venezuela operation. Not hard to read that as an expression of heightened concern. In passing, it also signaled doubt about whether the level of Venezuelan reserves are as large as claimed (supposedly the largest in the world). This is not crazy. Matthew Simmons of Peak Oil fame produced tables showing OPEC members posting sudden increases in claimed reserves, which he documented had no substantiation (as in no new discoveries or changes in production methods that could lead to bigger supplies from existing assets). He argued a big reason for these rises was that OPEC set production levels among its members based on their proven reserves. Back to the Journal: In the U.S., the shale boom unleashed record levels of oil production, but the kind of oil American frackers are pumping doesn’t work as well as heavy crude produced in Venezuela, Canada and Mexico. Venezuela’s government says its proved oil reserves top 300 billion barrels, which, if true, would make its bounty the world’s largest. Other big oil companies that are potentially interested in re-entering Venezuela will almost certainly take time to evaluate the situation because the country has a track record of appropriating oil assets, as it did in the 1970s and the 2000s, analysts said. ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil pulled out of Venezuela in 2007 after then-President Hugo Chávez nationalized their assets. Conoco later sued the Venezuelan government for more than $20 billion; Exxon sued for $12 billion. The companies were awarded fractions of their losses in protracted arbitration proceedings… Orlando Ochoa, a Caracas-based economist and a visiting fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, described the Herculean task of jump-starting the moribund energy industry, which has seen tens of thousands of trained professionals flee the country under Maduro’s authoritarian rule. He said that includes drafting a broad economic stabilization plan to attract the financing Venezuela badly needs from multilateral lenders to rebuild infrastructure and rusted oil-field installations. Local laws need to be modified to allow private energy firms to operate without state overreach, he added. And the government has to restructure some $160 billion in debt and settle pending arbitration cases with foreign companies to convince them to come back. “What the U.S. needs to do is to implement a form of a Marshall Plan,” said Ochoa, referring to the economic program that helped rebuild Europe after World War II. “This is about much more than coming into the oil and gas sector just to extract crude from the ground.” Good luck with that. This is from a bunch that is so seat-of-the-pants that it can’t even conduct negotiations with Russia on a disciplined basis. Reuters echoes the Journal’s concerns: Venezuela was a founding member of OPEC with Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Its struggles with electricity production have repeatedly hampered mining and oil operations. The country was producing as much as 3.5 million barrels per day of crude in the 1970s, which at the time represented over 7% of global oil output. Production fell below 2 million bpd during the 2010s and averaged some 1.1 million bpd last year or just 1% of global production. That’s roughly the same production as the U.S. state of North Dakota. “If developments ultimately lead to a genuine regime change, this could even result in more oil on the market over time. However, it will take time for production to recover fully,” said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen from Global Risk Management… “History shows that forced regime change rarely stabilises oil supply quickly, with Libya and Iraq offering clear and sobering precedents,” said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy. Reuters usefully presents 2019 and 2021 data from Venezuela on gold, coal and nickel reserves. It also includes this interesting factoid: Venezuela owes about $10 billion to China after China became the largest lender under late President Hugo Chavez. Venezuela repays loans with crude transported in three very large crude carriers previously co-owned by Venezuela and China. But Reuters oddly does not mention the large gas field off the coast of Venezuela and Guyana, which relates to a long-standing territorial dispute.3 Finally from the New York Times: The national oil company, known as PDVSA, lacks the capital and expertise to increase production. The country’s oil fields are run down and suffer from “years of insufficient drilling, dilapidated infrastructure, frequent power cuts and equipment theft,” according to a recent study by Energy Aspects, a research firm. The United States has placed sanctions on Venezuelan oil, which is now exported primarily to China….. In theory, if U.S. oil companies were given greater access in Venezuela, they could help gradually turn the industry around. “But it’s not going to be a straightforward proposition,” said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects. Analysts say increasing Venezuelan production will not be cheap. Energy Aspects estimated that adding another half a million barrels a day of production would cost $10 billion and take about two years. Major increases might require “tens of billions of dollars over multiple years,” the firm said. Some experts are throwing even more cold water on the Trump hoped-for oil heist. Be sure to click through. The analysis is detailed and devastating. I have spent a lot of time talking shit at people with opinions on Venezuela's oil production potential, and how it's going to "RePLaCe CanADa". So here's my contribution — how I see the cost of replacing Canadian crude with Venezuelan heavy. I think it's a nearly $1 trillion… pic.twitter.com/XFlPVwPdew — Michael Spyker (@ShaleTier7) January 4, 2026 To entice you to read the whole tweet, one paragraph from the middle: The problem is they don’t have the power infrastructure to add the power needed for 3MMBbls/d of SAGD for steam generation, and even for primary recovery they don’t have the electricity they need. So you need to build 10-15 GW of new power infra, at gas-fired capital cost including transmission and the new midstream infra to move gas (including LNG import terminals), that’s another $40-75Bn just to get the power to the SAGD facilities. There are constant rolling blackouts in the country. You also need ~7-900MB/d of diluent looping on the Venezuela side, including DRUs for another ~$25Bn. Other local midstream refurb is at least $15Bn to replace ashphalted and corroded trunk lines. Any North American firm would also have to commit to cleaning up Lake Maracaibo which is a $10Bn commitment. So this Trump romp in South America is sure to end badly. The big open question is whether Trump decides to break more china there or goes TACO and moves to other, seemingly easier, targets. ____ 1 Thanks to the state of search, I have been unable to find estimates of how much it would cost to retune a refinery to process lighter grades, although I infer that newer refineries make this possible at lower cost than for older ones. Per the American Fuel & Petroleum Manufacturers website : Long before the U.S. shale boom, when global production of light sweet crude oil was declining, we made significant investments in our refineries to process heavier, high-sulfur crude oils that were more widely available in the global market. These investments were made to ensure U.S. refineries would have access to the feedstocks needed to produce gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Heavier crude is now an essential feedstock for many U.S. refineries. Substituting it for U.S. light sweet crude oil would make these facilities less efficient and competitive, leading to a decline in fuel production and higher costs for consumers. 2 Trump tariffs and Chinese overinvestment and resulting deflation are big drivers. Neither looks set to change soon. 3 Among other things, Venezuela has credibly alleged that the long-ago arbitrator was bribed. I am skipping over this topic for now, but those interested, please see The Guyana-Venezuela dispute and UK involvement and Guyana’s Oil Wealth Drives Tensions With Venezuela. So one view is that the subjugation of Venezuela would also solve the Venezuela dispute with Guyana and facilitate development there. This is reminiscent of Peter Cook’s World Domination League,,where you would knock on the door and politely ask to be allowed to dominate people. Some Admiral in the US is looking at the budget for this killing present appropriations and the maintenance costs of keeping all these old ships on station longer than they should and shaking his head. Not that I don’t think the fix is in but it can’t be done on the cheap like they are trying. power peeps care not one whit about doing things on the cheap. Budgets and spending are matters of Political Will, and Political Won’t. There will always be plenty of money to procure arms, siphon dough off to the MIC, to protect Oil resources that the US assumes and asserts are ‘hers’. Same Old Sh*t, different Emperial action. I guess with Trump, it is Imperial? I hope that Dulci and the Chavista movement stay strong in Venezuela but I’m uneasy about her 1-hour reported call with Narco Rubio and the fact there was no military opposition to the raid. I also hope that Trump takes Greenland next. It will be delicious to see the craven EU twist itself into a pretzel to not sanction the US in anyway despite the latter waging a war against it. It will expose it to those who still don’t see how useless it is. The handover from Rafael Correa to Lenin Moreno in Ecuador constitutes a sobering precedent: from a leftist government that implemented quite a number of reforms favouring the working class, sovereignty in the exploitation of resources, and autonomy from the USA to one doing a 180-turn (Baerbock-360) that privatized everything, abolished social reforms, exited ALBA, accepted the yoke of the IMF, and started a steady cooperation with the USA. The former basis of Correa protested heavily, and was crushed. Moreno had been vice-president of Correa, and was member of the same party — just like Delcy Rodriguez wrt. Nicolas Maduro. The Defense Minister’s house was bombed and he is alive only by virtue of having gotten to a shelter. At least two of the ~10 helicopters were hit, which means shot at, and some soliders were injured as a result but I infer not badly. The US sent in over 150 planes. From Task & Purpose: The force included a mix of Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps bombers, fighter jets and electronic attack planes, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Saturday. Speaking at a press conference with President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Caine said that the force used included “F-22s, F, 35s, F-18s, EA18s, E-2s B-1, bombers and other support aircraft, as well as numerous remotely piloted drones.” The various aircraft hit several targets in Venezuela, including the La Guaira port, the military headquarters complex at Fort Tiuna in Caracas and multiple airports. While the jets and bombers flew overhead and prepared for any aerial response, helicopters flown by the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment entered, carrying members of Delta Force. They flew over a largely blacked out Caracas, which Trump implied was as a result of operations by American forces. Caine noted that U.S. Cyber Command and Space Command carried out actions in support of the air assault. https://taskandpurpose.com/news/fighters-bombers-venezuela-attack-maduro/ And Vanessa Beeley speculated: Were the alleged 5000 Russian-manufactured Manpad systems jammed, as happened in Iran during the first 24 hours of the Zionist aggression in June 2025? https://beeley.substack.com/p/14-points-on-trump-kidnap-of-venezuelan? Listened to a few podcasts this morning and it was either Alastair Cook or Chas Freeman or both who said that 30 Cuban soldiers who comprised Maduro’s personal bodyguard were all killed. Yesterday there was that report from the Russian pundit (Korbyko?) who claimed Russian forces went in to protect Maduro and were fired on by his bodyguard – that claim seems a little odd to me. All that seems certain at this point was that there was some resistance to his capture. thank you. I watched Max and Anya’s livestream about this yesterday and they didn’t have these details yet. And from today’s links, I learned that a military base repelled an attack as well so there was some resistance. Very clean operation by the US. It seems very likely the CIA did pay for a lot of intel and perhaps some cooperation. But IMHO there is a tendency to over-rely on that idea as being the main driver here due to: 1. Bias to see Latinos as corrupt 2. Bias to see US military as not very good (when our special ops are pretty good). And remember, Mossad likely helped a lot. 3. Psyops playing up idea of top level cooperation to weaken Rodriguez and incumbents (keep pressure on them) and make US operation look less illegitimate at the margin (ie, locals cooperated in the raid). Greenland will be much easier: 1. Declare Greenland US territory 2. Send ICE in to round-up and deport the non-US citizens to willing Sub-Saharan hosts There’s less than 60,000 of soon-to-be illegals in Greenland– Homeland Security can clean house in a week. Wouldn’t this be the end of NATO? (I wouldn’t cry for this) Urup would finally have to face up to its submerging reality and cut its increasingly threadbare cloth accordingly. South America could not supply enough coke to cope. How does Trump even TACO from this mess? Release Maduro? I guess he could hold Maduro in legal limbo a la Assange for years/decades. A la Assange, a la Epstein, a la Milosevic, a la Hussein, a la carte. There’s a lot on the menu. Hei, wouldn’t it be something if they Epsteined him?!? Hear the shrieks get even louder! Perhaps the U.S. has learned from previous mistakes (Iraq, Libya) and realized that destroying an existing regime is not a good idea. The oil industry requires long-term investments, which depend on stability. The process I am seeing reminds me of the “Transition” in Spain in 1978. In a smooth “Transition,” the current elites retain most of their power in exchange for: 1) providing stability, 2) accommodating U.S. interests, and 3) eventually moving to the background. If the Spanish “Transition” is the template, we should see elections within 1-2 years, with the winner being a “centrist” candidate. Someone clarify: When in the last 60 years has the US learned from a mistake, whether or not that mistake was admitted? I’m not coming up with a single one, except for multiple examples of the learning part being “keep it even more secret”. They’ve lerned to stop the draft after the Vietnam War, and feed their grinder with foreign meat. That’s what kept them going. “Words calculated to catch everyone may catch no one.” “The sound of tireless voices is the price we pay for the right to hear the music of our own opinions. But there is also, it seems to me, a moment at which democracy must prove its capacity to act. Every man has a right to be heard; but no man has the right to strangle democracy with a single set of vocal cords.” Adlai Stevenson Trump’s goal is not to seize oil. Rather, he wants to avenge his humiliating loss in Ukraine by defeating Russia’s key allies, such as Syria and Venezuela. Perhaps you’re right. But according to Mercouris at least, Russia is doing surprisingly well in Syria under the new regime, and this strike against Venezuela is most likely to result in the Russia/China relationship getting even stronger as China might look to Russia for even more oil… https://youtu.be/5CrOrDheZ9s?si=yf3LZJyEGuJLDbjf Perhaps Trump has achieved a key goal in cutting off a Petro supply line to China? May be insignificant in the number of tankers going through Panana but will be seen as a win by Trump to attempt restricting Chinese economic growth. *Sigh* Please consider uinsg a search engine, as I just did: Trump suggested on Saturday that China will continue to receive some Venezuelan oil under a U.S.-led government in Caracas, but that amount is likely to be limited. https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-oil-refiners-win-chinese-rivals-lose-trumps-venezuela-strike-2026-01-04/ * The US’s intervention in Venezuela will likely choke oil flows to China, as China is the major buyer of crude from the South American country. * Venezuelan shipments provide a unique type of crude used to produce bitumen, which is vital for construction and road building, and is also deeply discounted, making it popular with China’s independent refiners. * A hoard of sanctioned crude in floating storage will cushion Chinese buyers in the coming months, with almost 82 million barrels currently on tankers in waters off China and Malaysia. The US’s shock intervention in Venezuela will likely choke oil flows to China, although the short-term impact will be softened by large volumes of sanctioned crude being stored at sea. China is the major buyer of crude from the South American country, but that trade now looks in jeopardy after the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. President Donald Trump said the US would run the country and American companies would rebuild its oil industry and sell a “large amount” to global buyers, including current customers and new ones, without specifically mentioning China. https://archive.is/gRk9D#selection-1611.0-1647.341 Russia can provide China with heavy crude (Urals is medium heavy), increasing Chinese dependence on Russia, but filling any bitumen gap would take some doing. From an article explaining why Russia’s bitumen exports had fallen: Russia’s strategic reorientation of oil-product sales toward Asia—especially China and South Asia—complicated logistical flows for bitumen specifically. Unlike crude oil and gasoil, bitumen is not easily rerouted through long-distance maritime transport without special heating systems, viscosity management, and insulated storage. Some of Russia’s older export terminals on the Baltic Sea and Black Sea lacked the upgraded heating and pumping infrastructure required for large-scale redirection. As a result, even if the intention existed to replace European markets with Asian importers, the operational and technical constraints reduced Russia’s ability to shift bitumen exports efficiently. https://bitumenmag.com/News/global-repercussions-of-russias-declining-bitumen-output-in-2025 Thanks Yves, first time contributor so learning the ropes. Will get better. Sorry to have seemed rough on you and appreciate you being a good sport. While 80-90% of Venezuela’s crude oil export goes to China in recent years, only 4% of China’s crude import comes from Venezuela according to a recent report from Reuters. China is probably more worried about the debt it lent to Venezuela. And China can buy heavy crude from Canada… Willy OAM, over at his YouTube channel (Legends) mentioned on his video yesterday that lots of liars are using statistics to distort the dependence of China on Venezuelan oil. Apparently, only 4% of China’s oil comes from Venezuela. So, they should be able to easily replace that even if Trump succeeds in blocking oil exports. I was half listening to Trump waffle on about taking Venezuela’s oil when he used a word that I had not heard him using before in talking about that oil and I think that it was the word recompense. He was saying that he would take the oil and profits would be used to help the Venezuelan people. That was what the government has been doing and I am sure that he only means certain parts of the population. Regardless, he slipped that word recompense in and what I think that he means is this. He will take that oil, sell it, deduct what the US has had to pay for this to happen (I would imagine that would also include the tens of billions of dollars spent on the blockade) and then they would take out recompense. By that I am sure that he means the decades worth of lost profits that the US never made on that oil so in the end, there will be very little left for the common people. This plus the Michael Spyker thread prompts ”socialize the costs, privatize the profits”-dictum How many and which billionaires do you need to off in order to stop this evil? Sounds like trickle-down economics, with high viscosity fluid. :) https://www.upworthy.com/pitch-drop-experiment-still-fascinates After Saturday’s presser, with Trump talking about oil and identifying the colonial viceroys standing behind him while the others talked only of narco-gang-poison-crime and getting the kingpin in SDNY, I was thinking about my remark when we were discussing this Oil Price (quoted again above) that it might still be about the oil for Trump. I had opined that perhaps Trump doesn’t understand the obstacles, like he doesn’t understand about the effects of tariffs, and there may be neocons that find it useful for him to believe the oil story. Now Yves added a very interesting dimension to this: he’s doing sales theater like with the Ukraine minerals. Trump the real estate developer has a long career of talking up things that don’t exist trying to raise the investment needed to make them, many of the things being completely pie-in-the-sky, and that’d often be fitting in projects’ early stages (compare selling Venezuelan oil production licenses to selling Theranos equity). With all that experience Trump may find it reflexive and/or natural-feeling to talk up the oil like he did. Ultimately, the real motives for this whole Venezuelan adventure are most likely the usual 1) empire, in this case establishing the Donroe Doctrine (which the CW seems to accept, judging from early reactions), and 2) he needed a distraction from all the failing at home and some highly visible win. The usual, indeed. And there is no such thing as narco-terrorism. Adults willing to go on camera and say narco-terrorism out loud or claim “we are at war withbdrig traffickers” are so obviously lying. With this administration, don’t they even have a truth to hide? Trump is a 1980s Reagan guy living in a 21st century world and that applies to much of the Repub party that supports him. Meanwhile the Dems try to coast on their own brand fumes. The only thing new in our not so brave new world is the rise of the computer industry and they too live in an imaginary bubble. I’ve been rewatching old episodes of the Mike Judge absurdist comedy Silicon Valley. The characters are all deeply weird comic types and it’s hilarious. He satirizes the way these nerds talk about “making the world a better place” when it’s really all about money even if the central character–the nerdiest of all–does seem sincere. Trump apes all that “better place” lingo but nobody could possibly buy his pitch unless they are feeling trapped by TINA. When that last collapses maybe things will finally change. …he needed a distraction from all the failing at home and some highly visible win. Doing an imperialist takeover of some foreign country is not a good way to distract the population from your failures. Recent decades have given us plenty of examples of how these operations inevitably play out, which is more gigantic failures and usually the signature catastrophe of your administration. When you think of Lyndon Johnson, what do you think of? Vietnam! When you think of Ronald Reagan, what do you think of? Iran-Contra! When you think of Bill Clinton, what do you think of? Iraq (part 1)! When you think of GW bush, what do you think of? Afghanistan and Iraq (part 2). When you think of Obama, what do you think of? Iraq and Afghanistan! When you think of Biden, what do you think of? Ukraine and Afghanistan! I will leave it as an exercise to the reader regarding what Trump’s historic legacy will be. Bushco will always be remembered as the sawdust head Charlie McCarthy to Edgar Bergen Cheney. It’s a long time between now and November, and today’s “win” could well turn into a significant political loss – particularly if Trump régime follows it up with Iran, or the Russians start deliberately taking out Americans in the Ukraine, or the Taiwanese decide that China has prepared an offer they can’t refuse, or that he makes a move on Greenland and steps on Russian and Chinese toes. Great analysis, as usual, Yves. Especially in this, err, overly dynamic situation. I’m curious about your views on the point Larry Johnson made recently that this is a step towards the US guaranteeing it’s supply of oil in the face of potential oil market upheavals if Israel (+US) attack Iran? This could be simply getting a few pieces on the board in advance of a longer Iran play… What do you think? its really reallty really worthwhile to read the Stryker X thread: https://x.com/ShaleTier7/status/2007936384448024898 which assumes no resistance (in the new age of drones, where China and Russia have incentive to bog the US down in a new Vietnam). There also is an assumption that China will provide the necessary rare earths and components to allow the US to retool the Venezuelan oil industry to prevent it from exporting oil to China! If that is Johnson’s argument, I don’t understand it. Venezuela supplies to global markets are too small to have any impact on a closure-of-the-Strait-of-Hormuz scenario. Thanks. From this article https://larrycjohnson.substack.com/p/is-the-maduro-kidnapping-a-prelude Larry says I believe the true objective of the kidnapping operation to remove Maduro is to secure US control of Venezuelan oil in anticipation of a disruption of the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf when Israel, with US-backing, launches a new attack on Iran Although having read through the long tweet by ShaleTier7 and the arguments you make above, I am also persuaded that if this *was* their thinking they have sorely miscalculated. What a shock. Cheers It may be that Larry Johnson assumes a lack of knowledge alongside frail intellectual abilities are the guiding stars of US policy. Or it could be that Trump is going to re-make all the roads in the US, re-build all the bridges and develop wonderful housing estates for the poor and generally make every white Amercan life great again. What a guy! Thank you for this excellent analysis. “Some Admiral in the US is looking at the budget for this killing present appropriations and the maintenance costs of keeping all these old ships on station longer than they should and shaking his head.” I am curious what the cost of the whole Venezuela project has been to ‘arrest’ Maduro. The Pricer says around $60 million. https://www.thepricer.org/how-much-did-the-u-s-spend-to-capture-maduro/ That seems very low to me. Navy ships have continuous overhead, but I believe being on station must be more expensive. And then there is the strikes on the narco-terrorist boats, the DEA, the Coast Guard involvement. A lot of money for nothing in my book. Same with the money spent ‘getting’ all the terrorists we have chased for 25 years. I guess the payoff must be the resulting militaristic rule in the USA. That Pricer article attempted to define the incremental costs of the op. It states a major uncertainty is the ordnance expended. It doesn’t attempt to cost out the general presence mission cost. Keep in mind we have had an ongoing level of effort counter-drug op in the Caribbean for about as long as I’ve been around. Of course we have gone from a board-and-arrest model to attack-and-destroy. That’s separate from the cost of enforcing sanctions. Trump is obviously high on his supposed perfect military abduction. Unfortunately, when his oil heist doesn’t go as planned, and it won’t, Trump will probably get uglier toward the Venezuelan people. Trump basically sounds like a mob boss when he said if the new president Delcy Rodriguez “doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” Trump, according to the NYT, told reporters, “And don’t ask me who’s in charge, because I’ll give you an answer, and it’ll be very controversial.” “What does that mean?” a reporter asked. “It means we’re in charge,” the president said. One might think of the Nazis and the annexation of Austria. Hitler visited Austria to meet with Austrian Nazis. This was Hitler’s home country. He spent time visiting his family home and the border crossing where his father worked. It seemed he cared about Austrians. It didn’t work out well for Austrians or the Austrian Nazis who thought they were more or less partners. The Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg was arrested and spent the war in a concentration camp. Austrian ministers were replaced when Hitler sent his own ministers to Vienna to run the country. Austrian Nazis had little or no power. The Austrian Central bank was looted for its gold and foreign reserves. Austria’s iron ore deposits were seized immediately, as well as other mineral resources, oil, art works, etc. I hope the Venezuelans realize what Trump has in store for them. Looks like the interm president got the message: Venezuelan interim leader tones down criticism, ready to ‘work with the US’ Acting President Delcy Rodriguez calls for a ‘balanced and respectful’ relationship with Washington during transition. “We extend an invitation to the US government to work together on an agenda for cooperation that is aimed towards shared development,” she continued. The US does have Venezuela over the barrel, quite literally. A bit of lip-service at this point can be a step towards reducing the immediate heat without being tantamount to capitulation or surrender– pull a Ukraine: sign a few agreements, buy some time to more properly arm. I don’t see how Venezuela can break out of the stranglehold that the US has it in. As economic conditions there worsen, the US remains out of reach, and civil unrest will turn inward to find targets close at hand. The issue is not the regime change threat. It’s the blockade, But it costs the US to keep that going. And someone in Russia might have clued Rodriguez in that it costs nothing to talk nicely to Trump, and he gets off on that. Except Trump takes the soft soap seriously and wants revenge when he finds out it isn’t. Crooke suggests the Russians may be changing their tactics and withdrawing from Trump engagement. IMHO everyone important in Russia except Putin and Dmitriev,, who has his stature elevated by this charade, has been wanting to withdraw from Trump engagement. Putin needed to go along, regardless of what he felt (and he really does not like war, I think he is natively very conservative on that front) to placate his Global South economic allies, particularly China and India. But in an important late-in-year Q&A (not his big year-end event but not long before that) Putin said it suited Russia better to resolve Project Ukraine on the battlefield. It still costs Russia nothing to play along. But Putin is likely to decline further in-person engagement with anyone other than Trump or perhaps Rubio. They probably can’t break out of it until enough other nations realize that they can either hang together now or hang separately later. How many countries does the US need to destroy before other nations fight back? You would think that at the very least, the UN could impose massive sanctions on the US. Yes, I know, I did laugh a little as I typed that last sentence. The UN is about as useless as the US Congress Aboard AF1, Trump told a reporter, “We need total access in Venezuela. We need access to the oil and to other things.” “Total Access” Trump also accused Venezuela of stealing from the US. He said, “It was the greatest theft in the history of America. Nobody has ever stolen our property like they have. They took our oil away from us.” I can’t find an accurate figure but it seems Venezuela has roughly $5 billion in gold at its central bank and another $2 billion in the UK which the UK has refused to return. There are other valuable minerals available to be extracted. And, of course, lots of water front property. I can imagine Trump stealing what he can as payback while waiting for the oil business to recover. https://apnews.com/video/trump-says-he-wants-total-access-from-venezuela-comments-on-cubans-killed-c08d04e0f1d7467e87fdb3f66c3eac77 https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/05/business/oil-venezuela-trump The Iraq tragedy is being repeated as farce in Venezuela. Trump lacks the means to extract anything other than cheap spectacle from Venezuela. The downward spiral of the U.S. into idiocracy continues. Adam Tooze has put together a Chartbook on Venezuelan oil. Which likely won’t start to flow anytime soon: https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-423-some-topical-material Same as natural resources from Greenland… Which will need ports, airports, roads, powerplants, housing and amenities for the workforce, etc. All in a harsh climate. Greenland already has US military there since WWII, can’t they properly insure the US national security? Trump’s regime is notable for its incompetence – just like Zelensky in Ukraine, which is why, despite claims to the contrary, Putin has made it clear he wants to keep him in office for now, because better the incompetent leader you know is going to screw things up than a competent one that won’t. So, arguably it is better Chump stays in office and keeps screwing things up, than the far more competent Vance take over. However, the risk of major war keeps going up! Chump is deranged enough to ramp things up further. This Venezuela debacle has all the hallmarks of yet another botched regime change and resources grab job. If it was to prop up the petrodollar by making Venezuela revert to selling oil in dollars, so far nothing has changed – and won’t unless a puppet regime is installed, and even then it will take time before any change comes into effect. If it was to hurt Chinese and Russian interests in the country, they will retaliate in other ways to hurt the US dollar and economy. The US has spent a huge amount of money, well into the billions, just to kidnap one man, and bribe the military not to defend the country, and has so far failed to achieve anything much. Chumps’ threats to other countries will merely accelerate the move/rush away from the dollar and the dumping of US treasuries, thus putting even more downward pressure on the dollar. Making enemies at such a rapid rate will soon overwhelm the US. It can’t fight everyone! This article: The Venezuelan Oil Narative is PURE THEATRE -The Real Reason the Pentagon Approved Venezuela: Critical Minerals and Adversary Expulsion pins the motive on a threefold confluence of risks to the Pentagon: 1, The Pentagon’s Critical Minerals Crisis – along side China’s Supply Chain Stranglehold of the critical minerals in Venezuela; 2, IRGC: Iranian Weapons Manufacturing in the Western Hemisphere; 3, Russian Military Advisory Mission and Systems.

BUMPER TO BUMPER traffic at peak hours has become a feature of modern life in Ireland’s cities, with road users reporting ever-worsening gridlock on key routes. From the Quincentennial Bridge in Galway, to the Dunkettle Interchange in Cork, to the M50 and N7 and other roads around Dublin, along with every other city, commuters can lose hours of their days stuck in traffic. On the M50, Ireland’s busiest road, any closing of a lane as a result of a crash or debris can result in huge delays. The motorway has seen a 40% increase in traffic on its busiest stretches over the past 10 years. Recently Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) stated that it had “done all it can” in terms of works and upgrades to address the gridlock. Meanwhile, it has not been much better for anyone using public transport, with a senior Dublin Bus official recently citing data that showed traffic in the capital has become slower than London. Across the country, there are plans underway to revamp the roads network and to expand transport services – but some of these have faced repeated delays, whether due to planning struggles or financing from government. Most recently Firethorn Limited and Manhattan Peanuts lodged a judicial review against the planned Luas extension to Finglas in north-west Dublin city. We asked our readers to outline some of their main traffic complaints. Here’s what they said. Unsurprisingly, the main issue brought up had to do with traffic on the M50, and the knock-on effect this had on other areas around Dublin. One reader said he had to drive from Cherrywood to Santry on the run up to Christmas to collect a parcel at a depot. “I left at around 4.20pm, but by the time I made it to Santry, it was nearly 6.30 and the depot had closed at 6pm. Two hours to cross the breadth of the M50. The M7 and M4 exits in particular looked awful,” they said. They tried again a few days later, this time heading from Artane to Santry, what should be a much shorter journey. “This time from Artane to the same depot. It took an hour each way. I wish I was joking, but the gridlock was that bad,” the readers said. “At least I got the package! Perhaps the grim weather was to blame but still, that’s a really long time to cross 3 kilometres as the crow flies. Another reader, who lives in Ballyfermot, said they had experience multiple traffic jams as result of traffic on the M50. They were travelling from Smyths Toy Store at Fotnhill Retail Park to their home in Ballyfermot, a journey that would take about 15 minutes in light traffic. “It took one and a half hours to get out of the carpark and two hours to get home to Ballyfermot. This should have been a 15 minute journey!” The reader said. On another day soon after that, the reader went to collect her husband at the Hermitage Hospital in Lucan. “We could not get out of the car park. It took us one and a half hours to get home, we can normally do this trip in 15 minutes,” she said. The reader blamed traffic on the M50 for having a knock-on effect elsewhere. “When there is an incident on the M50 it causes enormous traffic jams in Ballyfermot as drivers drive through their to avoid delays on the M50,” she said. A final reader raised issue with traffic coming into Dublin, comparing their trip into Dublin on the N7 to Merrion Square, to when they drove in London. “I lived in London for six months last year. My commute to work consisted of driving from Finchley to around Cheshunt, the drive was 24 km and in bad traffic would take 40/45 mins on a bad day during rush hour traffic,” they said. “On the other hand I drove from the far side of Limerick City last week to Dublin. “It took me less time to get from Limerick to passing in by An Poitín Stíl (in Rathcoole) which is 195 km, compared to getting from An Poitín Stíl to Merrion Square that took me 2 hours on the dot and is only 18 km away and there were no road closures or crashes… just traffic.” Advertisement Readers also raised issues with traffic coming in and out of Galway City at peak times. “Traffic gridlock in Galway has been getting worse in the last few years but especially in the last year,” one woman told The Journal. “The Quincentennial Bridge in the mornings eastbound to the factories in the Parkmore/Ballybrit areas are a constant line of cars. The reader also said that the Dublin Road inbound and outbound are “constant traffic jams any time of day”. A bypass for Galway City – the Galway City Ring Road – has long been planned and debated. An Coimisiún Pleanála is due to make a decision on the road early this year. Another reader, who “drives daily for a living in Galway” decried the traffic and improper planning in the city, and called for the ring road to be built. “Galway’s annual descent into gridlock in the weeks leading up to Christmas is often blamed on shoppers, tourists, or poor driving behaviour, but the core problem is structural,” they wrote. “The absence of a completed ring road means that through traffic — vehicles with no destination in the city at all — is forced to funnel directly through already constrained urban streets. This fundamental planning failure magnifies congestion every December, when traffic volumes naturally rise.” The reader said that this forced the city to attempt to deal with local traffic and long-distance vehicles, which it fails to do. “The result is chronic congestion on key corridors, unreliable journey times, and mounting frustration for residents, workers, and businesses alike. Christmas simply exposes the problem at its worst.” The reader said that the ring road would also help improve sustainable transport options in the city, like public transport, walking and cycling. “Road space in Galway is scarce, and as long as it is dominated by through traffic, there is little political or practical room to reallocate it. “A functioning ring road would remove a significant volume of cars and trucks from the city centre, freeing space for continuous bus lanes, safe cycle infrastructure, and improved pedestrian environments. Public transport could become faster and more reliable, active travel safer and more attractive. Other readers shared local traffic issues in the outskirts of the cities. One reader who lives on the outskirts of Cork City said their morning commute takes 45 minutes, or 15 minutes with no traffic. “Nowhere near as bad as Dublin. Despite this as a family I am so frustrated by traffic and the lack of real alternatives,” they said. “If you look around Carrilgaline, Glanmire, Ballincollig, Maryborough, Lehenaghmore you will find massive newish housing developments with thousands of young families and kids and teens with zero infrastructure and zero amenities. “More often than not: No local shop. No crèche for the 100s of kids. No pub. No restaurant. No school. No playground. Nothing for teens to do. No GP. No dentist. No pharmacy. No bike lanes, no active travel supports. Limited bus routes, no bus shelters Zero, nothing, zilch. “And then we wonder why traffic is so bad?? ‘Cos we have to drive everywhere all the time for everything. Drive into Carrigaline, down to Douglas, over to Wilton. All stuck in traffic all wondering why traffic is so bad all the time!! Another reader took issue with traffic in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area of South Dublin, saying that there were now numerous traffic jams “all over the Dún Laoghaire, Glenageary, Deansgrange, Blackrock areas”. The reader said the jams were caused by “out of sync lights” and “unused cycle lanes that shut off parts of the road”. “I have no idea why the council closed off the feeder lanes at colossal expense and disruption,” they said. As well as the issues raised, some readers raised proposed solutions to the problems. The reader who lived out the outskirts of Cork proposed a variety of responses. These included: A final reader, living in Kildare but commuting to Dublin every day, said he is “a true believer in public transport but have mostly given up” and that he is “ashamed at how bad we’ve let it become, considering we’re such a small, flat country”. This readers commutes 30km to and from Dublin today. Where he lives has a direct train line to the city, he he cycles “because it’s faster (75mins vs 90mins minimum) and I can guarantee my arrival time(s)”. He said the city and surrounding area needed new train and metro lines to get people off the roads; double-tracking existing railway lines; connectivity between orbital train stations adding new stations. “I’d love to talk more about cycling infrastructure, but we can only properly tackle that once we do the big things properly,” he said.

The rebranding was announced by SGX Group CEO Loh Boon Chye at a ceremony at the SGX Centre’s IPO Arena. “This reinforces its role as the core pillar of SGX group’s multi-asset ambitions and its importance to Singapore as an international financial centre,” Loh said. The announcement comes as Singapore’s equity market shows signs of recovery. The STI delivered a total return of over 25 per cent in 2025, reaching record highs. Over five years, the index has gained more than 100 per cent in Singapore dollar terms, according to National Development Minister and Monetary Authority of Singapore deputy chairman Chee Hong Tat. The total market value of SGX-listed companies crossed the $1 trillion mark in 2025, while the average daily traded value for the year was the highest since 2010. Trading volumes in small- and mid-cap stocks surged more than 40 per cent compared to 2024. IPO activity rebounded significantly, with over $2.4 billion raised in 2025 - the strongest showing since 2019. The recovery follows a $5 billion Equities Market Development Programme led by MAS, with $3.95 billion already allocated to nine asset managers, including BlackRock and JP Morgan Asset Management. “Our journey to rebuild a vibrant stock market has started well in 2025, but all stakeholders must work even harder this year,” Chee said, cautioning that sustained effort is needed. The STI, launched in 1966 as the Straits Times Industrial Index, now tracks Singapore’s top 30 blue-chip companies and represents about 85 per cent of the market’s total capitalisation. The three local banks, DBS, OCBC and UOB, account for nearly half of the index’s weight. Published on January 5, 2026 Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.
