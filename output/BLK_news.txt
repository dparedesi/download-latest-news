A Better Formula For Funding and Executing Commercial Transformation Kristen Carloni leads the global Business Proposal Strategy team for Aladdin Sales and Marketing, a B2B technology business within BlackRock. Her responsibilities center around ensuring an impactful and scalable business proposal process for selling the firm’s financial technology products. From that perch, her team directly impacts the majority of revenues in the business. “The most important, biggest deals come through my team,” says Carloni. “So as a baseline if we don’t do our job the firm is never going to see that revenue, it’s just going to die on the vine.” While Business Proposal Strategy conveys the workings of her job, Kristen’s role defies conventional description. In practice she works across marketing, product, IT and sales functions to leverage technology and AI in ways that help her firm drive faster, more profitable and scalable growth. In other words, she’s a poster child for what is emerging as the next generation of growth leader, a Revenue Operations executive. The description is apt because Kristen is working across silos to better connect teams, data, technology and processes to: 1. Generate more consistent, reliable and profitable revenue growth 2. Improve the return on growth investments in sales, marketing and customer programs 3. Maximize the return on commercial assets like brand, channels, innovation and knowledge assets She’s doing this with a small team of under a dozen people who are impacting over 90 percent of the revenues in the business. At the same time she’s helping the people responsible for the rest of the revenue be more effective in their jobs. And she's in the best position, most importantly, to leverage AI multiplier to drive more scalable revenue growth. A big reason she is so effective is she has adopted the principles and platforms of Strategic Response Management (SRM) which is defined as the people, practice and technology to unlock organizational knowledge for profit growth. Every sales operations, marketing operations, or sales enablement executive can learn a lot from Kristen about creating, quantifying, and communicating the financial impact commercial transformation can have on the business. Why? Because she’s used the principles of Revenue Operations to effectively unlock more of the full potential of the growth investments and assets of her business. And she’s done it from what seems on the surface as a relatively back office “cost center” stuck in the middle of the revenue cycle - the bid and proposal response team. A BETTER BUSINESS CASE FOR COMMERCIAL TRANSFORMATION Generating more consistent and profitable revenue - Unlike typical sales and marketing operations teams, Kristen’s team has the advantage of directly impacting top line revenues. That makes a big difference when it comes to leading commercial transformation in the eyes of leadership. The average B2B response team directly impacts almost one half (48%) of revenues in terms of both customer acquisition (via RFPs) and loyalty and expansion (via Due Diligence Questionnaires) according to APMP benchmarks. They also drive additional revenue by providing market intelligence, self-service knowledgebases, customer insight, and knowledge assets that help improve the overall go-to-market process. As evidence, Carloni’s team has leveraged technology to grow the percent of revenues they directly impact from 70% to 92% of revenues in the past year – with greater productivity, performance and at lower cost. They’ve effectively used the insights and experience drawn from responding to hundreds of customers to inform and improve the efforts of the product, marketing, finance, and sales teams in many ways. Calculating the Probability of winning. Showing where to allocate resources. Identifying the top features customers want. Forecasting future demand 24 months out. Reporting which marketing messages are landing or not. And more. Here are some examples: Improving the return on growth investment. As compelling as these returns are, many sales leaders make the mistake of treating sales productivity as a single solution problem, according to Bob Kelly, the CEO of the Sales Management Association. Instead Kelly advises managers to treat commercial transformation as an equilibrium problem that involves constantly balancing some fundamental tradeoffs such as investing in salesperson up-skilling versus simplifying the selling job; undergoing wholesale transformation versus pursuing incremental process improvements. Kristen Carloni has struck that balance in her efforts to transform the commercial model one dollar at a time at Blackrock. “Our ability to impact sales win rates, productivity, capacity and costs is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the financial impact we’ve delivered when you compare it to the multiplier effect it has had on the return we are getting from our selling assets, IP, and investments,” says Carloni. Academic research reinforces Carloni’s focus on maximizing the return on commercial investments at lower risk. Business leaders that understand the math of growth in a modern business realize that far greater financial impact can be had by managing the allocation and deployment of growth resources, investments and assets such as building customer and brand equity, while mitigating the risks associated with selling. Maximizing the return on commercial assets. Perhaps the biggest financial impact a commercial transformation leader like Carloni can have is to unlock the enormous untapped growth potential of the firms commercial assets. Why? Because the majority of the value in firms is intangible commercial assets – including market-based assets, knowledge assets, computerized information, innovative property, and economic competencies like ‘sales know how.’ When properly measured and accounted for, these intangible assets can represent up to 80% or more of the value of a business.

Title: Why your retirement fund might soon include cryptocurrency

Director of the Centre for Digital Finance, Associate Professor in Finance, University of Southampton Larisa Yarovaya is affiliated with the British Blockchain Association. University of Southampton provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Pension funds are investment pools that manage people’s retirement savings. They aim to encourage long-term saving and provide financial security to retirees. But some pension funds in the US, UK and elsewhere have recently begun investing in cryptocurrencies, an asset class renowned for its volatility. In the US, for example, bitcoin derivatives such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are becoming a popular choice for pension schemes in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan. ETFs are baskets of investments that can be bought and sold on a stock exchange and aim to replicate the performance of a given market. Bitcoin and ethereum ETFs track the prices of these cryptocurrencies, offering fund managers exposure without the need to buy or manage digital assets directly. The interest in cryptocurrencies is being driven by their surging price. In December 2024, on the back of Donald Trump’s endorsement of digital assets throughout his presidential election campaign, the price of bitcoin hit US$100,000 (£81,600) for the first time in history. It then shot to around US$110,000 on the day of Trump’s inauguration. This surge has the potential to generate substantial short-term profits for investors, including pension funds. But pension funds operate under strict fiduciary duties – a set of legal and ethical obligations requiring them to prioritise low-risk, stable investments over speculative opportunities. And some experts have raised concerns about whether the move into crypto could undermine the stability of people’s pensions. Daniel Wiltshire, an actuary at financial planner Wiltshire Wealth, told Sky News in November 2024 that one unnamed UK pension scheme was “deeply irresponsible” for investing 3% of their assets in bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are infamous for their volatility, risk of fraud, and susceptibility to speculative price bubbles. The value of a cryptocurrency is largely derived from collective belief and perception rather than intrinsic financial fundamentals. This makes cryptocurrencies vulnerable to manipulation and rapid shifts in sentiment. So, should this trend continue and pension fund managers invest heavily in cryptocurrencies, then a crypto price crash could jeopardise retirees’ savings. Such a crash has happened before. In 2022, Canada’s Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan lost a US$95 million investment after the FTX crypto exchange failed. Following this loss, the fund decided to avoid further investments in crypto due to high uncertainty. Despite Trump’s endorsement, there is still a possibility that the current bitcoin price boom is yet another bubble. Cryptocurrencies remain relatively new as an asset class, so the lack of long-term performance data makes it difficult to assess their suitability for inclusion in a pension fund portfolio. However, pension funds are under increasing pressure to explore alternative investment options to enhance returns. Larry Fink, the CEO of American investment company BlackRock, warned in March 2024 that America’s ageing population had put the US retirement system under “immense strain”. And in the UK, analysts predict that the pension system will reach a crisis point within the next two decades. This may result in retirees receiving less than expected, and seeing a significant drop in their living standards. Crypto derivatives could be seen as one of the few viable solutions to meet countries’ growing retirement commitments. The bottom line is whether bitcoin and ethereum prices will continue to grow. Crypto advocates believe that bitcoin’s scarcity, driven by its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, suggests its value should increase over time. In contrast, sceptics question why something without any tangible value should cost anything at all. Almost 95% of bitcoin has already been “mined”, or created. As the available supply diminishes, the mining process becomes increasingly difficult and energy intensive – a deliberate design feature of the bitcoin network. Miners need to use more advanced hardware and consume more electricity to compete in solving the mathematical puzzles required to create new bitcoins. And as a result, only the largest mining pools (groups of miners who combine their hardware to increase computational power) will be able to compete in and profit from the current cryptocurrency boom. The cost of mining is often cited as justification for bitcoin’s fundamental value, as it reflects the resources and energy required to produce it. However, once mining ceases and bitcoin reaches its full supply, miners will shift to relying solely on transaction fees charged to bitcoin users to incentivise their maintenance of the network’s security and integrity. This raises questions about bitcoin’s long-term value and utility for regular users. If transaction fees become excessively high, bitcoin could lose its appeal for frequent transactions, limiting its functionality as a medium of exchange. The ease with which powerful and influential people can leverage and disrupt the crypto market further contributes to the uncertainty surrounding bitcoin’s future. Trump launched his own cryptocurrency – or “meme coin” – perfectly timed just before his inauguration. Over the pre-inauguration weekend, $Trump coin’s market capitalisation soared to US$15.1 billion. Not to be outdone, “first lady” Melania Trump followed suit and launched her own crypto coin. While some customers may push for pension funds to break away from their conventional low-risk ethos and explore opportunities in the volatile crypto market, the risks cannot be ignored. High market volatility, regulatory uncertainty and potential misalignment with long-term investment goals pose significant challenges. Pension funds must carefully balance the demand for innovation with their responsibility to protect retirees’ savings, ensuring any foray into crypto is both prudent and sustainable.

January 22, 2025 09:05 ET | Source: Unlimited Unlimited NEW YORK, Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unlimited, an asset management firm and ETF sponsor that uses proprietary technology to provide low-cost, alternative strategies to a variety of investors, today published its Q4 2024 Hedge Fund Barometer, showing that heading into 2025 hedge fund managers are positioned conservatively while waiting on market uncertainty to play out. According to the Barometer, the industry’s low conviction levels could be underpinned by reluctance to chase the run-up in assets observed in 2024 or make aggressive bets on weakening assets. Overall, the hedge fund industry posted a modestly positive performance in the fourth quarter of 2024, with overall gross returns of 0.9%, according to Unlimited’s proprietary technology. Event Driven strategies led the quarter with an impressive 2.8% gross return, while Emerging Markets strategies struggled, declining by -2.1% gross. Hedge fund performance in 4Q24 was bolstered by strategic positioning around key global events. Event Driven and Global Macro managers benefited from investments aligned with expectations surrounding Donald Trump’s re-election in November. In contrast, Emerging Markets managers faced headwinds due to the absence of anticipated Chinese economic stimulus, contributing to the underperformance of the strategy. Caution Amidst Euphoria Heading into 2025 Looking ahead, hedge fund managers are displaying caution as they approach 2025. Thematically, the Industry seems to be in “wait-and-see” mode, with managers largely maintaining exposure levels near long-term averages across major asset classes. 2024 Performance Recap Despite a modest fourth quarter, the hedge fund industry closed 2024 with an estimated 12% gross return (~8% net of fees). Equity strategies stood out, with both Long/Short and Event Driven funds outperforming industry averages. Managed Futures lagged, delivering returns below cash after fees. While industry returns in 2024 exceeded the long-term average by 300-400 basis points, they fell short of the extraordinary performance seen in equity markets during the same period.Key Industry Insights: Positioning Outlook As hedge funds enter 2025, managers appear to be holding firepower awaiting clearer market and economic signals.

Title: Inside A Real Estate Billionaire’s Fight To Revive His Aging Empire

OnJanuary 15, real estate billionaire Charles Cohen called Forbes from a no caller ID phone, as he always does. For four months, Forbes had been trying to get Cohen to sit down and discuss the mounting debt and vacancies at the buildings owned by his real estate firm, Cohen Brothers Realty. In September he said to check back in November. In November, he said to call in January. Last week, Cohen said he was going on vacation. He didn’t specify where, but he often jets to his vineyard in the south of France, Château de Chausse, or his Palm Beach penthouse. (He also has apartments in West Hollywood and Manhattan and a sprawling home in Greenwich, Connecticut.) Then he asked if the story could be delayed once again for four to six weeks, when he would explain how his firm had “turned the corner.” “If you run a negative story, it's going to hurt me,” he said, mentioning several refinancings and new leases he claimed were in the works. “It makes it harder for us to rent when people think there's a problem that really isn't a problem." Cohen finally relented, only after Forbes explained the story would run regardless, and had his executive vice president sit down with Forbes to go over financials. There is no doubt that Cohen, who took over his father and uncles’ firm in the 1980s and expanded it by building and buying prime office towers in midtown Manhattan, now finds himself in a tricky spot. Since the pandemic emptied offices, many of his prized properties lost tenants. At least six of his buildings sit more than 20% empty, with three of those less than 60% occupied. At the same time, he’s struggled to make payments on at least $1.1 billion in debt according to loan filings and court documents, resulting in the loss of four properties at a foreclosure auction in November. All of that has dealt a blow to Cohen and his fortune, which peaked at $3.7 billion in 2022, when he was flush with cash and interest rates were near zero. Forbes now estimates he’s worth $1.6 billion. About two-thirds of that lies in his real estate holdings, which have lost value as tenants fled to newer, amenity-rich skyscrapers. Cohen disputes the valuation, claiming it should be higher. Steven Cherniak, Cohen Brothers’ chief operating officer, said that the firm is up-to-date on loan payments for buildings that carry more than half that $1.1 billion debt load. Plus, Cherniak is confident the properties will land more tenants in the first half of this year. Cohen’s troubles made headlines on November 8th, when one of the largest foreclosure auctions in New York history took place. Up for sale were five of his holdings: an 800,000-square foot office and design complex in Dania Beach, Florida, a nearby Le Meridien hotel, a former hotel site in Rye Brook, New York, and theater chains in the U.S. and the U.K. At the end of the bidding process, Cohen’s creditor, Fortress Investment Group, walked away with nearly everything, paying just under $150 million for the design complex, hotel, U.K. theater chain and Rye Brook site. No one bothered to bid on the U.S. chain Landmark Theaters, with its 28 locations and concessions business, leaving them in Cohen’s hands. It was the latest episode in a long-running battle between Cohen and Fortress. The lender sued Cohen last March, seeking repayment of a $534 million loan secured by the properties. Representatives for Fortress didn’t respond to a request for comment. Cohen and his company counter-sued. The auction, for which Cohen was a no show, was another setback for the real estate mogul and movie buff. For years, the collection of office towers in midtown Manhattan he’d assembled provided steady profits. He then expanded into design centers and indulged his passion for film, producing several Oscar-nominated films (and one best foreign-language film winner, “The Salesman”), buying arthouse theater chains and launching a film distribution business. He also bought a 135-acre vineyard and estate in France in 2016 and men's high-end footwear brand Harry’s of London a year later. But in the past two years, he’s had to deal with mounting troubles at his office towers. He lost several major tenants—including WeWork, which vacated more than 200,000 square feet at several properties while keeping much less space—and debts racked up as repayment dates loomed. His buildings struggled to compete with brand new skyscrapers with luxury amenities, making it tougher to replace those leases, according to several brokers. High interest rates also made it harder to refinance, and when he did—as with the Fortress loan—it was on unfavorable terms. At the same time, the rest of his empire also took a hit. The pandemic shuttered his theaters across the country, and his design centers lost tenants, too: he lost the one in Florida to Fortress but has three more, including two in Los Angeles and New York where occupancy has dipped below 80%. For his part, Cohen insists the picture isn’t as bad as it looks, pointing to better leasing activity and a recent uptick in sales of office buildings. At one of his properties, 750 Lexington Avenue—home to the headquarters of his firm—the lender filed for foreclosure in May, a month after the building was reappraised at just $50 million, down from $300 million in 2015. But the foreclosure has stalled, while one tenant, beauty retailer Sephora, renewed its lease and another tenant, WeWork, kept its lease after emerging from bankruptcy. Cohen Brothers is working on a loan modification with the lender. “We're doing fine. We've got leasing challenges, which everyone has, but we've got good buildings,” Cohen told Forbes in a phone call 10 days after the auction in November. “We have very strong tenant retention and expansion, and we're probably doing more leasing than a lot of other people.” Outside of New York, he’s expecting to break ground soon on a 23-story, glass-clad office tower in West Palm Beach, where demand for office space remains strong, especially for new buildings. “I'm doing everything that I need to do everywhere,” he asserted. Cohen's 750 Lexington Avenue, a 28-story tower with tenants including Sephora and WeWork, is 27% vacant and was reappraised in April 2024 at $50 million, down from $300 million in 2015. Cohen was born in 1952 into a real estate family in Harrison, north of New York City. His father, Sherman, was a former car dealer who built Cohen Brothers Realty with his two brothers; the siblings eventually grew it to more than 20 buildings across Manhattan. As a young child, Cohen was more interested in show business, developing a love for movies after his grandmother took him to see Cinderella at age 3. By the time he was a teenager, Cohen was showing apartments for his family’s real estate firm. But he also knew he wanted to become a director and even shot a few short films. “When I turned 14, I stopped following the Yankees and started reading Variety,” he told Forbes in 2017. “There was nothing more exciting to me than being in line to see a movie when it opened.” It would be a while before he pursued his filmmaking dreams. The first in his family to graduate from college, he got his bachelor’s at Tufts University in 1974 and a law degree from Brooklyn Law School in 1977 before working in Chemical Bank's real estate division in New York for a couple of years. He then joined his family’s firm and rose to become vice president and general counsel by 1981. Just two years later, he became president and bought out his father’s and uncle’s stakes in the company for an undisclosed sum. One of his signature deals was the construction of 750 Lexington Avenue. Cohen bought up the entire block between 59th and 60th streets in the 1980s to build it. (One resident on the block held out and refused to sell her townhouse, leading Cohen to build the 28-story tower around it; it’s still there) Cohen expanded into design centers in the 1990s, purchasing the Decoration and Design building in Manhattan for $63 million in 1996 and adding the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles and the Design Center of the Americas in Florida three years later for an undisclosed sum. By 2009, he had expanded the firm to more than 12 million square feet of real estate—up from 3 million when he took over in the 1980s. At the time, he also pivoted back to his fervor for filmmaking. He put up half the budget for the independent film “Frozen River,” which won the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize in 2008, and then set up a movie distribution business the same year. Over the following decade, he picked up a historic film collection, a small-screen theater in Manhattan plus Landmark and Curzon, two theater chains in the U.S. and the U.K. He also began spending more time in France, purchasing the Château de Chausse wine estate in Provence in 2016 for $20 million and picking up a historic Japanese-style theater in Paris a year later. He joined The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans for the first time in 2016 with an estimated $2.8 billion net worth. That same year, coworking outfit WeWork leased four floors at Cohen's office tower on East 57th St. By 2018, the startup had expanded to 123,000 square feet there and also took more than 80,000 square feet at 750 Lexington. When WeWork’s public listing collapsed in September 2019, Cohen was left with a looming leasing problem as the startup’s cash was predicted to dry up. Six months later, the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The downturn was devastating for New York office landlords. By the end of 2020, the value of the city’s office buildings had fallen by 45%, an estimated $50 billion decline, according to a research paper published in 2022 by Columbia and New York University professors Arpit Gupta, Vrinda Mittal and Stijn van Nieuwerburgh. “In the future, this period of time will be called the great valuation reset,” says longtime New York real estate broker Bob Knakal. “People have to get tuned in with the reality of what the present market is.” Cohen, though, had locked in fixed-rate loans on several of his largest properties—including 750 Lexington Ave and the New York design center—in the years before the pandemic. In 2022, as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to battle high inflation, he chose to take advantage before rates got too high. In September that year he refinanced four properties and the two theater chains with a $534 million loan from Fortress. According to financial documents revealed in the Fortress lawsuit, Cohen’s empire was already feeling the pain by the 2022 refinancing. An independent auditor's report compiled in December 2022 stated that the firm was dealing with “net operating losses” and “high vacancy rates” which “raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.” The report also noted that the firm had pursued “significant efforts to increase occupancy and cost control measures” and also had “adequate cash resources and business continuity plans.” In the spring of 2023, Forbes investigated the collapse of commercial real estate values across major cities in the U.S. “You’ve got to be defensive,” Cohen told Forbes at the time, when asked about his strategy to survive the downturn. On his debt, he said: “It’s not an issue of imminent concern to me. We’re keeping lenders apprised of what’s going on, being transparent, explaining why things are the way they are.” Throughout the rest of that year, Cohen and Fortress extended the payment schedule on the loan and deferred payments, according to court filings. In November 2023, WeWork filed for bankruptcy and vacated more than 200,000 square feet at two Cohen properties in Los Angeles and New York—the latter bearing a mortgage owed to Fortress, and where WeWork had leased nearly a third of the total space. Tensions came to a head in February 2024, when Cohen and Fortress were negotiating a further extension. In emails revealed in court records, Cohen pushed back on Fortress' proposal but expressed hope that they would come to an agreement: “Over the last 20-plus years, we have always found a way forward together.” Dean Dakolias, Fortress' co-chairman and managing partner, fired back a blunt response. “Your last proposal was unrealistic and took us several steps backwards,” he wrote. “You’ve not made your last payment, and you’ve not demonstrated that you understand or prioritize the severity of your situation.” The next month, Fortress sued Cohen and demanded full repayment of the more than half billion loan, as well as a personal guaranty of up to $187 million—plus interest—from Cohen. Cohen counter-sued a month later, seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed and alleging that Fortress had reneged on an agreement to extend the loan. Fortress had demanded a foreclosure auction on Cohen’s properties in May, but a judge ruled in Cohen's favor in June and agreed to postpone it. In August, it was put on the schedule for November. In October, Cohen suffered another blow when the judge in the case ruled that Cohen had to pay the personal guaranty on the properties. (Cohen filed an appeal 11 days later, which is still pending.) Still, Cohen appeared to have more than enough resources to foot the bill: he had nearly $300 million in cash and investments as of June last year. According to Fortress, Cohen then attempted to shield his personal assets so they couldn’t be taken from him to cover the guaranty. The firm’s lawyers alleged that Cohen had transferred ownership of his 219-foot, $50 million yacht Seasense and three smaller vessels to offshore entities in the Cayman Islands, while shifting ownership of his $20 million home in Greenwich, Connecticut to his wife Clo, a former Jimmy Choo executive. Cohen hit back, stating that it was just routine estate planning, but Fortress won a court judgment in the Cayman Islands delaying the transfer. Cohen is also fighting the $187 million personal guaranty demanded by Fortress. In a filing ten days after the auction, Cohen's lawyers argued that the auction sales mean that the guaranty amount should be reduced by $75 million to account for the sale of the assets and the release of a lien on another Cohen property. In December, his lawyers also argued that Cohen had nearly $350 million in equity in four buildings—3 Park Avenue, 979 Third Avenue, 805 Third Avenue and 622 Third Avenue— sufficient to cover the remainder of what he owes to Fortress. Once again, Fortress disputed his claim, pointing to the fact that those values were based “on stale, year-old valuations” that have declined since then, and that all four properties are burdened with outstanding mortgages. The proceedings are still ongoing. Cohen's private theater at his Greenwich, Connecticut mansion cost $1 million to build and features a curved movie screen and a sculpture of a ticket collector handmade by a Massachusetts artisan. Outside of the Fortress dispute, Cohen is still saddled with several debt-laden buildings that are showing their age. And while he had less leverage on his buildings than other Manhattan real estate tycoons, he was particularly vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic due to his concentration in older office towers. “It's difficult for the owner of a Class B office building to make their buildings competitive with Class A product,” says Knakal, referring to older properties compared to newer construction like Hudson Yards or One Vanderbilt, which is fully occupied. “We're talking about declines in the order of 30% to 50% in value on average," adds Tomasz Piskorski, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School. For real estate moguls with their wealth tied up in office towers, “it means they may no longer be billionaires.” In a bid to entice tenants, many owners of older properties are now offering as much as a year of free rent as well as pricey allowances for improvements. But Cohen sees that as a losing proposition. “We're only doing deals that make sense. A lot of our competition is just throwing money at deals,” he said in November. Cohen insists he’s working on improving his buildings to make them more competitive, arguing that they should be valued higher now due to recent transactions such as a November deal that valued S.L. Green’s One Vanderbilt at $4.7 billion and the December sales of two office towers on Park Avenue. “We're finishing up a major lobby renovation at 622 Third,” he said. “We're reinvesting in our buildings.” Those renovations are now complete, according to chief operating officer Cherniak, including a $13 million new lobby and exterior facade at 3 Park Avenue. Cohen’s also bullish on new lease activity to replace his vacancies. In Los Angeles, the space left by WeWork has been filled by the hospital and health science center Cedars-Sinai, an existing tenant. In New York, the firm expects to sign new leases at five of its least occupied towers in the coming months. Cohen may have a point: Office leasing activity in Manhattan increased 17% year-over-year in 2024, the highest since 2019, according to real estate brokerage Avison Young. Still, older or lower-quality properties made up just 23% of new leasing last year, and rents at those buildings are only about half what’s charged by trophy buildings—a sign that the resurgence in leasing is leaving many of these aging towers behind as tenants continue to opt for newer ones. Another strategy he has: converting office space to residential apartments and condos. In May, his firm filed for a special permit to convert 19 floors of its 38-story tower at 623 Fifth Avenue—across from the Rockefeller Center and atop Saks’ Fifth Avenue’s flagship store—to 172 condos. The project has since been scaled down to 60 to 70 condos, per Cherniak, but the firm is working on design plans. Another condo conversion project at 3 East 54th Street, which has views of Central Park, is further along, with the firm finishing the interior demolition last summer. “They’re all moving forward,” said Cohen. Yet the lender on the 54th Street property filed for foreclosure in December, putting that project in doubt. (Cohen says he is in the process of refinancing the loan.) Another proposed conversion at 135 East 57th Street is now dead in the water. The Wallace family, which owns the ground underneath that building, opposed the conversion project and sued Cohen over unpaid rent in December 2023. In October, a judge ruled in the family’s favor, handing the building over to them. According to New York office brokers who spoke with Forbes, if Cohen is able to follow through on the conversions, work with his lenders on the troubled properties and hold onto the buildings he wants while sacrificing others, he could survive the threats to his empire. As his appeal on the Fortress case works its way through the courts, Cohen is looking south toward his planned 23-story, 400,000-square-foot tower in West Palm Beach, named West Palm Point. Located close by two other office projects being developed by billionaires—Stephen Ross’ One Flagler and Jeff Greene’s One West Palm—the three edifices-in-progess form part of what has been called “Wall Street South,” as financial firms from BlackRock to Citadel open offices in the fast-growing city. Together they will add nearly 900,000 square feet of office space. Cohen’s building there, which is set to break ground in March, is expected to be finished in 2028. He plans to finance the construction with a mix of equity and loans. That could be a smart bet for Cohen, with Donald Trump’s election spurring business magnates and world leaders to flock to Palm Beach for its proximity to the new president’s Winter White House at Mar-a-Lago. According to Cherniak, the firm has already negotiated leases for six floors. “We have all our approvals. The contracting is just about complete and we're getting ready to close our loans and break ground,” Cohen said in November. “We've got leasing activity underway already." As for the legal battles, Cohen is going to keep fighting. “I'm not paying that personal guaranty. I've got defenses, I've got an appeal pending in the appellate division,” he said. “It's not over by a long shot."

Title: BlackRock, Weinstein Reach Truce in Spat on Closed-End Funds

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. stuck agreements with Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital Management that will end the activist-hedge fund’s battle with BlackRock over dozens of closed-end funds whose share prices had tumbled deeply below the value of their underlying assets. As part of the deal, BlackRock agreed to repurchase a big chunk of the shares in two of its largest closed-end funds at a price close to their net asset values — 50% of outstanding shares in the $1.8 billion Innovation and Growth Term Trust (ticker BIGZ) and 40% of the $1.7 billion Health Sciences Term Trust (ticker BMEZ). Saba also entered so-called standstill agreements with 48 other BlackRock funds, according to regulatory filings. BIGZ and BMEZ, which had both had traded at deep discounts in the past, jumped more than 6% on the Tuesday proposals. The two tender offers, at a price of 99.5% of of their net asset values could potentially deliver more than $1.5 billion to shareholders, based on calculation by Bloomberg. Weinstein wrote in a post on X that the changes were made after “constructive discussions with BlackRock” and that “by committing to shareholder-friendly initiatives, liquidity events and governance enhancements, value can be unlocked for all investors.” Saba has spent years and billions of dollars buying up closed-end funds run by BlackRock and other big asset managers after their share prices dipped sharply below the value of the assets they hold, a trading anomaly that Saba said was harming investors. It mounted proxy fights and court battles in a bid to pressure the firms to take steps to erase that gap, including through tender offers to buy back the stock. Last year, Boaz ran proxy fights at 10 BlackRock funds with mixed outcomes. It also sued BlackRock’s ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust (ticker ECAT) over its voting bylaws, which is still subject to litigation in a federal court. Weinstein’s fights center around funds that buy income-producing assets, like junk bonds, municipal debt or dividend-paying stocks, that were hit hard when the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates and investors were looking to bail out. With their performances trailing market benchmarks, the discounted trading prices saddled investors with losses if they sold. The hedge fund manager is bringing a similar playbook to UK’s investment-trust industry and attempting to seize control of a bunch of those firms, including two trusts run by Janus Henderson Group Plc.

Title: ‘A Race of Sovereigns’ Will Serve As Next Catalyst for Higher Bitcoin Prices, Says Analyst Willy Woo

On-chain analyst Willy Woo thinks “a race of sovereigns” will catalyze higher Bitcoin (BTC) prices. In a new interview with Natalie Brunell, Woo says MicroStrategy kicked off the corporate BTC treasury trend in the previous cycle. He predicts the current cycle will see other sovereign wealth funds follow El Salvador and Bhutan’s lead. “I think this cycle, that starts to come out and the cycles ahead. And so everything becomes a race, and I don’t know if these are big unlocks, I think it’s one step after the next and the next and the next.” Woo says a big moment of the current cycle was when BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink expressed approval of BTC. “You’re not going to get fired for recommending Bitcoin. Asset managers [previously] would buy it themselves and not recommend it because it was risky for their career. Now I see CIOs at banks not only talking about Bitcoin as an investment but they’re talking about it as the next world reserve currency.” BTC is trading at $105,785 at time of writing after hitting a new all-time high of more than $108,000 on Monday. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 4% in the past 24 hours. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Worries for Ireland as Trump moves on corporation tax

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning Ireland’s corporation tax bonanza of recent years has been well documented, but now that Donald Trump is back in office, that particular gravy train may be about to come under threat. US president Donald Trump has moved to pull his country out of a landmark global corporate tax deal, setting up a potential stand-off between his administration and the European Union, with Ireland caught in the middle. Jack Power and Eoin Burke-Kennedy have the details, while Cliff Taylor breaks down just what is at stake in the row. Trump was inevitably the main topic of discussion at the second day of the World Economic Forum at Davos, with EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and German leader Olaf Schultz among those choosing their words carefully. Eoin is at the forum in the Swiss town, where he also assesses the view on where Trump’s tactics come from. Intel is still betting big on Ireland with the company’s €17 billion Leixlip plant seen as an “critical” to reversing the slide in the once-dominant chipmaker’s fortunes, according to sources close to the company. Eoin has the details. Kilkenny-based nutrition group Glanbia is planning a restructuring of the administrative functions at its Irish locations in a move that will involve up to 60 redundancies, some of them compulsory. As Ciaran Hancock reports, staff have been informed that a new centralised unit is being established – Glanbia Enterprise Solutions – for the delivery of finance, HR and IT services to the business. Some of this work will be outsourced to third-party providers. The economy is currently experiencing a “moderation” in growth, according to Ibec, which is forecasting a slowdown in employment growth in the coming years. As Colin Gleeson reports, the business lobby group’s latest economic outlook is forecasting gross domestic product growth of 1.7 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent in 2026. It says the moderation is “not unexpected”, particularly given the turbulence faced by some of Ireland’s largest trading partners. With the next government set to be formally take power today, John McManus looks at what we can expect from the new(ish) team, and what deals may have been agreed to get a working majority into place. How hard is it to save, really? In Money Matters, Joanne Hunt looks at how a little bit of planning, and consistently setting aside just a few euros per month, can add up quickly. BNY Mellon has announced the closure of its facility in Wexford with about 300 jobs impacted. The global financial firm employs about 310 employees at its offices in the Drinagh Business Park on the outskirts of the town. There had been widespread reports over recent days that jobs at the firm were in jeopardy. Brendan Furlong has the story. Online payments firm Stripe is to make 300 staff redundant over the coming months, including a small number in Ireland, as part of what is understood to be a review of some aspects of its operations. A consultation process has been initiated with the people whose roles are expected to be impacted and this is expected to be complete within a matter of weeks. Emmet Malone reports. The Blackrock Clinic is to create 50 jobs by establishing a women’s health centre over four floors in a new Dublin city centre location “in a pivotal step forward in enhancing women’s health services”, the company said. Gordon Deegan has the story. Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance group, is seeking to cut as many as 18 jobs – or almost 12 per cent of roles – within its Irish software technology unit, Munich Re Automation Solutions, as part of a restructuring of the business. In Commercial Property, Fiona Reddan reports that The Morrison Hotel, on Dublin’s north quays, has been put up for sale, with the sellers seeking between €90 million and €95 million. If it achieves this price level then owner Zetland Capital/Centauro Holdings, a UK private equity investor, would stand to secure a significant return on its original €65 million investment.

Title: Paralyzed man flies virtual drone by thought alone
URL: https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/paralyzed-man-flies-virtual-drone-by-thought-alone/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T06:25:29Z
Full Content:
A man with paralysis has been able to fly a virtual drone using only his thoughts. The feat was made possible by a brain-computer interface (BCI) that decoded the man’s brain activity in real time, Nature reported this week. The neural signals were associated with finger movements that enabled control of the virtual drone. “There’s a lot of things that we enjoy or do as humans where we use multiple individuated finger movements, so like typing, sewing, playing a musical instrument,” said Matthew Willsey, the study’s co-author and a neurosurgeon at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “That’s what this line of work is focused on — how we enable the control of multiple things at the same time.” Willsey added that the experiment could’ve been performed with a real drone but the team decided to use a virtual one for ease and safety. The 69-year-old man who participated in the study told the researchers that controlling the virtual object felt like playing a musical instrument, saying: “Flying [the virtual drone] is tiny little finesses off a middle line, a little bit up, a little bit down.” The man’s BCI was fitted by Blackrock Neurotech and was implanted in the area of the brain that controls hand motion. An AI model was used to map the neural signals received by the BCI’s electrodes to the man’s thoughts, New Scientist explained. The participant first went through a process of learning how to imagine some of his fingers moving in a way that created electrical signals of varying strength, which later allowed him to pilot the virtual drone through an obstacle course. Willsey said that for the participant, the test was the realization of “a dream that he thought was lost once he suffered his injury. He had a passion and a dream for flying. He seemed very empowered and enabled — he would have us take videos and send it to friends.” BCI technology has made significant advancements in recent years, with companies like Elon Musk’s Neuralink also developing a device that is currently undergoing human testing. Once fully developed, a slew of exciting applications could bring significant freedom and independence to those with paralysis. They include allowing people with severe paralysis or locked-in syndrome to communicate by translating neural activity into text or speech simply through their thoughts. It can also enable people to use computers, play games, and operate wheelchairs and robotic prosthetics, and even do things like grasp objects or scratch their face. However, challenges remain with the technology, including medical risks from the surgery required to implant a BCI device. High levels of concentration are also required from the person using the device, with current BCIs correctly recognizing mental commands only about 80% of the time, and up to 30% of users failing to get it to function at all. The health and psychological implications of the technology, including cognitive fatigue and long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields, are also not yet fully understood. These and other challenges highlight the need for continued research and development to improve BCI technology, deal with safety concerns, and create appropriate regulatory frameworks. Soccer giant Manchester City this week secured the English Premier League title, beating archrival Manchester United into second place. As part of the celebrations, the club has offered its fans -- as well as anyone with an interest in drone photography -- a stunning fly-through of its modern, 55,000-seat Etihad Stadium. The groundwork is being laid for the quantum internet -- up in the air. Recently, researchers from Nanjing University in China demonstrated that it is possible to send entangled photons between a pair of drones, called Alice and Bob, hovering one kilometer apart. Have Robot Arms, Will Eat Twinkie Robert "Buz" Chmielewski, a quadriplegic man who suffered an accident in his teens that left him with minimal movement and feeling in his hands, recently fed himself dessert with the aid of two prosthetic robot arms he was able to control using his mind.

USYC, or the Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin, is backed by U.S. Treasury debt and reverse repurchase agreements, with a total asset value of over $1.25 billion, according to RWA data. It comes as multiple businesses seek to tap into an anticipated lucrative boom for real-world asset tokenization. The move is also expected to bolster Circle’s standing against rival and stablecoin giant Tether, which launched its tokenization platform, Hadron, in November. Supporting the integration, Circle has partnered with DRW subsidiary Cumberland, a major institutional crypto trading firm, which will underpin the integration between the fund and Circle’s stablecoin, USDC. Cumberland will expand liquidity and settlement capabilities for USDC and USYC in a bid to drive broader adoption in both crypto and traditional capital markets, according to a statement on Tuesday. The integration is expected to place USYC as a preferred yield-bearing collateral for exchanges, custodians, and prime brokers in both crypto and traditional finance markets, Circle said. Speaking on the partnership, Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire said Tuesday on X there exists an “enormous opportunity” to “bring yield-bearing collateral to crypto market structures” around the clock. “One of the Holy Grails of capital markets is the ability to move between cash and collateral instantly,” he said. “We are unlocking this with a focus on the well-established crypto capital markets.” TMMFs are blockchain-based digital versions of traditional financial assets, such as Treasury bills, offering faster ways to invest in yield-generating instruments. Plans to deploy native USDC on Canton, a blockchain tailored for secure and private financial applications, were also announced. Canton processes over $3.6 trillion in tokenized RWAs and facilitates more than $1.5 trillion in monthly repo transactions, the companies said. The tokenization of real-world assets, which converts ownership rights of physical assets into blockchain-based tokens, is gaining traction. The total value locked in the sector has risen 36.9% in a year to $7.89 billion, as per DeFiLlama data. That’s expected to balloon to more than $50 billion by some estimates. Spying an early opportunity, the world’s asset manager, BlackRock, launched a fund of its own on Ethereum in March of last year, allowing qualified investors to earn U.S. dollar yields. Dubbed the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), the vehicle reportedly contains more than $500 million in assets under management. “Circle is leading the way in bringing the most important building blocks of money onchain, fostering a more scalable model of global institutional adoption of crypto infrastructure, while also paving the way for onchain money to become the core of traditional financial markets,” Allaire said in his post.

Title: Bitcoin mining revenue hits $45M – Understanding what it means for you
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-mining-revenue-hits-45m-understanding-what-it-means-for-you/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T06:00:22Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin mining saw a surge in revenue, highlighting potential for sustained growth or a new bull cycle. Bitcoin [BTC] mining has long been a key indicator of market health. Recent spikes in mining revenue and network activity seemed to suggest that the Bitcoin network could be entering a new phase. With daily mining revenue reaching approximately $45 million, current conditions closely mirror the high network activity seen during Bitcoin’s previous bull cycles. However, the big question remains – Does this surge in mining revenue signal the start of another explosive bull run, or is it an indication of sustained growth that is less tied to immediate price fluctuations? The recent surge in Bitcoin mining revenue, reaching approximately $45 million daily, highlights a significant boost in network activity. This hike signals not only a healthy ecosystem, but also heightened miner confidence. As miners continue to secure the Bitcoin network, metrics like hash rate and block difficulty provide valuable insights into its overall strength. A rising hash rate means greater participation and computing power, while climbing block difficulty hints at a more challenging environment for miners. Together, these indicators point to a thriving Bitcoin network that could be gearing up for a new phase of growth. Bitcoin’s historical data revealed a clear correlation between mining revenue spikes and the onset of bull markets. In late 2017 and early 2021, mining revenues soared alongside high network activity and transaction fees, signaling investor enthusiasm and price rallies to all-time highs. For instance, in late 2017, mining revenue surged past $50 million daily, coinciding with Bitcoin’s climb to $20,000. Similarly, early 2021 saw revenues spike to over $60 million as Bitcoin reached $60,000. These surges reflected strong network fundamentals, such as rising hash rates and transaction volumes, which typically precede price booms. Source: Cryptoquant The daily mining revenue of $45 million seemed to align closely with these historical thresholds, suggesting a potential bullish signal. However, the impact of this figure can extend beyond immediate price speculation. It underlined strong network activity, miner confidence, and growing adoption, hinting that Bitcoin’s ecosystem is solidifying. If historical patterns hold, the current mining revenue could foreshadow a significant price rally or signal sustained, steady growth driven by a thriving, secure network. Either scenario would reaffirm Bitcoin’s position as a resilient, maturing asset class. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $104,551 with a steady upward trend in recent sessions. The RSI at indicated bullish momentum but not yet overbought territory, suggesting room for further upward movement. On-balance volume at -89.25K reflected growing accumulation, supporting the price action. Source: TradingView Historical resistance levels near $110,000 could act as a critical test for continued momentum. If breached, it may signal the onset of a broader bull run. However, sustained volume and a push beyond the RSI threshold of 70 are needed to confirm a strong trend. The press time data supported optimism, but necessitated careful monitoring for confirmation of a sustained breakout. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025–2026 Bitcoin mining appears to be entering a phase of sustained growth, independent of traditional market cycles. Increasing institutional adoption by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity is stabilizing the market, while global demand for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and an alternative financial system continues to grow. Technological advancements in mining hardware, such as energy-efficient ASICs, are further enhancing profitability, ensuring miners stay competitive even as block rewards decrease. Long-term trends point to a transformation in mining economics. As block rewards halve every four years, transaction fees are expected to become the primary revenue source, driving miners to adopt renewable energy and cost-efficient practices. By aligning with sustainability and technological innovation, Bitcoin mining may well-positioned for continued growth and relevance in the evolving digital economy.

Title: Commission of investigation into abuse in schools ‘a priority’ for new government
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/01/22/commission-of-investigation-into-abuse-in-schools-a-priority-for-new-government/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T06:00:00Z

A commission of investigation into abuse in schools, including private fee-paying schools, will be “a priority” for the new government, Minister for Education Norma Foley has said. In a letter to survivors this week, she assured them “that there has been no let-up in the work being carried out by the high-level group that I set up to progress the establishment of the commission of investigation” into abuses in the schools. Noting that she herself was “part of the negotiating team during the talks on the formation of a new government”, she was “pleased to say that the programme for government contains a specific provision in relation to the next steps following the report of the scoping inquiry”. [ Further 12 Spiritan abuse survivors come forward since September’s scoping inquiryOpens in new window ] This, she said, stated that: “Cognisant of the experience of survivors of historical abuse and in line with their wishes as per the scoping inquiry of Mary O’Toole SC, we will as a priority establish and support the work of a commission of investigation as agreed by Cabinet in September 2024.” Last September, the Government formally agreed to establish a statutory inquiry into the sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools, following recommendations in the 700-page scoping inquiry report, led by Ms O’Toole. The inquiry was set up following revelations of widespread sexual abuse of boys at Willow Park and Blackrock College in south Co Dublin. It followed the broadcast of RTÉ radio documentary Blackrock Boys in November 2022 and the launch that month also of a restorative justice programme involving abuse survivors and the Spiritan congregation, which runs the schools. [ Abuse report: Full list of 308 schools and case numbers detailedOpens in new window ] Last September’s scoping inquiry report disclosed 2,395 allegations of sexual abuse at 308 schools run by religious congregations, involving 884 alleged abusers. A high number of allegations were concentrated in special education schools, where 590 allegations were recorded in 17 institutions involving 190 alleged abusers. In her letter this week, Ms Foley said the high-level group to which she referred had also been asked to consider other recommendations of the scoping inquiry report, related to “redress, child protection and memorialisation”. “I am conscious that you and other survivors want to see early action, and so the group was asked to report as quickly as possible. I can confirm that its work has been progressing well and it expects to report shortly,” she said. [ Statutory inquiry into sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools agreed at CabinetOpens in new window ] She hoped her letter would assure survivors “of the ongoing commitment of government in responding to the appalling historical sexual abuse experienced by survivors which was set out in the devastating accounts contained in the report of the scoping inquiry”. Expressing her “personal gratitude” to survivors “for engaging in the process”, she said she was “conscious that your courage has inspired, and will inspire, many others to step forward and share their experiences. I will also be forever grateful for the open, honest and honourable manner in which so many of you engaged with me on a personal basis. Thank you.” Patsy McGarry is a contributor to The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wachtell Lipton Discusses Court Ruling that BlackRock’s Inclusion as Investment Manager Breaches ERISA Duty of Loyalty
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/01/22/wachtell-lipton-discusses-court-ruling-that-blackrocks-inclusion-as-investment-manager-breaches-erisa-duty-of-loyalty/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T05:01:03Z
Full Content:
The District Court for the Northern District of Texas recently ruled that a company breached its fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) for permitting BlackRock’s inclusion as an investment manager of its employees’ retirement assets in a 401(k) Plan. After a four-day bench trial, the Court found that the company failed to “loyally act solely in the retirement plan’s best financial interests by allowing their corporate interests, as well as BlackRock’s ESG interests, to influence management of the plan.” Core to the Court’s holding is its evidentiary determination that BlackRock “pursues a pervasive ESG agenda” that “covertly converts the retirement plan’s core index portfolios to ESG funds,” and that this harms the financial interests of 401(k) participants. As we have noted in prior memos, including The Future of ESG: Thoughts for Boards and Management in 2024, the politicization of ESG has led to “anti-ESG” legislation in several states and a general corporate and investor retreat from use of the term. BlackRock itself has publicly disavowed the term and recently began expanding voting choice programs to include voting policies that oppose energy transition and decarbonization efforts to appeal to a wider swath of its client base and allay the concerns of regulators. The Court ruling notes these recent moves, including BlackRock’s 2024 announcement that it was leaving Climate Action 100+, citing these distancing efforts as “telling” evidence of BlackRock’s “apparent recognition” that ESG investing was problematic under ERISA. The Court found that the company “turned a blind eye to BlackRock’s ESG activism,” and did not sufficiently “monitor, evaluate, and address” the extent to which BlackRock was pursuing a “non-pecuniary ESG investment strategy.” The ruling described BlackRock’s influence over the company—as one of the company’s largest shareholders and a significant debt holder—as the explanation for the company’s “lack of accountability with respect to BlackRock.” This ruling adds an additional layer of consideration for companies and boards seeking to navigate the evolving regulatory and legal landscape on ESG matters. It remains an appropriate and essential part of business judgment for companies to evaluate how key business risks—including those related to the environment, employees, and communities in which companies operate—may impact long-term performance. A number of companies are carefully crafting how they message their policies and thoughtfully considering the specific language they are using. Companies need to continue to be mindful of the current environment as they chart their path forward. This post comes to us from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. It is based on the firm’s memorandum, “District Court Rules BlackRock’s Inclusion as 401(k) Investment Manager Breaches Company’s ERISA Duty of Loyalty,” dated January 13, 2025.

Title: BlackRock and Weinstein's Saba reach settlement in battle over closed-end funds
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackrock-and-weinsteins-saba-reach-settlement-in-battle-over-closedend-funds-3823464

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Saba Capital Management announced a standstill in a long-raging battle over the future of closed-end funds with the asset manager buying back shares in two portfolios and the hedge fund dropping demands for deep management changes. BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said it will buy back 50% of outstanding shares in its BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust and 40% of outstanding shares in Health Sciences Term Trust for a price of 99.5% of each fund's net asset value. A total of roughly $1.6 billion is being tendered in these funds alone, more than has ever been available to investors. In return, Saba, a large owner in BlackRock's closed-end funds, agreed to stop its campaigns at dozens of BlackRock funds calling for fresh directors to be installed and for BlackRock to be fired as some of the funds' manager. The agreement lasts for three proxy seasons. "This is a monumental outcome for shareholders," Saba's founder Boaz Weinstein wrote on social media platform X. He said the settlement shows how shareholders and managers can find a "win-win" solution. "By committing to shareholder-friendly initiatives, liquidity events and governance enhancements, value can be unlocked for all investors." Saba's Weinstein has for years waged a battle against closed-end funds run by BlackRock and other companies that oversee billions of dollars, arguing they charge high fees and deliver lackluster returns with limited opportunities for average investors to get their money out. The settlement comes some seven months after BlackRock shareholders voted at 10 of its closed-end funds to keep the asset manager's directors in place and retain it as the manager at six funds. Saba has long criticized the gap between the assets held by closed-end funds and their share prices and wanted to install new directors and at some funds fire the manager. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, don't issue or redeem new shares, which can leave them trading above or below the value of the securities held by the fund. Weinstein has been crusading against these types of portfolios for some time and late last year took his fight overseas by urging shareholders in seven UK investment trusts to replace directors and install his hedge fund as the manager. He argued the current boards failed to deliver "sufficient shareholder returns." (This story has been corrected to say that investors voted at a total of 10 funds, not 4, in paragraph 7)

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock and Saba Capital Management announced a standstill in a long-raging battle over the future of closed-end funds with the asset manager buying back shares in two portfolios and the hedge fund dropping demands for deep management changes. BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said it will buy back 50% of outstanding shares in its BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust and 40% of outstanding shares in Health Sciences Term Trust for a price of 99.5% of each fund's net asset value. A total of roughly $1.6 billion is being tendered in these funds alone, more than has ever been available to investors. In return, Saba, a large owner in BlackRock's closed-end funds, agreed to stop its campaigns at dozens of BlackRock funds calling for fresh directors to be installed and for BlackRock to be fired as some of the funds' manager. The agreement lasts for three proxy seasons. "This is a monumental outcome for shareholders," Saba's founder Boaz Weinstein wrote on social media platform X. He said the settlement shows how shareholders and managers can find a "win-win" solution. "By committing to shareholder-friendly initiatives, liquidity events and governance enhancements, value can be unlocked for all investors." Saba's Weinstein has for years waged a battle against closed-end funds run by BlackRock and other companies that oversee billions of dollars, arguing they charge high fees and deliver lackluster returns with limited opportunities for average investors to get their money out. The settlement comes some seven months after BlackRock shareholders voted at 10 of its closed-end funds to keep the asset manager's directors in place and retain it as the manager at six funds. Saba has long criticized the gap between the assets held by closed-end funds and their share prices and wanted to install new directors and at some funds fire the manager. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, don't issue or redeem new shares, which can leave them trading above or below the value of the securities held by the fund. Weinstein has been crusading against these types of portfolios for some time and late last year took his fight overseas by urging shareholders in seven UK investment trusts to replace directors and install his hedge fund as the manager. He argued the current boards failed to deliver "sufficient shareholder returns."

More Info A few years ago, the world’s biggest banks and asset managers raced to commit to funding the energy transition and drop fossil fuel projects from portfolios as they came under shareholder and market pressure to join net-zero alliances. But after years of scrutiny and blacklisting from Republican states in the U.S. and lawsuits from Republican attorney generals, North American banks and asset managers began quitting net-zero alliances en masse following President Donald Trump’s election victory. Net Zero Exodus The top U.S. banks and four of Canada’s largest banks are no longer part of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Now several European banks are considering withdrawing from the NZBA, too, while the leading figures of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) – the umbrella group for the finance institutions that have pledged net zero goals – are struggling to hold their regular annual meeting this month, the Financial Times reports, citing sources with knowledge of the situation. Some of Europe’s biggest banks are rethinking their membership and involvement in net-zero initiatives as Donald Trump returns to office and Republican-led U.S. states are going after “woke capital.” This, they say, discriminates against America’s oil, gas, and coal industry by committing to net-zero portfolios and adopting principles that could reduce financing for fossil fuel projects. Since early December, the biggest U.S. banks – Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and JP Morgan – have all quit the NZBA. Commenting on the banks’ withdrawals, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said, “More and more financial institutions are taking a major step in the right direction by leaving the radical and anti-energy Net-Zero Banking Alliance. “The NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities,” Paxton added. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, early this month quit the parallel Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in the latest exit of a major financial institution from a climate finance alliance since Trump was elected U.S. President. BlackRock has decided to leave the voluntary Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which launched in December 2020 and aims to “support the asset management industry to commit to a goal of net zero emissions in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximize long-term value of assets.” The world’s top asset manager has quit the initiative because its membership has “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand wrote in a letter to institutional clients. Net Zero Under Scrutiny BlackRock and major banks have come under increased pressure from Republican politicians and Republican-governed states over their pledges to scale back funding for fossil fuel projects. Texas authorities, for example, have decided to withdraw $8.5 billion in assets of the Permanent School Fund from the asset manager. The Texas legislature passed a law in 2021 to penalize financial firms that, according to state authorities, discriminate against energy companies. At the end of November, a group of Republican states led by Texas sued BlackRock and fellow asset managers Vanguard and State Street for alleged violation of antitrust laws. The states allege that the asset managers have been pressuring coal firms to lower output to cut emissions, thus driving up electricity prices in America. Since leaving the net-zero asset managers’ alliance, BlackRock has reached a settlement with the state of Tennessee, which had sued the world’s biggest asset manager for misleading consumers regarding the role of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in its investment practices. The settlement concluded a lawsuit filed by the State of Tennessee under the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). “The Americans are totally obsessed about not being sued by Texas. The banks have been the worst,” a European executive involved in the Glasgow initiative told FT. Canadian banks BMO, National Bank, TD Bank Group, and CIBC also quit the net-zero banking alliance last week. European lenders have threatened to follow suit unless NZBA eases rules and ends “all formal tracking and any issues that are perceived contrary to US antitrust”, according to FT’s sources. The asset managers’ net zero alliance is already struggling under the pressure. A week ahead of President Trump’s inauguration, the Net Zero Asset Managers said it was launching a review of the initiative. “Recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context,” the alliance said. While the review is ongoing, the initiative is suspending activities to track signatory implementation and reporting. European banks want the net-zero banking alliance to undergo a similar overhaul. Otherwise, they have threatened to quit and follow in the footsteps of the biggest U.S. and Canadian banks. “Several banks have said that unless the banking alliance goes the same way [as] the asset management initiative, they will begin the process to leave,” a source familiar with the banks’ thinking told FT.

We recently published a list of Billionaire Steve Cohen’s Top 15 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) stands against other Billionaire Steve Cohen’s top stock picks. Steve Cohen is one of the most prominent and successful hedge fund managers in the world, known for his extraordinary trading acumen and ability to generate consistent returns. As the founder of Point72 Asset Management, Cohen has built a reputation as a pioneer in the hedge fund industry. He was born in 1956 into a middle-class family. His father worked in the garment industry, while his mother was a piano teacher. Cohen showed an interest in finance early on, even dabbling in poker, which honed his skills in risk-taking and probability analysis. He graduated from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1978 with a degree in economics. Shortly after, he began his career on Wall Street as a junior trader at Gruntal & Co, where he quickly gained recognition for his ability to generate profits through equities trading. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. In 1992, Cohen founded SAC Capital Advisors with $25 million, including $10 million of his own savings. The hedge fund, named after his initials, focused on long/short equity strategies and became known for its aggressive trading style. Over the years, SAC Capital emerged as one of the most successful hedge funds in history, consistently delivering double-digit returns. At its peak, SAC Capital managed over $16 billion in assets. Cohen reportedly generated annualized returns of approximately 30% for his investors, an extraordinary achievement in the hedge fund industry. Cohen’s trading style emphasized speed, precision, and a deep understanding of market dynamics. In 2014, Cohen launched Point72 Asset Management, a firm focused on managing his personal fortune and eventually reopening to external investors. Point72 has since grown into a major player in the hedge fund industry. As of the third quarter of 2024, Point72 manages over $39 billion in 13F securities.

For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Point72 Asset Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A physician and a patient having a discussion in a hospital about biopharmaceutical medicines. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59 Point72 Asset Management’s Stake: $193.2 million Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a California-based biotechnology company founded in 1987. The following features make this company a strong investment case. Firstly, the report for the third quarter of 2024 indicates the company’s success in expanding its product offerings and capturing demand in critical healthcare segments, which may attract investment. For instance, as per the report, product sales increased 7% to $7.5 billion compared to the same period in 2023 and total third-quarter 2024 product sales, excluding Veklury, increased 7% to $6.8 billion compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher sales in HIV as well as in Oncology and Liver Disease. Secondly, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) presented the results of the pivotal Phase 3 PURPOSE 2 trial, which is studying twice-yearly lenacapavir, the company’s injectable HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, for the investigational use of HIV prevention. This may attract investment as it holds the potential to increase revenue streams, estimated to be over $10 billion. Moreover, the company is also advancing its oncology pipeline, including therapies for multiple myeloma and breast cancer. Overall, GILD ranks 11th on our list of Billionaire Steve Cohen’s top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of GILD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Calamos’ first “Protected Bitcoin ETF” will hit the market Wednesday, offering investors 100% downside protection against Bitcoin’s price with limited upside potential. From retail investors to financial advisors, Bitcoin’s risk profile has deterred a notable number of market participants who may be wary of Bitcoin’s steep drawdowns despite its growing adoption, Calamos Head of ETFs Matt Kaufman told Decrypt. “Calamos has built Bitcoin exposure with a safety net, and you can choose how low that safety net goes,” he said. “Bitcoin is a historically extremely volatile asset, and so a lot of people have been on the sidelines watching this experiment turn into an institutional reality.” Calamos’ ETFs will be listed on the Cboe, with its 100% Protected Bitcoin ETF set to debut at a price of $25 Wednesday. The product’s so-called cap range, expected to be anywhere between 10% to 11.5%, will be struck at the end of the day. From that point on, the ETF will aim to offer 100% downside protection against Bitcoin’s price, with a cap range struck again next year. Spot Bitcoin ETFs debuted in the U.S. last year, notching $36.2 billion worth of net inflows as investors and traders flocked to products from Wall Street giants like Fidelity and BlackRock. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has climbed 133% from $46,000 to nearly $107,000, yet some analysts say that registered investment advisors and wirehouses are still warming up to such products. Among institutional investors, 48% of those surveyed in 2023 said that digital assets’ price volatility was a considerable obstacle from an investment standpoint—citing that factor more than anything else, according to a Fidelity Digital Assets report. Meanwhile, 22% of respondents pointed to self-custody concerns, which spot ETFs largely availed. In two weeks, Calamos—which was founded in 1977—will launch additional ETFs with 80% and 90% downside protection against Bitcoin. Those products will have an estimated cap range of 28% to 31% and 50% to 55%, respectively. The products’ risk management framework will be achieved through a combination of U.S. Treasuries and flex options on the CBOE Bitcoin US ETF Index, according to Calamos’ website. Flex options are essentially customizable exchange-listed options, which can have a one-year outcome period, as opposed to expiring on the final Friday of each month, Kaufman said. Calamos, which has $40 billion in assets under management, launched similar products covering the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 last year. Though the products could find use among a professional investment crowd, Kaufman posited that the products could also cater to investors beyond the typical age of your typical crypto bro. “The adoption for Bitcoin has been on the individual or retail level, and it's largely been people younger than myself,” the 45-year-old Kaufman said. “We haven't seen too much of the adoption curve from those older investors, largely because of the risk tolerance that they just can't take.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: TikTok app unavailable on Apple, Google stores in US despite Trump delaying ban

By Doyinsola Oladipo (Reuters) -Three days after ByteDance's TikTok went dark and then was quickly revived in the United States, users who deleted the app were anxiously checking iPhone and Android devices to find it still unavailable to be downloaded again. Some looking to make a quick profit from TikTok fans' desperation listed devices on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) with the app purportedly downloaded for up to $50,000. TikTok still could not be downloaded from the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google app stores in the United States on Tuesday, trapped in legal purgatory by the two tech giants. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday delaying the enforcement of a ban on the Chinese-owned popular short-video app by 75 days, the legality of which is unclear. TikTok resumed service after Trump's assurances that the company and its partners would not face hefty fines to keep the app running, but it was yet to return to app stores. Other apps owned by ByteDance, including Lemon8 and CapCut, were also no longer available. Meanwhile the search to find a buyer for TikTok continued. Trump said on Tuesday he was open to billionaire Elon Musk's buying the app if the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO wanted to do so. And the chair of the House Select Committee on China, John Moolenaar, met businessmen Kevin O'Leary and Frank McCourt about the potential divestiture of TikTok. Billionaire businessman McCourt's Project Liberty consortium has made a formal offer to buy it, valuing the app without its algorithm at around $20 billion. O'Leary joined the effort, Project Liberty said earlier this month. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, O’Leary said he would be interested in a TikTok deal, but it’s not possible under current law. "That 50/50 deal, I would love to work with Trump on, so would every other potential buyer ... But the problem with some of these ideas is they are inconsistent with the ruling of the Supreme Court," the investor told CNBC. The back-and-forth has brought out mixed feelings from users, including some who planned to abandon TikTok after seeing Trump so heavily involved in the negotiations that could result in TikTok eventually being sold to one of his allies in the tech industry. "I do not want to continue being a pawn in this hellscape. I am not saying it will make a difference to TikTok but it will make a difference to me," said Nicole Norman, a TikTok user, on Meta's Threads app. "I will not be back on TikTok." Others, however, want TikTok back, which is not possible as long as Apple and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) do not make it available. "I’ve been checking every day," said travel content creator Lauren Scott. Scott, 29, currently in Brazil, read in some Facebook (NASDAQ:META) groups that Americans abroad may be able to access the app if they deleted and re-downloaded it. But that proved not to be the case, leaving her in limbo. The delay may be because Google and Apple are awaiting additional protections before bypassing the ban that punishes the companies for hosting or distributing the app, according to analysts. A notice on Apple's App Store said: "TikTok and other ByteDance apps are not available in the country or region you're in". Google Play showed: "Downloads for this app are paused due to current U.S. legal requirements." Some users have been tinkering with multi-step processes to gain access, such as trying to change their location in their phones. "Really hoping TikTok comes back to the app store ASAP, not wanting to do any of that VPN stuff to get it back," said Lauren Nader, a TikTok user, on Threads. Google, Apple and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. legislators last year passed a law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court requiring ByteDance to either sell TikTok or face a ban, citing national security concerns. Many Democratic and Republican lawmakers still want to see ByteDance sell the app. Trump suggested the United States government should be a half-owner of TikTok's U.S. business in return for keeping the app alive, and warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a deal. China indicated this week for the first time it would be open to a transaction keeping TikTok operating in the United States, with its foreign ministry saying on Monday that companies "decide independently" on matters of their operations and deals. Some users still on TikTok have suggested that the app's algorithm is "feeling different" since it came back online, fanned by fears about the future of the tool under a new ownership structure. TikTok welcomed users back on Sunday with the message, "Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!" "I deactivated my account after it was 'back' this morning. I'm done with [Trump] taking credit for the messes he starts," said TikTok user Janel Samson on Threads. Over 200 iPhone and Android devices with the app downloaded were listed on the site for sale as of Tuesday night.

As one of the co-founders of Brevan Howard, Rokos played a pivotal role in the firm’s rise to prominence. He specialized in global macro trading, focusing on interest rates, currencies, and government bonds.

Title: TikTok Might Never Be Listed On Apple’s App Store Again, Unless It Cuts Ties With Parent Company ByteDance And Is Acquired By A U.S. Entity
URL: https://wccftech.com/tiktok-might-never-appear-on-apple-app-store-except-for-one-condition/
Time Published: 2025-01-21T21:00:06Z
Full Content:
The ban on TikTok enforced by the government was superseded by an executive order signed by the new U.S. President Donald Trump that allows the short-video-uploading platform to be shielded by this ban for 75 days. In short, it has been a roller-coaster ride, one that Apple and Google have been forced to be a part of since the app was listed on each company’s online store. The reason for banning TikTok comes from its ties with parent company ByteDance, with the authorities believing that the app presents a national security risk to the nation. Despite the executive order signed, Apple and Google have yet to re-enlist TikTok on their respective app stores, and from the looks of it, both technology giants will maintain this stance unless a U.S. firm acquires the video-hosting service. Assuming that it was not clear before, Apple has mentioned the following details in a new support document, summarizing that TikTok and all other applications that have been developed and controlled by ByteDance will not be available to download or update on the Cupertino firm’s App Store. “Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025.” To clear the confusion, even though Donald Trump has signed an executive order, which protects TikTok and its supporting partners from a ban for 75 days, various experts have stated that the federal law will remain in place, regardless of Trump’s executive order. The only exception for TikTok to continue working in the U.S. is if the newly elected President can prove to Congress that the video-uploading platform has severed its ties with ByteDance and is now owned by a U.S. entity. Since none of the above conditions have been met so far, it is no surprise that Apple and Google are unwilling to bring TikTok back to their app stores, as such an action would likely result in exorbitant fines. For those wondering, 60 percent of TikTok’s ownership comprises of institutional investors such as BlackRock, General Atlantic, and the Carlyle Group, with its founders and global employees owning 20 percent each.

Title: BlackRock, Weinstein Reach Truce in Spat on Closed-End Funds

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. stuck agreements with Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital Management that will end the activist-hedge fund’s battle with BlackRock over dozens of closed-end funds whose share prices had tumbled deeply below the value of their underlying assets. Most Read from Bloomberg Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage NY’s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark As part of the deal, BlackRock agreed to repurchase a big chunk of the shares in two of its largest closed-end funds at a price close to their net asset values — 50% of outstanding shares in the $1.8 billion Innovation and Growth Term Trust (ticker BIGZ) and 40% of the $1.7 billion Health Sciences Term Trust (ticker BMEZ). Saba also entered so-called standstill agreements with 48 other BlackRock funds, according to regulatory filings. BIGZ and BMEZ, which had both had traded at deep discounts in the past, jumped more than 6% on the Tuesday proposals. The two tender offers, at a price of 99.5% of of their net asset values could potentially deliver more than $1.5 billion to shareholders, based on calculation by Bloomberg. Weinstein wrote in a post on X that the changes were made after “constructive discussions with BlackRock” and that “by committing to shareholder-friendly initiatives, liquidity events and governance enhancements, value can be unlocked for all investors.” Saba has spent years and billions of dollars buying up closed-end funds run by BlackRock and other big asset managers after their share prices dipped sharply below the value of the assets they hold, a trading anomaly that Saba said was harming investors. It mounted proxy fights and court battles in a bid to pressure the firms to take steps to erase that gap, including through tender offers to buy back the stock. Last year, Boaz ran proxy fights at 10 BlackRock funds with mixed outcomes. It also sued BlackRock’s ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust (ticker ECAT) over its voting bylaws, which is still subject to litigation in a federal court. Weinstein’s fights center around funds that buy income-producing assets, like junk bonds, municipal debt or dividend-paying stocks, that were hit hard when the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates and investors were looking to bail out. With their performances trailing market benchmarks, the discounted trading prices saddled investors with losses if they sold. The hedge fund manager is bringing a similar playbook to UK’s investment-trust industry and attempting to seize control of a bunch of those firms, including two trusts run by Janus Henderson Group Plc.

Chen Tianqiao is a prominent Chinese entrepreneur and investor, best known for founding Shanda Interactive Entertainment, one of the leading internet and gaming companies in China during the early 2000s. Tianqiao also heads Shanda Asset Management, a hedge fund that managed more than $1.7 billion in 13F securities at the end of the third quarter of 2024.

Raised in a modest family, he excelled academically and earned admission to Fudan University, one of the top institutions in the Asian country, where he studied economics. His early years were marked by a strong interest in technology and business, which would later define his career. After graduation, Chen began his career in the investment arm of the state-owned conglomerate Jinjiang Group, where he honed his business and financial skills. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to leave the corporate world and pursue opportunities in the burgeoning internet industry. In 1999, Chen co-founded Shanda Interactive Entertainment with his wife, Luo Qianqian, and younger brother, Chen Danian. The company initially focused on developing and distributing multimedia content but quickly shifted its focus to online gaming.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 Shanda Asset Management's Stake: $121.4 million NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company's investment potential is driven by following several factors. To begin with, the investors may consider the company’s financial growth as a top factor. As illustrated in the report of the third quarter of 2024, GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per diluted share was 0.78 dollars, up 16% from the previous quarter and up 111% from a year ago. Additionally, the company’s quarterly net income was 19.3 billion dollars, up 16% from the second quarter and up 112% from a year ago. The second most compelling factor that may attract investment is the launch of its project DIGITS, the world’s smallest AI supercomputer capable of running 200B-parameter models. Moreover, the firm has launched the NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform of APIs, SDKs, and services that enable developers to integrate OpenUSD, NVIDIA RTX rendering technologies, and generative AI into existing software tools and simulation workflows for industrial and robotic use cases.

U.Today - Institutional adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to accelerate, with treasuries now collectively holding 3,000,000 BTC valued at $317 billion. This represents 14% of the total supply that will ever exist, reveals self-proclaimed Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo. MicroStrategy remains the largest single corporate holder, having recently acquired an additional 11,000 BTC for $1.1 billion at an average price of $101,191 per BTC. The company’s total holdings now stand at 461,000 BTC, worth approximately $29.3 billion, with an average acquisition cost of $63,110 per BTC. Other notable holders include MARA Holdings, a prominent Bitcoin mining company, which ranks second, with 44,893 BTC valued at $4.65 billion. Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT), another mining firm, follows in third place, with 17,722 BTC worth around $1.84 billion. A broader analysis shows that the structure of these institutional holdings is diverse. Spot Bitcoin ETFs account for 1,307,868 BTC, with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) commanding a significant portion of this category, holding 563,134 BTC valued at $58.29 billion. Public companies, including MicroStrategy, collectively hold 608,381 BTC. Governments, such as those of China and the United States, own 513,199 BTC, with each holding at least 190,000 BTC. Additionally, 407,212 BTC are held by private companies like Block One, and 165,677 BTC are locked within DeFi protocols as wrapped Bitcoin. The fact that Bitcoin is becoming more popular as an investment is shown by the fact that institutions are getting into it. Large entities are playing a key role in the market's growth, whether they are investing directly, using it as collateral or diversifying their treasury. As this trend continues, the long-term impact on Bitcoin's adoption and its price dynamics could be huge. This article was originally published on U.Today

He then issued ‘a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021,’ a category that included people who assaulted law enforcement officers.” • This from Julie Kelly was something I didn’t know: Here is the raindrop theory– “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. JOHN DOUGLAS WRIGHT” (PDF) [Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, Criminal Action No. 21-341, United States District Court for the District of Columbia]. Kollar-Kotelly was “previously presiding judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.” From page 24: It would have been interesting to apply the “raindrop” theory of the case to the banksters who “collectively” caused the Great Financial Crash, causing “the unnecessary expenditure of substantial government resources.” Trump Transition Lambert here: Patient readers, Trump just signed a hundred exective orders (EOs) [apparently only 26? Yes] and held a presser. I don’t have the capacity to synthesize all that material, which is doubtless creating “Shock and Awe” in the political class. The links that follow seem the most salient now, but that may change in the coming weeks. What I will say is that I have skimmed several of the orders, and this latest rollout is an amazing feat of staffwork (hat tip Susie Wiles) that the previous Trump administration couldn’t even have considered. (Some clever people will also have to lay the Executive Orders against Project 2025 and look for overlaps. My guess is that the Trump administration will have put its own distinction twists on a lot of it. Also, I’ll often scatter the EOs under the usual category headings (“DOGE” under “DOGE”) because consolidating 100 EOs in one place would be unwieldy. Patient readers, I’ll return with a list of the executive orders — I’m frustrated because I don’t know how many have really been signed — after I handle some administrativia. –lambert UPDATE Here is the list. I took it from the Whitehouse.gov page on “Presidential Actions.” There are four buckets: Executive Orders, Proclamations, Memoranda, and Announcements. (I did this because all the sources I could find were explainers, a level of abstraction away from a simple list of the documents Trump signed, which seems to me to be the obvious base for any further analysis.) Executive Orders: Proclamations: Memoranda: Announcements: So this is the scope of the work for today; Trump was busy. Perhaps a connoisseuer of Federal document types can explain why an Executive Order in one case and a Memorandum in another. I did skim some of the EOs; they seem to be of varying quality, some quite specific as to statute and regulation, others more like “good things are good” handwaving. For example, in “Restoring Freedom Of Speech And Ending Federal Censorship”, this: Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to: (a) secure the right of the American people to engage in constitutionally protected speech; and: Sec. 3. Ending Censorship of Protected Speech. (a) No Federal department, agency, entity, officer, employee, or agent may act or use any Federal resources in a manner contrary to section 2 of this order. Constitutional lawyers in the readership please correct me, but am I right that this is a little thin? Not even a citation to a court case? And “constitutionally” is doing a lot of work. Is there speech that is not constitutionally protected? * * * “Trump signs order to end ‘government censorship’ of social media” [WaPo]. “President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order intended to ‘immediately stop all government censorship,’ a sweeping action that could chill years of efforts to combat the proliferation of false information online. The order bans federal officials from any conduct that ‘would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen.’ It also prohibits taxpayer resources from being used to ‘unconstitutionally abridge the free speech’ of Americans…. Trump’s order could have an immediate impact on years of efforts to bolster coordination between Silicon Valley and the government to combat misinformation about elections, natural disasters and public health.” • But: TikTok is dead, free Palestine pic.twitter.com/hQKK0trAlW — Ozymandias (@martianmarxist) January 21, 2025 However: so my tiktok didn’t seem the same when i got back on, so i went and muted all ads and turned off personalized ads, and now i can actually see things about Palestine and fascism pic.twitter.com/mwLLfs7shl — jess (@jesstechnician) January 21, 2025 Eight hours down not long enough to implement the algo changes properly? * * * “Neo-Nazis Love the Nazi-Like Salutes Elon Musk Made at Trump’s Inauguration” [Wired]. “At this point, Musk put his right hand on his chest before extending it straight out with his palm facing down and his fingers touching, a gesture widely recognized as the ‘Roman salute.’ Adopted by the fascist movement a century ago, it was most famously used by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany, and is to this day associated with the fascist right, especially in Italy. After he first made the gesture, Musk then turned around to members of the crowd who were seated behind him and, with his back to the camera, repeated the gesture. ‘My heart goes out to you,’ Musk added… One of many examples: “”WE ARE FUCKING BACK” the administrator of a Nazi meme channel on Telegram wrote under a clip of Musk giving the salute.'” • I must confess that when I first saw this take I filed under symbol manipulators looking for symbols and then making leaps in reasoning based on the symbols (which is a very bad habit in the idpol space). I also felt that Musk has been awfully herky jerky lately (and there is the preliminary hand-on-heart gesture, which forms no part of the Nazi salute.

I normalize all-caps to title caps but in this case I’m not, because all the EOs have this formatting. I hope readers can give this a close reading, but while the pre-inaugural DOGE set a horrid precedent, this version seems not so bad. The EO hijacks the United States Digital Service (USDS), which Obama put in place after Silicon Valley techies saved his bacon my making the ObamaCare website work. That’s a clever idea! ” The United States Digital Service is hereby publicly renamed as the United States DOGE Service (USDS) and shall be established in the Executive Office of the President.” And: “In consultation with USDS, each Agency Head shall establish within their respective Agencies a DOGE Team of at least four employees, which may include Special Government Employees, hired or assigned within thirty days of the date of this Order. Agency Heads shall select the DOGE Team members in consultation with the USDS Administrator. Each DOGE Team will typically include one DOGE Team Lead, one engineer, one human resources specialist, and one attorney. Agency Heads shall ensure that DOGE Team Leads coordinate their work with USDS and advise their respective Agency Heads on implementing the President ‘s DOGE Agenda.” • This shows, at least, somebody was thinking about process. (“Special Government Employees” were what the the pre-inaugural DOGE operatives — the dudes going around interviewing civil servants — should have been. “‘Everyone wants him out’: How Musk helped boot Ramaswamy from DOGE” [Politico]. “Musk, the tech tycoon and Donald Trump confidant, made it known that he wanted Ramaswamy out of DOGE in recent days, according to three people familiar with Musk’s preferences who, like others for this article, were granted anonymity to discuss them. An ill-received holiday rant on X by Ramaswamy about H-1B visas apparently hastened his demise…. Ramaswamy maintained to confidants as late as Saturday evening that he was actively involved in DOGE, saying he was at work writing executive orders, according to six people who had spoken with him. But a person familiar with the arrangement said he had done almost no DOGE-related work since early December. As recently as last week, Ramaswamy was hoping to achieve some early wins at DOGE before leaving to pursue a gubernatorial bid. Now Ramaswamy and his allies are laboring to put a positive spin on his departure, coming just as Trump takes office.” • 2024 Post Mortem “The Sad Tale of Moderate Joe Biden” [Ruy Teixeira, The Liberal Patriot]. The interesting part of this article is at the end: “Editor’s note: This is a slightly longer version of an essay that originally appeared in The Free Press, where Ruy is now a contributing writer.” • This dude is nimble! “Biden Was Just That Bad” [Caitlyn Johnstone, Consortium News]. “From what we are seeing so far, Trump is just returning things to their horrible standard baseline. Trump will go on to do many evil things as president, just as he did during his first term, but none of this will reverse the fact that Biden just spent four years advancing genocide, nuclear brinkmanship and authoritarianism. The Democratic Party plays just as crucial a role in promoting the tyranny and abuses of the U.S. empire as the Republican Party does, and it is nonsensical to think of either of them as a lesser evil. The empire itself must end. It’s possible that Trump’s term will constitute another swing from Bush-level depravity to Obama-level depravity. It isn’t normal for the U.S. empire to be as openly depraved as it has been in Gaza. Normally its evils are much more well-disguised, because it is in the empire’s interests to preserve its image in the eyes of the western public. You only see the really in-your-face acts of monstrosity when a coalition of forces within the swamp are able to seize on a rare opportunity to shove them through, as we saw in the wake of 9/11 and again in the wake of Oct. 7. The rest of the time, the empire likes to be a lot subtler about its abuses, like it was during the Obama administration and the first Trump administration.” • One could, I suppose, consider engulfing Greenland as “subtle” compared to a full-blown war with China. And it’s certainly subtle for Trump! Realignment and Legitimacy “Trump rescinds Biden’s census order, clearing a path for reshaping election maps” [NPR]. “Among the dozens of Biden-era executive orders that President Trump revoked on Monday was one that had reversed the first Trump administration’s unprecedented policy of altering a key set of census results. Since the first U.S. census in 1790, no resident has ever been omitted from those numbers because of immigration status. And after the Civil War, the 14th Amendment has called for the population counts that determine each state’s share of U.S. House seats and Electoral College votes to include the ‘whole number of persons in each state.’ Biden’s now-revoked 2021 order affirmed the longstanding practice of including the total number of persons residing in each state in those census results. It was issued in response to Trump’s attempt during the national tally in 2020 to exclude millions of U.S. residents without legal status…. Though it had an opportunity during the first Trump administration, the Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether the president can exclude people who are in the country without legal status from the tally that determines political power in the United States.” • Well, when you frame it that way… Syndemics “I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD.” –William Lloyd Garrison * * * Covid Resources, United States (National): Transmission (CDC); Wastewater (CDC, Biobot; includes many counties; Wastewater Scan, includes drilldown by zip); Variants (CDC; Walgreens); “Iowa COVID-19 Tracker” (in IA, but national data). “Infection Control, Emergency Management, Safety, and General Thoughts” (especially on hospitalization by city).

PCANS coats the nasal cavity, capturing large respiratory droplets from the air, and serving as a physical barrier against a broad spectrum of viruses and bacteria, while rapidly neutralizing them with over 99.99% effectiveness. The formulation consists of excipients identified from the FDA’s Inactive Ingredient Database and Generally Recognized as Safe list to maximize efficacy for each step in the multi-modal approach. PCANS demonstrates nasal retention for up to 8 hours in mice. In a severe Influenza A mouse model, a single pre-exposure dose of PCANS leads to a >99.99% reduction in lung viral titer and ensures 100% survival, compared to 0% in the control group. PCANS suppresses pathological manifestations and offers protection for at least 4 hours. This data suggest PCANS as a promising daily-use prophylactic against respiratory infections.” • Maybe one day it will be on sale… Maskstravaganza If you are only permitted a surgical mask: here is a non-exhaustive thread on the various modifications you can apply to surgical masks to increase their efficacy at preventing airborne illness (95% effective like N95 masks). combining these modifications will increase your mask's efficacy 🧵 — a southern souliloquoy (@niggasippian) January 18, 2025 Here is one modification: here is a non-exhaustive thread on the various modifications you can apply to surgical masks to increase their efficacy at preventing airborne illness (95% effective like N95 masks). combining these modifications will increase your mask's efficacy 🧵 — a southern souliloquoy (@niggasippian) January 18, 2025 Here is another: here is a non-exhaustive thread on the various modifications you can apply to surgical masks to increase their efficacy at preventing airborne illness (95% effective like N95 masks). combining these modifications will increase your mask's efficacy 🧵 — a southern souliloquoy (@niggasippian) January 18, 2025 There are a lot more techniques; the thread is worth reading in full. Vaccines “Former surgeon general: Vaccine-preventable diseases are still a major threat” [Jerome Adams, STAT]. The Biden Administration vaccine rollout was fantastically destructive, as we see here. “While there’s much to celebrate about the current focus on improving overall health — particularly the incoming administration’s emphasis on the MAHA agenda, which promotes better food safety, nutrition, and physical activity — it’s crucial that we remember these must be priorities in addition to addressing vaccine-preventable diseases, not in place of them. As I’ve said before, you can’t die of early heart disease at 50 if you already died from polio at 5. The reality is that vaccine-preventable diseases are still a major threat, even in the 21st century, and we ignore that at our peril. I hear from pediatricians and health officials across the country on a near-daily basis about their growing concerns over declining vaccination rates. Parents who would have once trusted their health care providers’ recommendations are now questioning vaccines that should be routine, like MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella). What’s even more troubling is that even the parents of long-term patients — children who have received all their vaccines in the past — are increasingly opting to delay or forgo these essential shots due to new doubts, often fueled by misinformation. What’s worse is that the default response to health provider recommendations has shifted. For many parents, the idea of questioning, deferring, or outright rejecting vaccines has become the norm, rather the exception. This undermines the trust that has been built over generations between health care providers and families, and presents a serious challenge for those of us trying to protect the health of all Americans, especially our children. The impact of this growing vaccine hesitancy will, of course, be felt most acutely by children whose parents are trying, in deeply misguided ways, to protect them. While we’re unlikely to see a dramatic rise in deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases in the U.S. in the near term, the personal costs are immense. A single case of measles can lead to weeks of missed school, sporting events, family gatherings, and other milestones. These are costs many Americans felt were unbearable and inexcusable during the Covid-19 pandemic, yet we’re now putting our children at risk of suffering the same disruptions — disruptions that are both preventable and unnecessary.” • As I said, it’s MMR that’s under-assault. Of course, we have already been induced to abandon our children to Covid — thanks, Great Barrington dudes — so everything’s going according to plan.

Reflections prompted by the Neil Gaiman case. “There’s a moment in the Gaiman exposé where the main accuser, Scarlett Pavlovich, sends him a text message asking him how he’s doing. Gaiman says he’s struggling: he’s heard from people close to him that Pavlovich plans to accuse him of rape. ‘I thought that we were a good thing and a very consensual thing indeed,’ he writes. ‘It was consensual (and wonderful)!” she replies. Except: she doesn’t mean it.” But: “[I]n the article we’ve been instructed, explicitly and repeatedly, that you can’t assume a relationship was consensual just because all parties involved gave consent.” And: “The thing is, if women can’t be trusted to assert their desires or boundaries because they’ll invariably lie about what they want in order to please other people, it’s not just sex they can’t reasonably consent to. It’s medical treatments. Car loans. Nuclear non-proliferation agreements. Our entire social contract operates on the premise that adults are strong enough to choose their choices, no matter the ambient pressure from horny men or sleazy used car salesmen or power-hungry ayatollahs. If half the world’s adult population are actually just smol beans — hapless, helpless, fickle, fragile, and much too tender to perform even the most basic self-advocacy — everything starts to fall apart, including the entire feminist project.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Los Angeles County SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentration as a percentage of the Winter 2023-2024 peak concentration value: 12/7/24: 18% 12/14/24: 19% 12/21/24: 19% 12/28/24: 24% http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/data/index.htm The value for the end of December probably represents the peak for the season. We can definitively say that this winter’s prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was only one-quarter of last year’s prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. It takes two weeks to get the lab results. “We can definitively say…” Based on what, exactly? With all of the manipulation going on with Covid-19 data reporting I have exactly zero confidence in any such statements, regardless of the source. I wonder what the injured police at the Jan 6 riot think about the pardoning of their attackers? And how the families of those killed view $Trump’s pardons? Remind us who was killed on Jan 6, and how many were killed by protesters. I lost count in all the confusion. I wonder how all those hundreds of thousands of family members of dead Ukrainians feel about Biden pre-pardoning his entire crime family to cover up the grifting they did to line their pockets at Ukrainian expense. This feels like “whataboutism”. Biden’s pardons can be wrong and Trump’s pardons can be wrong. “Whataboutism: is a term invented by the butthurt “liberals” in an attempt to make Trump out as the worst president evah. It’s a term I reject. I much prefer the term “context”, which is information needed in order to have an informed opinion. In my informed opinion, Biden’s pardons, including the non-pardon of Leonard Peltier (he deserved a real pardon, not the half-assed “pardon” he got), are wrong. While I don’t know the details of every single Jan 6th case, from what I do know of them, those pardons were the right thing to do. Participating in a protest that turned into a riot that disrupted a procedural vote for a couple hours doesn’t warrant serious jail time or a black mark on anyone’s record. I won’t even get into the fact that the capitol police let many of the protesters in, or how many spooks were in the crowd that day. The butthurt is at a fever pitch right now, and their tolerance is very low. They are incapable of informed opinions – all they feel is hate. They hate Trump, the people around him, and the people who voted for him. They are the scoundrels that did this to them and they want revenge. Even death, and yes, I have read that about some of the J6 people (death instead of pardons). It’s going to be a long 4 years. On fb I’m a member of a “city X before and after” photograph group. 22k members. It’s a neat group. Today the founder went off the rails about Trump and the J6 pardons. Went ballistic, irrational, completely unhinged. He totally blew the group up. Some people agreed with him and posted unhinged stuff as well. If this is what is going on with people…not a good sign. I screenshotted it. I’ll save you guys from the words used. Lots of familyblog. I have a similar thing too. They are at fever pitch hate level, and it’s getting very nasty. You are either like them, or you are the enemy. There is no middle ground – none. Absolutely what you said, Screwball. That is what that guy’s post was-all of what you said. Watch the video of the incident commander of the Capitol Police shooting an unarmed Woman to death, Ashli Babbitt. One of the curious things about that shooting was the two Capitol cops standing by while rioters smashed the class partitions on either side of the door they were guarding. Ms Babbitt crawled through one of those openings while the cops did nothing.It was t was murder in the 2nd degree, at NO POINT did Ms Babbitt pose a threat of death or serious bodily injury to anyone. Let me repeat, the cop who shot her dead was in charge of the Capitol police response that day. He committed murder on camera, in front of numerous witnesses and he has not been charged for that crime. I watched that incident. I also saw him warning her as she and a small group were breaking down a barrier in the capital building. I wonder how the response would be seen if the president was behind that barrier and a small group were breaking d9en the door to get to them. You can reject whatever terms you want, but if you disagree that Trump’s pardons were wrong (I don’t really know enough to have a strong opinion), then disagree on the basis of those facts not on the basis of something a different president did. Hmmm . . . is beating up police officers not a crime if it is in what you consider a good cause? More than 600 were charged with assaulting, resisting or obstructing law enforcement, including around 175 charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer, including with batons, planks, flagpoles, fire extinguishers, bearer or pepper spray. Several were convicted of seditious conspiracy. If let’s say BLM protesters, or climate protesters had done a fraction of that, many of the Capitol rioters would probably be among those calling for them to be shipped to Gitmo. Thin blue line flag at the Capitol riot Some of the charges C’mon – it’s pretty clear they increased the charges to send a message and most should have been at worst charged with trespassing, a misdemeanor. So write them a ticket and be done with it. And BLM protesters did do a fraction of that, and I don’t think they should go to prison either. I’m still a fan of that 1st amendment thing and try to be consistent. I can’t speak for the hypothetical MAGAs out there, who increasingly seem to me to be a caricature created by scared “liberals”. I didn’t vote for Trump, but I know plenty of people who did, and not many fit the stereotype the media would have you believe. Plenty of photographic evidence and sworn testimony of what happened was provided to judges and juries. We can all have opinions as to whether the cause of the protesters was just or their tactics justified, but what happened wasn’t only trespass. The three judges mentioned in the second link were appointed by Obama, GWB, and Reagan respectively. https://whyy.org/articles/january-6-crimes-trump-court-cases-evidence/ https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/23/capitol-rioters-severe-sentences-reprimands-judges Conspiracy is an inchoate offence. Nothing happened. You should smell.a rat It is used by states to charge dissenters with “precrime”. There is very rarely a criminal conspiracy in which a mastermind is directing others. In the US these get charged with wire offences. In the UK, they get charged with financial offences. Conspiracy charges are nearly always political or ” we don’t like the way you people look/talk/act” cases. You can dress up the thinnest tissue of behaviour by two or more people into a plan to bring down the state and a major indictment when the biggest choate crime on the facts might be a parking misdemeanour They increased the charges and used collective responsibility on a disorganised mass. This is what usually happens when cops riot, those who got their scull bashed gets prosecuted for being so threatening that the cops had to riot. Cops in turn tend to riot when control is slipping. And the courts tend to have their back. The unusual thing here is that the cops hardly rioted and that the target is on the right. Otherwise it follows the basic model, which tend to apply no matter the form of government or formal rights to speech or assembly. If real power is threatened niceties goes out the window. I guess it’s all about the exception and who gets to decide the exception. The Associated Press has an interactive web page, Track the legal paths of those arrested in the Jan. 6/Capitol riots that goes into detail about the individuals involved, what they were charged with, their sentences, their states of residence and any group affiliations that they have. Charges: 674 – Illegal parading 520 – Disorderly conduct 350 – Entering restricted area 238 – Assault 180 – Obstructing official proceeding 86 – Physical violence 57 – Theft/Destruction of property 18 – Conspiracy to obstruct official proceeding 14 – Seditious conspiracy 8 – Tampering with documents/proceedings 5 – Firearms charge 4 – Obstructing justice 4 – Communicating threats 3 – Obstructing officers 2 – Robbery Sentences: 1107 – Restitution 1044 – Probation/Supervised release 717 – Imprisonment 464 – Community service 297 – Fine 251 – Home confinement Of the 1,573 people charge, most were not a part of any organized group: Affiliations: 73 – Proud Boys 32 – Oath Keepers 27 – Three Percenters I wonder what the family of Ashley Bobbitt feels about the J6 committee being pardoned wholesale. How was the shooting of someone breaking down barred doors in the capital building and warned before being shot unjustified? Which government building should protesters be allowed to break down doors in? Copagandist. Trespassing in a public space is death sentence for ya, Kurt? Lovely. Having seen how many tear gas projectiles the police fired into peaceful protesters, I think most of the police involved and their families are deeply grateful to former President Biden for his last second pardons, immunizing them from perjury charges for their testimonies before the J6 Committee and in DC courts where they were allowed to testify even if there was no proof a defendant had been anywhere near that officer (raindrop theory). The true J6 story will make Watergate look like a third rate burglary. I know many are not a fan of Tucker Carlson, me included, but his interview with the Capital Police guy was quite telling. Tucker did a nice job and shut his mouth for the most part. Raindrop theory expanded: “When we are all guilty, we will have democracy.” —Albert Camus Zero people, excluding Mrs. Babbit (a protester) were killed that day. She was killed by a policeman with a very bad history of gun use. No police were killed. A few had minor injuries, mostly pepper spray. One cop died a few days later, of a heart attack. Read less fake news (unless you were being sarcastic). Re: “raindrop” theory of prosecution/J6 defendants I am constantly amazed at how liberals fail to understand that when you attack and abuse the law, it will be used against you by the other side in the future. So at the next BLM/Occupy protest, some poor schmoe who holds a sign up peacefully can now be arrested for the crimes committed by the other dude who throws a rock through a store window. Thanks Kollar-Ketelly, you’ve just given right-wing prosecutors a new tool to suppress freedom of expression. So at the next BLM/Occupy protest, some poor schmoe who holds a sign up peacefully can now be arrested for the crimes committed by the other dude who throws a rock through a store window. Mission accomplished! Yes, how silly of me to think that either side of the bench has any goal besides destroying freedom of speech and expression. Thanks for correcting me. Chris, Welcome to the exciting world of direct action. You’ve clearly never been to any demonstration where police were released to beat up on participants (on the other hand, the startlingly few participants who dare to beat up on police or counter-demonstrators, even in self-defense, tend to die while resisting arrest). Raindrop theory is already routine. January 6th was the just the first time I’m aware of that it’s been applied to proto-fascist demonstrators in the United States. You also haven’t been tracking largely successful energy industry efforts to automatically deem anyone opposing them as terrorists, a practice that Trump will soon be expanding to anyone he doesn’t like and their families and friends. We are about to discover that “free” in TrumpWorld is a NewSpeak term, quite different from “free” as conventionally defined in any dictionary. It will be interesting to see how long it takes people to realize that they’ve been had. Again. Those weren’t raindrops in the GFC. And of course blac blockers will throw that brick and rock in hopes of getting every poor schmoe arrested and maybe gassed and beaten and then maybe prosecuted . . . in order to radicalize them all and maybe recruit them into the blac block. Depend upon that, too. Would it be fair to say his outstretched arm was elongated? Elon-gated…almost missed that! Brilliant! Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly… A Nazi to her very core. Loves her secret laws and secret rulings. I never see photos of Davosians skiing, why’s that? Maybe they just don’t do it. Gives them too much of that Louis XVI feeling. Piste de la resistance? Shouldn’t that be Axial de Resistance? “Did you see that?” “Yes, I did. She turned on a euro!” “Amazing.” The ghost of Sonny Bono wants a word … Weather foecast the day Bono ate it… Cloudy in the morning, Sonny in the trees in the afternoon. Poikilotherms, all of them It’s for other people to bend ze knees? Actually, it is funny you don’t see them skiing because they are always using the poles and looking for new moguls. they all feverishly watched the pink panther movie and thought it was historically accurate. That’s because all we have in the way of physical samples of the Davosonians are a finger bone and some pocket protectors. The conspiratorially inclined will be certain to become very verklempt over the original source of the evidence of the Davosonians; some obscure cave in central Russia. “Neo-Nazis Love the Nazi-Like Salutes Elon Musk Made at Trump’s Inauguration” I made no immediate assumptions about Elon’s hand gesture because that is how I act in these days of automatic information. I said the same thing to myself, the hand on the heart first, I have never seen it. But I saw the same video as you of the neo-nazi’s saluting, and now I need to default that he holds their views unless he states otherwise. It convinced me. This, to me, is not something to be on the sidelines about. I know you need Twitter for a= much of your reporting here, but I wonder if there is something to be done about it. Things may be about to change and maybe more news will move off of Twitter now? I hope so, I use a service called xcancel to look at Twitter. Not trying to be a jerk. Please look at any number of photos of public figures doing the same thing that are now circulating all over the Internet. Including Kamala Harris. I will point out it was the ADL themselves who wrote a Tweet last night basically saying “not so fast – we should focus on things that are actually anti-Semitic”. I am of the mind that if anyone should be able to opine about this it would be them. Every Holocaust survivor patient I have ever had has been in their group. I am certain they would be able to recognize a real Nazi salute. My Jewish colleagues today in the lounge were just shaking their head in disbelief that AOC et al would be making an issue out of this. There are lots of things I do not like about Musk. As has been usual the past 10 years or so, all of this kind of performative bullshit just completely takes the attention away from the real issues. I think the woke need to grow a pair. Musk is clearly not a politician nor is he someone who is really comfortable in the limelight. I myself do not get nervous at all in front of students. In front of strangers I turn into Jello – and I have videos of myself through life doing all kinds of awkward things in public speeches. Your skirt is hiked up a bit, and your bias is showing. That is a personal attack and utterly out of line. IM Doc lives in a deep blue enclave and is reporting on what patients and colleagues are telling him. If they are not buying the Musk gesture hysteria and you are, the problem is YOU. There are plenty of things to be worked up about re Musk, and this or should be low on the list if you were paying attention. Start with DOGE, FFS. And you will have no more return here. I thought AOC was being idiotic too. What gets me is the hand-on-heart gesture. It seemed to me dispositive that Musk was “giving his heart” with that gesture (and Musk is, I said especially herky jerky in his motions just now, so the stiff arm arm didn’t bother me. But now, given that video, where the hand-on-heart movement, which is not part of the Roman salute at all, is part of the whole gesture, it looks to me like two populations caught the same variant. And I really dislike coming to that conclusion, because I hate that way of thinking. Adding, I’ll keep track of that video, let’s see what others say. It might have been a poor attempt at something like Steph Curry’s gesture. Musk is getting increasingly nuttier, but I don’t think he’s whacko enough to start giving the HH to large crowds in front of lots of cameras. I could be wrong. The Ukrainians all think he’s on their side now. https://nitter.poast.org/MyLordBebo/status/1881753775289077818#m Also, not Musk but too funny to pass up, Trump allegedly trolling Hispanophone America. https://nitter.poast.org/MyLordBebo/status/1881791991677137342#m It could have the Techbro’s version of the Romulan ‘salute’ from the Star Trek program. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsxnqqQLVTI&ab_channel=WickyWoo The Romulans didn’t do the outstretched hand, did they? I think it is more similar to the “Terran salute” from the mirror universe. Which is of course just a nazi salute. It is kind of wild to me to see the machinations people are going through to not see the obvious. The specifics of the sieg heil (was the hand laid flat on the chest, or held perpendicular to it?) is entirely besides the point. So he Americanized it a bit by adding a “hand over heart” a la the Pledge of Alliegance…and? That was a sieg heil, he did it twice, clear as day. Everyone downplaying it feels to me exactly like everyone trying to say Biden was fine, actually, after the debate. Bruh, we all saw it with our own eyes. No one does that by accident. And it also looked to me like he was coked or methed up pretty good, but I guess when you wrap up with a good ol’ fascist salute everything else kinda gets forgotten. Here is Musk in parallell with the original nazi salute. The arm moves in a simliar fashion, but Musks is a bit more forceful, while the original German is more stiff. Here is American history X with a neo-nazi salute. The neo-nazi, US version, is more forceful then the original and very similar to what Musk is doing. In other words: Musk did a nazi salute. Twice. While proclaiming that Trump voters had saved civilization. None of us can know what goes on in another persons head. But most people go their whole lifes while not doing a nazi salute in public, even once. I find it unlikely that Musk didn’t know what he was doing. About as unlikely as all those Ukrainians just happen to use symbols that are very similar to nazi symbols. Here’s a gif with Elon and Skinheads (the bad kind) side-by-side. It’s an exact match. https://discuss.smash.today/@SmashToday/113873210813104675 Those guys on the left look like undercover state agents provocateurs. Then again, so does the guy on the right. What else is AOC going to talk about now that she’s decided Pelosi is “Mama Bear”? Selling out limits your options. Amen, to your second sentence. Imo. Woke is the same kind of busybody collection for liberals that the Moral Majority busybody collection was for conservatives back in the day: Social authoritarianism disguised as do-gooderism. ‘Believe what I believe or else.’ The spirit of Mrs. Grundy lives! Casting Musk’s ‘heart-felt’ salute as ‘Nazi’ helps to further tar AFD with the same brush. As it should. AfD is fascist. Full stop. So are most ruling parties in the EU/NATO. I take disagreements with compassion. The photos you are referring too are photos, but with Musk, it was a video. And he did not do it once, but twice. Mostly I am just saying it is not as certain as it was when I first saw the video. The ADL thinks anti-zionism is anti-semitism, so I cannot take their opinion seriously. But the ADL criticized AfD saying: AfD members were exposed as participants in a November 2023 secret meeting of far-right extremists in Potsdam, including Austrian neo-Nazi Martin Sellner, who discussed a mass deportation plan for foreigners and “non-assimilated” Germans, as part of AfD’s strategy should it be elected to govern Germany. Musk expressed support of the AfD. I would not support the AfD. And the only real response Musk gave was: “Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.” But no on is calling him Hitler, they are calling him a neo-nazi. I can see that he might have done it on purpose to stir up this very tempest, but I am airing on the side of extreme caution here. “I can see that he might have done it on purpose to stir up this very tempes” I think it almost certainly is that. To me it looked a bit off (hand angled a little high), like he was either trying to make a Nazi salute and failing or making a gesture guaranteed to be taken for a Nazi salute with a slight deviation for the sake of deniability. Then again, looking at old photos of actual Nazi salutes, it’s not like they always held their hands in exactly the same way, so maybe it fits. What I find truly unlikely, though, is that someone like Musk would be able to hold consistently to a demanding ideology like Nazism for any amount of time. What I find extremely likely is that someone like Musk would make a pathetically successful attempt to stir up a controversy by violating widespread taboos and trolling the left. As far as I could tell, it’s one of his favourite activities. Ideologies are for plebs. Insanely rich ego-maniacs only worship themselves. I’m not sure the even he knew why he did it. Maybe he felt that he is now on top of the world, like some modern day Roman Emperor. Avē Caesar! Be careful Doc, I wouldn’t get too comfortable with the ADL’s efforts to point out “real” antisemitism. My take is that they were encouraging people to back off on the Musk salute only to make a larger point about antisemitism, not to actually dial it back to a sensible level. The ADL makes it clear throughout their website that they support a broad definition of antisemitism, including boycotts against the Israeli state and comparison to apartheid and nazi regimes. Musk says he’s on the Asperger spectrum. That means he lacks “social skills”. I.e. he can’t figure out how normies will misinterpret what he does. Here he is, a 50 year old man prancing around like a giddy 10 year old, and people don’t take that into account and think he’s the next incarnation of Hitler? I sometimes wish I could send people here to totalitarian states so that they learn what totalitarianism is once and for all, and realize they don’t live in one. Six month school exchanges with North Korea might finally knock some sense into them. “Here he is, a 50 year old man prancing around like a giddy 10 year old” Sounds like just the right person to be advising Trump. I disagree. You can be socially skilled and very stupid. Witness many politicians… Boris Johnson, Macron & Sarkozy come to my mind, but I’m sure everyone else has their own version. You can also be socially awkward and very intelligent. Witness many mathematicians, scientists and engineers, eg Einstein, Newton, Tesla, Turing, Feynman, Nash, Faraday, Pascal, Mendel, Schrödinger… etc. I think Musk falls into the latter category. As such, he might be useful advising on tech matters. I’m not sure what he’ll do with DOGE. It could be a disaster, but on the other hand Twitter still works despite his firing of tons of employees, so he knew what to cut. Time will tell. Does Twitter still work despite the firings? I can’t see replies or full threads anymore if I’m not logged in, and that was a big part of the site. Also, about 30% of the time, I just get stuck in a loop for days where the login page will just wrap around on itself and not let me log in. The functionality ain’t what it used to be. Does Twitter still work despite the firings? I can’t see replies or full threads anymore if I’m not logged in, and that was a big part of the site. Unfortunately, I think that’s a commercial decision (aka enshitiffication) to force people to log in. Twitter downtime is down (Twitter whales). No idea about your login issue. I have no idea what makes you place Musk into the same category as Einstein, et al. He has failed to demonstrate his genius, is not an engineer, and routinely confuses ideas he stole from others as his own. His claim of being on the spectrum is pure BS. He’s a conman and a grifter, not a real world Tony Stark / Iron Man. The category is intelligent but socially awkward people. Name me someone else who developed reusable rockets. AFAIK he did quite a bit of the work on that himself. Name me someone else who developed the level of self-driving that Tesla has. Sure, he relies on engineers to help do this, but he has made major decisions about it. So did Edison. If you don’t think that requires intelligence, why don’t you do it? Name me someone else who developed reusable rockets. AFAIK he did quite a bit of the work on that himself. McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X ? Interesting, thanks. I learned something. To be fair though, it was a prototype that never reached space, rather than a production vehicle launching satellites. Apparently Musk said “the SpaceX Falcon 9 development was “… continuing the great work of the DC-X project”. To be fair, Musk is still failing to make much headway with Starship. Multiple failures yet no stable low Earth orbit tests. Getting the rocket booster back sometimes, but frequently losing the main flight stage hardly makes it much better than the DC-X. Feel free to point to one thing Musk developed himself, instead of buying, that was successful. He’s bought everything he’s ever sold. It’s not intelligence, it’s money! Because I don’t have the money. Intelligence has nothing to do with it. LOL, you are actually dismissing engineers as some irrelevant factor in engineering. Like they are janitors, or maybe nurses wiping sweat of a surgeon performing open heart surgery. As an engineer, I almost feel personally insulted. Those guys are the ones doing all the work that you are supposedly praising here (the rocket science stuff), and I bet you can’t name a single one of them (or any real rocket scientist for that matter). Instead, you are worshiping the CEO celebrity guy. What Edison did was cheating and stealing, and also killing animals in public for marketing reasons. I bet you love him too. I’m an engineer too, and I’m quite aware that without a company in which one can develop cool stuff, what one does doesn’t get anywhere. That company is a machine too, and that’s what Elon builds. But let’s just ignore that, and pretend he just bought it all, and is dumb. Just ask yourself, if he had supported the people you like, would you be singing the same tune? What people I like? I don’t like people at all. Why would I pretend stuff? I feel like you and I live in two different universes. How about we just ignore that I tried to establish inter-universe communication. Your last sentence gives an explanation for the first one. He’s a conman and a grifter, and an essential part of it is to make people place Musk into the same category as Einstein. In real life, his placement is different, but some people are more inclined to belive his words than their own lying eyes. https://x.com/DD_Geopolitics/status/1881541689585852882 ADL is not an authority on fascism. Hitler’s most infamous demon of choice was Jews (as opposed to, say, Mexicans or Haitians or Palestinians), something that even fellow-fascists like Mussolini never took seriously at the time. Hitler worshippers are fascists. But not all fascists worship Hitler. Don’t believe someone is a Nazi until the ADL deny it. When fascism comes to America, it will come in the guise of anti-antisemitism. Musk is clearly a man of the radical right, not just a typical libertarian (Koch type) or evangelical Christian billionaire. A normal billionaire is content to buy influence and stay behind the scenes. Musk has become an ideological warrior. He likes warring and it has pushed him into some truly weird rightwing subcultures. He’s also on who knows what substances. ADL said that AZOV are not Nazis too. https://thegrayzone.com/2022/12/08/adl-ukraines-azov-battalion-far-right/ ADL is nothing more that an attack dog for those that do not stay in line (by playing insta-win anti-Semitic card), and guard for those that are part of their gang (which Azov, and Musk, demonstratively are). I wonder if your Jewish colleagues think that there are no Nazis in Ukraine. People using ADL, or “Jewish people they met”, as a reference for anything is not even funny anymore. This whole incident is not about Musk, but about the whole US public discourse. I saw one of those still photos of Kamala Harris. Then I saw this little video bit which that still photo was artfully extracted from. Here is the video bit. https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1i6szwa/context_for_those_sharing_kamala_still_images/ I wonder how many of those any number of other photos of public figures doing the same thing were also artfully extracted from videos showing them doing no such thing at all. Clevery extracted by complete-bad-faith-based clever extracters and sight-biters. And I wonder how many fake photoshop “pictures” will follow along, pretending to show nazi salutes from various public figures. > maybe more news will move off of Twitter now? I hope so, As of today there is nothing of equivalent scale or scope, both for breaking stories, Covid, and various vertical “neighborhoods,” certainly not Threads or Bluesky. What would be ideal is the rejuvenation of the blogosphere. Thanks to Kneecap I now read a lot of Irish reddit sub’s. They are all chock full of posts demanding that X links be banned (screenshots allowed by the more permissive). This is the cynical, tolerant Irish. These people need help! This ban twitter links thing is spreading to lots of other subs right now like a wildfire. Heavens! Good thing no one is talking about apparent banking irregularities.

I heard this from a couple of unrelated young women (mid-20’s?) and it really bothered me since I can only imagine myself saying it in very limited circumstances. This article gave me a hint of why. Is this a thing? *giggle..”I’m just a girl! ” giggle* First was a waitress when asked a question about cars during our conversation about my kid putting his car in a ditch. The implication was that she can’t know anything about cars because she’s just a girl. The second was an over heard social conversation at work between male and female co-workers, both in their 20’s and the young lady’s phrasing and intonation were identical to the waitress. I’m almost 60 so I’m totally out of touch. Was this the intonation? If so, it’s just a self-deprecating pop-culture reference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftde81QNXDY It was close to this…I hope that is all it is. Oh man i actually have read a lot of pieces on the self infantilization of women in their 20s. Girl dinner, 24 year old teenage girl, etc. stuffed animals being popular among grown women, the design of products being increasingly infantile. Also how “stay at home girlfriends” are becoming popular on tiktok. moving in an opposite direction from the 2010s girlboss feminism. Defenders generally go “well i deserve some comfort and in this modern world you are deprived of traditional aging markers like buying a house and starting a family because the economy. It is more fun to watch tv shows and try and marry a finance bro.” Antis generally go “you are letting go of your own agency.” I have seen this topic debated so much. Can link articles if anybody wants to hear more. I wonder how much of it is anime-manga culture. I don’t discount the influence of kiddie porn. Just spitballin’…. Ruy Teixeira evidently inhabits an alternate universe — one where Biden was too progressive. Evidence? From where I sit he was the desperation candidate to prevent Bernie from winning the nomination in 2019: recall the other candidates — with the exception of Warren, who was the nearest to Bernie’s right— all magically dropping out just before South Carolina. Coincidence? Hardly. And when he won in 2020 the donor class found him usefully malleable, so they hung onto his increasingly obvious cognitively decayed carcass like grim death until the debate exposed the charade. Too progressive? What a bad joke … Ruy Teixeira’s account of 2020 completely omits Obama’s involvement in selecting Biden. He then goes on to cite Third Way. I had some hope that he was’t a sleazy opportunist. Fat chance! About the executive orders — wondering if anyone has considered using AI to analyze them – especially for the comparison against Project 2025. It seems to me that’s the kind of task that LLMs like Claude have been designed for. I’d volunteer for a working group, but it would help to have people with a background in the subject matter to fine-tune the prompting. About the executive orders — wondering if anyone has considered using AI to analyze them – especially for the comparison against Project 2025… [ Excellent. This is precisely the sort of analysis that a proper AI system is meant for. ] A different perspective from the one you suggest but here are some takes on AI and copy-paste in the EO’s. https://bsky.app/profile/mjsdc.bsky.social/post/3lg7uvbogds27 https://bsky.app/profile/rmfifthcircuit.bsky.social/post/3lg7t4h4n6c22 Generative AI seems like overkill, unreliable, and it has quite a bad track record of “hallucinating” citations. This is just basic textual analysis. If you want to use an app, you could put all the documents into a single folder and start searching for set phrases using double quotes.

Mask tweet Threadreader here: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1880437952729518482.html Thank you! About the Gulf-of-Mexico coast blizzard being a once in a lifetime event . . . I don’t think so. As man-made global heatering keeps destabilizing the atmosphere and the jet streams, I expect more random and deeper-reaching herniated polar vortexes here and there than what we used to have. That means storm events “like” this every few years or so. More zuds in Mongolia ( https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/02/1146422 ) more blizzards in the Gulf of MexiComerica, etc. This is an opportunity for all the California-sympathetic Senators and Representatives to keep careful note of which Senators and Representatives vote against fire disaster relief for California, so they can vote against disaster relief when the Senators and Representatives from those states or districts want some post-disaster relief assistance for their states or districts. I don’t suppose that this is going to delay all those LNG shipments to the EU as the EU has left themselves on the hook for needing them now. No, it certainly won’t. And after global warming has advanced enough to cancel the Gulf Stream and turn EUrope into a localized super-cold zone every winter, they will buy even more mucher morer LNG than now. Profits! I’m of the opinion that much of the truly weird weather is on account of Hunga Tonga blowing up real good in 2022-combined with climate change. Clowns like Johnson making conditions for California will come back to bite him when push>meets<shove in his back yard. Only if California and others MAKE it come back to bite Johnson in the back yard. In fact, if all the delegations opposed to Johnson’s MAGA behavior here want to, they will promise ahead of time to vote against any relief for the South from this weather unless and until no-conditions relief for California has been voted through and signed by President Musk(trump). They could even try forcing these two separate disaster areas to be part of one relief bill. No conditions or no relief. Its what I’d do. How many years will it take for the Hunga Tonga Hunga water-blast to fall back out of the atmosphere? However many years that is, we can then see what the weird weather levels are after that. A natural experiment has been performed. Think you mean the Gulf of America–need to stay up to date. https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-gulf-of-mexico.html He’s really into Nikki Haley territory now. When she became governor she required all state employees to answer the phone “it’s a great day in South Carolina.” No .. . I think I’ll stay behind the times. Its still Gulf of Mexico to me. But that will be one of the Trumpies’ linguistic loyalty tests. If one of them overhears you calling it ” Gulf of Mexico”, they’ll put you on a little list. Here is an entry called ” Context for those sharing Kamala still images, this is not what Elon did”. https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1i6szwa/context_for_those_sharing_kamala_still_images/ But the muskbara for Musk will continue until/unless it becomes too untenable from sheer embarrassment-o-genesis. “The Lost Towers of the Guelph-Ghibelline Wars” It’s a bizarre story but a fascinating one. Maybe our own wealthy could just occupy Manhattan and fortify that island for themselves. Each family could buy their own skyscraper and fortify it. Dibs on the Chrysler tower. It could be like J.G. Ballard’s High Rise meets Poe’s Masque of the Red Death meets the Kowloon Walled City. It would be interesting to read a summary of what the revoked executive actions said.

Posted on 01/21/2025 9:46:07 AM PST by george76 ‘A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,’ Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said.. After years of applying the progressive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ideological framework to their corporations, executives appear to now be realizing that these programs could be driving their companies into a legal and financial wall. The past year has seen a growing list of Fortune 500 companies announcing that they are dropping race- and gender-based programs for their employees and pulling out of global net zero climate clubs. Companies that have announced they are canceling or dialing back their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs include Meta, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Lowe’s, Molson Coors, Nissan, Toyota, and Stanley Black & Decker. In addition, within weeks of the 2024 election, six of the largest U.S. banks—Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley—dropped out of the U.N.-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The past year has seen a growing list of Fortune 500 companies announcing that they are dropping race- and gender-based programs for their employees and pulling out of global net zero climate clubs. Companies that have announced they are canceling or dialing back their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs include Meta, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Lowe’s, Molson Coors, Nissan, Toyota, and Stanley Black & Decker. In addition, within weeks of the 2024 election, six of the largest U.S. banks—Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley—dropped out of the U.N.-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” ....

Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said.

But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” ....

In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ...

Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ...

Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” ....

On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Title: Apple won't return TikTok to the App Store until it's sold to a U.S. buyer
URL: https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/01/21/apple-wont-return-tiktok-to-the-app-store-until-its-sold-to-a-us-buyer
Time Published: 2025-01-21T17:39:49Z
Full Content:
AAPL: 223.91 ( +0.08 ) Copyright © 2025 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. TikTok's status in the U.S. remains complicated Despite President Trump's temporary stay on the federal TikTok ban, it's extremely unlikely that the video-sharing app will return to the App Store anytime soon. Here's why. On January 19, the U.S. government enacted a blanket ban against ByteDance apps, owners of popular apps such as TikTok, Marvel Snap, and CapCut. A day later, President Trump signed an executive order delaying the ban for 75 days. And yet, despite that, TikTok — or any app developed by ByteDance Ltd — has yet to reappear on the App Store or the Google Play store. And, according to a new Apple support page, it appears as if it's going to stay that way. Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025.The complete list of removed apps includes: CapCut Gauth: AI Study Companion Hypic Lark - Rooms Display Lark - Team Collaboration Lark Rooms Controller Lemon8 MARVEL SNAP TikTok TikTok Shop Seller Center TikTok StudioThose who live in the United States and already have any of the aforementioned apps on their phones will still be able to access them. However, they can't be redownloaded if deleted or restored to a new device. Additionally, in-app purchases and new subscriptions are no longer possible. This comes as the newest chapter in the fray between the United States and ByteDance that began in mid-2020, under the Trump administration. For the next few years, notably the first of President Biden's administration, it seemed as though the TikTok ban was off the table. Then, in April 2024, President Biden signed a law requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok ownership to a U.S. buyer within nine months. ByteDance, for its part, went on record saying that it would rather shut down TikTok than divest to a U.S. company. Days before the ban was set to take effect, then President-Elect Trump promised Americans TikTok would continue operating in the U.S. After the ban took effect on January 19, Trump kept his promise. He delayed the ban on January 20, the day he took office. The delay was enacted under the pretense that ByteDance would have an additional 75 days to divest ownership to a U.S. business. There's currently no word if there's been any movement on the divesture front. The move to acquire TikTok is reminiscent of eminent domain, or the process of the government acquiring private property for public use provided it fairly compensates the original owner. However, because the only requirement is that ByteDance divests to a U.S.-based owner, who would likely retain it as private property, it does not meet the criteria. While ByteDance was founded by Chinese entrepreneurs, China does not own a majority stake in the company. As TikTok points out, Nearly 60% of TikTok is owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock, General Atlantic, and the Carlyle Group, while its founders and global employees own 20% each.

When it’s sold, will be subject to better regulations and stop sending way more data than it should to an adversarial nation. Will see if it’s a joint venture tire or total ownership. Bummer for everyone on TikTok now, but there’s no way this doesn’t get sorted. Great.

As a non-American I look at all your companies the same way - they’re taking my data and that of others around the world and using it for their own gain. TikTok is no different.

The Blackrock Clinic is to create 50 jobs by establishing a women’s health centre over four floors in a new Dublin city centre location “in a pivotal step forward in enhancing women’s health services”, the company said. In plans lodged with Dublin City Council in recent days, the Larry Goodman Trust-owned hospital is seeking planning permission to change the use of an office development to a women’s health centre at 2-5 Warrington Place, Dublin 2. A planning report lodged with the application said that the proposed development for a women’s health centre aligned with priorities, outlined in the Department of Health’s Women’s Health Action Plan 2024-2025, such as improved access to diagnostic imaging, ambulatory care and preventive health services such as mammograms and bone density scans. [ Blackrock Clinic gets go-ahead for expansion plansOpens in new window ] The report, by McGill Planning, said that “facilities such as consultant suites, physiotherapy rooms and procedure areas directly contribute to key initiatives in the action plan, including the development of specialised gynaecology clinics, pelvic floor health and multidisciplinary care”. In the report, planning consultant Shauna Hewitt said that “repurposing the existing office building minimises environmental impact and aligns with sustainable practices, an implicit priority in many governmental health strategies”. Ms Hewitt added that “by addressing national healthcare priorities and fostering a patient-centered design, this transformation into a women’s health centre is justified as both a practical and strategic advancement in healthcare infrastructure”. She said that “the proposed women’s health centre is a valuable addition to Dublin’s healthcare infrastructure, promoting equity, sustainability and patient-centered care while contributing to the urban regeneration of this prominent location”. “We trust this development will be a pivotal step forward in enhancing women’s health services in Ireland,” she said.

A decision is due on the application in March.
