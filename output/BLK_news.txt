Leading experts share their insights into the future of money as the GENIUS Act redefines finance in 2025 and beyond. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate’s new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. If 2024 was the year of the dragon, 2025 has been the year of the stablecoin. U.S. dollar-backed digital assets, in particular, have taken front and center stage, achieving buy-in all the way from the highest office. The World Liberty stablecoin, USD1, was launched in March by a DeFi platform majority-owned by members of the Trump family. Then Vice President JD Vance set the stage alight at the Bitcoin Conference in May, clarifying the administration’s bullish stance on stablecoins and their ability to act as a “force multiplier” for U.S. economic power. Stablecoin issuer Circle’s $20 billion IPO followed, igniting what the Bankless podcast duo coined “stablecoin summer.” And last week, the GENIUS Act was signed into law, becoming the first piece of U.S. legislation to directly regulate digital assets, creating a turning point for global finance. Even Jamie Dimon’s getting in on the action despite his personal skepticism about Bitcoin and digital assets. He may publicly claim not to understand their appeal, but there has long been a gap between what Dimon says and what Dimon does: America’s largest bank has been a pioneer in blockchain technology, developing its own stablecoin, JPM Coin, since 2019. So, what’s with all the latest developments in moving value worldwide, and what does the GENIUS Act mean for the future of crypto, TradFi, and the global economy? I asked experts from the technical, legal, and financial fields to throw some light on the subject and unpack the types of advancements we may see in the years ahead. For those of you who’ve been hiding under a rock, let me guide you out of your shadowy abode. The GENIUS Act stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act of 2025,” but “GENIUS” is a lot more catchy. It’s the first comprehensive U.S. federal law that specifically regulates “payment stablecoins” (AKA, digital tokens pegged to fiat money). The GENIUS Act establishes a long-awaited licensing and oversight regime for stablecoin issuers, mandating full 1:1 reserve backing, imposing strict consumer protection measures, and creating a clear legal footing for integrating stablecoins into mainstream finance. The law also bars non-financial companies like the Facebooks and Googles of this world from issuing stablecoins without special approval, applying substantial penalties for noncompliance (violations can incur fines of up to $200,000 per day, and criminal penalties including up to five years’ imprisonment). Why is the GENIUS Act such a big deal? Well, because after years of opacity and uncertainty surrounding stablecoin issuers in the United States, it provides the first federal legal framework, providing clarity on how to run their operations. As international law firm, Winston & Strawn LLP writes in a recent blog: “The Act pushes stablecoin issuers into a regulatory regime similar to that of banks. For many firms, this means a need to hire compliance officers, invest in risk management systems, and potentially partner with experienced regulated institutions to meet the standards set by Congress.” Moon Pursuit Capital is a fast-growing crypto investment fund. Its founder, Utkarsh Ahuja, shared his thoughts on just how groundbreaking the GENIUS Act is, commenting: “The GENIUS Act is a major step forward, not just for crypto, but for U.S. leadership in global finance. For the first time, we have clear rules around stablecoins, which are the backbone of open, programmable money infrastructure. For too long, uncertainty has held the industry back and driven builders offshore. The GENIUS Act changes that. It gives stablecoins legal clarity and sets the stage for broader crypto adoption.” Genna Garver is a partner at the international law firm Troutman Pepper Locke LLP. She also provided her thoughts on the GENIUS Act to share with CryptoSlate readers. She said: “This is a watershed moment for institutional financial services. The GENIUS Act authorizes the tokenization of fiat currency and regulation of the same, thereby legitimizing digital US dollarization.” Guillaume Poncin is CTO at Alchemy, a developer platform that facilitates over $100 billion in transactions annually for businesses across the ecosystem, from Fortune 500 firms like Robinhood, Visa, JPMorgan, and PayPal, to crypto-native companies like Coinbase and Circle. He told me via written commentary: “The GENIUS Act provides the clarity that institutions have been waiting for, and it helps legitimize programmable money that operates at internet speed. This legislation is important because it reduces regulatory uncertainty that has held back institutional adoption.” What’s more, the GENIUS Act does not exist in a vacuum. With a groundswell of favorable momentum toward digital assets from the current administration, the tailwinds are blowing like crazy. The unwinding of the stranglehold on crypto during the Biden years, and the repeal of key pieces of prohibitive legislation such as SAB 121, which prevented U.S. banks from providing custody of digital assets, are creating a perfect storm. Poncin enthused: “We saw immediate interest from major banks that had previously been cautious. Now, with GENIUS in place, we believe every major bank will move toward issuing or supporting stablecoins in some form. It unlocks the next era of programmable money that is trusted, regulated, and built for internet-scale speed.” The GENIUS Act also serves to extend U.S. dollar dominance, spurring innovation based on the USD and reinforcing the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency for decades to come. As crypto-native investment firm, CoinFund, president Chris Perkins commented: “The GENIUS Act will go down in history as a law that served as a foundational step in the mainstreaming of crypto as an asset class. By catalyzing innovation on our greatest export, the greenback, GENIUS will position the dollar as the global reserve currency for decades to come, enhance national security, and unlock financial opportunity across the globe Stablecoins deliver obvious utility by offering inexpensive, 24/7 payments. But, by enabling seamless and efficient access to U.S. dollars across the developing world, stablecoins will also serve as a store of value when local monetary policy goes awry.” Stablecoins have come a long way from their original use case as a means to store wealth, while avoiding the volatility of digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, to be enshrined in a landmark bill recognizing them as key financial infrastructure. So what are some of the main use cases the GENIUS Act enables, and what can we expect from the coming years? Ahuja comments: “The GENIUS Act unlocks real innovation, instant remittances, AI-native payments, and global commerce without intermediaries.” Poncin adds: “The opportunity in stablecoins isn’t in holding them, unless they’re being used in DeFi for yield opportunities. The real opportunity lies in companies issuing their own stablecoins, such as payment processors integrating stablecoins and fintechs launching their own tokens. We’re seeing fintechs generate meaningful revenue from stablecoin reserves through treasury management. This can potentially be $100M+ annually on $2-3B in deposits. The real value creation comes from how stablecoins are enabling the new financial system.” Beyond experimenting with its own stablecoins, JPMorgan made headlines this week for its moves to allow clients, particularly institutional ones, to use bitcoin as collateral for loans. Thanks to the GENIUS Act, the bank is developing a new program that would allow clients to pledge their Bitcoin or Ether holdings to secure cash loans, much as they might with stocks or real estate. While JPMorgan already enabled clients to borrow against crypto ETFs, the move to accept direct crypto holdings as collateral is a paradigm shift for an institution helmed by one of the industry’s most vocal critics. The GENIUS Act’s significance extends across the industry, with DeFi platforms and tokenized RWAs taking note as well. Orest Gavryliak, the chief legal officer at DEX aggregation pioneer, 1inch Labs, told me: “Tokenized technology has become a major area of focus for TradFi giants like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and more, as it represents marked improvement on the current setup of financial standards. It is also a major benefit in terms of the accessibility of liquidity. By transcending geographic barriers, the global nature of tokenization, enabled by blockchain technology, allows markets with limited, isolated liquidity to unify and access liquidity from multiple sources—available 24/7, in real time.” Poncin expands: “Banks will enable customers ‘investor-grade opportunities, like trading in private equities, and get loans against their holdings. Small businesses can finally harness the remote work era to pay overseas workers affordably. We’re about to see a flood of not one, but hundreds of stablecoin ‘killer apps’, all enabling people to exchange and create value in ways unimaginable just months ago. Tokenized treasuries are growing significantly. Stablecoin issuers, such as Tether, hold substantial U.S. debt positions. We’re seeing increased interest in tokenizing traditionally illiquid assets like private credit and real estate to unlock liquidity. There’s also growing development of infrastructure to make RWAs composable with DeFi protocols. The real innovation is about making these assets programmable. This enables new financial products like automated lending against tokenized assets or smart contracts that can interact with real-world collateral.” One interesting clause in the GENIUS Act is the prohibition on paying interest or yield to stablecoin holders, which could mean an explosion of demand in DeFi yield-earning opportunities. Perkins says: “Under GENIUS, stablecoins do not pay interest to end users, and without interest, stablecoins are depreciating assets. So, holders will seek yield. And that’s where DeFi comes in. If the Treasury Department’s projections are correct and trillions of stablecoins come into the system, expect DeFi summer on steroids as users seek to maximize yield by engaging across a variety of yield strategies. Users will be drawn to yield-bearing vaults, and they will commission AI agents to optimize their returns. With the U.S. back in the lead, countries around the world will need to accelerate and optimize stablecoin policies of their own. The $7.5 trillion per day FX market stands to benefit. Watch this space.” Will Beeson, founder of MultiLiquid, and former co-lead of Standard Chartered’s Tokenization platform, comments: “The outright ban on stablecoin yield marks a critical inflection point. Capital is already shifting. Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin as traders seek returns via Ethereum-native protocols and tokenized funds. The stablecoin market is entering a phase where only institutions that can put capital to work efficiently will survive. But there’s a bottleneck: stablecoins move 24/7, Treasurys don’t. Liquidity infrastructure that bridges this gap is now mission-critical.” Gavryliak adds: “Regulatory clarity, like the GENIUS Act, means companies and institutions can now look to leverage stablecoins for fast, cost-efficient cross-border payments, treasury optimization, and real-time settlement, bypassing TradFi banking rails and unlocking operational efficiencies. It’s a positive step forward for DeFi. It also provides security for institutions and other TradFi operators, who can now put their full weight behind the sector. Those previously just dipping their toes in can now dive headfirst with the clear guardrails.” With digital assets an increasingly partisan issue, and key Democrats like Elizabeth Warren holding onto her anti-crypto army, is there any risk of the GENIUS Act, or any other legislation, being reversed if and when the blue team returns to power? And with the Trump family so overtly benefiting from digital assets, does this clear conflict of interest pose any threat? Poncin believes it’s too late for that: “The momentum in crypto adoption transcends political divisions. We work with institutions across the spectrum that recognize blockchain’s potential. The repeal of SAB 121 had bipartisan elements, and there are crypto advocates across party lines. Major banks, asset managers, and payment companies are building on blockchain because it offers superior technology for settlement and programmable money. Moreover, the cryptocurrency industry has demonstrated resilience in the face of various challenges over the years. What matters is that institutions are building real utility on blockchain. These use cases exist because they solve real-world problems, such as settlement speed, operational costs, and 24/7 availability. That’s what drives lasting adoption.” Garver is also positive that GENIUS brings in lasting change. She says: “During the legislative process, there were numerous attempts to debate and offer amendments to the bill to address certain conflicts of interest, but those amendments were not adopted as part of the final GENIUS Act. Now that we have final legislation authorizing permitted payment stablecoins, digital asset adoption likely will depend more on the use cases. Not unlike ATM adoption of the last generation, at some point, it’s just too convenient and beneficial not to get on board. I don’t see potential users sitting on the sidelines as a sign of protest. I think the ship will quickly sail, and crypto will become too integrated into the fiber of our economy, the global economy, and the financial services industry.” With the ballooning global debt, liquidity expansion, geopolitical uncertainty, and lowering interest rates, favorable regulation for digital assets in the U.S. could mean that “nothing stops this train.” As Ahuja affirms: This is, frankly, as constructive a macro setup as you can ask for, short of resolving event-driven risks like tariffs or Middle East escalation. But from a pure market-structure and liquidity standpoint, the conditions are primed. We’re entering a rare window where fundamentals, liquidity, and macro dynamics are all pointing in the same direction; and that’s precisely when the most compelling upside gets unlocked.” Christina is a web3 writer, editor, and content manager with a passion for technology and starting important conversations.

Title: Bitcoin’s Parabolic Glory Days May Be Over, Analyst Claims

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin has climbed 250% since BlackRock’s IBIT launch. But those massive green candles—spikes traders chase—could become a thing of the past. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the era of sudden jolts up or down may be ending. He says that spot ETFs and big companies piling in will smooth out those drawdowns. Balchunas pointed out that IBIT just passed $100 billion in assets under management. Based on his view, that landmark tells you everything. Bitcoin traded between $116,000 and $120,000 after Galaxy Digital sold 80,000 coins. No panic sell‑off followed. Before ETFs, a sale like that could send prices tumbling by double‑digit percentages. Now, deep corrections look less likely. This guy gets it. We’ve been saying same thing. Since BlackRock filing Bitcoin is up like 250% with much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns. This has helped it attract even bigger fish and gives it fighting chance to be adopted as currency. Downside is prob no more… https://t.co/0ECd5XevcO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 26, 2025 In‑and‑out profit‑hunters once drove Bitcoin up or down by 20% or more in a day. But steady inflows from regulated products lure in large investors. Balchunas argues that fewer wild swings will make crypto more useful for buying coffee or paying bills. He believes this shift will help Bitcoin behave more like a real currency and not just a roller‑coaster asset. Based on reports from Citigroup, every $1 billion of ETF inflows can lift Bitcoin by about 3.6%. Using that math, Citi sees Bitcoin hitting $199,000 before December 31. That forecast depends on steady money flowing in. Big funds make big bets. And those bets tend to stick around longer than retail traders chasing quick gains. Citigroup notes that BlackRock’s IBIT became the fastest ETF to reach $100 billion. That matters because it shows how hungry big players are for crypto. If those trends keep up, Bitcoin could push past its current trading band. It may even test new highs without the classic “God candle” leaps that gave quick fortunes—and quick losses. Meanwhile, some analysts warn that early Bitcoin whales are taking profits and stepping aside. As institutions arrive, some old‑school traders will leave. That could shift volume to less regulated spots or exotic derivatives markets. In a calmer main market, risks may hide in side channels. Lower volatility brings fewer heart‑stopping moments. It also means less of the adrenaline rush that attracts day‑traders. For some, that trade‑off is worth it. For others, the loss of big swings could drive them away. Overall, Bitcoin seems to be entering a new phase. Based on Balchunas’s take, those “God candles” won’t vanish overnight—but they’ll be rare. The push from spot ETFs and corporate treasuries aims to make price moves smoother. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock’s CIO fires at Fed’s policy delay: ‘It’s not a goods economy’

With crypto inflows rising and Fed criticism peaking, Rieder’s support for rate cuts may shift the macro winds this week. BlackRock’s Rick Rieder pushes for rate cuts as the crypto industry and housing sector strain under Fed policy. With ETH ETF inflows surging past BTC, all eyes now turn to the upcoming FOMC decision. With just four days to go before the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting, the debate around interest rates is heating up, drawing in voices from both Wall Street and the crypto industry. This time, it’s not just crypto-native investors calling for rate relief. BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer, Rick Rieder, has entered the conversation. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Rieder urged the Fed to begin slashing interest rates. He argued that the broader U.S. economy and particularly the service sector would benefit from such a shift. That said, markets have heard this tune before. Earlier this month, traders piled into Bitcoin [BTC] ahead of a strong U.S. jobs report, hoping the Fed would finally pivot—only to be met with data that reaffirmed its hawkish stance. As previously reported, that macro surprise cooled crypto momentum and reminded investors that the Fed’s next move remains tightly tethered to real-world labor and inflation numbers. Rieder’s comments contrast with prevailing sentiment on Wall Street, where many still favor a cautious or minimal easing approach. For the crypto sector, however, Rieder’s remarks could serve as a critical point of validation, as lower interest rates historically fuel investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. He said, “The service economy is what drives this economy today. It’s not a goods-oriented economy, not commodities, not exports, not manufacturing.” Further in the interview, Rick Rieder emphasized that the Fed’s current approach to inflation may no longer be effective in today’s service-dominated economy. According to the BlackRock executive, aggressive rate hikes are now doing more harm than good, particularly in sectors like housing, where the impact is most pronounced. “The real impact of interest rates on the economy today… it’s about housing.” These individuals, he noted, are the ones most reliant on credit and now face increasing barriers to home ownership. Rieder argued that easing rates could spur more housing construction and improve affordability, ultimately benefiting the broader economy. He added, “If we get the rate down, you actually can bring home prices down. You build more houses, you’ll actually reduce inflation.” This shows that his stance not only challenges the Fed’s current policy direction but also adds weight to the growing call, especially from within the crypto industry. However, despite the Fed’s continued concerns about inflation, BlackRock’s Rieder pointed out that even a rate cut to 3.25% would remain above current inflation levels. Still, optimism for an imminent Fed rate cut remains low. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there’s a 95.9% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged after July’s FOMC meeting, with only a slim 4.1% chance of a cut. Meanwhile, Ethereum [ETH] ETFs have outpaced Bitcoin [BTC] in inflows, with ETH seeing $1.85 billion in net inflows between 21 and 25 July, compared to just $72 million for BTC. With so many crosscurrents shaping the market, all eyes are now on the FOMC meeting and its potential ripple effects across the crypto landscape.

Title: Lions and Wallabies give the MCG the epic it deserves

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Think about all of the times you've seen Jerry Guscott’s drop-goal to clinch the series against the Springboks in 1997. Hugo Keenan’s try to defeat Australia in Saturday’s epic second Test at the MCG has joined a list of iconic moments in the 137-year history of the British and Irish Lions. Owen Farrell’s winning penalty in the second Test in Wellington in 2017, George North lifting Israel Folau over his shoulders and carrying him like a toddler in Brisbane in 2013, Brian O’Driscoll’s dancing feet at the Gabba in 2001. Jim Telfer’s 'This is your Everest’ speech. Add Keenan to the montage. Every four years, the sight of the Ireland and Leinster full-back hitting the gas and burning Len Ikitau to the line will be replayed again and again and again, probably with a Scott Quinnell or Ian McGeechan voiceover that would have you ready to run through walls. Sport can create unlikely heroes, and when Keenan was playing off the bench for Blackrock College’s U14 C team back in the day, never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined scoring a last-minute winner to win a British and Irish Lions series. Even a few weeks ago it would have seemed like a long shot. Having come into the tour shaking off a calf injury, his Lions debut was delayed by a gastro bug that emptied him out and left him 6kg lighter. One of the more level-headed players – even by modern rugby standards – Keenan couldn’t be contained after the final whistle, doing his best to leap into the stands of the MCG every time he spotted some of the friends and family that made their way down to the front row to meet him, including some particularly emotional moments with his parents, Paul and Avril (below). Maybe we’re biased, but on a Lions tour that was so dominated by green, it felt appropriate that one of the Irish contingent was the hero of the day. It was also appropriate that the game itself matched the setting and occasion. The Melbourne Cricket Grounds is one of the world’s iconic sporting venues, and with 90,307 people crammed into ‘The G’, we were treated to one of the all-time great Lions Tests. While the Wallabies fell 60 seconds short of bringing it to a decider in Sydney, Joe Schmidt’s side put to bed any ideas of this series being a formality. Bullied a week ago in Brisbane, they allowed the Lions win pulling up and only a sleepy final quarter at Suncorp put some respectability on that scoreboard. Last night at the MCG it was a different story. While the Lions never played with the same efficiency that marked the first half of their win a week ago, both teams played their part in a thrilling 80 minutes. All week there were fears that this game would be wasted on the occasion, but what played out was a game of rugby that delivered beyond all expectations. In the first half, Australia played with a determination and flair unrecognisable from a week ago. With Will Skelton and Rob Valetini back in their side, they used their two most powerful forwards effectively. The first two lineouts saw them manufacture touches for each player in space; first Skelton broke down the touchline off a clever short lineout, and on their second they went over the top where Valetini charged to the 22. They carried nine times each, with Valetini departing at half time as his calf injury caught up on him, while Skelton’s tank was empty early in the second half. Even with those early departures, captain Harry Wilson was the only forward who carried more. It wasn't just physically where they matched the Lions. Full-back Tom Wright was inspired in the first half, with his glorious 50:22 laying the platform for Jake Gordon’s try, before he raced clear to score one of his own almost straight from the restart, after Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii had left Bundee Aki for dead. "I suppose the drama and how it unfolded is what makes it special," Lions head coach Andy Farrell said. "We came here to win a series. To do it in that type of fashion, you wouldn’t have backed us at 23-5, but to find a way adds to the story, doesn’t it? It adds to the fairytale." Twelve years ago Farrell was part of Warren Gatland’s coaching group who were brought the distance by the Wallabies in the series, before blowing them away in the Sydney decider. "To be a part of it is an honour, it really is. 2013 was special, 1-1, and being able to win it at the death, but we won quite comfortably in the end. "To win it like that is what top level sport is all about." If any context was needed to back-up how thrilling Saturday’s game was, the numbers back it up. Keenan’s match-winner saw the Lions take the lead for the first time on the night, having trailed for 75 minutes, while no Lions side had ever come from more than 10-points down to win a Test, as highlighted by the great rugby historian Stuart Farmer. Jack Conan’s workload summed up the physical toll, with the excellent stats man Russ Petty confirming his combined 31 tackles (24) and carries (7) were the most for Lions player in a single Test across the last five series. Judging by the singing in the Lions’ changing room, which could be heard loudly from the press conference room at the MCG, there will be a physical toll to the celebrations too, and the players are set to be given a couple of days off before turning their attention to Saturday’s third Test in Sydney. With the series win complete, it’s unlikely we’ll see the intensity of the MCG repeated at Accor Stadium. But with a first 3-0 sweep against the Wallabies for more than 100 years the prize on offer, there’s incentive enough for the Lions to throw everything they have at the last week, and give the final game of this tour, and Australian rugby, the respect it deserves.

Title: Tracing the real people in Brian Friel’s ‘first great Irish play’

Brian Friel had a healthy suspicion of journalists. A reporter once described how, when asked to reflect on the success of one of his plays, he did “a touching impersonation of an opossum playing dead at the approach of danger”. Still, in February 1963, when a journalist from the Belfast Telegraph caught up with him, Friel was frank about his work in progress. He was writing a play called The Ballad of Ballybeg but didn’t know if he’d ever finish it: “I have been working at it for six months and so far my characters aren’t moving.” His ambition, he added, was to write “the great Irish play”: “Such a play is one where the author can talk so truthfully and accurately about people in his own neighbourhood … so that these folks could be living in Omagh, Omaha or Omansk.” A few weeks later, the 34-year-old left for Minneapolis, where over several months as an “observer” at the Guthrie Theater he honed his craft. On his return home, he and his wife Anne took their children to the Rosses of west Donegal. And there, near Kincasslagh, which comprised little more than O’Boyle’s shop and Logue’s hotel (in truth, a bar), the Ballad of Ballybeg became Philadelphia, Here I Come! The play spans the night and morning before the emigration of Gar O’Donnell, a young man conflicted about both his imminent departure and his relationship with his emotionally inarticulate father, Screwballs, a county councillor and proprietor of a general store. Philadelphia opened at the Dublin Theatre Festival to a rapturous reception in September 1964. It moved to Broadway in 1966, where it ran for 324 performances and won several Tony Awards, including that for Best Play. Friel had written his first “great Irish play”. Philadelphia was the first play Friel set in “Ballybeg”. Among the others are Translations (1980) and his best-loved work, Dancing at Lughnasa (1990), whose run at Dublin’s 3Olympia finishes this weekend. And because of the symmetry between Lughnasa’s characters and the lives of his mother’s people in Glenties, there is a tendency to assume “Ballybeg” represents that southwest Donegal town. But then, as Friel intimated to the Belfast Telegraph, Ballybeg is Anywhere. Well, it is Anywhere – and it is not. In Philadelphia, for instance, the stage directions for the shopkeeper-cum-county councillor’s entrance are as follows: “SB appears at the shop door. He is in his late 60s. Wears a hat, a good dark suit, collar and tie, black apron. SB O’DONNELL is a responsible, respectable citizen.” In notes on characters in an early draft, Friel remarks of Screwballs: “Aged in his 60s. Hat. Daniel E O’Boyle.” It is a clear reference to Daniel E O’Boyle (1873–1958), the proprietor of the general store in Kincasslagh, who was a county councillor from 1925 through 1950, and who, just like Screwballs, had a younger wife. Daniel E O’Boyle died in 1958. However, at least one other character in Philadelphia was based on somebody who was alive in the 1960s: Master Boyle, who drops into Screwball’s to say goodbye to Gar. And to rant about the priest trying to get him fired: “Enter MASTER BOYLE from the scullery. He is around 60, white-haired, handsome, defiant. He is shabbily dressed; his eyes, head, hands, arms are constantly moving – he sits for a moment and rises again – he puts his hands in his pockets and takes them out again – his eyes roam around the room but see nothing.” Boyle has a gift for Gar, a volume of his poems: “I had them printed privately last month.” Public Gar appears genuinely touched. But Private Gar, his alter ego, who has been sneering at Master Boyle, is dismissive: “He’s nothing but a drunken aul schoolmaster – a conceited, arrogant washout.” Master Boyle may seem a stock character. Indeed, in 1966 Friel himself said: “All my characters are the stock ones of Irish plays … I use the stock people and then have to make something of them.” Still, young fellows who rocketed from the west of Ireland to college in bright cities sometimes burned up on re-entry. And if the drunken schoolmaster with frustrated ambitions was a stock character in Irish literature, he was a familiar figure in many small towns. In an early draft Friel named the person who was in his mind’s eye when conjuring Master Boyle: “The local teacher Dominick Kelly, brilliant, mad, touting his book of privately printed poems; years ago he urged Gar to ‘clear out’ and now that Gar is escaping the teacher turns mean through jealousy.” Dominic Ó Ceallaigh or O’Kelly (1900–70) was once considered “brilliant” and he was what people in the 1960s called “mad”. The son of schoolmaster, he trained for the priesthood, studying in Rome in 1915–18, but abandoned the idea after completing a degree in Philosophy. Returning to Ireland, he joined the IRA. A severe beating from Black and Tans left him deaf in one ear. After the Civil War, in which he took the anti-Treaty side, he taught in various schools in Dublin, including stints in Belvedere and Blackrock, before becoming principal of Finglas National School and then, in 1930, principal in Rush. In 1933, he left Rush to become principal of Dungloe National School, settling in Kincasslagh, where his wife Úna, herself a teacher, was appointed to a position in the local school. Úna O’Kelly (née Turner) was a native of Gortalowry, CoTyrone, where she had been taught by Friel’s aunt, Kate MacLoone. [ Anne Friel on her late husband playwright Brian: ‘I was crazy about him. He was everything’Opens in new window ] O’Kelly was active in Fianna Fáil, attending ardfheiseanna as a constituency delegate. Indeed, he was master of ceremonies in 1937 at a Fianna Fáil Aeraíocht, cultural festival, on Narin Strand when eight-year-old Brian Friel was among the performers. And then things came undone. On the morning of July 17th 1939, O’Kelly left Kincasslagh on the mail car to go to his school in Dungloe – it was the holidays – and when he arrived home at 4.45pm he clearly had drink taken. He took his dinner, and then at 6.00pm said was going to get the paper at Daniel E O’Boyle’s, a stone’s throw from the house. After 15 minutes there, he crossed the road to Logue’s. On arrival home at 10.00pm, “very drunk”, he picked a row with his wife when he was unable to tune the wireless. Then he viciously attacked her, punching and kicking her unconscious. A priest was called to administer the last rites to her. According to court records, O’Kelly called him a “baldy-headed bastard” and ordered him out of the house. Arrested in Belcruit on July 24th, O’Kelly was removed to Sligo Gaol and brought to court three days later, charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm on his wife and indecently assaulting one of the maids, a young girl. A trial date was set for mid-October and O’Kelly remanded in custody. However, on August 17th he was released on bail to Letterkenny Asylum. In October, a doctor testified in court that he was unfit to plead: “He was suffering from a certain amount of depression and confusion, and a certain amount of loss of memory.” Press reports at the time show the judge ruled O’Kelly was “not of sound mind” and returned him to the asylum. There he remained until February 1941, when a jury deemed him sane. He now pleaded guilty to three charges relating to the assault on his wife; the indecent assault charge had been dropped. The judge sentenced him to three months in Sligo Gaol. Úna O’Kelly, meanwhile, moved with their children to Ramelton, north Donegal, where her brother Seán was an established solicitor, and resumed her teaching career. By 1943, Dominic O’Kelly was back teaching, at the Prior School, a Protestant secondary school, in Lifford. He taught there until 1948, when he returned to primary teaching in CoSligo as principal of St John’s Well and then, in 1950, of Geevagh, a three-teacher school, moving a few years later to Claremorris, Co Mayo. After a car hit him in 1959, he retired early to Downings, north Donegal. O’Kelly knew no shame. Since his release from prison, he had been a regular contributor of verse to the regional press, especially the Derry Journal. In 1960 he published, like Master Boyle, a collection of his poetry, Sky, Sea, Sod. It was available from the printer, the Donegal Democrat, and from himself for 10 shillings and sixpence. His short introduction alludes to his “undermined career” and there is a marked note of grievance in several poems, notably the 30-verse “Death by Despair (How a Man Might Die in a Mental Hospital)”, which includes his self-pitying account of his attack on his wife. [ ‘Glenties is the stage’: Brian Friel’s DonegalOpens in new window ] Dominic O’Kelly died in 1970. An obituary in the Derry Journal lamented the passing of a man of “giant intellect”, a “most lovable and entertaining character”, and a “poet of outstanding genius”. Preceding it on the very same page was an interview with Friel on plans to make a film of Philadelphia. Friel alone likely got the irony. The solicitor who represented O’Kelly in 1939–41 was Pa O’Donnell (1907–70) of Burtonport, a UCD-educated lawyer, who was subsequently a Fine Gael TD (1949–70) and minister for local government (1954–57). Although not mentioned by name in Friel’s drafts, might O’Donnell have been the model for the UCD-educated Senator Doogan in Philadelphia? Perhaps. Certainly, other Rosses notables inspired characters in Friel’s “Ballybeg” plays. In a draft of Translations, for instance, Friel describes the Ballybeg hedge-schoolmaster as “a kind of dissipated Eunan O’Donnell”. Eunan O’Donnell (1923–99), who had an MA in Classics, had established a fee-paying secondary school in Dungloe in 1956. And when free education was introduced, and it was decreed that Dungloe was to have a vocational school, with an emphasis on the trades, not a secondary school, with an emphasis on academic subjects, he left to teach in Gonzaga in Dublin. In the play, Hugh O’Donnell, the Greek- and Latin-speaking hedge-schoolmaster is uncomfortable with the incoming national schools. He remembers, how, in 1798, he and Jimmy Jack, a 60-year-old who knew the classics and not much else, had marched, with the Aeneid in their pockets, before getting drunk in Phelan’s pub in Glenties. There, overcome by the desiderium nostrorum (the need for our own), they resolved to march home. “And that was the longest 23 miles back I ever made.” Glenties, before the road was straightened in recent years, was 23 miles from Kincasslagh. So Ballybeg isn’t Glenties any more, Toto, it is Kincasslagh? No, Dorothy: Ballybeg is Anywhere, but populated in Philadelphia and Translations with characters modelled on people in the Rosses where Brian Friel holidayed from the 1950s. Breandán Mac Suibhne is a historian at the University of Galway. He is writing a book on the individuals on whom the characters in Dancing at Lughnasa are based. A new 35th anniversary production of Dancing at Lughnasa opens as part of FrielDays - A Homecoming on August 1st at St Columba’s Comprehensive School in Glenties, near the house in which was play was set. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Massive data centers also require oodles of energy.“These AI data centers are going to require more power than anything we could ever have imagined. We at the G7 do not have enough power,” said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink last year.From Mark Zuckerberg to Elon Musk and many more, there is a similar consensus among Silicon Valley’s leaders that AI will necessitate a huge increase in demand for dependable and affordable energy.In order to meet this forthcoming rapid increase in demand for reliable and affordable energy, it is absolutely essential that the United States pursues what Trump calls “energy dominance.”A few months ago, Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council, which aims to “expand energy production and address cost barriers.”RELATED: Trump Admin to Announce Big, Beautiful News in AI InvestmentsTrump Holds Post-Certification Press Conference, Announces Huge New Investment in Data CentersDuring his first term, Trump made great strides in unleashing American energy. However, most of those successful policies were rejected by President Biden, who then went all-in on the so-called green energy transition.This created a skewed energy market that subsidized unaffordable and unreliable power via solar panels and windmills to the detriment of conventional energy sources that are much more affordable, reliable, and cleaner.Fortunately, President Trump recognizes the sheer folly of the green transition. For years, he has rightfully pointed out that solar panels and windmills are not actually friendly to the environment, unless you ignore the facts that they destroy pristine lands, disrupt ecosystems and habitats, are nearly impossible to recycle, and result in the mass killing of birds, whales, and other animals.So far, Trump has delivered on his campaign promises to eliminate the “Green New Scam.” In a little more than six months, he has already taken the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement (again), signed a bevy of executive orders to accelerate the domestic production of coal, oil and natural gas, and signed into law the reconciliation bill, which eliminated many of the outrageous subsidies that have kept the green energy industry afloat for decades.Moreover, Trump has assembled an all-star team of energy officials who are climate realists. From Energy Secretary Chris Wright to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the days of climate alarmism driving federal policy are long gone.Americans should rejoice at this development. Going forward, Trump’s energy dominance agenda will keep prices at the pump low and utility bills less exorbitant. It also strengthens the U.S. national security posture and global economic influence. Most importantly, it will pave the way for American hegemony in the AI era.Chris Talgo ([email protected]) is editorial director at The Heartland Institute.

Massive data centers also require oodles of energy.“These AI data centers are going to require more power than anything we could ever have imagined. We at the G7 do not have enough power,” said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink last year.From Mark Zuckerberg to Elon Musk and many more, there is a similar consensus among Silicon Valley’s leaders that AI will necessitate a huge increase in demand for dependable and affordable energy.In order to meet this forthcoming rapid increase in demand for reliable and affordable energy, it is absolutely essential that the United States pursues what Trump calls “energy dominance.”A few months ago, Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council, which aims to “expand energy production and address cost barriers.”RELATED: Trump Admin to Announce Big, Beautiful News in AI InvestmentsTrump Holds Post-Certification Press Conference, Announces Huge New Investment in Data CentersDuring his first term, Trump made great strides in unleashing American energy. However, most of those successful policies were rejected by President Biden, who then went all-in on the so-called green energy transition.This created a skewed energy market that subsidized unaffordable and unreliable power via solar panels and windmills to the detriment of conventional energy sources that are much more affordable, reliable, and cleaner.Fortunately, President Trump recognizes the sheer folly of the green transition. For years, he has rightfully pointed out that solar panels and windmills are not actually friendly to the environment, unless you ignore the facts that they destroy pristine lands, disrupt ecosystems and habitats, are nearly impossible to recycle, and result in the mass killing of birds, whales, and other animals.So far, Trump has delivered on his campaign promises to eliminate the “Green New Scam.” In a little more than six months, he has already taken the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement (again), signed a bevy of executive orders to accelerate the domestic production of coal, oil and natural gas, and signed into law the reconciliation bill, which eliminated many of the outrageous subsidies that have kept the green energy industry afloat for decades.Moreover, Trump has assembled an all-star team of energy officials who are climate realists. From Energy Secretary Chris Wright to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the days of climate alarmism driving federal policy are long gone.Americans should rejoice at this development. Going forward, Trump’s energy dominance agenda will keep prices at the pump low and utility bills less exorbitant. It also strengthens the U.S. national security posture and global economic influence. Most importantly, it will pave the way for American hegemony in the AI era.Chris Talgo ([email protected]) is editorial director at The Heartland Institute.

Title: The coming Bitcoin treasury bubble could rival the dot-com era with $11T of capital chasing BTC

Experts are calling the next boom a Bitcoin treasury bubble that could rival the dot-com era, with $11 trillion of institutional capital on the sidelines and a possible path to $1 million BTC. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s quiet rally has captured the attention of Wall Street and beyond, but some voices from OG Bitcoiners like American HODL are predicting that what we’ve witnessed so far is just the calm before an explosive storm. The Bitcoin treasury bubble thesis is that, within just a few years, a tidal wave of corporate, institutional, and possibly sovereign capital totaling as much as $11 trillion could flood into Bitcoin. Some projections suggest that true mania may not hit until 2026 or beyond, potentially sending the price as high as $1 million per coin. Swan Bitcoin exchange unpacked this thesis, examining the signals, mechanics, and real-world examples supporting the case for a Bitcoin treasury bubble that could rival the wildest days of the dot-com boom. Let’s check it out. This month, Bitcoin marked a new all-time high above $120,000, pushing its market cap to $2.4 trillion, trailing only behind Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and gold. Yet, this move has come with little public awareness or euphoria. The price has stair-stepped higher in a quiet fashion, led not by retail speculation but by deliberate, low-profile corporate and institutional buying. As Swan pointed out: “This is the least euphoric bull market we’ve ever seen… and that’s bullish.” Public companies ranging from Strategy to Metaplanet, GameStop to Trump Media are accumulating Bitcoin on their balance sheets, and more novel models, such as those pioneered by Strive Asset Management, see companies converting cash reserves to Bitcoin, not for speculation but as an inflation hedge and long-term holding. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently warned that if the U.S. can’t rein in ballooning debt, America might lose its stance as the world’s reserve asset. He said: “I just don’t know if it’s going to be a crisis in six months or six years, and I’m hoping that we change both the trajectory of the debt and the ability of market makers to make markets. Unfortunately, it may be that we need that to wake us up.” As of fiscal year 2025, U.S. debt interest payments are projected to reach $952 billion, and as the dollar loses luster, Bitcoin’s narrative as “digital gold” and a reserve asset strengthens. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink echoed Dimon’s concerns, saying: “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” The bond market is pricing in interest rate cuts, suggesting a potential return to “easy money” conditions as early as 2026. Lower rates mean cheap capital, more risk-on sentiment, and historically, a surge in asset prices, including Bitcoin. As Swan observed: “Bitcoin ran from $42K → $123K during the tightest monetary policy in modern history. What happens when liquidity floods back in?” Remember the lockdown era? When rate cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic spurred rally after rally across crypto markets, culminating in parabolic gains for Bitcoin? With another cycle of rate slashing potentially on the horizon, the setup looks eerily similar. According to Swan, big buyers are still mostly on the sidelines, finalizing mergers and legal structures. Names like Nakamoto, Twenty One Capital, and Strive Asset Management have yet to fully deploy capital, but are preparing multi-billion-dollar mandates. As coins are absorbed by corporate treasuries through algorithmic “drip-buying,” available supply dries up without dramatic price spikes. When enough boardrooms and sovereigns hit “bid” at the same time, price action could turn “reflexive” where buying by one entity triggers more entities to chase Bitcoin, echoing the late-’90s scramble for “internet stories.” Just like every dot-com needed an “internet story” to survive in 1999, every major firm may soon feel pressure to have a “Bitcoin strategy.” This “narrative contagion” can push prices to unimaginable heights (well beyond what fundamentals alone would suggest). American HODL, among others, sees a realistic path: “I think the treasury company bubble can get dot-com level large. We could see a 3–4 year run that takes Bitcoin well beyond a million dollars.” This isn’t isolated. BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes and long-term Bitcoin advocate Mark Moss also projected a $1,000,000 BTC by 2030. So is it plausible that we’re seeing the opening moves of a bubble that could rival the dot-com era? The pieces are falling into place. Mania may yet be a year or two away, but if history rhymes, the blow-off top could take Bitcoin to levels few believed possible just a few years ago.

Title: Ethereum ETFs Outpacing Bitcoin? BlackRock’s ETHA Hits $10B Benchmark

Time Published: 2025-07-26T14:30:32Z

BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust has raced past a major mark. It now holds $10 billion in assets, just one year after launch. That pace makes it the fastest non‑Bitcoin ETF to hit that level and the third‑fastest ETF overall in US history. ETHA’s rapid popularity also may lead to more competition. Other issuers will be watching closely to see if staking approval gives ETHA a leg up on the competition. Lower cost fees or competing custodians may change their offerings to remain competitive. Investors will be comparing fee schedules, custodial arrangements, and staking opportunities as they place their Ether. LOOK OUT: $ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after (you guessed it) two bitcoin ETFs $IBIT & $FBTC. Amazingly it went from $5b to $10b in just 10 days (ETF asset equiv of a God candle). Is in Top 5 in flows 1M, 1W. Sister Hazel! pic.twitter.com/Jrrb15BdHV — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 24, 2025 Ethereum ETFs are moving quickly. Latest data shows they drew nearly $5 billion in monthly inflows overall. On July 17 alone, Ethereum funds saw $602 million net injections. At the same time, Bitcoin ETFs brought in over $520 million. That shift hints at growing confidence in Ethereum’s role beyond simple currency use. ETHA’s sponsor fee of 0.25% is low enough to attract big players. Based on reports, BlackRock set it up with Coinbase Prime as custodian after filing in November 2023. The US Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Ethereum ETFs alongside seven other funds early in 2024. That green light opened the door for major institutional flows. Analysts point to Ethereum’s proof‑of‑stake system and its DeFi applications as key drivers. Staking locks up Ether and earns rewards, offering a potential yield that Bitcoin funds can’t match. BlackRock has applied to let ETHA stake its holdings. If approved, some of ETHA’s Ethereum will be locked up to generate staking income. That decision could come later this year after the SEC clarified that staking rewards count as income, not a security. Ethereum’s rise also reflects a broader search for yield. With bond returns still low and stock markets volatile, some investors are turning to crypto products that offer returns beyond price gains. ETHA’s quick growth shows that institutional demand for crypto is no longer limited to Bitcoin. Based on reports, ETHA ranks first among spot Ethereum ETFs in both size and growth rate. BlackRock’s deep pockets and respected brand do not hurt either. A large brand like BlackRock has clout when it comes to working with highly regulated assets. With Ethereum now being seen as a broader-than-niche token, large asset managers see a chance to add crypto to mainstream portfolios.

Title: XRP Price Set To Teleport As Major Financial Players Tap In — Opportunity Window Closing Fast
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-set-to-teleport/
Time Published: 2025-07-26T13:00:13Z

The XRP price is already looking at a rapid move after the market decline that rocked the altcoin in the last few days. This comes amid expectations of a Spot XRP ETF, as well as a move by Ripple to sweep in and take a bite out of SWIFT’s market share. As one XRP analyst puts it, the altcoin is already set for takeoff, and the only thing left now is for it to trigger a face-melting rally. Crypto researcher and XRP community member Ripple Van Winkle has sounded the alarm for investors for what could be coming next for the altcoin. In a video posted on X, Van Winkle explains that the teal XRP move was yet to happen, and what was seen before was only a preview of what was yet to come. He pointed to a number of factors that are set to drive the XRP price higher, including larger institutional players looking to tap into the altcoin. The analyst mentioned that the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and PNC, among others, are already circling, especially as XRP ETFs become more popular over time. These trillion-dollar players are expected to possibly jump on the bandwagon once XRP begins receiving ETF approvals from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Due to this, the researcher believes that the XRP price has not even started to move. In fact, he explains that the ‘real move’ is actually ‘encoded into the system.’ This move, he explains, is not going to be a gradual move for the market. But rather, he expects the price to expand rapidly during this time. Ahead of this expected move, Van Winkle has urged XRP investors to hang tight. For those who are still holding their coins, he suggests continuous holding and faith in the altcoin for a move that he says will hit like a freight train and catch everyone off guard. As for those who are yet to invest in the altcoin, the crypto researcher explains that they have only a small window of opportunity to get into the cryptocurrency before it takes off. He expects the move to make instant millionaires of investors when it eventually happens. In his post, he points to things like pre-programmed liquidity and institutional ETFs as things that will drive the rally. According to Van Winkle, there is going to be a reset that will cause the XRP price to teleport to possibly new all-time highs. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: The Best Brokers For Saving On Capital Gains Taxes

ByWilliam Baldwin ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. You make money in the market but tell the IRS you’re losing money. Yes, this works—for a while. Direct indexing with loss harvesting looks like a bonanza, for both providers and customers. Is it? Short answer: Yes, but. Yes, you can do nicely with this scheme, more than covering the fees charged. The two buts: (1) Before getting in, think about what’s going to happen on the way out. Below I will present a cautionary tale about the resulting mess. (2) Take any vendor’s projection of tax savings with a grain of salt. Providers evidently see gold here. In recent years Vanguard, BlackRock, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan, Stanley have bought their way into the business. Wealthfront, a Palo Alto, California robo-adviser, has made a great success democratizing automated loss harvesting and aims to go public in the near future. Frec, a newer San Francisco firm and something of a Wealthfront knock-off, has shaken up the business with an insanely low-cost offering. Direct indexing means owning the S&P 500 or another index not via a fund but via individual stock positions. Instead of putting $100,000 into the Vanguard S&P 500 exchange-traded fund you buy 42.4 shares of Nvidia, 13.7 shares of Microsoft, 0.33 shares of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies and so on. Or rather, a computer does the buying. Periodically the computer plucks out losers to sell for a capital loss, replacing them temporarily with substitute stocks that behave similarly (Merck for Pfizer, perhaps). After 30 days have passed, the original position can be restored without creating a loss-killing wash sale. You sit on the winners for as long as you can. We are, of course, talking about money in taxable accounts. There is no point to direct indexing inside an IRA or 401(k). A direct indexing account typically has between 200 and 400 stocks. You don’t need more than that to do a decent job of tracking an index with 500 stocks in it. Parametric Portfolio Associates was a pioneer in this business, originally offering the tax dodge to wealthy clients paying for custom portfolio management. Its direct-indexing skills (and the large footprint of Morgan Stanley, which picked up the company when it acquired Eaton Vance) explain Parametric’s $400 billion of assets under management. The prevalence of fractional shares and the automation of financial advice mean that little people can now get in on the action, with as little $5,000. What kind of capital losses do you get? That will depend on the direction and the volatility of the market. Over a decade, Wealthfront reports, capital losses have averaged 2.6% to 3.3% per year for its clients, but there is a great deal of year-to-year variation. People who put money in at the beginning of 2022 got a gusher of losses in the ensuing crash, but then they would have been better off waiting for a year and doing without the tax goodie. Remember that your aim with loss harvesting is not to have losses. It’s to have gains but report losses. Suppose you have a plump capital loss to put onto your tax return. How much good does that do you? This is a function of your tax bracket and your other investing activity. Capital losses can absorb any amount of capital gains and, beyond that, can be written off against up to $3,000 a year of ordinary income like salaries. Unused losses can be carried forward indefinitely but expire with the taxpayer’s death. It is reasonable to expect that the tax benefits will, in the early years of a direct indexing account, more than pay for the fees, which are usually in the range of 0.1% to 0.4% a year. But at some point, perhaps after five years of a mostly bullish market, or later if stocks go sideways, you will have nothing but gain positions. Note that someone who bought in 2015 would not have derived much tax benefit from the crash of 2022 because even at its low point that year the market was twice as high as in 2015. This matter of loss exhaustion brings me to the first caveat about fancified indexing. What are you planning to do when it’s time to move on? To illustrate, I will cite the case of a Forbes reader that I will identify as Mr. X. X signed up for a separately managed account with a financial advisor who was using direct-indexing software. Recently, with most of the potential losses captured, he quit the advisor and deposited the stock at a discount broker. He asked me: Now what should I do? X is sitting on an interesting pile of shares. He owns Nvidia at a $12 entry point, and should let that position ride. So, too, with gains in Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom and Microsoft. But he’s got 140 positions that are now underwater or showing small gains. It would be nice to declutter. Some of these clunkers will be easy to dispose of. Pepsico, Nike, Pfizer—no problem. But what about PT Bank Raykat or Airports of Thailand? These American Depositary Receipts trade over the counter, which is to say, not on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. On Yahoo Finance I recently saw the airport ADR with an average daily trading volume of 993 shares and a frightful bid/ask spread of $9.52 to $12. X could sell all the cats and dogs, but would probably get hosed on the OTC shares. Apart from their sometimes larcenous bid/ask spreads, unlisted shares may not qualify for commission-free trading. Another problem: Odd lots (less than 100 shares), of which X has more than 400, are sometimes hard to trade. This junkpile cries out for all-or-none orders (you don’t want a trade to turn an odd lot into an odder one). But combining that restriction with a price limit increases the chance that an order simply won’t be executed. X did walk away with a fat loss carryforward, which may come in handy some day, but is likely to spend many hours cleaning up. Here’s someone commenting anonymously online on direct indexing: “I made a big mistake doing it in a Wealthfront account and when I wanted to consolidate holdings with another firm, I had to manually sell 195 securities. Stick to broad index ETFs!” I don’t entirely agree with that sentiment. Direct indexing makes sense if you have plans for the end game and if you stick to large U.S. companies. I’ll go this far with the Wealthfront critic: You should get your small-stock and foreign exposures via ETFs. Now let’s look at the second caveat, which is to understand the value of a capital loss. Wealthfront says that, over the past decade, it has captured $3.5 billion of losses for its customers, 91% of them short-term. (These figures include earlier versions of tax-wise automated investing as well as the more recent direct indexing product.) The losses, it declares, have saved people an estimated $1 billion in taxes. Fine print: The estimate assumes that all of the short-term losses went to use, immediately, against short-term gains. This is unrealistic. Someone with a $100,000 account generating $3,000 of capital losses, and with no capital gains to report, can indeed use the $3,000 against ordinary (that is, high-taxed) income. But someone with a $1 million account generating $30,000 of capital losses is unlikely to be using all that against high-bracket income. It would require having at least $27,000 of short-term capital gains. People do not have short-term capital gains unless they engage in foolish behavior, such as investing in a hedge fund. Rational investors do, however, have long-term gains to report. They get them from employer stock, sales of homes, all-cash takeovers and unwanted capital gain distributions from mutual funds. Realistic assumptions for big-ticket investors: You will be using most of your capital losses, whether short or long, to absorb long-term gains. You may find yourself using a loss long after you harvested it. The top rate on long gains is 23.8% plus whatever your state grabs. Conclusion: Losses are valuable but not as valuable as advertised. Now here are some product reviews. This one is my favorite. It offers a direct-indexed S&P 500 account at a bargain-basement 0.09% annual fee, with a $5,000 minimum. In a price war with Wealthfront, this outfit has the same 0.09% fee for the S&P 500 direct deal, with a $20,000 minimum. It gets a runner-up status because it’s newer and smaller. It oversees $350 million to Wealthfront’s $80 billion. Frec has some interesting variations on the theme, including a Sharia-compliant index portfolio at 0.35%. Its direct-indexing product uses 250 or so stocks to mimic the Fidelity Large-Cap Index (similar but not identical to the S&P 500). The annual fee is 0.4%, with a $5,000 minimum. When the harvesting wears out you can transfer the collection of stocks to a no-fee brokerage account. Forty basis points is a lot. But using this service could make sense if you have other money at Fidelity, which oversees (in custody or management) $15 trillion. It has a powerful brokerage platform and the oldest and biggest broker-affiliated donor-advised charity fund. Exit plan: Offload your long-term winners onto the charity, which will take them, fractional shares included, with a few mouse clicks. Charles Schwab has a 0.4% direct indexing product (minimum, $100,000) and a charity fund similar to Fidelity’s. This firm invented retail-level indexing and is known for its low costs. Four years ago it spent an undisclosed sum of money (your money, if you are a Vanguard customer; it’s a mutual corporation) to acquire direct indexer Just Invest Systems. So, what’s on offer? I can’t find an answer on the Vanguard website, which has only a vague description of direct indexing aimed at financial advisors. The company did not respond to a press inquiry. A few weeks ago former shareholders of Just Invest sued Vanguard, claiming they were double-crossed on a performance payout. Could be a while before we see a competitive offering from the indexing king.

Title: FeliSpeaks: Life as a ‘black, Irish, queer culchie’

Over the past decade, Felicia Olusanya, who performs as FeliSpeaks, has written themselves into the contemporary Irish cultural canon. Growing up in Longford town, having moved to Ireland from Nigeria (via France) at the age of eight, there have been multiple landmarks along their creative journey to becoming a compelling and well-recognised performer on Dublin’s spoken word scene. Yet early on, they imbued their poetry with its own specific cadence, intonations, a musicality that can move like waves, often becoming an enveloping experience for audiences. A moment that felt especially important was in 2017, at a fundraiser for the Repeal the 8th campaign in the Olympia Theatre. Olusanya’s capacity to both quieten and command the room was potent. What emerged was a poem written at their desk in the credit union where they worked: They were nominated for Best Performer at Dublin Fringe Festival in 2018 for Boy Child, co-written with Dagogo Hart, and then won the award in 2022, for their performance in thisispopbaby’s production, WAKE. Their poem, For Our Mothers, was included on the English Leaving Certificate curriculum in 2023. Olusanya has spent the past two years living in Brussels, returning to Dublin in early July. They arrive in Temple Bar on a sunny weekday morning, finishing up a deli pastry. In the Project Arts Centre, we sit at the back of the empty auditorium upstairs, the airy silence interrupted only by a lone technician clearing lights from the stage floor. At this year’s Dublin Fringe Festival, this stage will be Olusanya’s. Octopus Children, presented by thisispopbaby, is written by Olusanya, who also performs in the piece. Olusanya describes it as a “choreopoem”, using the term coined by the American playwright and poet Ntozake Shange, where multiple disciplines including poetry, music, and dance combine. “Octopus Children,” Olusanya explains, “is this idea that we’re all connected by water. We all come from the water, the birth canal, we drink water to survive, we’re 70 per cent water. I think water is integral to how we live, and one of the things we waste the most. That’s the underbelly of the piece. The overbelly, if I can say that, is just trying to figure out where you fit as a person.” These are the tentacles. “There are many layers people can see themselves in. But being black, and then being black-Irish, and then being black, Irish and queer in a religious setting, in a Nigerian setting, in Ireland, is very specific.” And beyond that, Olusanya deadpans, “being a culchie”. The idea for Octopus Children arrived in 2021. Olusanya felt the poems landing as songs. “I could hear a sonic world with them.” They began hanging out with some producers in a garage in Blackrock in Dublin – “very sweet boys” – working on a concept for an EP. The first piece completed in 2022, Tough Meat, was a video poem directed by Bobby Zithelo. “Putting that out into the world, I was hoping to leverage that in some capacity – somebody will see it! Somebody will think it’s brilliant!” In the meantime, Olusanya captivated audiences in WAKE. That show was a hit, journeying from Dublin Fringe Festival to a standalone sold-out run at the National Stadium in Dublin, and then to London’s West End, and Manchester’s Aviva Studios. The show holds many things simultaneously: chaotically fun cabaret; aerial artistry; breathtaking pole-dancing; club anthems; dance; poetry; Irish traditional music – all combining to become a moving funeral rite and a great night out. In WAKE, Olusanya is a central character – part ringmaster, part preacher, part spirit, part healer, an anchor tethering the audience to the spiritual essence of the show. In rehearsals, Olusanya says that before developing the character, the thisispopbaby team “really developed my talent and stretched it a bit”. Olusanya relishes a challenge. “If you’ve ever grown up in a choir and a Nigerian auntie has been your choir master, girl, you take challenges real well! Nothing can faze you.” [ Thisispopbaby’s magic sauce: ‘Take Irish traditional culture, add some mirror balls, throw some glitter on it’Opens in new window ] Olusanya recalls telling Jennifer Jennings, WAKE’s co-director and co-creator, that the character felt like an offering for the audience. Amid the neon and glitter, WAKE is also about expressing and diffusing grief. “Grief is so traumatic, and if you’re going to address it, you need to bring balm. I feel like that was what I was tasked with,” Olusanya says. At one performance in the West End, they recall “coming off the stage and I wasn’t even thinking about the words, I was being the words ... I vacuum cleaned the grief in the room. There’s something so difficult about that, feeling the intensity of people’s grief. Take it off their hands, and then offering balm. Oftentimes I’ll get offstage and my body is wracked. Hyperventilating. I can’t breathe.” An audience in the midst of releasing their emotion – joy or pain – doesn’t often consider where that energy goes when those on stage are opening up those channels. “Energy cannot be destroyed or created,” Olusanya says. “It can only be passed from one to the next. So if you’re releasing and you feel great, I’m determined to swallow it all up. I’ll bring it before my chi and my god and release it that way.” They pause to consider that process and experience. “I felt powerful enough to be able to do that. I’ve been thinking about power a lot. Once you’re aware of your magnitude or power, for me, awareness of my power meant service. You can’t be powerful and useless – come on! The more aware of my power I am, the more I submit to the service of other people via my art. That’s what I’m here for.” After the second run of WAKE in Dublin, Olusanya says thisispopbaby asked, “What do you want to create? What do you have in mind?” Olusanya answered: Octopus Children. “I made them a little PowerPoint with all the ideas and thoughts, the sounds, the music I had already created. They were like, ‘What in the hell? Here’s a director. Go sort that out.’ They were interested, they were curious. I really appreciated that they wanted to see my perspective on life.” That director is Oonagh Murphy. Murphy says Olusanya is “a counter voice to what we’re familiar with in the Irish cultural imagination. But also the craft of their work is incredible. When you think about how prolific their output is, there is a real discipline ... And there’s a deep playfulness there too. For all the weight and darker elements of the work – which need to be given space – Feli also brings a real lightness, humour, and an irony.” [ Sabotage review: Joyously chaotic festival opener has all the fun of the circusOpens in new window ] Working on Octopus Children, Murphy says, “has felt quite spiritual, magical”. Early on in our conversation, Olusanya refers to “being the rebel in your family unit”. What does that rebellion look like? Their upbringing, community and family in Longford runs deep. As a youngster, Olusanya was “a good girl, because I liked the things that I was supposed to like”. They loved school, “which, if you know anything about immigrant families, this is the one thing”. They loved church, “because I was very aware of my spiritual nature from when I was very young, and I didn’t have any other outlet for it”. They loved going to choir, and being part of a youth group. “The rebellion started when I hit 15 or 16. I started wrestling with my gender identity without knowing what it was. I didn’t even know what those terms were until I hit maybe 21, 22 ... I wore the wrong clothing. I ‘girled’ differently to how I should have. So my mum was quite worried about that. I also wanted to explore kissing boys and girls, but it was like: that’s not something you do. And I was very aware of that.” Around the age of 17, Olusanya recalls taking their younger brothers to the barber shop. “I came home with a haircut too. My mother said, ‘What is the matter?’ She was so concerned because I cut my hair.” The rebellion “ramped up” in college in Maynooth, where they were studying English and sociology, “because I decided to leave Christianity”. Then, there was coming out as queer. “I came out by accident. I didn’t know I was coming out, I was just talking about being queer on Instagram.” I want black Irish girls, or non-binary people, or gays, to be like, ‘Ahh! That’s a bit of me!’ Olusanya had attended Dublin Pride, alone, “so excited, just taking it in, like wow ... I came back from my first Pride parade, and I made a whole Instagram post – as you do when you’re 23 and stupid. I was so excited, saying all my thoughts, and I forgot church people followed me. My mum followed me, obviously. She commented, ‘Mum’s got your back always.’ It was really beautiful in that moment. However, some tricky conversations in the community in Longford followed. “You know in the movies where they want to pray the gay away? They’re really serious about that, you know… I was like: I like my gay. I’m not giving up my gay… That in itself was a rebellion.” On the hurt this induced, Olusanya says they “would rather that pain, than the pain of hiding”. Tears pooling in Olusanya’s eyes, they express empathy and understanding for the context. “That in itself is complicated and confusing, and requires all the emotional intelligence in the world to navigate. But yeah,” they say, brushing the tears away, “that’s also in Octopus Children.” Olusanya flips the atmosphere into a moment of unexpected lightness, “Do you know what? The Laya Healthcare ad helped!” Laughter fills the empty theatre. “Do you know how cool it is when you’re on billboards? They get over the gay stuff quick!” In late 2021, Olusanya appeared in a campaign for the health insurance company, bringing their image and words on to television screens and billboards across Ireland. I suggest that this feels like a quintessentially Irish experience, but perhaps one more associated with another time. Olusanya nods, connecting the social attitudes of older generation white Irish people to first generation Nigerian-Irish. “I don’t like saying this, but that’s how far away we are in terms of where we should be. I’m not saying white Irish Ireland has it all figured out, but in terms of the queer thing? It just feels like the story is a 1980s Irish experience. It feels like a time-travelling experience. [ Taylor Tomlinson at 3Arena review: more personal, more vulnerable but few surprisesOpens in new window ] “When immigrant black people come here and they make black Irish children, they’re not expecting the assimilation that we experience. My parents and their peers came purely out of survival – ‘at least you’re going to have a fighting chance’. When people come from a survival mentality and you’re trying to operate from a thriving mentality, they’re terrified. Because even though they do want you to thrive, they don’t know what that looks like. And so there is this push and pull between: ‘I want you to be better and that’s why I brought you here,’ versus, ‘What better looks like is really confusing and alienating for me as the mother or father or family that brought you here.’” This can cause, Olusanya believes, a “disconnect” between some black youth in Ireland, and their parents and older relatives. “It’s either thrive and evolve, or we just end up replicating our parents. So that 1980s connection is so interesting. There’s half of us who are like, ‘F**k it, I’m going to take this opportunity to thrive beyond the economic.’ Because, no word of a lie, black Irish people my age? Disgustingly equipped and educated. They have masters degrees for no reason, bruv! What, to work in a Centra? Relax!” The Centra line is obviously a joke. “They’re taking over Google! What’s going on?! Educated to s**t. Lawyers, medical doctors. We’re not playing it small, because we’re not allowed to. We’re not allowed to play it small, because survival involves going all the way up here,” Olusanya raises their hand. “But that’s economic survival.” The social and spiritual aspect, they say, is another thing. I wonder whether the reaction Olusanya experienced to them being queer was also about a fear of another layer of oppression to contend with in a racist society. The conversations Olusanya had with family and others, they say, were “not about hate, it’s about fear. They were terrified, because they’ve built these communities and structures that incubate them safely. When you pop out of it for work, to socialise, you can still come back home. Even if I get racist experiences at work, there’s a whole community that have my back I can come back to, so that is a temporary experience. That’s how I think the older generation view it. Whereas if you’re then gay, it’s not the thing that’s going to break you out ‘there’ in the white Irish world, but it will,” - or may - “in the home that we’ve all built that’s supposed to support you no matter what.” “I want us to be able to have our communities, grow our communities, and not be caged by our communities, because that’s also what’s happening when people come from a space of survival, psychologically. I can’t wait for a couple of generations where our people feel completely safe, that there isn’t a demarcation. Sociologically and psychologically we all do this: you’re drawn to people who are more like you, that’s normal, so you’ll always have those type of communities anyway. I’m not saying we need to dismantle our safety in our community in order to integrate. That’s not what I’m asking for. But what I am saying, is to free ourselves from the limitations that the survival of our communities has brought. And one of those limitations,” Olusanya says, is a feeling “that you can’t be queer. Especially not out loud.” They have just returned from two years in Brussels, a place Olusanya went to out of a sense of adventure and “safety, because it felt like the country held me well - I visited several parts of of Belgium before settling in Brussels - and I didn’t want to go to London especially, very Dublin 2.0 vibes.” Living there, they were exposed to “a type of freedom and blackness that I had never seen before or experienced”, as well as new forms of dance and jazz. Now, Olusanya is ready for the next phase. They hope what Octopus Children does is make people “one, feel visible in multiple ways, per tentacle. But two, that it frees us from the limitation of our own community – seeing a ‘me’. I’ve come to accept – and no ego s**t – you just end up being a pioneer. You don’t want to be a public figure, you don’t want to be the person people look up to. But if you’re going to do something different, you’re going to end up being that ... With this show, I want to show my community – black Irish people – and the white Irish community, that this weird layered person-being can be visible, and it’s completely okay. Visible and celebrated. I want black Irish girls, or non-binary people, or gays, to be like, ‘Ahh! That’s a bit of me!’ and not feel like there’s no representation. I hate the word representation, but it’s so f***ing important. But I don’t want to be the only one. I want to be able to make Octopus Children so octopus children can find it, so there can be a community of us, so we’re very visible, very loud.” Una Mullally, a contributor to The Irish Times, writes a weekly opinion column © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: JioBlackRock Mutual Fund: New entrant in industry eyes profitable and scalable growth in India

Jio BlackRock Asset Management, one of the latest high-profile entrants into the Indian mutual fund industry, may be following a slightly different playbook from group entity Jio's disruptive telecom foray, as reported by ET Bureau. The 50:50 joint venture between Mukesh Ambani-backed Jio Financial Services and the world's largest asset manager BlackRock, may not be as aggressive on its pricing strategy to grab market share, unlike Jio's sharp discounting that helped it catapult into the big league in telecom. Profitability and capturing share from new growth in a market that has grown threefold in five years will be some of its mantras. "It is not at all to just capture market share, and profitability will be important and pricing is one of the key points," said Sid Swaminathan, MD and CEO, Jio Blackrock Asset Management, in an exclusive interview with ET. The fund house is keen to offer differentiated content, value-added products and grow the market rather than grab share from existing players, he said. One of the differentiators Jio BlackRock will bring is its proprietary tech platform Aladdin, which will help in cutting transaction costs. Jio Blackrock started operations in India this month with launch of three debt schemes that include overnight, liquid and money market funds that mopped up Rs 17,800 crore in early July. There have been talks that Reliance has also invested in the NFO. Though the fund house has started with index funds, it aims to offer the entire range of index and active funds, funds that are driven by data, exchange traded funds (ETFs), specialised investment funds (SIFs) and alternate investment funds (AIFs) over time.

Auctioneers regularly hear from members of the public seeking their opinion on the value of a piece of jewellery, a painting, a rare book or a piece of antique furniture. And while most auctioneers offer their expertise for free, many say that members of the public often have unrealistically high expectations of the value of the items they bring in to be valued. “Some clients have done their own research before they come to us but a lot of the time it has been done incorrectly, leading them to having higher expectations than the true auction market,” says Claire-Laurence Mestrallet, head of jewellery at Adam’s Fine Art Auctioneers and Valuers on St Stephen’s Green, Dublin. She explains that people can be confused between the insurance valuation (ie the retail value in case of loss or damage) and the more realistic price a piece might fetch when sold at auction. “Sometimes pieces are overvalued for insurance,” she says. According to Mestrallet, some people accept the valuation given by the auctioneer, while others need time to come to terms with the news before deciding to sell a piece. Engagement rings are among the items for which valuations are frequently sought. Jewellery that’s no longer worn and jewellery that’s been inherited but not necessarily wanted are also likely to be brought in for assessment on valuation days, she says. It’s often the case that people no longer want to keep valuable jewellery that they don’t wear in their homes and decide to sell it on. Adam’s is hosting valuation days next week in hotels in Dublin (Monday, July 28th), Belfast (Tuesday, July 29th), Cork (Wednesday, July 30th) and Limerick (Thursday, July 31st). Anyone interested in attending should email stephanie@adams.ie in advance. Mestrallet says valuation days always bring some surprises. “It’s like fishing. Some days, there is nothing and other days, you might see something spectacular,” she says. Valuation days are also a way for auctioneers to build relationships with future clients, with about 40-50 per cent of items seen on the day put on the market for sale subsequently. Will de Búrca of De Búrca Rare Books in Blackrock, Co Dublin, says his antiquarian and rare books shop receives photographs almost on a daily basis from people “hoping they’ve stumbled upon a hidden treasure in their attic or in their inherited library”. Most of the time, the owners of these potentially rare books, maps or manuscripts have already typed the details into Google in the hope of finding the answers to their questions. “The internet can be a good starting point but it’s a bit like diagnosing an illness – it’s best to ask a specialist,” says de Búrca. “What many people don’t realise is that a book’s true value lies in the detail: edition, condition, rarity, provenance and sometimes the story attached to it.” While it may be difficult to fathom, he says two books with the same title and date can differ in value substantially. “Valuations can be a bit of a reality check. Sometimes people are disappointed to learn their cherished heirloom is more sentiment than substance. Others are pleasantly surprised to discover that a volume on their shelf is actually quite valuable,” says de Búrca. Genuinely valuable or remarkable books don’t turn up very often. “Most inquiries turn out to be relatively common editions or books with more sentimental than market value.” He says that what makes a book particularly interesting for a dealer isn’t always its monetary value. “It’s rather if it has unique binding, marginalia [notes written in the margins of the text] from a notable owner or a forgotten piece of Irish printing that fills a gap in the historical record.” De Búrca Rare Books regularly puts up a selection of new books on its website for collectors to view. Morgan O’Driscoll, which has offices in Skibbereen, Co Cork and Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin, says paintings are often brought in for valuations. “If people send us an image of a painting, we will give them an initial valuation but we will never sell something unless we physically have it here,” says O’Driscoll. A final, formal valuation will only be given once he sees the painting in person to check its authenticity, size and condition. “Valuations are one of the most rewarding aspects of the job – never knowing when something truly special will come through the door. Those unexpected finds keep things exciting,” he says. On average, O’Driscoll estimates that about 50 per cent of the paintings sold in his art auctions come in through clients seeking valuations. One such work is the John Shinnors painting Falling, which is being offered in his current Irish Art online auction. Executed by the artist between 2000 and 2001, the oil-on-canvas work carries an estimate of between €8,000 and €12,000 and is available to bid on until 6.30pm this Monday, July 28th. According to O’Driscoll, most people are happy with the estimates that auctioneers give them. “They can see online the highest price an artist has made and avid collectors will know how much each artist’s paintings are worth,” he says.

Title: Is the YouTube channel you’re watching right now owned by private equity? A YouTuber investigates

Time Published: 2025-07-26T03:00:00Z

Charlotte Colombo If you’re a YouTube enthusiast, I have bad news for you: some of your favorite channels might be owned by private equity companies. In a 12-minute video, Micro, a YouTube channel known for its microeconomics content, broke down exactly what this means. Essentially, a large portion of YouTube watch time is on channels owned by private equity firms, which in turn have raised billions of dollars from investors like Amazon and Softbank. Some channels like Donut Media, Veritasium, and Task and Purpose have been acquired publicly. Others, such as Dude Perfect and Coco Melon, have been acquired more privately, with no public disclosure. According to Mirco, the reason private equity firms are interested in YouTube channels is their growth and profitability potential, which makes them seem highly investable. Micro also claims that, currently, legacy media companies are threatened by new media. For them, private equity acquisitions are a form of self-preservation. The fact that YouTube channels already have an established audience makes it a lot easier to scale and monetize. Thus, private equity operations have dramatically increased. Firms like BlackRock manage over $12 trillion. The video also notes that the rise of private equity can have a substantial impact on YouTube content. The increased overheads that come with a private equity acquisition mean that they need more revenue to stay profitable. This, in turn, puts pressure on channels to produce more content and take on more sponsorships. According to Micro, this can lead to these creators gravitating towards “safer” and more generic content. Moreover, acquired channels often move away from one creator and build out a team to ensure that one person isn’t the be-all and end-all of the investment. This has the disadvantage of reduced viewership and a lack of fan support, as they struggle to adjust to the new content. Micro says this has led to the former hosts of big channels leaving to start independent channels. With this uptick in predictable, cookie-cutter-type content, could we be seeing a decline in YouTube creativity? Netizens, who made their feelings clear on Reddit, seem to think so. “Honestly, it’s pretty easy to spot corporate content imo,” one wrote. “Like it’s just so bland most of the time. It doesn’t have any personality behind it you know?”“Another dead giveaway is when they start collaborating with big companies instead of other YouTubers, schools, small businesses,” a second replied. While a third emphasised that we should keep in mind that “these are only the channels which have been publicly acquitted by P.E. firms. There are likely even more channels which we are unaware have already been acquitted or are in the process of being acquitted.” Is the future of entertainment doomed, or are we all just being a little too dramatic? In all honesty, it’s impossible to tell. The internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Title: Ethereum Validator Exit Queue Explodes To 521,000 ETH ATH, What This Means
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-validator-exit-queue/
Time Published: 2025-07-26T00:00:54Z
Full Content:
Ethereum staking validator Everstake has announced that the validator exit queue has reached its highest point in one year. The expert further explained why this development might be a positive for the ETH ecosystem. In an X post, Everstake stated that the Ethereum validator exit queue has reached its highest level in over a year, representing approximately 520,000 ETH, which is equivalent to $1.9 billion at current prices. The validator noted that this queue will take around 19 days to fully clear. He further explained that this exit queue tracks how many validators are leaving Ethereum’s staking system. This typically raises concerns about a huge sell-off being imminent from these validators. However, Everstake assured that the surge in the validator queue is not a sign of fear or collapse. Instead, the expert claimed that it is a shift, whereby these validators are more likely to exit and restake, optimize, or rotate operators than leave the ETH ecosystem. Meanwhile, Everstake admitted that there is still the possibility that these validators may want to lock in profits, especially seeing as the Ethereum price just recently surged to a six-month high. He noted that it is natural to assume that some stakers are preparing to sell, which could create short-term sell pressure and potentially cause ETH to correct. However, on the other hand, the validator remarked that Ethereum is seeing record ETF demand, with billions of dollars in net flows since the beginning of this month. As such, BlackRock, Fidelity, and other ETH ETF issuers could match this potential sell pressure with similar buying pressure. Everstake also declared that this development with the validator exit queue is a “sign of health” and the freedom to move. He claimed that activity like this shows how mature ETH staking has become, with the protocol doing what it was designed to do. He added that this is what decentralization looks like. SoSo Value data shows that the Ethereum ETFs have now recorded 15 consecutive days of net inflows. This follows the net inflow of $231.23 million that they recorded on July 24. These funds currently hold $20.70 billion in net assets, representing 4.59% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. The significant inflows into these funds support Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan’s theory that ETH will soon witness a demand shock. He stated that this demand will come from the ETFs and corporate treasuries, predicting that they could purchase up to $20 billion of ETH in the next year. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,630, up over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Government Bitcoin Reserves Could Push Price Beyond $1M, Analysts Say

Time Published: 2025-07-25T23:00:00Z

Governments are quietly reshaping the Bitcoin narrative—and it may be the catalyst that sends BTC beyond $1 million. A growing number of nations are adding Bitcoin to their reserves, according to analysts, as sovereign wealth funds and central banks turn to digital assets in the face of inflation, geopolitical risk, and the long-term decline of fiat confidence. From El Salvador’s BTC holdings to speculative reports of Kazakhstan, Bhutan, and even BlackRock-backed ETFs interacting with government channels, the momentum is building. Some macro analysts argue that just 1% of global sovereign reserves moving into Bitcoin could drive the price beyond $1 million. Amid this rising interest, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as a breakout altcoin. Previous rounds sold out instantly as investors rushed to secure their spots, signaling a wave of early-stage demand that mirrors meme coin booms of the past. MAGACOIN FINANCE rounds spark early-mover frenzy In the midst of institutional accumulation and sovereign adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a high-upside opportunity for retail investors. Previous rounds sold out instantly, and analysts are projecting aggressive return potential as MAGA continues to expand utility and build community. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its hybrid positioning: cryptocurrency with viral appeal, but layered with growing functionality and planned listings. The lean supply and anti-dilution model have drawn comparisons to the early-stage couple of top 30 tokens on CoinMarketCap. As momentum builds, strategic entry remains a core focus for those looking to front-run the next altcoin cycle. Sovereign demand reshapes crypto market The shift began subtly. El Salvador became the first nation to make Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, but now other governments are exploring Bitcoin for reserve diversification. Sanctions, inflation, and debt monetization have eroded faith in traditional assets like U.S. Treasuries and euros—prompting smaller economies and wealth funds to explore BTC as a hedge. Financial strategists suggest that reserve diversification into Bitcoin is no longer fringe. With even mainstream banking giants like BlackRock facilitating sovereign access through ETFs, the process is becoming seamless. Analysts note that if global institutions continue this trend, Bitcoin’s supply-demand dynamics could undergo a seismic shift—driving long-term price appreciation beyond current expectations. Conclusion The idea of governments holding Bitcoin is no longer hypothetical—it’s happening. And with each new reserve-level buyer, the long-term price trajectory shifts upward. For institutional and retail investors alike, this changing landscape is creating both macro opportunity and altcoin openings. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one such opening—already generating buzz as its momentum mirrors the conditions that drove past viral success stories.

Title: Tesla misses out on massive Bitcoin gains after selling at $20K
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/tesla-bitcoin-profits-missed-opportunity/
Time Published: 2025-07-25T20:26:53Z

Share this article Tesla could have made billions if it had held onto Bitcoin (BTC) instead of selling the bulk of it when prices crashed in 2022. In early 2021, Tesla acquired 43,200 Bitcoin worth $1.5 billion as part of its treasury diversification strategy, data from BitcoinTreasuries.net shows. Soon after, the company began accepting the asset as payment for its cars, but then suspended the option due to environmental concerns related to Bitcoin mining’s energy usage. In March of that year, Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company made its first Bitcoin sale, offloading 4,320 BTC when Bitcoin was trading above $58,000. Bitcoin reached a high of $61,500 during the 2021 cycle, so Tesla’s initial sale was not entirely unreasonably timed. By the end of June 2022, Tesla had sold another 29,160 BTC, representing 75% of its remaining holdings. At that time, Bitcoin was trading around $20,000 and later dropped to a yearly low of $16,500. However, the second sale was less favorable. It resulted in massive missed gains. Bitcoin has exploded since Wall Street stepped in, with major players like BlackRock, Grayscale, and other fund managers pushing to bring Bitcoin to institutional investors through ETFs. Grayscale’s court victory over the SEC paved the way for the landmark debut of spot Bitcoin funds in the US. Following that, Bitcoin has left the $20,000 level well behind. The digital asset crossed $100,000 last December and extended its rally to $122,000, its latest high. With Bitcoin trading at around $116,300 at the time of reporting, Tesla’s initial holdings would be valued at about $5 billion. The BTC it offloaded would be worth over $3.5 billion now. Tesla now holds 11,509 BTC worth around $1.4 billion. The company has not adjusted its Bitcoin portfolio since its last purchase. Tesla’s auto revenue dropped for the second quarter in a row, and the company missed Wall Street’s projections. The stock plunged 8% on Thursday before bouncing back 3.5% on Friday. It’s still down more than 21% so far this year, per Yahoo Finance. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, which trades under the ETHA ticker, just became the third-fastest ETF to reach $10 billion. It reached the milestone in 251 days. And was beat by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund—which did it in 34 days and 53 days, respectively. There was much hand wringing and head scratching on Wall Street when the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in July 2024 didn’t get the kind of reaction as Bitcoin ETFS did in January 2024. We’re talking $1 billion in trading volume for ETH funds’ debut vs. $4.5 billion for Bitcoin. But investors don’t seem worried or confused now. Looking ahead, there’s reason to believe the growth of crypto ETFs could accelerate even more. Analysts recently told Decrypt that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers are likely to get the nod from the SEC to offer in-kind redemption and creation of shares. That would mean shares could be purchased with BTC or ETH—whichever happens to be the underlying asset—and that investors could receive BTC or ETH when they redeem their shares. The feature is popular with investors, but regulators are concerned the process is complex and could pose security concerns in crypto-based funds. Bitcoin glutton Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) is back in the market raising cash to buy even more Bitcoin—this time with a new preferred stock offering that could add another $2.5 billion to its war chest. At the time of writing, Strategy’s 607,770 Bitcoin is currently worth $70.6 billion with a 1,519.17% in unrealized profit after adding another $739.8 million to its holdings on Monday. The company initially said it would raise $500 million with its new Stretch preferred stock offering, selling 5 million shares at $100 a pop. Then news got out (initially reported by Bloomberg) that the company would expand its offering to $2 billion. When the SEC filing finally hit EDGAR on Friday, it became clear the company intends to raise closer to $2.5 billion with its new Stretch preferred stock offering. Meanwhile, there’s a new class‑action lawsuit brewing over how Strategy amended terms for its Strike preferred stock offering. The company acknowledged in a July 21 filing that a plaintiff has filed a class action lawsuit alleging that holders of MSTR common stock ought to have been given a chance to vote on a July 7 amendment made to the Strike offering. Speaking of class action lawsuits: The July 15 deadline has passed for a judge to choose a lead plaintiff in the other Strategy class action lawsuit over statements made by executives about the risks involved in its Bitcoin treasury. Issuing debt to buy Bitcoin hits different when it's a Bitcoin miner. At least that’s what can be deduced from the way MARA Holdings saw its share price tumble when execs announced an $850 million raise on Wednesday. The stock slipped again on Thursday, when an SEC filing revealed the company upsized its offering to $950 million. The BTC the miner already holds in its treasury—second only to Strategy’s stash—is currently worth $5.8 billion. That puts its Bitcoin holdings nearly even with the company’s intraday market cap, which is $6 billion at the time of writing. But the company isn’t just going to buy Bitcoin with the proceeds of its raise. It wrote in its SEC filing that it plans to use a portion of the new cash for “working capital, strategic acquisitions, expansion of existing assets, and repayment of additional debt and other outstanding obligations.” All told, MARA shares look to be ending the week 12% lower than they started it, having gone from $19.98 per share to $17.15 at the time of writing. But Compass Point analysts see the dip as a minor issue. Early Friday, Compass Point analyst Ed Engel upgraded MARA from Sell to Neutral and nearly doubled his price target from $9.50 to $18. But he did caution in a note shared with Decrypt that the investors should expect to see some “pullback during seasonally weak August.” The upgrade is largely driven by Bitcoin’s recent performance, he added—but that’s not all. “While most miners are transitioning to HPC,” he wrote, referring to high-performance computing, “MARA seems committed to its HODL strategy that prioritizes ATM and convertible debt sales over selling BTC.” He also noted that while the company has increasingly used its BTC holdings in yield-generating strategies—approximately 15%, by Engel's count—”MARA has yet to disclose any ROI.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: XRP As The World’s Leading Bridge Currency — German VC CEO Outlines The Possibilities

Time Published: 2025-07-25T19:30:53Z

XRP’s potential role as the world’s leading bridge currency is now in the spotlight following remarks from a prominent European venture capitalist. Oliver Michel, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Germany-based Tokentus Investment AG, has expressed strong confidence in the ability of crypto payment company, Ripple, to underpin the global financial system as central banks race to launch digital currencies. In a video interview shared on X social media by crypto analyst JackTheRippler, Michel shed light on Ripple’s strategic role in the evolving global finance system. He primarily discussed how Ripple could establish XRP as a World Reserve Bridge currency. Designed to facilitate fast, low-cost cross-border payments, XRP has long been positioned as a neutral settlement asset capable of linking various fiat and digital currencies. Michel argues that as central banks accelerate efforts to implement Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) amid increasing urgency to stabilize economic systems, the world may have no choice but to rely on existing blockchain infrastructures like Ripple. He further emphasized that the pressure to act swiftly in the face of surging financial instability could push governments and institutions to adopt ready-made solutions, instead of investing time and resources into developing alternatives from the ground up. Currently, Ripple offers the necessary framework to facilitate seamless cross-border settlements and interoperability between diverse national currencies through the use of XRP. Michel suggests that when the moment of global financial alignment arrives, Ripple is poised to play a leading role. Its blockchain technology, combined with its partnership across banking and fintech sectors, places it in a favorable position to potentially establish XRP as the world’s bridge currency. This perspective aligns with Ripple’s long-standing ambition to replace SWIFT and serve as a bridge between digital and fiat currencies. As regulatory clarity improves, global adoption increases, and real-world use cases expand, Ripple and XRP are increasingly positioned to take on a pivotal role in global finance—an area that traditional fiat stalwarts have historically dominated. In other news, former BlackRock insider Edward Dowd shared a compelling perspective on how XRP and its ledger are becoming instrumental in the ongoing shift toward tokenized finance, particularly in the realm of hard assets like gold. During a podcast with Black Swan Capitalist, Versan Aljarrah, Dowd highlighted XRP’s growing importance in cross-border settlement infrastructure, acknowledging the altcoin’s assumed title as the “bankers’ token”. The conversation centered on whether there is a strategic roadmap for tokenizing hard assets with digital networks using technologies like XRP. Dowd responded affirmatively, citing the broader movement to tokenize everything. Notably, real-world assets like gold are natural candidates for tokenization due to their universal acceptance and tangible backing. XRP, with its established cross-border payment capabilities and real-time liquidity features, is uniquely positioned to support this development. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Chalom, who helped launch BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, led the financial giant’s strategy on digital assets as the managing director and head of strategic ecosystem partnerships. “After 20 years at BlackRock and helping to lead its digital asset strategy, I’m beginning a new chapter: I’ve joined SharpLink Gaming as co-CEO,” he posted on X. He added that SharpLink is “built on a clear belief: that Ethereum is becoming the foundation of global finance. And I couldn’t agree more.” With Chalom’s addition, current SharpLink CEO Rob Phythian will begin transitioning into the role of president. After 20 years at BlackRock and helping to lead its digital asset strategy, I’m beginning a new chapter: I’ve joined @SharpLinkGaming as Co-CEO. Here’s why. At BlackRock, I helped launch: - IBIT — world’s largest Bitcoin ETP- ETHA — world’s largest Ethereum ETP- BUIDL —… — Joseph Chalom (@joechalom) July 25, 2025 “Few executives in the world have had the kind of impact Joseph has had in unlocking institutional adoption of digital assets, having pioneered BlackRock’s strategic entry into the space,” SharpLink Chairman and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin said in a statement. “His decision to join SharpLink is a resounding validation of our ETH treasury strategy and vision for Ethereum to drive profound, transformative change across the global digital economy.” (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) With Chalom in tow, SharpLink will continue its mission of adding shareholder value long-term, utilizing Ethereum as a productive asset via staking, restaking, and other yield-bearing strategies to do so. The firm, which holds more than 360,000 ETH valued at more than $1.3 billion, acquired nearly 80,000 ETH in the last week as it builds its treasury. It recently detailed plans to raise up to $6 billion via a stock sale, with proceeds intended to fuel more ETH purchases. “We’re building a bridge between institutional capital and Ethereum-native yield, packaged in a single public equity,” posted Chalom. “The asset is ETH, the ticker is SBET.” Shares of SharpLink Gaming are down over 6% today to $21.89, extending its losses to more than 31% in the last 5 days of trading according to Google Finance.

Title: Goldman Sachs hungry for acquisitions — but not for the targets you think

Yes – Goldman Sachs is on the prowl for acquisitions, and it isn’t alone on Wall Street – but they may not be the deals you’ve been reading about. The speculation about Goldman buying Northern Trust (yes, I have been reporting it for years) is, at this point, likely nothing more than that, sources told On The Money. Northern Trust shares are up 20% on the chatter, but its CEO has been dismissive – and so are the people at Goldman, I am told. For one, Goldman CEO David Solomon doesn’t like overpaying, which is exactly what he’d have to do at this point to get Northern Trust to sell. I’ve also been told Goldman’s culture is too weirdly unique for it to combine with another same-sized bank. On that latter note: Solomon also isn’t looking to be the CEO who will cede control to a bigger player. Other deals, however, will happen at Goldman and elsewhere in banking. That’s right: Wall Street is rife with high-level bank merger discussions. They may or may not lead to a transaction, but the talks have officially begun, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The reason is a lighter regulatory approach by the Federal Reserve prodded by the more deal-friendly Trump administration that will allow large to mid-sized banks – stymied for years by post-financial crisis guardrails – to expand. True, you probably won’t see two large “systemically important” banks like Jamie Dimon’s JP Morgan buying up Goldman. But both JPMorgan and Goldman will be able to do significant, albeit smaller deals, my banking sources say. “Because of the Fed’s supervisory relaxation big bank deals are going to happen,” said one financial-service chief executive who asked not to be named. “Everyone is talking.” As I have reported, Solomon knows he needs to grow his smallish, but powerful investment house. Its market cap is $221 billion compared to more than $830 billion at JPMorgan. It could use heft and scale if it wants to remain relevant well into the future. One possible target for Goldman: State Street Corp., a mid-sized bank with around $30 billion in market value. It’s digestible and it is strong where many of the bigger players would like to be, like custodian services and various types of investment services (A State Street spokesman had no immediate comment). Another potential target for Goldman: the mid-sized BNY, formerly known as Bank of New York Mellon. Both companies have already announced a joint venture to offer “tokenized” money market funds, a precursor to a true merger later. People close to Goldman tell me a more immediate deal could be in the private credit or non-bank lenders space. BlackRock dived head first into private credit, snapping up HPS Investment Partners in 2024. CEO Larry Fink sees private credit booming and will soon offer retail investors products where they can get such exposure in their 401(k)s. A Goldman spokesman had no comment. A BNY rep declined comment. Meanwhile, Citigroup, after years of turmoil following its near demise during the 2008 financial crisis, is ripe to do a deal. Finally, its balance sheet has improved enough to give the Fed some assurance it has the capital to digest dealmaking. Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. CEO Jane Fraser is impressing investors with her turnaround of the nation’s third largest bank (based on assets) and she now has the resources to combine with possibly a European bank that could enhance Citi’s strong point, which has always been its international footprint. (A Citi rep also declined to comment.) The giant Swiss bank UBS is also said to be on the prowl for US bank assets, On The Money has learned. This comes after its 2024 forced merger of the beleaguered Credit Suisse that Swiss banking regulators believed was needed to prevent a collapse of CS. “UBS is very aggressive to do a US deal to reduce its Swiss exposure,” my CEO source said. A UBS rep had no immediate comment. This is far from an exhaustive list and combos are all subject to change. But deal-making is in the air. Advertisement

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network An aerial view shows the Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, as U.S. President Donald Trump plans to regain control of the Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun HONG KONG, July 25 (Reuters) – CK Hutchison’s plan to sell most of its $22.8 billion ports business is unlikely to be finalized anytime soon, with political brinkmanship set to continue, and sources saying that a Sunday deadline for exclusive talks was likely to be extended. The Hong Kong conglomerate’s plan to sell the business, which would include two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run shipping company MSC, has become politicized amid an escalating China-U.S. trade war. Negotiations for the deal, which covers 43 ports in 23 countries, are on an exclusive basis between CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, and the consortium for 145 days until Sunday, as per the terms announced in March. The deal talks, however, are unlikely to collapse if the two parties do not ink a pact by Sunday, with three people close to the ports-to-telecoms conglomerate saying the parties could extend the deadline to continue exclusive negotiations. The first part of the deal – definitive documentation to sell two port operations near the Panama Canal – was also not signed by an April 2 deadline set in the sales announcement. The people declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. BlackRock declined to comment. CK Hutchison and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, which CK Hutchison said in May was the main investor in the consortium, did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. President Donald Trump hailed the deal as “reclaiming” the Panama Canal, after his administration previously called for the removal of what it said was Chinese ownership of the ports near the canal. But in April, China’s top market regulator said that it was paying close attention to CK Hutchison’s planned sale and that parties to the deal should not try to avoid an antitrust review. Beijing’s stance on the planned deal was made public after pro-China media launched a stinging criticism, saying China had significant national interests in the transaction and it would be a betrayal of the country. “I think at this moment it’s not very optimistic that they can directly sell the ports to the consortium,” said Jackson Chan, global fixed income senior manager at FSMOne Hong Kong, which has clients holding CK Hutchison bonds. “The market has already digested the news, even if it announces next week that it won’t sell anymore, I don’t think it’ll be a shock because the market understands it wouldn’t have a large impact on its operations.” CK Hutchison shares, which jumped 33% the following two days after the deal was announced in early March, erased all of the gains by mid-April. But since then it regained lost ground along with the rise in the broader Hong Kong market index. The outlook for the deal has been clouded further in recent days, with a separate source telling Reuters that Chinese ports operator China Cosco Shipping Corp (COSCO) was also looking to join the consortium to buy the ports business. COSCO is requesting veto rights or equivalent power in the entity that will take over 43 ports from CK Hutchison, Bloomberg News reported this week, citing people familiar with the matter. COSCO did not respond to a request for comment. The existing consortium would likely allow COSCO into the deal, said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. “The bigger risk to the deal being consummated, in my opinion, is likely the Trump administration, which is likely to block a deal that would include China,” said the New Jersey-based analyst who tracks BlackRock. Ballingal Investment Advisors strategist David Blennerhassett, who publishes on the independent online research platform Smartkarma, said the addition of COSCO in the consortium was likely to enrage Trump. “Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, would be incandescent,” he said.

Title: BlackRock’s $10B Ethereum ETF Surge Propels Snorter Token to New Heights
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-10b-ethereum-etf-propels-snorter-token/
Time Published: 2025-07-25T12:49:34Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) just hit a whopping $10B in assets in only 251 days, making it the third-fastest ETF to hit that milestone. Such a surge signals massive institutional interest in Ethereum, fueled by price gains, US regulatory clarity, and growing stablecoin adoption. It also drives fresh demand for all projects building on the Ethereum network, including high-utility ERC-20 tokens like Snorter Token ($SNORT). The rise in BlackRock’s ETHA is happening in tandem with a dramatic rally in $ETH’s price. Just days ago, it hit $3.7K, a price not reached since January 2025. It’s now valued at just over $3.6K, up by nearly double compared to just last month. While the relationship between ETF inflows and $ETH’s price movement is complex, Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas says that ‘They feed off each other, but it’s not one for one. It’s a chicken or egg question.’ And Ethereum ETFs are taking off. Between July 7 and July 24, 2025, US-listed Ethereum ETFs saw a total of $9.9B in net inflows, according to Farside Investors. The surge was driven by strong demand for low-fee offerings from BlackRock and Fidelity, which generated $8.9B and $2.3B, respectively. The broader environment is also boosting interest in $ETH, with the passing of the stablecoin bill (GENIUS Act) significantly boosting Web3’s overall outlook. Ethereum stands to benefit the most. This is because it dominates all other networks when it comes to stablecoin activity, and with a whopping $80.958B total value locked (TVL), it holds 59.65% of the total market share. It’s supported by a massive $131.42B stablecoin market cap and $USDT (an Ethereum-based stablecoin pegged to the US dollar), which makes up 50.96% of the market. In comparison, Solana – the second-largest – has $9.739B in TVL, highlighting that no other network come close to Ethereum’s usage, engagement, and financial throughput. As institutional capital flows into $ETH and Ethereum continues to lead in TVL, stablecoin dominance, and on-chain activity, the demand for tools that simplify and speed up on-chain trading is bound to explode. This is precisely the moment that $SNORT’s Telegram trading assistant – Snorter Bot – was built for. Imagine being able to trade, snipe, and manage $ETH among other tokens directly on the world’s fourth-largest messaging app with no browser or extensions needed. Well, that’s precisely what Snorter Bot promises to deliver in Q3 2025. Once live, you’ll be able to buy and sell tokens instantly, set stop-losses, track portfolio performance, and mirror trades in one user-friendly interface. Built for speed and cost-efficiency, it aims to outperform competitors with the fastest execution on Solana and ultra-low fees of just 0.85% for token holders. This percentage is significantly lower than bots like Maestro, BonkBot, and Trojan, which typically charge 1% or more. Initially, it’ll launch on Solana, with integration on Ethereum and BNB Chain already in the final stages of development. Then, it’ll expand to other EVM-compatible chains – including Polygon and Base – as part of its ongoing, ambitious roadmap. And it will all be achieved while maintaining top-tier security. Snorter Bot is being built with a private RPC infrastructure, MEV protection, and scam-detection tools, including honeypot and rug pull filters. Such security protocols have never been more critical. Rug pulls alone made up 68% of all crypto-related scams in Q1 2025. $SNORT is the gateway to maximizing the ecosystem’s benefits. It removes sniping limits, offers access to advanced analytics and tools, and will grant voting rights in its upcoming DAO. It’s staking friendly, too. After buying the coin, you can stake it at a sizable 173% APY. The sooner you do so, the more you’ll earn, as this rate will drop as more users enter the pool. It’s no wonder that $SNORT has already surpassed $2.3M on presale, backed by major whale investors who have contributed $40K, $10.8K, and $10K. BlackRock’s $10B Ethereum ETF shows just how strong institutional interest in Ethereum has become. As $ETH continues to skyrocket and Ethereum network activity surges, the desire for fast and secure trading tools is rising just as quickly. This is precisely where Snorter Bot comes into its own. Not only will it track $ETH’s future trajectory in real-time, but also other major coins. By doing so, it’ll give you a leg up in the trading arena while the market continues to boom.

Title: Washington and Beijing’s Mexican Standoff

As Trump’s bumbling threats continue to alienate the US in Latin America, China is increasingly determined to hold its ground in the US’ so-called “backyard”. Just over a week ago, the embassies of the world’s two apex economic superpowers, the US and China, clashed in Mexico. The spark was a speech given by US Ambassador (and former CIA agent and Green Beret) Ronald Johnson at a gathering of a gala dinner of the American Society of Mexico (AMSOC) sponsored by the billionaire tycoon Ricardo Salinas Pliego, who is seeking to position himself as a populist Milei-type figure in Mexican politics. In what can only be described as a severe case of projection, Johnson accused “countries like China of trying to impose their financial control and greater economic and supply chain dependence on some places in our own Western Hemisphere”. The words represented the latest escalation in the battle for economic power and influence in Latin America between the US and China. It is a battle that the US is handily losing, as we have reported for the past four years and as even the FT conceded last year. China is already South America’s largest trade partner. As Reuters reported in 2022, if you take Mexico’s huge trade partnership with the US out of the equation, which Trump seems determined to torpedo, China has already overtaken the US as Latin America’s largest trade partner. Even a fanatically US-aligned government like Milei’s is strengthening its ties with China, much to Washington’s chagrin, while the Petro government of traditional US vassal state Colombia has joined the BRICS bank and is talking about cancelling its NATO global partnership due to the military alliance’s support of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Colombia’s🇨🇴 President Gustavo Petro says Colombia will LEAVE partnership with NATO over the Gaza genocide: ‘How can we stand with armies that drop bombs on children? Those armies are not armies of freedom, those are armies of darkness. We have to leave, there’s no other way.’ pic.twitter.com/yZyTX1G0un — Going Underground (@GUnderground_TV) July 17, 2025 As is becoming increasingly clear, China is determined to hold its ground in the US’ so-called “backyard”. As the American Quarterly notes, the recent China-CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) summit underscored the striking contrast between the two countries’ approaches: Xi Jinping appears to be aligning more closely than ever with the region as the Trump administration pushes an agenda focused on migration, tariffs, and even expansionist ambitions… By announcing a $9 billion yuan-denominated credit line and fresh infrastructure investment for the region, Xi not only reasserted China’s role as a development financier but also positioned the yuan as an alternative to the dollar-dominated monetary logic—a strategy aligned with the country’s long-term efforts to internationalize its currency. “There are no winners in tariff wars or trade wars. Bullying or hegemonism only leads to self-isolation,” Xi said in his inaugural speech. In September last year, Beijing urged the US to give up the antiquated Monroe Doctrine as Washington intensified its meddling in Mexico, Venezuela and Honduras. The Chinese government also continues to block a corporate deal that would transfer ownership of more than 40 sea ports, including two crucial terminals on the Panama canal, to a Western BlackRock-led consortium, again much to the chagrin of Washington. Now, Mexico finds itself on the frontlines of this escalating tussle between the world’s two apex economic superpowers. In response to Ambassador Johnson’s remarks, the Chinese embassy in Mexico posted a tweet accusing the US of spreading “lies full of ideological prejudices and cold war thinking”: The “theory of China’s threat”, hysterically propagated by the United States, is nothing more than an excuse to maintain its own hegemony. From imposing arbitrary restrictions and erecting commercial barriers, to mistreating foreign immigrants and trafficking in illegal weapons, as well as inventing false positions to sanction financial institutions from other countries, a country like the United States is shamelessly killing the region of the Western Hemisphere. The United States seeks everywhere and in every way to set traps and attach labels to China, forgetting that it is [the US itself] that constitutes the true regional destabilizer, economic-commercial threat and saboteur of development. Justice lives in the hearts of the people, the United States’ defamation of China is destined to fail. It would be advisable for the Ambassador of the United States in Mexico to dedicate more energy to promoting friendship with the country in which he believes, instead of inventing things out of nothing and confusing white with black, to avoid a total loss of credibility. US Losing Credibility So far, the tweet has had almost half a million views. One point it raises that is undeniable is that the US is rapidly losing credibility in Mexico. With his unilateral aggressions against the country, Trump has already caused a dramatic a shift in public opinion… towards China. One recent Pew Research survey found that 45% of Mexicans consider China to be the largest economy in the world, up from 33% two years ago. Crucially, 45% of respondents said they want the relationship with China to be prioritised over that of the United States while 44% would prefer relations with the US to be prioritised. This places Mexico among the most polarised countries on the issue of US/China relations. Interestingly, Mexico was one of only five of the 24 (Western or Western-aligned) countries surveyed by Pew Research that wanted its government to prioritise relations with China, albeit by a wafer-thin margin. Perhaps most importantly, more than two-thirds of Mexican respondents (68%) considered the United States to be the greatest threat to the country, compared to 5% for China. That is well above the levels of distrust for the US registered among Indonesians (40 percent vs. 19 percent), South Africans (35 percent vs. 13 percent), Turks (30 percent vs. 2 percent), Brazilians (29 percent vs. 15 percent) and Argentines (24 percent vs. 13 percent). This last result is perhaps unsurprising given that members of the Trump administration have been debating to what extent, not whether, the US should “invade” Mexico, and have been issuing threats on a more or less constant basis. That this is intensifying anti-US sentiment in a country that has already suffered at least 10 military interventions from its northern neighbour in its 204 years of independence from Spain is hardly surprising. There is a clear shift in public opinion taking place in Mexico, and it is one that is likely to intensify as long as Trump continues to treat the country as his piñata. Here is a quick recap of some of the provocative threats and actions the Trump administration has launched against Mexico, the US’ largest trade partner, over the past eight months: As El País notes, one of the main reasons why Trump is constantly attacking the US’ North American trade partners, Mexico and Canada, is to gain leverage in the coming renegotiation of the USMCA. Sheinbaum’s position since Trump’s trade war began has been to preserve the USMCA; however, the neighbouring country to the North and main buyer of Mexican exports, advocates a “renegotiation” of the trade agreement. “President Trump is definitely going to renegotiate the USMCA, but that will be within a year. He wants to protect American jobs, he doesn’t want cars to be made in Canada or Mexico when they could be manufactured in Michigan and Ohio,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this weekend in local media. The problem for Mexico is that a renegotiated USMCA deal is likely to be even more prejudicial than the current one, especially if Trump carries through on his threat to close down automotive plants in Mexico and Canada. Then there’s the simple fact that the US’ word means nada. Trump may end up signing a new deal only to violate it or renege on it days later. The constant threats of intervention will also no doubt continue, and may even be acted upon. China: A Realistic Alternative? In other words, the world’s largest trade partnership will almost certainly continue to sour as Mexico’s deeply asymmetrical relationship with its biggest trade partner becomes more and more abusive. An early example of blowback from Trump’s tariffs and remittance tax was a 10% fall in Coca Cola’s sales volumes in Mexico, one of its most important markets in the second quarter. As readers may recall, Coca Cola was the target of a consumer boycott in the early days of Trump 2.0. But does China represent an economic alternative? The current answer is: definitely not. Although trade between the two countries has ballooned in recent years, it is almost all going in one direction: from China to Mexico, and in many cases onwards to the US. In 2024, Mexico’s exports to China represented just 1.5% of its total exports while its imports from China represented just over 20% of the total. Contrast that with Mexico-US trade: Mexico’s exports to the US last year represented 83% of all its exports while its imports represented just over 40% of the total. Which begs the question: given the vast gulf between their respective trade volumes, why is the US even worried about Mexico-China relations? The answer is simple: it is the trend that matters. As Enrique Dussel, the director of the UNAM’s Center for China-Mexico Studies (Cechimex), explains to El País, Mexico’s trade with China increased from 1% of the total in 2000 to 11% China in 2022, while its trade with the US fell from 81% of the total to 62% in the same period, mainly due to the rise in Mexican imports of Chinese goods: This U.S. is Mexico’s first trade partner with a downward trend, China is the second with an upward trend. What is happening in Mexico is also happening in Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Chile: the productive apparatus is replacing imports that were historically American with Chinese ones. The products affected include electronics, auto parts, telecommunications and automotive. It is not a one-to-one correspondence, but there is a strong association of substitution through imports. Within this reality, the trilateral relationship between China, Mexico and the US is unique, as we noted in a post last September, just two months before Trump’s re-election: The US and Mexico share the world’s most frequently crossed border and after 30 years of NAFTA and USMCA, their economies are tightly coupled. China and Mexico are not just trade partners but direct competitors vying for the custom of the world’s largest consumer market, which is trying to wean itself off Chinese products. Mexico has so far emerged as the largest beneficiary of the US’ nearshoring strategy, but the more it exports to the US, the more it needs to import from China. And that is the last thing the US wants. Over the past year, the US has escalated its war of words against both China and Mexico over the illicit fentanyl trade that is killing tens of thousands of US citizens a year. But as AMLO [and now Sheinbaum have] repeatedly argued, the US government has spectacularly failed to address the root causes of drug addiction within its borders. Instead, some US lawmakers and pundits have proposed using military force on Mexico’s sovereign territory, with or without Mexico’s permission, to combat drug cartels. That was the situation before Trump’s arrival. The situation today is far worse. On the one hand, Trump 2.0 is intent on undoing many of the nearshoring processes Trump 1.0 unleashed by targeting China with tariffs. On the other hand, Mexico is arguably as dependent as ever on the US even though its trade with the US as a proportion of the total has fallen somewhat. Mexico sources around half its food from the US and more than 70% of its natural gas. Mexico’s sheer level of dependence on the US — no comparably sized economy in the world sends more than 80% of its exports to one destination — and the constant threats of military or financial intervention emanating Washington, Mexico suffers from a structural vulnerability that limits the sovereign capacity of the Mexican State to make long-term strategic decisions. The Mexican economist Mario Campa notes that one of the two main stumbling blocks preventing closer ties between Mexico and China is the huge — and growing — trade deficit between the two countries, which he claims could be somewhat rectified through trade negotiations. The other, of course, is Washington. Regardless of who occupies the White House, the US government and its myriad agencies will not look kindly upon Mexico further deepening its trade relations with China, or the BRICS as a whole. But what alternative will Mexico have? To stay trapped in an increasingly dysfunctional relationship with a country whose government keeps threatening to invade? While many of the relative benefits of USMCA are whittled away next year by Trump’s protectionist demands? The Sheinbaum government’s response so far has been to launch Plan Mexico, an ambitious national industrial policy whose main objective is to reposition Mexico as a global hub for advanced manufacturing, technological innovation, attracting foreign direct investment and relocating production chains, with an emphasis on key sectors such as automotive, electronics, aerospace, pharmaceuticals and information technologies. The question is: whose market(s) will it serve if the USMCA unravels? For geographic reasons and given the unparalleled size of its consumer market, the US makes the most sense. Even without a North American trade deal and with Trump’s tariffs, the US will struggle to find a cheaper, more reliable manufacturing hub literally on its doorstep. Meanwhile, China is at the core of the Asia-Pacific region, which has been the main engine of global economic growth so far in the twenty-first century. If it can, Mexico should expand its exposure to that region. One way of doing that will be by completing the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (CIIT), which could help establish Mexico as a global logistics hub. This huge infrastructure project is scheduled to be fully operational in the first half of next year. Once completed, it will link up four key ports — Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Dos Bocas, Tabasco, and Puerto Chiapas — via 1,200 kms of railway lines, integrating 10 industrial and development poles. CIIT is arguably Mexico’s most ambitious infrastructure project of this still rather young century and its timing could not be better, coming as the Panama Canal’s logistics remain at the mercy of the weather and climate. There is also the ongoing tussle between the US and China over who owns the company operating the two ports at each end of the canal, which recently escalated into a war of words between the US and Chinese embassies in Panama. As I noted in my article last week on Trump’s tomato tariffs, if there’s one thing that can push Mexico closer to the BRICS, and by extension China, it is Trump himself. Without his constant bullying, Mexico may not have agreed to participate in the recent BRICS summit, for the first time ever. Mexico and founding BRICS member Brazil, Latin America’s two largest economies, are now fast-tracking negotiations for an expanded trade agreement as both countries brace for hefty US tariffs, set to take effect on August 1. This would probably not have happened, at least not this quickly, if it weren’t for Trump’s accidental matchmaking. Also this week, a Department of Homeland Security official warned that Mexican drug cartels could soon deploy weaponised drones at the border. I maybe wrong but i think these people will be CIA assets to escalate the situation Mexico is not in a good place but I do not see them having much choice than to start re-orientating their market away from the US and more to China and the BRICS to balance out trade more. And the reason is simple. Trump. As he is going to be President for the next three and a half years Mexico has to think about what that will mean for Mexican – US relations between now and 2028. And the truth of the matter is that Trump will keep on coming back to Mexico again and again so long as he thinks that there is money and concessions on the table to be had. And on any single day Trump could wake up and decide to put 50% tariffs on Mexico unless they changed a law or maybe their constitution or freed some prisoner or maybe even halt construction of the CIIT as it being unfair to American commerce or something. If it has the ability to compete with the Panama Canal then absolutely he will target it. And maybe there will be some US strike in Mexico on a suspected Cartel house or something. It would be crazy reckless but as the Neocons are running his government right now, it may only be a matter of time. Tough times for Mexico ahead. Turn’s out that Trump and Co are fools after all. If there was any hope left that Trump was “crazy like a fox”, it’s long since gone. If Trump and Co had any brains, they should have realised that in a post-globalised world, the highly integrated economies of the three big North American economies Canada, USA, and Mexico are the future for any hope of a MAGA future. But as befits halfwits and semi educated morons, they miss the bigger picture and at the same time they alienate their closest neighbours and most strategic allies. Trump is a real estate developer way out of his depth whose ideas of “negotiation” owe more to thuggery than any geo strategic and economic insight. Do you know why soccer isn’t as popular as baseball in the United States? It’s because they always score own goals! It’s because you can’t put many commercial breaks in a continuous gameplay. “Mexico is not in a good place…” I’m not so so sure, the economy is booming, the MxPeso is soaring, and. at least in this town and state (Querétaro) there is an amazing level of confidence and optimism and calm. It is somewhat inexplicable to me, but there you have it: Mexicans are tough and this is not their first rodeo. Big difference between here and Canada, which is angry and defiant, but cowering. Maybe it is explained by Mexico’s level of industrialization: they actually make things here. Thanks, Don, you raise a key point. Mexico actually makes things, and Queretero is right at the beating heart of its ongoing transformation. Maybe, just maybe, Plan Mexico could work, especially if the country is able to continue diversifying its economy away from the US. Forging closer trade ties with Brazil should help in that regard.

Ethereum's market cap representation in ETFs jumps to 5%, signaling its status as a prime investment. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are recording a remarkable surge in investor interest, consistently outperforming their Bitcoin counterparts throughout the past week. SoSo Value data shows that spot ETH ETFs attracted $231.23 million in new capital on July 24, edging past the $226.61 million net inflows recorded by spot Bitcoin ETFs. When the timeline is extended to the past six trading days, spot ETH ETFs have received nearly $2.4 billion in net inflows, almost triple the $827.6 million logged by Bitcoin ETFs in the same period. This trend reflects a broader shift in institutional investor sentiment, with attention moving increasingly toward Ethereum-based products. Speaking on the milestone, crypto analyst Bec said: “This is the first time in ETF history that Ethereum has consistently outperformed Bitcoin in daily inflows across multiple trading sessions. It’s clear ETH is officially regarded as a institutional grade asset.” The inflow momentum has propelled Ethereum ETF holdings to new record heights. In July 2025 alone, ETH ETFs have absorbed more than $4.4 billion in inflows, exceeding the total inflows from the entire previous 12-month period, which stood at $4.2 billion. As a result, the total amount of ETH held by ETFs has jumped by nearly 50% in just two months, rising from 3.5 million ETH on May 1 to 5.6 million ETH as of July 24, according to data from the Strategic ETH Reserve. Their holdings now represent roughly 5% of ETH’s market capitalization. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has played a critical role in this run. Since July 1, ETHA has added over 1 million ETH to its portfolio, growing its holdings to 2.8 million ETH, valued at approximately $10.22 billion. This rapid accumulation helped ETHA become the third-fastest ETF in history to hit $10 billion in assets under management. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the speed of ETHA’s growth, noting it went from $5 billion to $10 billion in just 10 days, which is “the ETF equivalent of a God candle.” Despite the funds’ strong performance, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan believes Ethereum is still underrepresented in ETF portfolios. According to Hougan, investors would need to allocate an additional $7–8 billion to bring ETH exposure in line with market weight, assuming Bitcoin ETF flows remain flat.

Title: BlackRock’s ETH ETF hits $10B milestone in record time! – Details

There was a spike in profit-taking, but ETH’s speculative froth was not dangerously elevated yet. BlackRock ETH ETF, ETHA, hit $10 billion, making it the third-fastest growing product to hit the milestone after two spot BTC ETFs. Will ETH push higher or cool off? U.S. spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have been on a tear recently. In particular, BlackRock’s ETH ETF, ETHA, saw massive inflows and hit $10 billion milestone in assets under management (AUM). This feat has even rivaled some traditional products, noted Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, adding that, “$ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after two Bitcoin ETFs $IBIT & $FBTC.” Source: X BlackRock’s and Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETFs were the 1st and 2nd to hit the milestone, followed by ETHA. But ETHA’s inflows streak was unique in one aspect; it doubled from $5 billion AUM to $10 billion in the past two weeks of trading, a move Balchunas called a ‘God candle.’ The spot ETH ETF products have seen positive inflows for 11 weeks straight. On the 24th of July, they saw a daily net inflow of $231 million, setting the 15th consecutive day of net inflows. Source: Soso Value Notably, the renewed surge in daily net inflows from early July rallied ETH from $2.4K to $3.8K, posting a 45% monthly gain. But the rally, also backed by massive demand from ETH treasury firms, has attracted significant selling. In fact, mid-July saw ETH profit-taking hit $1.4 billion per day on average, mirroring the levels seen during past local peaks in 2024. Source: Glassnode At press time, ETH traded at $3.6K, down 6% from the recent high of $3.8K amid a sharp BTC drop to $115K. This could be a healthy retreat before taking a stab at $4K since the Open Interest was at record highs of $57 billion, underscoring high speculative interest and liquidation risk. Source: CryptoQuant Even so, the speculative market was still ‘neutral’ as there was no extreme retail FOMO on the Futures market, per CryptoQuant data. This further suggested that ETH could still have room for growth before topping out or hitting a local top. Even so, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen warned that ETH may need to cool off, citing the overbought condition of ETH’s daily RSI. “ETH Daily RSI rejected at around 88. I would not suggest using RSI to identify when larger trends are over, but it can be good for sometimes guessing when the market needs to cool off.” Source: X Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

CK Hutchison's $22.8 billion ports business sale to a BlackRock-led consortium faces delays amid political tensions and regulatory scrutiny. The deal, encompassing 43 ports including those near the Panama Canal, is complicated by China-U.S. trade war dynamics and potential antitrust concerns. While the exclusive negotiation deadline may extend, the addition of COSCO to the consortium could further inflame U.S. opposition.

ETHA needed just 251 days to reach this threshold, less time than all but the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fundspot Bitcoin funds, which needed just 34 days and 53 days, respectively. The fund doubled in size over 10 days ending Wednesday, adding $5 billion in assets to become the shortest period ever for a fund to grow from that mark to $10 billion, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt. "That five to $10 billion move, most of that's the price, although the flows were really robust too," Balchunas said. "So it was a nice combination of both. But I don't think I've ever seen an ETF grow that quickly. "This is very weird stuff," he added. The inflow surge has been closely intertwined with a dramatic spike in the asset, which on Monday approached $3,850, its highest point since December. It is currently trading about 3.5% below that at $3,710, according to CoinGecko data. Analysts have attributed the increase, along with the rise of ETH treasuries, to growing interest in the funds, although Balchunas said the cause and effect was unclear. "Flows in the price are like tangoing," he said. "I don't think the flows make the price go up. I don't think the price makes the flows go up 100%. They feed off each other, but it's not one for one. It's a chicken or egg question." LOOK OUT: $ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after (you guessed it) two bitcoin ETFs $IBIT & $FBTC. Amazingly it went from $5b to $10b in just 10 days (ETF asset equiv of a God candle). Is in Top 5 in flows 1M, 1W.

The legislation is expected to benefit Ethereum, the dominant platform for stablecoin transactions. The nine U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs generated more than $1.1 billion in inflows just over the first three days of this week alone, according to U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. Still, the funds' performance falls well short of the dramatic success of the 12 Bitcoin products that now hold more than $140 billion in AUM, led by IBIT, which now manages more than $70 billion in assets. Those funds have also benefited from the surge in crypto markets and contributed to it. In a text to Decrypt. ETF.com Senior Analyst Sumit Roy wrote that he was surprised at how long it took for ETF investors "to come around," particularly after Bitcoin funds' fast start. "That all changed over the past few weeks as the mania over stablecoins and Ethereum Treasury companies gave the asset a shot in the arm," he wrote. "We'll see if this is the catalyst that finally breaks Ethereum prices out of their trading range—it may or may not be," he added. "Regardless, it signals that the demand for Ethereum ETFs has finally arrived."
