If you don’t already know Nordic Elements, Helle Moyna’s shop in the village of Blackrock, Co Dublin, you should make the journey, to browse and to be beguiled. The shop has a reputation for high-end furniture but every surface is adorned with smaller potential gifts – ornaments and objects priced to suit every pocket, from €10 wooden spoons to books on design, via mugs and vases. Then there’s lighting and, of course, sofas to sink into. The approach taken to decor in Nordic Elements is reflected in Moyna’s home in nearby Booterstown. She is a fan of Christmas but don’t expect to see any glitter or snowglobes or tinsel in her house. While growing up in Jutland, Denmark, where people would always spend money on their homes, she says, the mantra was: “Buy well, buy less.” “We wouldn’t go out to eat much. We would entertain at home – cosy, nice furniture, nice accessories,” she recalls. The essence of hygge, the calm interior of Moyna’s home is understated, and yet there is something in every corner that draws the eye – from ceramics, collected on holidays, to gifts from a son’s girlfriend. Every object tells a story and all have become the building blocks of a home – one to which you’d relish an invitation. For Moyna, December is a particularly lovely period. To get in to the festive spirit, as she puts it, she has adorned the impressive entrance to her home with “an oversized wreath, with all kinds of foliage – eucalyptus, pinecones, pink and burgundy ribbons”. “It is illuminated by battery-operated lights,” she enthuses. “I get some help from Ruth Monaghan of Appassionata Flowers.” Lights thread through the railings out front too, and a miniature pine tree in a pot at the front door is similarly illuminated. Inside, on the hall return, a miniature tree draws the eye upwards; it and the Christmas trees – yes, trees, plural – are tastefully dressed in white lights. The star is the tree in the main livingroom, the grown-up room, as Moyna calls it; that one is always a real tree, she says. “I never saw a fake tree until I moved to London in my 20s.” It was in the UK capital that Moyna met her husband, David, from Scotstown in Co Monaghan. Her preference for a Christmas tree is Nordmann fir, an evergreen conifer with good symmetry – and “not too wide at the bottom” – which she orders from Kavanagh’s Christmas Farm at Glendarragh in Newtown Mount Kennedy, Co Wicklow. “They know what I want,” she says. “In Denmark we put live candles on trees. The first time my husband saw it he thought we were nuts. My dad is old school – that’s what we do. His tree comes the day before Christmas Eve.” The tree lights are still; no flickering, no colours. Hanging from the closers on all the livingroom’s large sash windows are big brass stars festooned with micro-lights. “It means there’s light in the windows even if we close the shutters.” A silver tray, bought in Lebanon on honeymoon, forms the base to a series of pillar candles, Moynagh’s Advent wreath, where she lights a candle each Sunday in Advent. She listens to music or podcasts as she decorates and enjoys the moment. “Life is busy. We don’t have enough time to potter.” Across the hall, in the family room, her sons, Tobias and Marcus, now 19 and 17 respectively, have always had a tree of their own that they decorate with all their stuff, as she puts it. “They open a huge box, close the door, put on Christmas music and decorate. The first year they did it they were just seven and five and they only decorated one side of the tree. It has loads of colour, although they didn’t decorate it last year as they were in Denmark.” [ How to establish your own interior design styleOpens in new window ] Given her sons’ ages, Moyna wasn’t sure the tradition would continue. But when the “boys” heard she was decorating the house early to give The Irish Times a sneak preview, they went out and got a tree of their own. It is as stylishly presented as their mum’s, with a classic red-and-white colour scheme. The dining table is set into bay windows that overlook the family’s large garden; here, beaded hearts hang from the window closers in the same fashion as the formal livingroom. She spotted the table at the last auction held by Adams in Blackrock; the steel pedestal base was visible but the teak tabletop was hidden from view by about an inch of varnish and a glass covering, as well as many other items for sale. It is relatively low-set, with three different kinds of stemware – “I like to set a mismatched table,” says Moyna. She uses living foliage to create maximum impact – keeping things “fragrant and simple”. Simple, yes, but highly effective – and stylish touches such as curling a long stem of fresh eucalyptus around a scrolled napkin and tying it in a knot are easy to replicate. Instead of putting a big bunch of flowers at the centre of the table, only for it to be moved elsewhere when the time comes to serve dinner, Moyna populates it with single-bud vases containing hyacinth bulbs and a centrepiece candelabra. “It’s about reusing stuff. It’s creative, relaxed and less formal,” she says. You could do something similar by putting short stems into low jars and bottles and tying a ribbon around them to add a flourish of colour. It is decor as an icebreaker. Elsewhere, the house stays as it usually is. This is not a Christmas pyjamas for all the family-type household, she says. She also says no to festive-motif bedding, yuletide towels in the bathrooms or Christmas-themed cushions. What type of Christmas personality does she have? “I really enjoy entertaining at home. I would rather have people over than eat out. I know it’s work but I have developed shortcuts over the years. I really relax cooking. I enjoy it. If I want help, I’ll ask for it.” Introduce art and wonderful scents combined to your home with ceramicist Bela Silva’s fragranced candles for Serax.

He’s an emergency physician and CEO of Starbot. We’re going to talk about the current state of Bitcoin and digital assets. Noah, welcome back to the show. Noah Kaufman: Kevin, thank you. I guess this is our third talk now. Kevin Pho: We have you on every year, and Bitcoin is at a different price every time we talk. Last night was a historic event—it broke $100,000. Before we get into anything, for those who may not be familiar with Bitcoin and digital assets, what does $100,000 for one Bitcoin mean to you? Noah Kaufman: Yeah, you know, it’s a milestone. It’s a stepping stone. It’s hard to talk about something exponential without being hyperbolic, right? On your podcast, we’ve been telling physicians—or, well, I was kind of pounding the table way back in 2019. Just because of the Sharpe ratio and the amazing adoption of this new monetary network, Bitcoin at $100,000 is kind of a stepping stone. When I say it’s hard not to be hyperbolic, I mean that some people are going crazy celebrating, but really, this is ultimately a multimillion-dollar asset. And, you know, we’re just getting started. It’s still extremely early—a very small number of people own Bitcoin or understand what it is. Believe it or not, I think $100,000 is not that big of a deal. It was expected. It was expected when I started buying it at hundreds of dollars, then at $10,000, and now $100,000. And now I expect $1 million, several million, and probably, in the next 20 years, there’s a good chance we’ll get to $10 million. I know that sounds crazy, but it’s hard to understand something exponential, growing by Metcalfe’s Law, that is so novel and so important for humanity. Kevin Pho: Well, tell us, what is Metcalfe’s Law? Noah Kaufman: Sure. Metcalfe’s Law describes the value of networks. For every participant in that network, the value of the network increases exponentially. The larger a network becomes, the more valuable it becomes exponentially. Of course, there’s a mathematical equation and a lot of research behind Metcalfe’s Law, but in a nutshell, that’s the lay version. We see it with Facebook and Amazon. Social networks are valued by the number of users and monetized through advertising or other means. That’s how Facebook makes its money. A monetary network, like the U.S. dollar system, has its value intrinsically tied to the value of each unit. Each participant makes the system more valuable. There’s been no network in history that has reached an inflation-adjusted $100 million market cap and failed. That’s never happened. Right now, we’re at a $2 trillion market cap for Bitcoin. We’re way beyond sustainability. Now there are ETFs, and there’s talk about a strategic Bitcoin reserve. If that happens, things will go crazy. Metcalfe’s Law is part of the reason why the Bitcoin network is so valuable, whether you agree with it or think it’s a scam. The fact of the matter is, all money systems are Ponzi schemes. This is a big legal Ponzi. It’s crazy, but all it takes is belief, political adoption, and legal adoption. We have that now with ETFs. It’s been de-risked. Compared to the last time we talked, the value of the network has gone up substantially because the risk has been taken away. Kevin Pho: So, we started off this year with Bitcoin in the $30,000 range. Now, it has broken $100,000 per Bitcoin. What were some of the triggers that led to its rise this year? Noah Kaufman: Certainly, the adoption of Bitcoin in the ETF world played a huge role. BlackRock—we all know BlackRock is holding hands with the United States government—gave more than a tacit approval of Bitcoin. Once money managers and Wall Street got into Bitcoin, it really changed the game. It takes a long time for pension funds and other large funds to be able to buy Bitcoin. Many of them won’t even buy it until it hits the $100,000 mark—that’s a mandate for a lot of pension funds. There are countless trillions of dollars sitting on the sidelines in debt markets, looking for places to invest. Bitcoin is going to be a recipient of some of that capital—quite a bit of it, actually. This is due to the Sharpe ratio, which measures risk-adjusted returns. Bitcoin has returned 147 percent CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) over the last 14 years. It’s the best-performing asset of all time. It was the most-bought ETF of all time by far, dwarfing gold ETFs. Bitcoin is demonetizing precious metals and taking their place because it’s technologically superior. It’s completely finite, with 21 million Bitcoins scheduled to exist—94 percent of which have already been created. That means only 6 percent of Bitcoins are left to be mined for eternity. Every four years, the number of Bitcoins mined is cut in half. This is an absolutely scarce, inelastic supply running straight into an ever-expanding demand. From the early days, I’ve argued that this is such an asymmetric bet with such a great Sharpe ratio for your portfolio. More return for less risk—that’s what the Sharpe ratio tells you. I’ve said, “Why not put 1 percent of your net worth as a physician into it?” Myself and a bunch of friends started doing that when Bitcoin was $3,000, and now most of us are retired. We work because we want to. I’ve got a ton of Bitcoin, and I feel bad for those listening to White Coat Investor because they’ve been told, “This is horrible. This is bad.” But studies show that putting an asset with a high Sharpe ratio into your portfolio—even at a small percentage—can yield outsized returns for minimal risk. That’s always been the argument. Whether or not you believe in Bitcoin, you need to be agnostic if you want to act as a fiduciary for your family and financial situation. It’s still extremely early. Bitcoin is going to reach $1 million, then multi-millions per coin. I know it’s hard to believe, but this is exponential adoption. If you look at the chart, it’s a parabola. We’re right here, and it’s going up. You can’t think of it like a stock. It’s a new monetary system—an egalitarian one. Kevin Pho: Wrapping back to your earlier point, yes, the ETFs were a trigger. But what about global influences, like El Salvador or the Saudis? How do they play a role? Noah Kaufman: Absolutely. El Salvador adopting Bitcoin was a huge moment. There are also rumors that the Saudis are buying Bitcoin. Just yesterday, Putin made statements that likely pushed it over $100,000. He hinted that Bitcoin is an important world asset, and nobody can control it. Then there’s Trump. For better or worse, as president, he’s now talking about creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and buying a million Bitcoin. If that happens, other countries will think, “Oh no, we better get some Bitcoin.” It’s a self-fulfilling process. This is why it’s crucial to remain agnostic. Bitcoin is a new, uncorrelated asset class. Yes, it’s volatile, but it’s volatile while going straight up, unlike fiat currency. With fiat currency, if you have $1 million today, in five to seven years, it will only have the purchasing power of $500,000. You need to invest to protect your wealth. Even if you invest in the S&P, you face currency risk and inflation. Sure, maybe you made 12 percent CAGR, but after inflation, what’s your real return? It’s like Pascal’s wager: even if you don’t believe in Bitcoin, the smart thing to do is to buy a little, just in case it catches on. Kevin Pho: You mentioned White Coat Investor earlier. For the record, I’m a big fan of White Coat Investor and the work they’ve done to bring physician financial literacy into the mainstream. But not just White Coat Investor—if you read finance articles in the New York Times or Washington Post, they aren’t as enthusiastic as you are. Why do you think that is? Noah Kaufman: First, let me say that White Coat Investor has been a net positive for physicians. I’ve learned a lot from them, and while we’ve had disagreements, I really respect Jim and everything he’s built. That said, I think he got it wrong on Bitcoin. When something is outside the current paradigm, it threatens existing power structures. Most people are conservative and prefer to stay safe within the status quo. Back when we first talked about Bitcoin, there wasn’t an ETF. Regulation from the SEC was a concern, and it was viewed as risky. Now, though, it’s different. Even Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, recently said that Bitcoin isn’t a competitor to the U.S. dollar. It’s a speculative asset and a competitor to gold. I agree—it’s a much better form of gold. If it reaches gold’s market cap, each Bitcoin would be worth $913,000. The opportunity here is to invest in something before everyone else recognizes its value. It’s like buying Amazon, Netflix, or Apple stock in the early 2000s. Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman famously said in the ’90s that the internet would be a passing fad and wouldn’t contribute meaningfully to GDP. Clearly, that was wrong. Investments like these are about seeing value before others do. That’s why I recommend putting a small percentage—1 percent, maybe 5 percent if you’re bold—of your portfolio into Bitcoin. If you lose 5 percent of your portfolio, it’s not the end of the world. But if that 5 percent grows tenfold, it could become a significant portion of your portfolio. Kevin Pho: That makes sense. You’ve touched on how Bitcoin fits into a portfolio and why its Sharpe ratio is attractive. But let’s talk about trust. There were significant losses with platforms like FTX and Voyager. How has that impacted Bitcoin adoption? Noah Kaufman: That’s a great point. The failures of centralized custodians like FTX and Voyager were devastating. I personally lost over 40 Bitcoin on Voyager. It was painful. Luckily, I’ve rebuilt my holdings, but it was a harsh lesson. These losses made one thing clear: self-custody is essential when it comes to Bitcoin. Even with platforms like Coinbase, I wouldn’t fully trust them for long-term storage. The mantra in the Bitcoin world is, “Not your keys, not your coins.” If you don’t hold the private keys to your Bitcoin, you don’t truly own it. That said, while retail adoption has slowed due to these setbacks, institutional adoption has surged. Many retail investors got burned by platforms like Celsius, BlockFi, and FTX, and they’ve been hesitant to come back. It’s a “once bitten, twice shy” situation. However, institutions like Wall Street have been accumulating during this time, taking advantage of the lower prices. Now, Bitcoin is primed for its next big move, and we’re seeing the effects of that. Kevin Pho: With Bitcoin now surpassing $100,000, some may wonder if it’s too late for physicians to invest. What’s your perspective on that? Noah Kaufman: It’s definitely not too late. In fact, it’s still very early. Bitcoin follows mathematically defined cycles, which are volatile by nature. You’ll see 30 percent rises followed by 20 percent drops, or 50 percent gains followed by 10 percent pullbacks. It moves in stair-step patterns. Right now, we’re over $100,000, but it wouldn’t surprise me if Bitcoin dropped to $70,000 in a few weeks. People would then declare, “See? It’s failing; it’s a Ponzi scheme.” But shortly after, it might surge to $180,000. That’s how Bitcoin works. Its supply is extremely inelastic, and its demand keeps growing. Nation-states are buying it. Institutions are buying it. This dynamic creates an upward pressure on price over time. Sure, there will be corrections, but the long-term trajectory is up. For physicians, the idea is to allocate a small, speculative percentage of your net worth—1 to 5 percent—to Bitcoin. It’s not about day trading or trying to time the market. Bitcoin is something you buy and hold for the long term. If you buy now and hold for several years, the potential upside is significant. Kevin Pho: You mentioned earlier that Bitcoin could play a role in private practice or medical group balance sheets. Can you elaborate on that? Noah Kaufman: Absolutely. I consult with private practices and medical groups on this topic. There are ways to structure investments into Bitcoin legally and strategically. For example, instead of distributing 100 percent of profits as bonuses or reinvesting in traditional ways, practices could allocate a small percentage—say 5 percent—of their funds into Bitcoin. Holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet offers several benefits. First, there are favorable tax implications depending on how the investment is structured. Second, it diversifies the group’s financial strategy. Even if Bitcoin’s price remains stable, the potential for outsized returns over time makes it a compelling option. For practices, this is a way to strengthen financial resilience while taking advantage of an emerging asset class. It’s a no-brainer to allocate a small percentage to Bitcoin. Of course, there are legal and accounting considerations, but I help groups navigate those complexities. Kevin Pho: Shifting gears a bit, let’s talk about how financial freedom impacts the physician lifestyle. You’ve mentioned that financial security has changed how you approach medicine. Can you share more about that? Noah Kaufman: Sure. When I started practicing medicine 20 years ago, finances weren’t as much of a concern. Physician salaries felt sufficient, and the administrative burden was lower. Today, it’s a different story. I recently spoke with a couple—a pediatrician and an ophthalmologist—who have $900,000 in student loans at a 7 percent interest rate. That’s crushing. Combine that with rising administrative demands, decreasing reimbursements, and inflation, and many young physicians feel stuck. Financial stress leads to burnout, compassion fatigue, and physician depression. It’s hard to provide great care when you’re overwhelmed by financial pressures. That’s where financial literacy and tools like Bitcoin come in. They empower physicians to take control of their finances, reduce debt, and find a better work-life balance. For me, I now practice medicine because I enjoy it, not because I have to. I work five or six days a month and spend the rest of my time rock climbing, riding motorcycles, or just enjoying life. This balance makes me a better physician and a happier person overall. Kevin Pho: We’re talking to Noah Kaufman, an emergency physician and CEO of Starbot, about the current state of Bitcoin. Noah, as we wrap up, what take-home messages would you like to leave with the KevinMD audience? Noah Kaufman: The most important thing for physicians to understand is that Bitcoin is like Pascal’s wager. Even if you don’t believe in it and think it’s a Ponzi scheme, it still makes sense to allocate 1 to 5 percent of your portfolio to it. Why? Because the risk is asymmetric. If Bitcoin fails, you lose a small amount—no big deal. But if it succeeds and reaches $2 million or $3 million per coin, it could dramatically improve your financial situation. Bitcoin has been de-risked significantly over the past few years. Institutions, nation-states, and pension funds are accumulating it. It’s becoming a mainstream asset. Physicians should consider owning some—not just for financial gain but to combat inflation and secure their financial futures. Kevin, thank you for having me on again. It’s always a pleasure to share my perspective with your audience. Kevin Pho: Noah, as always, thank you so much for sharing your insight and perspective. Thanks again for coming back on the show.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other best affordable stocks to buy. There has been a growing debate regarding whether the economy of the United States will have a soft landing. A recent report by Vanguard titled “Beyond Landing” released on November 25 discusses the economic outlook for the year ahead. The report highlighted that global inflation has significantly decreased over the past two years, nearing the target of 2%. However, this decline has been inconsistent across different regions, with many developed markets experiencing slowdowns due to monetary policy adjustments. The United States stands out as an exception, showcasing robust economic growth and full employment despite restrictive monetary policies. READ ALSO: 10 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready To Explode and 10 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Now. The report raised critical questions about whether the US has achieved a "soft landing" or if high interest rates will eventually lead to a "hard landing." The narrative has largely focused on the Federal Reserve's ability to time rate cuts effectively to facilitate painless disinflation. Vanguard suggests that the strong growth and falling inflation in the US may be better explained by supply-side dynamics, such as increased labor productivity and a surge in available labor, rather than solely by Federal Reserve policies. Regarding the 2025 outlook, the firm anticipates that US real GDP growth may decline from around 3% to closer to 2%, influenced by potential policy risks like trade tariffs and stricter immigration regulations. Core inflation is expected to remain above 2.5% for most of 2025. The firm also predicts that interest rates will stabilize at levels higher than those seen during the 2010s, fostering better returns in cash and fixed-income markets over the next decade. However, they express caution regarding equity markets due to elevated valuations. The report highlights a tension between momentum and valuation in risk assets, suggesting that while some stocks may continue to perform well, their high valuations could pose risks if economic conditions change unexpectedly. A technician testing the latest 5G device, demonstrating the company's commitment to innovation. To compile the list of the 12 best affordable stocks to buy right now, we used the Finviz stock screener, Yahoo Finance, and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we shortlisted stocks trading below a Forward P/E of 15, as of December 4, and that are expected to experience earnings growth this year. Next, we sorted our initial list by market capitalization and cross-checked the Forward P/E of each stock from Seeking Alpha and earnings growth from Yahoo Finance. Lastly, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as per Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Forward P/E Ratio: 14.16 Earnings Growth This Year: 9.52% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a prominent technology company specializing in wireless communication technologies. It designs and manufactures integrated circuits and software for smartphones and smart devices, as well as advanced automotive technologies like automated driving systems. Its competitive edge originates from the numerous patents it holds in wireless technology. The company’s smartphone chipset, the Snapdragon series is one of the most widely used in the industry. Its Snapdragon X75 modem is not only being used to power the new iPhone 16 models but is also the powerhouse of the generative AI-enabled Galaxy series. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 alone, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) generated $33.2 billion in QCT revenue, up 9% year-over-year. Within the QCT segment handset revenue contributed $6.1 billion mainly due to the quick adoption of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. Looking ahead, Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S25 is expected to utilize the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, indicating continued growth for the company. Moreover, other manufacturers such as ASUS, Honor, OnePlus, and OPPO are also launching devices with this chipset. Management anticipates first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenue between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. were the largest detractors. Qualcomm has given back some of its first half gains after the CFO commented at a conference that its entrance into the AI PC business would take time to ramp. We continue to see Qualcomm as well positioned with growth from AI moving into the mobile phone, from new opportunities in the Internet of Things (IoT), and within the Auto industry but will also look to future growth as they enter the PC market.” Overall, QCOM ranks 8th on our list of best affordable stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of QCOM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than QCOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Microsoft Corporation Inc. (MSFT) Dominating A Billionaire Quant’s Investment Strategy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Dominating a Billionaire Quant's Investment Strategy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. AQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998, dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology. Cliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum. Asness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable. AQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility. AQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments. "We let the machine decide more," Asness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition. Our Methodology: Stocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe. A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Position size: $1.73 billion Activity: 5% Microsoft (MSFT) was the #1 position in AQR's portfolio at the end of the first quarter. Here is what we said six months ago: Analysts from Wolfe Research and Barclays believe that Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFT) is well-positioned amid expected market volatility, emphasizing its resilience and investor appeal. MSFT has seen significant share price gains by 30% over the past one year. Following which multiple Wall Street analysts support bullish sentiments in addition to New Street Research that gave the Company a new Buy rating with a $570 price target. The company's strategic integration of AI in its Cloud division has driven impressive growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment. Microsoft's investments in its Search business, Bing, have also generated market share gains. Looking ahead, analysts anticipate continued earnings growth for MSFT, making its current valuation, with a forward P/E ratio of 31, attractive." At the time AQR had $1.67 billion invested in the stock and MSFT shares were trading at $421. MSFT stock only returned 5% since then and it isn't the top position in AQR's portfolio anymore. Overall, AQR owns only 0.05% of MSFT's outstanding shares. This may be a top 3 position for AQR but relatively AQR isn't too bullish on the stock. Overall MSFT ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: What Is Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) The Best Lithium and Battery Stocks to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Lithium and Battery Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other lithium and battery stocks. According to a Reuters report from November 6, automakers are preparing for potential changes under President-elect Donald Trump, including new tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico and the reversal of pro-electric vehicle policies. Trump has indicated plans to rescind EPA and Transportation Department regulations and may reduce or eliminate EV tax incentives. Moreover, the Zero Emission Transportation Association expressed a willingness to collaborate with Trump on future EV development. Trump has also warned of tariffs of up to 200% on Mexican vehicles and is considering similar measures for imports from other regions while encouraging foreign automakers to build plants in the US. Additionally, in October, Reuters reported that the European Union approved additional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, ranging from 7.8% to 35.3%, on top of the existing 10% duty, in response to what it calls unfair subsidies by China. These tariffs, effective October 30, aim to address concerns over subsidized raw materials, batteries, and financing, with China opposing the decision and calling for negotiations to prevent further trade tensions. China has launched its own probes into EU imports, including pork, dairy, and brandy, potentially retaliating against the EU measures. Chinese EVs currently account for 8% of the EU market, a figure expected to grow to 15% by 2025, with their prices typically 20% lower than European counterparts. The investigation has caused division within the EU, with Germany opposing tariffs while France supports them. GlobalData lowered its 2030 U.S. EV market share forecast from 33% to 28%, citing weakened emissions standards and a focus on lower oil prices after the 2024 elections. Bloomberg reported on November 7 that Mark Wakefield of AlixPartners highlighted that $129 billion in EV investments through 2027 and the $7,500 EV tax credit may be at risk. Automakers are expected to cut EV spending, delay new models, and shift production toward hybrids and gasoline vehicles, like Volkswagen’s adaptation at its South Carolina plant. While reversing Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act could prove challenging, changes to fuel economy standards are likely, though their impact may not be felt until later in the decade. The lithium market has experienced a huge decline over the past several quarters due to oversupply and lower demand. However, Ana Cabral, Co-Chair & CEO at Sigma Lithium is positive about the future demand for lithium as discussed in a September interview with CNBC. She noted that lithium prices hit a low point in August but have been recovering steadily. The Chinese recovery package, the largest since COVID, has especially boosted the market, as China accounts for more than half of global EV sales. While the U.S. has seen slower EV adoption compared to China and Europe, with growth in China outpacing the U.S. and Europe, the fundamentals remain strong. As China continues to dominate the EV market, it plays a crucial role in driving demand and lithium prices. Regarding other uses of lithium, Cabral emphasized that EV batteries remain the primary driver, especially as automakers shift away from combustion vehicles, which is expected to create further demand in the coming years. Our Methodology For this article, we used stock screeners to identify around 20 lithium and/or battery stocks and chose the 11 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leading electric vehicle company with key ventures in batteries and solar technology. It plans to invest $3.6 billion in Nevada to build a factory producing 4680 battery cells, essential for the Cybertruck, which requires around 7 GWh of battery capacity annually. Additionally, the company is committing $1 billion to establish a lithium refinery in Texas, designed to sustainably produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide. This facility is expected to support 50 GWh of annual output, improving battery supply and reducing costs. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk seems to have a close relationship with President-Elect Donald Trump which could prove beneficial for the company. Reports suggest that the Trump administration plans to prioritize creating federal regulations for self-driving vehicles. According to a Bloomberg report from November 17, this initiative would focus on easing restrictions through the Department of Transportation, aligning with Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) investments in autonomous technology. Current regulations limit the production and deployment of fully autonomous cars, but potential federal rule changes could support the company’s goals. Elon Musk has voiced support for nationwide policies enabling self-driving vehicle use. Moreover, the market is anticipating that the President-Elect is likely to cancel the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) EV tax credits, which Elon Musk is less worried about. In the company’s Q2 earnings call in July, Colin Langan of Wells Fargo asked Elon Musk about the potential impact on Tesla if the IRA was repealed under a Trump presidency. Langan noted Tesla benefits from EV subsidies and production tax credits for batteries. Musk acknowledged that while losing IRA support would have some negative effects on Tesla, it would be far more damaging to competitors. Musk said: “I guess that there would be like some impact, but I think it would be devastating for our competitors. But — and it would hurt Tesla slightly. But long-term probably actually helps Tesla would be my guess. Yes — but I’ve said this before on earnings calls, it — the value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy. These other things are in the noise relative to autonomy. So I recommend anyone who doesn’t believe that Tesla will solve vehicle autonomy should not hold Tesla stock. They should sell their Tesla stock. You should believe Tesla will solve autonomy, you should buy Tesla stock. And all these other questions are in the noise.” Overall TSLA ranks 1st on our list of the best lithium and battery stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Jay Jacobs, the firm's U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, cites the artificial intelligence boom as a major catalyst. "It's still very early in the AI adoption cycle," he told CNBC's "ETF Edge" this week. According to Jacobs, AI companies need to build out their data centers. Plus, keeping that data safe is also a sound investment play for the new year. "If you think about your data, you want to spend more on cybersecurity as it gets more valuable," he said. "We think this is really going to benefit the cybersecurity [and the] software community which is seeing very rapid revenue growth based off of this AI." Jacobs also sees a wider impact in terms of the supporting infrastructure. "I think what people forget is kind of, magical as technology is, there's real physical things on the ground that run that technology, whether it's power, whether it's data centers and real estate, whether it's chips. It's not just something that lives in the ether, in the cloud, there's real physical things that have to happen, and that means energy, that means more materials like copper, that means more real estate. You really have to think about kind of the physical infrastructure that underlies it," he added. So, for Jacobs, the theme is widening one's investment scope. "It's not just about megacap tech names. There's other semiconductor companies, there's other data center companies, there's other software companies that are benefiting from the rise of this theme," he said. Jacobs cited BlackRock's iShares Future AI & Tech ETF (ARTY) and iShares AI Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI) as potential ways to benefit from the rise in AI. The iShares Future AI & Tech ETF is up around 13% for the year so far, while the iShares AI Innovation and Tech Active ETF is up around 13% since its Oct. 21 launch as of Friday's close.

Title: Lunex Network To Score More Gains as Bitcoin, Ether Look to Set New All-Time Highs This Altseason
URL: https://zycrypto.com/lunex-network-to-score-more-gains-as-bitcoin-ether-look-to-set-new-all-time-highs-this-altseason/
Time Published: 2024-12-07T14:55:45Z
Full Content:
The slowdown of the Bitcoin (BTC) price pump has led many top analysts to predict the beginning of the alt season. According to forecasts, two top altcoins to watch are Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Seth has predicted an SOL price pump of $800 following the application of an ETF from Grayscale. Ali Martinez has shared a long-term price target of $10k for ETH if it maintains its ascending channel. While these are potentially massive gains for SOL and ETH, Lunex Network (LNEX) has been picked as the dark horse for this altseason as it looks to pump by up to 15x. Although the Ethereum coin did not have some other top altcoins’ explosive price pumps, analysts expect it to in the near future. As revealed in a recent analysis by Ali Martinez, ETH is now trading in an ascending channel that could trigger a massive price hike. Martinez also predicts ETH could hit $6,000 mid-term. The analyst believes Ethereum (ETH) could be as high as $10k in the long term. However, according to CoinMarketCap’s data, the Ethereum crypto is trading comfortably above this support level in the $3,700 range. Hinting at a potential reason for the price increase, Armando Pantoja reported that BlackRock has bought over $230 million worth of ETH. Solana (SOL) failed to break above $250 after multiple trials in November despite recording its biggest monthly candle ever. Based on CoinMarketCap’s data, we can see that the Solana crypto has traded in the $220 to $250 price range on the weekly timeframe. While the breathtaking November Solana (SOL) price rally has cooled off, Seth has shared a new target for the altcoin. According to Seth, Grayscale’s application for a Solana ETF could push the altcoin price as high as $800 to $1,400 this altseaon, making SOL one of the best cryptos now. Another crypto analyst, Jelle, has explained that $SOL has bounced off from the 200EMA, leading to a breakout from the falling wedge. As a result, Jelle predicts that the Solana price could pump to a new all-time high soon. Unlike many top crypto coins, the recent 200% price pump of Lunex Network (LNEX) has set a new all-time high at $0.0036. The Lunex Network’s disruptive potential has caught the eye, helping the DeFi project raise over $4.1 million. Most analysts think this is the reason LNEX could extend its gains by up to 15x over this altseason. Lunex Network’s high return, at an APY of 18%, has made it one of the most promising coins in the DeFi market. Unlike conventional exchanges, Lunex offers low-cost swaps between different chains for over 50,000 assets. Lunex also operates on a non-custodial approach, allowing traders full control over their funds and private keys. Lunex Network also does not make its users go through a lengthy know-your-customer process to open an account. The revenue share policy on Lunex is its most valuable feature. Half of a dedicated part of its revenue used to repurchase LNEX coins from the market is used to pay stakers. The other half is kept for other incentives to create a highly sustainable ecosystem. All of these features make Lunex a unique opportunity to get the maximum privacy, security, and obviously huge profits in the DeFi space. The incoming alt season has excited crypto enthusiasts as altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) look to surge to new ATHs finally. However, all eyes have been on Lunex Network because of its exciting features and potential 15x price pump.

Title: Why Is Bank of Montreal (BMO) Among the Best Bank Stocks to Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Bank Stocks With High Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) stands against the other bank stocks. In 2023, the US banking industry took a major hit, as Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, followed by the downfall of two other major banks. It was the biggest shake-up the industry had seen since the 2008 financial crisis. Despite the US banking crisis, the past two years have been the best for banks since before the Great Recession. Shocking, right? According to McKinsey, banks made $7 trillion in revenue and $1.1 trillion in net income globally during 2023, with a return on tangible equity of 11.7%. They have also strengthened their capital and liquidity, with capital levels at 12.8% and liquidity at 77.2%, both improving from 2022. In fact, banks earned more profit than any other sector worldwide last year. Right now, 14% of banks are making up 80% of the industry's economic profit, which is a big jump from 11% in 2013.

Dividend Yield as of December 6: 4.62% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14 Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) operates mainly in North America, where it provides financial services including personal and commercial banking, wealth management, and capital markets. Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) announced a quarterly dividend of C$1.59 per share on December 5, marking a 2.6% increase from the previous dividend of C$1.55. The dividend will be paid on February 26 to shareholders on record as of January 30. This bank has consistently paid dividends to shareholders since 1829 and has increased its payouts annually for the past eight years. That puts BMO on our list of the best bank stocks for a dividend portfolio. In BMO's Q4 2024 earnings call, the bank shared that a year ago, it expected higher interest rates and a slowing economy to make things more difficult for business activity, loan demand, and credit. To stay ahead, Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) took early action, managing costs while still supporting customers, which led to solid results. However, credit performance was worse than anticipated, resulting in a drop in net income for the year to $7.4 billion and earnings per share to $9.68. Despite the tough year, there’s a lot to be proud of. The bank saw a 5% increase in pre-tax earnings to $13.4 billion, improved efficiency, and grew its core customer base, with deposits rising by $61 billion or 9%. BMO expects provisions to ease off through 2025. According to Insider Monkey’s third-quarter data, Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) was present in 14 hedge fund portfolios. Arrowstreet Capital is the largest position holder in the bank, with nearly 1.5 million shares worth $133.2 million. Overall BMO ranks 3rd on our list of the best bank stocks with high dividends. While we acknowledge the potential of BMO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BMO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Bank Stocks With High Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) stands against the other bank stocks. In 2023, the US banking industry took a major hit, as Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, followed by the downfall of two other major banks. It was the biggest shake-up the industry had seen since the 2008 financial crisis. Despite the US banking crisis, the past two years have been the best for banks since before the Great Recession. Shocking, right? According to McKinsey, banks made $7 trillion in revenue and $1.1 trillion in net income globally during 2023, with a return on tangible equity of 11.7%. They have also strengthened their capital and liquidity, with capital levels at 12.8% and liquidity at 77.2%, both improving from 2022. In fact, banks earned more profit than any other sector worldwide last year. Right now, 14% of banks are making up 80% of the industry's economic profit, which is a big jump from 11% in 2013. This is nearly five times higher than most other industries, where a few big players usually dominate the performance. In 2023, global dividends surged to a record $1.66 trillion, marking a 5.0% increase on an underlying basis, according to the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index.

Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) reported a 7% increase in Q4 2024 net income, reaching C$4.2 billion, driven by strong performances in wealth management, personal banking, insurance, and contributions from HSBC Canada.

Title: A longtime stock market bear is rethinking his view after this year's dizzying rally
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-bear-rethinking-view-ai-boom-david-rosenberg-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-07T13:31:02Z

Economist and longtime market bear David Rosenberg is coming around after this year's blistering stock market rally. While he says his updated view doesn't amount to "throwing in the towel," he admits that the technology-fueled AI boom is requiring him to reframe his thinking on the broader stock market. "It's high time for me to stop pontificating on all the reasons why the U.S. stock market is crazily overvalued and all the reasons to be bearish based on all the variables I have relied on in the past," Rosenberg wrote to his clients on Thursday. Rosenberg has long relied on today's stock market valuations relative to the past to highlight just how historically extreme the stock market is currently valued. And he's not wrong. Longtime stock bull Ed Yardeni highlighted five charts this week that showed that valuations have been stretched to historical extremes. However, according to Rosenberg, the extreme valuations may actually be warranted if AI can unleash a wave of productivity upon the economy. This idea was echoed by BlackRock in its 2025 outlook, which argued that comparing today's market valuations to those of the past is "apples to oranges" given the profound shift in America's tech-led economy. Perhaps more importantly, the promise of AI is ultimately leading investors to extend their time horizons beyond the traditional one-year outlook. "Investors are clearly looking out beyond one year across an entire gamut of indicators and developments, so the classic way we look at valuations may not be appropriate today," Rosenberg said. Rosenberg added that even if the stock market is in a bubble, it may not be apparent for years to come, similar to the internet bubble that began to form in the mid-1990s before ultimately popping in 2000. With profits booming for technology companies like Nvidia, the exuberance gripping investors doesn't appear to be extreme or unsustainable. "A bear market only ensues if and when these expectations prove to have been excessive. That day may well come, but Mr. Market has been saying for some time: 'not quite yet,'" Rosenberg said. A shift in the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy could also send markets lower, but that doesn't seem to be in the cards in the near term. Going forward, Rosenberg said he is keeping a more open mind toward the idea that the stock market bull rally could "go further than anyone thinks." "The way to redress the lament of a bear is to keep an open mind as we head into 2025 and learn from the mistakes of the past year," Rosenberg said. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

Title: Ether ‘Impulse Breakout’ Sets The Stage For $15,000 Price By May 2025, According To Pundit

After months of lackluster action, the price of Ethereum (ETH) rocketed above the $4,000 price point on Friday, a level not seen since March. The upward move came as an analyst pointed out a bullish pattern recently formed on the Ether chart. According to their analysis, the second-largest crypto is gearing up for a big breakout. According to data from CoinGecko, Ether’s price has since settled at $4,002 as of press time, still up 2.8% on the day after giving up some gains above $4K. A popular analyst going by the online moniker venturefounder on X believes that Ethereum is about to register an astronomical rally that will send its price to a new all-time high. Venturefounder noted that ETH is on the verge of breaking out of a three-year consolidation phase. Moreover, the trader thinks Ether could soon break out of the range where it has hovered for the last seven years. Venturefounder postulated: “Ethereum likely to repeat this impulsive breakout it did after between 2016-2017 to shoot to new ATH. Price Target: $15,937 by May 2025.” Ethereum’s market cap would soar above $1 trillion for the first time ever if its price nears $16,000. Nevertheless, the pundit indicates that ETH must first close its weekly candle with $3,800 support to be able to first retest its current lifetime high of $4,878 en route to new ATHs. Ether’s latest surge above $4K follows the nine ETH ETFs’ biggest single-day of inflows in history, according to data from Farside Investors. The $431 million in inflows registered on Thursday surpassed the previous record of $333 million on Nov. 29. Despite a tepid launch, the Ether ETFs have been at a daily net positive since Nov. 21 and have accumulated over $1.1 billion in net inflows in the past two weeks. The BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust contributed the lion’s share of the day’s inflows, with a record $292.7 million. This wave of increased investment has pushed Ethereum’s market value to over $486 billion as of publication time. The bullish price movement reflects traders’ optimism following President-elect Donald Trump’s appointment this week of Paul Atkins as the new Securities and Exchange Commission chair and David Sacks as the crypto czar — both prominent pro-crypto advocates. Some analysts are now convinced that a new Trump 2.0 crypto-friendly SEC will likely approve spot ETH ETF staking yields.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) stands against the other dividend stocks that beat the market in the last 3 years. The broader market has been performing strongly this year, rising by nearly 30% since the beginning of 2024. According to Morningstar Direct, the S&P 500's return has exceeded this level in only 17 of the past 74 years. For instance, in 1954, the index saw a gain of over 52%, and in 1989, it increased by about 31%. However, analysts caution investors to manage their expectations, as years with such exceptional returns are uncommon. Cathy Curtis, a certified financial planner and the founder and CEO of Curtis Financial Planning made the following comment about the market’s performance this year in one of her recent interviews with CNBC: “Investors should know that the stock market has an average annualized return of over 10% for decades. The past year has seen growth way over this amount and it would be highly unusual for that to continue for a multi-year timeframe.” Regardless of where the market ends up, dividend stocks have strong potential, as demonstrated over the years. During past periods of inflation, dividend stocks performed better compared to other asset classes. Since the 1940s, dividends have accounted for 40% of the market, with this share increasing during times of higher inflation, according to Hartford Funds. The report also highlighted the performance of dividend stocks in the 1970s, when they made up 73% of the market’s returns. Additional studies, including one from Fidelity International, showed that dividends typically grow faster than inflation. Fidelity's research indicated that since 1900, the 10-year annual average growth of dividends in the market has outpaced CPI growth nearly 73% of the time. In addition to their considerable impact on overall market returns, dividend stocks provide investors with a way to mitigate risks linked to market volatility. According to DWS Group, over the past 20 years, the monthly volatility of dividend returns was just 0.10%, compared to 3.75% for price returns. The report also noted that despite market fluctuations, investors have seen positive overall returns during this period. While riskier factors played a significant role in these returns, it was the dividend stream that proved to be a more stable and safer option amid the uncertainties of the stock market.

The Dividend Aristocrats Index has grown by just nearly 11% this year, but the outlook for dividend growth among US companies is promising. According to Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, large-cap stocks outperformed many others in the first three quarters of 2024, driven by record earnings and an anticipated record dividend payout for the year. He further added that the market’s large caps are expected to see a 6% increase in dividend payments for 2024, compared with 5.1% in 2023 and 10.8% in 2022. When it comes to dividend investing, investors often prefer companies with a strong track record of dividend growth and solid returns as they help prepare for challenging market conditions. Additionally, investors focus on a company's ability to generate cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet, as these factors support the sustainability of future dividend payouts. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend knights that have outperformed the market in the last three years. Our Methodology: For this list, we used a stock screener and selected dividend companies that have outperformed the market in the past three years. These companies also have strong dividend growth track records under their belt. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey's data for Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their three-year returns. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The company reported solid earnings in its fiscal Q1 2025. Its revenue came in at $2.5 billion, which showed a 6.8% growth from the same period last year. The revenue beat analysts' estimates by over $8 million. Its gross margin also grew to $1.25 billion during the quarter, from $1.14 billion in the prior-year period. In view of its strong earnings, the company announced an upward revision to its full fiscal year financial guidance. Annual revenue projections have been raised from the previous range of $10.16 billion–$10.31 billion to a new range of $10.22 billion–$10.32 billion. Additionally, the guidance for diluted EPS has been increased from $4.06–$4.19 to $4.17–$4.25. On October 30, Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.70%, as of December 5. The company's strong cash position has made it possible for it to increase its payouts consecutively for 41 years. In the most recent quarter, it generated $466.7 million in operating cash flow, up from $337 million in the prior-year period. The company also returned approximately $158 million to shareholders through dividends in Q1. According to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 48 hedge funds held stakes in Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS), up from 46 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $1.76 billion. Among these hedge funds, Impax Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall CTAS ranks 4th on our list of the best dividend knights that beat the market in the last 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential for CTAS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Lithium and Battery Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) stands against the other lithium and battery stocks. According to a Reuters report from November 6, automakers are preparing for potential changes under President-elect Donald Trump, including new tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico and the reversal of pro-electric vehicle policies. Trump has indicated plans to rescind EPA and Transportation Department regulations and may reduce or eliminate EV tax incentives. Moreover, the Zero Emission Transportation Association expressed a willingness to collaborate with Trump on future EV development. Trump has also warned of tariffs of up to 200% on Mexican vehicles and is considering similar measures for imports from other regions while encouraging foreign automakers to build plants in the US. Additionally, in October, Reuters reported that the European Union approved additional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, ranging from 7.8% to 35.3%, on top of the existing 10% duty, in response to what it calls unfair subsidies by China. These tariffs, effective October 30, aim to address concerns over subsidized raw materials, batteries, and financing, with China opposing the decision and calling for negotiations to prevent further trade tensions. China has launched its own probes into EU imports, including pork, dairy, and brandy, potentially retaliating against the EU measures. Chinese EVs currently account for 8% of the EU market, a figure expected to grow to 15% by 2025, with their prices typically 20% lower than European counterparts. The investigation has caused division within the EU, with Germany opposing tariffs while France supports them. GlobalData lowered its 2030 U.S. EV market share forecast from 33% to 28%, citing weakened emissions standards and a focus on lower oil prices after the 2024 elections. Bloomberg reported on November 7 that Mark Wakefield of AlixPartners highlighted that $129 billion in EV investments through 2027 and the $7,500 EV tax credit may be at risk. Automakers are expected to cut EV spending, delay new models, and shift production toward hybrids and gasoline vehicles, like Volkswagen’s adaptation at its South Carolina plant. While reversing Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act could prove challenging, changes to fuel economy standards are likely, though their impact may not be felt until later in the decade. The lithium market has experienced a huge decline over the past several quarters due to oversupply and lower demand. However, Ana Cabral, Co-Chair & CEO at Sigma Lithium is positive about the future demand for lithium as discussed in a September interview with CNBC. She noted that lithium prices hit a low point in August but have been recovering steadily. The Chinese recovery package, the largest since COVID, has especially boosted the market, as China accounts for more than half of global EV sales. While the U.S. has seen slower EV adoption compared to China and Europe, with growth in China outpacing the U.S. and Europe, the fundamentals remain strong. As China continues to dominate the EV market, it plays a crucial role in driving demand and lithium prices. Regarding other uses of lithium, Cabral emphasized that EV batteries remain the primary driver, especially as automakers shift away from combustion vehicles, which is expected to create further demand in the coming years. Our Methodology For this article, we used stock screeners to identify around 20 lithium and/or battery stocks and chose the 11 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A battery powered electric vehicle charging in a city storefront. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12 Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) specializes in solid-state battery technology, focusing on applications in electric vehicles and other sectors. The company is known for its sulfide-based solid electrolytes and licenses its innovative cell designs and manufacturing methods. Its technology improves battery safety and boosts energy density by 50-75% compared to traditional batteries. This positions the company as a key player in industries like EVs, electronics, and aerospace. Solid Power continues to work closely with partners like BMW and SK On, focusing on developing competitive solid-state battery technology for automotive applications. Additionally, the company signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a major battery manufacturer to explore potential collaboration on electrolyte development. It is also strengthening relationships with research institutes in Korea. Solid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) management highlighted significant milestones in Q3, including the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) selecting the company to negotiate a $50 million grant for a project aimed at producing sulfide-based solid electrolyte materials for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). This selection is seen as a validation of Solid Power’s technology and business model. The company is focused on advancing both the performance and manufacturing of its electrolyte products, moving from batch production to a continuous manufacturing process, with the first pilot line planned for installation within the next 12-18 months. By 2026, Solid Power expects to produce 75 metric tons of electrolytes per year, increasing to 140 metric tons by 2028. On the cell side, the company made improvements to its A-2 cell design, aiming for higher performance in safety and energy density, with testing expected in early 2025. Overall SLDP ranks 9th on our list of the best lithium and battery stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SLDP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SLDP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A laboratory technician pouring a specialty blend of industrial chemicals into a beaker. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12 Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) is a global leader in producing lithium, iodine, and specialty plant nutrients, leveraging its exclusive access to mineral-rich reserves in Chile’s Atacama Desert. This position enables the company to support industries like EVs and renewable energy storage. Operating in over 100 countries, SQM held an 18% share of the global lithium market in 2023, supplying products to 207 customers across 39 nations, with a strong focus on Asia. Its partnership with Kidman Resources in Australia has further expanded its lithium operations. Moreover, a partnership with Chilean state-owned Codelco, lasting until 2060, aims to improve production and adopt advanced extraction technologies. In Q3, SQM reported solid performance across its business lines in Q3 2024. Specialty Plant Nutrition volumes grew by more than 20%, boosting revenues by 12% year-over-year despite lower prices. Iodine prices showed steady growth due to strong demand and limited supply. In lithium, sales volumes exceeded 51,000 metric tons, an 18% increase from the previous year, though prices declined 24% from the previous quarter due to temporary oversupply. Analysts are also quite optimistic about the long-term prospects for SQM. On November 25, The Fly reported that Scotiabank lowered its price target for SQM shares from $60 to $50 but still rated it as Outperform. The bank sees SQM as the best long-term option among the lithium companies it covers. However, the price target was reduced due to expectations that lithium prices will stay low for a longer period. Overall SQM ranks 10th on our list of the best lithium and battery stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SQM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SQM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also congratulated him. In other news, OpenAI has debuted a “research grade” version of its main artificial intelligence (AI) model. The ChatGPT Pro is a $200-per-month plan that includes unlimited access to the company’s smartest model, OpenAI o1, as well as to o1-mini, GPT-4o and Advanced Voice. “As AI becomes more advanced, it will solve increasingly complex and critical problems. It also takes significantly more compute to power these capabilities”. ChatGPT Pro also includes o1 pro mode, a version of o1 that uses more compute for thinking harder and provides even better answers to the hardest problems. OpenAI also expects to add more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features to this plan in the future. Moreover, the company announced that it is awarding 10 grants of ChatGPT Pro to medical researchers at leading institutions in the U.S. to help drive meaningful progress in fields that benefit humanity. Artificial intelligence is also shaping the healthcare industry. As per a recent study by Accenture, AI-driven healthcare has the potential to save up to $150 billion annually by 2026 in the US. This is done by reducing administrative costs, automating patient education, and improving adherence to care plans. In particular, AI-powered assistants can provide essential, 24/7 support. In the latest news, researchers from Germany and the US have developed a deep learning framework for automated volumetric body composition analysis using whole-body MRI. Published in eBioMedicine, the study validated this approach and demonstrated its potential to predict all-cause mortality in a large Western population.

On December 4, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised the price target on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) to $130.00, from $90.00, and maintained an “Overweight” rating. The rating follows Marvell’s impressive October quarter results which exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. The company reported sales of $1.52 billion, surpassing the $1.46 billion consensus forecast for its fiscal third quarter. Chief Executive Matt Murphy revealed that the quarter’s growth was largely driven by sales of new custom AI accelerator chips for Amazon and other builders of the so-called hyperscale data centers running today’s huge AI software models. Harlan Sur’s rating is based on this very impressive performance and promising outlook, driven by strong growth in the company’s data center business, particularly in AI ASICs and AI optical DSPs. Not only has the company achieved better-than-expected results, but has also achieved partnerships with major clients like Amazon and Google which strengthens its market position. Moreover, the company’s positive trajectory in its cyclical businesses, along with its anticipated revenue growth from AI, places it for continued earnings growth heading into 2025.

On December 6, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) was revisited by a Wall Street analyst Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein who maintained a “Hold” rating along with a $21.00 price target. Sacconaghi has given a hold rating due to mixed signals in its financial outlook. Even though Q4 results slightly exceeded expectations, there remains a cautious outlook due to the pending Juniper acquisition and the modest projection for IT spending in 2025, also leading to a lack of full-year guidance. Moreover, AI server revenues did meet expectations, but there were weak net bookings and a declining AI backlog suggesting challenges ahead. Moreover, HPE had “debooked” a significant portion of server orders, implying potential risks in its order book concentration and customer creditworthiness. Lower R&D spending and weak cash flow compared to income are some more factors for the firm’s cautious approach. Overall HPE ranks 7th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet recently.

Moreover, the company announced that it is awarding 10 grants of ChatGPT Pro to medical researchers at leading institutions in the U.S. to help drive meaningful progress in fields that benefit humanity. Artificial intelligence is also shaping the healthcare industry. As per a recent study by Accenture, AI-driven healthcare has the potential to save up to $150 billion annually by 2026 in the US. This is done by reducing administrative costs, automating patient education, and improving adherence to care plans. In particular, AI-powered assistants can provide essential, 24/7 support. In the latest news, researchers from Germany and the US have developed a deep learning framework for automated volumetric body composition analysis using whole-body MRI. Published in eBioMedicine, the study validated this approach and demonstrated its potential to predict all-cause mortality in a large Western population.

Its products are used in industries like high-performance computing, smartphones, automotive, and consumer electronics. According to a report by Reuters, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is in talks with Nvidia to produce its Blackwell AI chips at TSMC's Arizona facility, which is set to begin volume production in 2025. The chips, currently made in Taiwan, are in high demand for generative AI and computing tasks. While the Arizona plant will handle the chips' front-end process, packaging will still take place in Taiwan due to the absence of CoWoS technology in the U.S. facility. Taiwan Semiconductor’s (NYSE:TSM) Arizona plant already serves customers like Apple and AMD. This expansion is part of TSMC's significant investment in Phoenix, supported by U.S. government subsidies to boost domestic chip production. Overall TSM ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Why Is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Among the Best Tech Stocks for Long Term Investment?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other tech stocks. In a recent conversation on December 3, Clare Pleydell-Bouverie from Liontrust Asset Management appeared on CNBC and shared insights on the current state of innovation, particularly in Silicon Valley. She emphasized that the pace of innovation is not only continuing but is accelerating. This rapid evolution necessitates frequent visits to the region to discern which companies are successfully navigating this transition and which are not. Pleydell-Bouverie noted that the clarity regarding these companies is improving quarter by quarter. She expressed a firm belief that the beneficiaries of the new technology cycle, which began about 18 months to 2 years ago with the advent of ChatGPT and the AI Revolution, will differ significantly from those in the previous technology cycle. While established names remain relevant, her focus is increasingly on opportunities beyond the MAG7. The discussion also touched on market trends for 2025, highlighting a significant focus on AI infrastructure. Pleydell-Bouverie indicated that this year has seen a concentrated effort on building out the necessary compute infrastructure before monetization can occur. This infrastructure encompasses not only silicon but also semiconductor equipment and networking components, which are essential for scaling AI capabilities. She pointed out that while model providers are often viewed as commoditized, there is an ongoing arms race to develop large foundation models. Engineering tools that facilitate the integration of AI into businesses and various applications are also critical, although currently, most value resides within the AI infrastructure layer. Looking ahead, Pleydell-Bouverie anticipates a shift in focus toward application layers where substantial disruption is expected. Numerous AI startups are targeting established players like Salesforce, indicating a competitive landscape. Despite this shift, she believes that the importance of NVIDIA in AI infrastructure remains strong. She described its role as pivotal, suggesting that it is positioning itself to become the operating system for an emerging landscape of AI-infused software set to launch in the coming year. Pleydell-Bouverie cautioned against viewing the company merely as a chip provider; instead, she argued that understanding its strategic positioning within this technological paradigm shift is crucial for investors. Her insights reflect a broader narrative about Silicon Valley's ongoing transformation and its implications for investors looking to navigate this rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively. As tech stocks become increasingly popular, we're here with a list of the 10 best tech stocks for long-term investment. Methodology We first sifted through the stock screeners and internet lists to compile a list of the top mega-cap tech stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279 Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a technology giant that is well-known for its impactful technologies and has recently made significant strides in the AI landscape. In November, it launched new and improved AI models designed to cater to various industries, enhancing its offerings through the Azure AI model catalog. Recent reports indicate that the company's investments in AI are beginning to yield positive results. In FQ1 2025, which ended on September 30, the company reported $65.6 billion in revenue, reflecting a 16% increase year-over-year. This was driven by a record quarterly revenue of $38.9 billion from its cloud services, a 22% increase year-over-year. The Azure segment alone achieved a remarkable 33% growth in revenue, due to high demand for AI-driven solutions within its cloud offerings. These developments highlight the effectiveness of its strategy in harnessing AI to boost business outcomes. The company revealed plans to build 3 trusted platforms focused on maximizing the benefits of AI for the business, demonstrating its approach to integrating AI into core business functions. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is at the forefront of AI innovation, with a clear focus on expanding its capabilities through partnerships and product enhancements. It is positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for AI solutions across various sectors, reinforcing its status as a leader in the technology industry. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $147 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. Shares gave back some gains from strong performance over the first half of this year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, Microsoft reported a strong quarter with total revenue growing 16%, in line with the Street; Microsoft Cloud up 22%; Azure up 30%; 43% operating income margins; and 36% free cash flow margins. Core Azure growth came in one point shy of expectations, however, due to a soft European market and continued constraints on AI compute capacity. In the same vein, while Microsoft reiterated its fiscal 2025 targets of double-digit top-line and operating income growth, quarterly guidance called for Azure growth to slow a bit before accelerating in the back half of the fiscal year, as capital expenditures increase, yielding an expansion of AI compute capacity. We believe this investment is a leading indicator for growth, with more than half of the spend related to durable land and data center build outs, which should monetize over the next 15-plus years. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes, and we remain investors.” Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best tech stocks for long term investment. As we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Storm Darragh welcomes All-Ireland League back after break with Clontarf heading to Ballynahinch

The effects of Storm Darragh welcome back the Energia All-Ireland League (AIL) after a two-week break, with the first of two significant rounds to be played over the next two weekends before the festive break at the halfway point. Ballynahinch, the somewhat surprising leaders after five successive bonus-point wins, host third-placed Clontarf at Ballymacarn Park where they have not been beaten since April. Just over year ago the sides played out a 24-all draw here, with the recently capped Cormac Izuchukwu among the home try-scorers and Hinch look stronger this season, with hooker Clayton Milligan’s six tries even outnumbering his prolific counterpart Dylan Donnellan on four. They are without Ben Moxham as well as fellow winger Aaron Sexton, who is heading to the USA to pursue a career in the AFL, while Jake Humphreys returns at outhalf. Clontarf are also much changed, with Alex Soroka at number eight, winger Aitzol King and fullback Andrew Smith among those returning and it looks like being another close arm wrestle. UCD are stacked for their match against Terenure at the Belfield Bowl, so much so that Leinster’s match-winner in Ulster, James Culhane, is on the bench, while fellow academy players Ben Brownlee, Diarmuid Mangan, Rory McGuire, Ruben Moloney, Conor O’Tighearnaigh and Alan Spicer all come into the starting XV. Jordan Coghlan’s brace was crucial in Terenure’s 19-12 win last time they met but he is ruled out, albeit ex-Ospreys backrower Will Hickey switches to number eight. Harrison Brewer has overcome his ankle injury and with Chris Cosgrave returning from his trial in Bath to start at fullback, Aran Egan reverts to outhalf. A settled St Mary’s have enjoyed renewing old acquaintances back in 1A this season and, sitting second, they host Young Munster for the first time since February 2018 in a renewal of the famous 1993 shoot-out at Lansdowne Road. Ever since that day, there has always been an edge to this rivalry. To add some extra spice, Conor Hayes (47 points this season) and Dan Goggin (who also has three tries), come up against their former club for the first time. Julian Leszczynski, Young Munster’s leading scorer with 58 points, switches to fullback, with Munster’s Tony Butler and Jake O’Riordan combining at halfback and recently contracted Conor Bartley at tight head. Garryowen, bottom of the table, are reinforced by the return of Liam Coombes alongside fellow Munster players Dylan Hicks, Jack Daly, Brian Gleeson, George Hadden and Ronan Foxe, for the visit of Cork Con. The champions recall last season’s leading try-scorer Matthew Bowen, with Sean French moving to 13, and captain David Hyland returns at number eight. Evidently content with Lansdowne’s win over Clontarf last time out, Declan Fassbender has done that rarity in the AIL and named an unchanged side for their tricky trek to City of Armagh who, curiously, have won their last three away but lost their last three at home. Old Belvedere who lead 1B after taking 19 points out of their last 20, meet Shannon at Ollie Campbell Park for the first time since their 46-8 promotion/relegation playoff win last April. The 2A pacesetters Corinthians head to Banbridge without Seán Naughton, in line for his Connacht debut, while close challengers Cashel and Instonians clash at Spafield.

Title: Much-changed Leinster eye Champions Cup winning start against free-flowing Bristol

This Sunday evening opener could be as tough, albeit in a very different way, than the January renewal of hostilities with La Rochelle and it lands on Leinster when they have had the most disruptive preparation of any team in the competition. The net effect of Ireland’s additional autumn match against Australia last week is palpable. In addition to having only a week together again, Leinster are without Hugo Keenan for four weeks due to a wrist injury and James Lowe with a calf strain for an indeterminate amount of time, while Cian Healy and Ryan Baird miss out. Jamie Osborne has also joined their casualty list and after starting all four Irish games and playing 256 and 320 minutes respectively, both Andrew Porter and Caelan Doris are restricted to bench duties. By contrast, two other Irish ever-presents, Joe McCarthy and Josh van der Flier, start their fifth game in five weeks, yet despite the former’s workload and the absence of Keenan and Osborne, RG Snyman and prospective Leinster debutant Jordie Barrett are named on the bench. Both can certainly have a serious impact but even so, the selection of these two stellar names on the bench strongly supports the belief that Leinster are not permitted to start either of them in the Champions Cup. Jack Conan again captains a side showing nine changes in personnel from last weekend’s win in Ulster, with Rónan Kelleher, Joe McCarthy, James Ryan, van der Flier, Jamison Gibson-Park, Sam Prendergast, Robbie Henshaw and Garry Ringrose all return, as does Ciarán Frawley at fullback. The squad trained in Energia Park in Donnybrook on Friday in memory of Dave Fagan, who died this week after a short illness after working with the province as a strength and conditioning coach since 1995 with the senior team, academy and sub-academy. “It gives me goosebumps just thinking about him,” admitted Leo Cullen, who first worked under Fagan when he left school. “When players leave school or club, they go into the Ken Wall Centre of Excellence and it’s like the school of hard knocks down there. It was an unbelievably sad day yesterday here. We try to move on. It won’t be easy, but our thoughts at the moment are with his family.” For his part, Pat Lam makes only three changes from last week’s 48-24 win away to Harlequins — virtually the norm for Bristol — in recalling the English pair of Ellis Genge and Harry Randall, and promoting Harry Thacker. Bristol sit second in the Premiership, with five wins and a maximum nine bonus points in seven games. Collectively they have scored the most tries, 36. Individually, left wing Gabriel Ibitoye, with his pace, strength, elusiveness and extravagant offloading, leads the way with six, as does ex-Blackrock pupil and Connacht’s Pro12 winning outhalf AJ MacGinty in the points charts with 75. “Bristol like to keep the ball on the field, they play quick, they play from anywhere, they have an unbelievably strong running game and for us defensively it’s going to be a serious challenge for the 23,” admitted Cullen. “It looks like a very unstructured free-flowing game, but it is very structured in the roles the players would have within that.” Now in his eighth season there, not surprisingly Lam has Bristol singing a tune familiar to Connacht and to his credo that all his players, backs and forwards, must touch the ball over 1,000 times in training every week. Bristol always look to push the pass, keep the ball off the deck and vary the point of attack. They don’t mind conceding 30 so long as they score 40. “They are completely unique,” admits Jacques Nienaber, relishing the challenge. “You won’t find a lot of international teams that will play like that because if you lose [at Test level] it’s written in history. “At club level you can have a little bit of a crack because if you lose a game, you score 30 and they score 31, it’s not as detrimental. It’s not knock-out yet. “But that is why I’m so excited, to try and work out plans for Pat and all the things that he has lined up for us. Listen, they’ve got a bag full of tricks and you can be 21-0 down in 15 minutes if all their stuff sticks and you’re a little bit off your game.” This could be a wild and fluctuating ride, and Leinster will most likely have to roll with a few punches, but they may just have enough forward power and ballast off the bench to come through. BRISTOL BEARS: Rich Lane; Jack Bates, Benhard Janse van Rensburg, Kalaveti Ravouvou, Gabriel Ibitoye; AJ MacGinty, Harry Randall; Ellis Genge, Harry Thacker, Max Lahiff; James Dun, Joe Owen; Santiago Grondona, Fitz Harding (capt), Viliame Mata. Replacements: Gabriel Oghre, Jake Woolmore, Lovejoy Chawatama, Steven Luatua, Benjamin Grondona, Kieran Marmion, Joe Jenkins, Benjamin Elizalde. LEINSTER: Ciarán Frawley; Jordan Larmour, Garry Ringrose, Robbie Henshaw, Jimmy O’Brien; Sam Prendergast, Jamison Gibson-Park; Jack Boyle, Rónan Kelleher, Rabah Slimani; Joe McCarthy, James Ryan; Max Deegan, Josh van der Flier, Jack Conan (capt). Replacements: Gus McCarthy, Andrew Porter, Thomas Clarkson, RG Snyman, Caelan Doris, Luke McGrath, Ross Byrne, Jordie Barrett. Referee: Pierre Brousset (France). Forecast: Leinster to win.

Listen on Sorcha says she knows me. She knows me inside-out. But I tell her that the Rossmeister General still has one or two surprises in his locker. Yeah, no, we’re staying with Sorcha’s old pair in Stoneybosher while the fire damage to our gaff is being fixed and they’ve told us we can decorate their gaff for Christmas. So we’re off to buy a tree and then we’re going to swing into Killiney to collect our baubles and various other bits? Which is actually what we’re orguing about. Sorcha says I’m going to be spending the entire weekend disentangling the lights, but I’m making the point that I didn’t just fock them all into the same box after Christmas last year. Yeah, no, I separated them, then I stretched them out and wrapped each set individually around pieces of, like, cordboard. Sorcha laughs. I’m there, “What’s funny?” She goes, “I remember you saying that you were going to do that? As a matter of fact, you say it every year. But then when it comes to it, you can never be bothered and you end up just throwing them all into the same box for Future Ross to sort out.” “But last Christmas,” I go, “I remember Past Ross thinking, ‘You need to stort being nicer to Future Ross. He’s a genuinely good bloke. Do the dude a solid for once in your life.’ I remember saying that out loud, Sorcha – very clearly.” There’s a “Christmas Trees for Sale” sign on a lamp-post as we’re approaching the junction with Ailesbury Road. Sorcha’s like, “Will we stop here?” But I’m there, “What, Michael’s? I wouldn’t have a Michael’s tree in the house, Sorcha. Even though I’d consider James Ryan a very good friend and obviously Dan Leavy and the Byrne brothers.” She goes, “You see? This is why I’m so dubious about you wrapping the lights. Because you always, always insist on making things hord for yourself.” “That’s not true.” “It’s one hundred per cent true.” “Sorcha, I actually remember very pacifically thinking – and it was the mention of Ross and Harry Byrne there that reminded me – when you’re a ten and you score a try, you have the option of either putting the ball down in the corner, so you can show off your kicking skills with the conversion, or putting it down underneath the posts, just to make it easier on yourself. And I remember thinking, as I was wrapping the lights, ‘You’re basically putting the ball down beneath the posts here, Rossmeister.’” “You’ve suddenly remembered that?” It’s, like, every single year you used to say that you were going to give up drink after Christmas, do twelve hours per week in the gym and make a comeback to rugby “Yeah, no, I’m like Celine Dion here – it’s all coming back to me now. And then I actually texted Ross Byrne – or I might have sent him a voice note – to tell him what I was doing. Because I’m always saying to him that once you’re a kicker, you never, ever stop thinking like a kicker – and that’s for life. And he came back to me with either a thumbs-up or a smiley face emoji.” “Will we stop at Blackrock College for a tree?” “Not a focking chance. Wouldn’t give them the pleasure.” She’s like, “So where did the cordboard come from?” I’m there, “Excuse me?” “The cordboard. That you supposedly wrapped the lights in.” “I think you’ll find the word is supposably?” “It’s not, Ross.” “Isn’t it? Well, whatever. It would have been cordboard that we had just lying around.” “So you don’t remember where it came from?” “I think it might have been a Corn Flakes box, or – yeah, no, I’m remembering now – it was a Rice Krispies box. Because you know the way I always love a bowl of Rice Krispies on Christmas morning.” “Ross, I really think this is all wishful thinking on your port.” “Excuse me?” “You constantly do this. You tell yourself that you’re going to do something, and you manage to persuade yourself that you’ve done it – even though you haven’t?” “Don’t suppose you’ve any examples of this, Sorcha?” “Yeah, I do. It’s, like, every single year you used to say that you were going to give up drink after Christmas, do twelve hours per week in the gym and make a comeback to rugby.” “Jesus.” “What?” “You had that one in the chamber, ready to fire, didn’t you?” “And then in January, February, Morch, I would hear you tell people that you were off the booze and absolutely crushing it in the gym. Even though you weren’t.” “So you’re calling me a liar?” “I never thought you were lying. I always thought you’d convinced yourself that it was actually true. I think your enthusiasm sometimes gets the better of your sense of reality.” “Well, brace yourself, Sorcha, because you’re about to be shocked.” We drive the rest of the way in silence. Eventually, we pull into Honalee. There’s, like, five or six workmen out the front of the gaff, having their tea break. Sorcha goes, “My husband is just going to pop up to the attic to get the Christmas lights if that’s okay?” “Don’t mention Christmas lights,” one of the dudes goes. “I spent the whole of last weekend try to untangle the things.” Sorcha’s there, “Well, Ross is convinced that he wrapped them all individually after last Christmas.” The dude actually laughs. He goes, “I always tell myself I’m going to do that. That’s me. Every year.” I decide to block out the voices of the doubters and the naysayers. I tip upstairs, open the attic, clamber up the ladder, switch on the light and find the box. I stare at the lid of it for a good, like, thirty seconds, listening to my own breathing as I prepare to open it. Then I grab the two flaps, tear it open and look inside. Sixty seconds later, I’m carrying the box down the stairs and out to the cor. All of the workmen are standing around waiting to find out whether I actually did wrap the lights or not. “Well?” one of them even goes. I’m there, “Get on with the work, will you? We want to be back in the house before Christmas 2025.” I throw the box on the back seat and Sorcha storts the cor. She doesn’t say anything for a good, like, five minutes, then she goes, “I’ll tell you what, let’s treat ourselves to new Christmas lights this year.” I’m like, “Yeah, no, good idea,” and then I go, “Past Ross is a total dick, by the way.” Ross O’Carroll-Kelly was captain of the Castlerock College team that won the Leinster Schools Senior Cup in 1999.

Title: Christmas dinner wines to get the table talking

Bored drinking the same wine every Christmas? We tend to revert to the same few staples every year: Chablis, Mâcon, Rioja Reserva, Bordeaux and one or two other tried-and-trusted favourites. However, there are plenty of other options, wines that might provoke a little conversation around the table. Smooth-textured white wines go nicely with turkey as well as seafood starters. Instead of a chardonnay, this week I suggest a delicious Spanish white made from the godello grape. I tried the Château Thieuley with some smoked salmon I had in the fridge and the two went very well. It might be a bit light for turkey or red meats, though. But you could also try a viognier or an albariño from Spain. I tend to go for lighter red wines with my turkey, usually a Burgundy, a syrah from the Northern Rhône, or a gamay, but I think the Dāo would also do very nicely. If you prefer fuller-bodied wines I would suggest a southern Rhône, Languedoc or Australian grenache-based red that will be low in tannins and therefore great with turkey. If you are catering for a large gang of people, the featured Lidl Grenache would be ideal.

Jordie Barrett and head coach Leo Cullen during a Leinster training session at UCD this week. Photo by David Fitzgerald/Sportsfile Sam Prendergast Dave Fagan had a profound influence on the Leinster match-day 23 that arrived in Bristol this morning, and Leo Cullen admitted the death of the club stalwart after an illness had hit the organisation for six. The strength and conditioning coach’s name regularly cropped up in discussions with young Leinster players whose journey as professionals began working with him at the club’s centre of excellence in Donnybrook, where he’d help turn the boys into men. He was as much part of the Leinster furniture as head coach Cullen who yesterday recalled working with the former shot put coach when he was transitioning from Blackrock College into senior rugby in the late 1990s. “It gives me goosebumps just thinking about him,” Cullen said yesterday. “We just trained in Energia Park in memory of Dave. When players leave school or club, they go into the Ken Wall Centre of Excellence and it’s like the school of hard knocks down there. “Dave is there since I came out of school. I was explaining to Rabah Slimani on the pitch today about how in the olden days when Mike Ruddock was the head coach and I went in as a 19-year-old, it was a prefab building where the Old Wesley gym is now . . . that’s where we all would have done our training. “Everyone was learning about professionalism and Dave has been involved in Leinster since those days. He was around my whole career and it seems like a long time ago since I played rugby. “He was a great character to have around, a great sounding board for me about young players coming through. He had so much knowledge, he’d seen so much and he could spot them a mile away – the good and bad ones – and it’s such a great skill. “You go into the gym down there and there’s this picture on the wall, Dave takes great pride in the players that step into the senior team. That’s where they all came through, in terms of our home-based players, he was such a big role in that. “It was an unbelievably sad day yesterday here, we try to move on. It won’t be easy, but our thoughts at the moment are with his family.” There are no plans to formally mark Fagan’s passing at Ashton Gate tomorrow, but you sense the squad will feel the need to deliver a performance for the coach. The big news at yesterday’s team announcement was Cullen’s decision to select Sam Prendergast at out-half. There had been plenty of speculation about whether the Kildare youngster would be put in cold storage after starting back-to-back Tests for Ireland, but the head coach conceded his performances in November had moved the dial on selection. “It’s never straightforward. Sam is a young player, he’s very talented. Not just him, you have to make sure the transition is smooth,” he said. “You have to be open-minded . . . listen, we’ve four 10s that can do a really good job for us. They’re all internationals now. Sam wasn’t an international four weeks ago, now he is. “That’s a different conversation in terms of his level of experience and exposure he’s been through, which is fantastic because . . . we could talk about him, but Gus [McCarthy] and Thomas Clarkson as well, we’ve three young players and now they are internationals and that’s great for them to go through because they grow in terms of their confidence. “Hopefully, that’s a positive thing for us as a group. I thought Ross [Byrne] did a great job for the team on Friday night [against Ulster], but we’ve got to be respectful that we’ve a guy who started the last two Tests for Ireland. “We have, when we’re talking about selection, it’s this week. It’s not a call that was made six weeks ago. We can have conversations, but it’s ifs, buts and maybes until we’re sitting down together as a group of coaches saying this is how it’s played out. The three lads coming back, it’s fantastic to have and obviously Sam is one of them.” McCarthy and Clarkson are on a stacked bench that includes Andrew Porter, RG Snyman and Jordie Barrett, who will make his club debut against an in-form Bristol side. Cullen confirmed Hugo Keenan (wrist) and James Lowe (calf) are facing spells on the sidelines, while he said Tadhg Furlong was also a number of weeks away from returning. Pat Lam and his Bristol Bears represent a formidable opening test but Leinster have a cause and they should be too strong.

The crypto industry is excited about a second Trump presidency. by Ellen Ioanes and Nicole Narea The price of bitcoin surged past $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, continuing a post-election run buoyed by the pro-crypto promise of the incoming Trump administration. On Election Day, bitcoin — one of the most popular decentralized digital assets available — was worth $69,374, according to the cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase. Within a month, it had spiked more than 44 percent. Other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and XRP also shot up during that period. Cryptocurrencies’ sudden increase in value is a sign of investor optimism about President-elect Donald Trump’s policies and those of his picks to head several key regulatory agencies, some of whom have explicitly promised deregulation of the crypto industry. “That bitcoin hit the $100,000 mark reflects the expectation of both political support and regulatory latitude under the incoming administration,” said Ramaa Vasudevan, an economics professor at Colorado State University who has been critical of crypto. “The nomination of crypto-enthusiasts for administrative posts is a clear signal of the embrace of bitcoin and crypto triggering the flood of money into these markets.” Bitcoin’s rally is also a product of its increased legitimacy. Trump’s election may have sparked its rally, but the financial establishment’s embrace of the asset in recent months provided the tinder. While bitcoin was once a niche curiosity, it is now a mainstream digital currency that everyday Americans can now buy through reputable retail investment accounts. Even if bitcoin ultimately turns out to be a bubble, as many economists have argued it may, these investment vehicles have assured it some staying power. Trump has been an ardent cryptocurrency supporter throughout his most recent presidential campaign, and his choices to lead key government agencies related to its regulation reflect that enthusiasm. Bitcoin hit its highest valuation ever following the nomination of Paul Atkins on Wednesday to head the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is in charge of regulating tradable securities like stocks. Atkins was previously an SEC commissioner for six years during former President George W. Bush’s administration. Atkins is “not necessarily the sort of burn-it-all-down type of nominee that Trump has decided upon for other positions,” Molly White, a cryptocurrency researcher and critic, told Vox. “He’s fairly establishment; he has the SEC background, but he also was a very strong advocate for deregulation when he was in the SEC and certainly since then.” Atkins is also a co-chair of the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance, an industry lobbying group that advocates for lax regulation of cryptocurrencies. Perianne Boring, the CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, is rumored to be one of Trump’s top picks for another key position: head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which makes rules around the trading of futures and commodities. Currently, cryptocurrency is under the purview of the SEC, but the Trump administration is reportedly weighing regulating it as a commodity instead. If that change is made, cryptocurrency would come under the purview of the CFTC, which is often seen to be more hands-off in its approach to regulation. Billionaire crypto enthusiast David Sacks, whom Trump named Thursday as his crypto and AI czar, will be tasked with helping formulate crypto and AI policy from the White House. In that role, Trump said in a post on Truth Social, Sacks will work closely with both the SEC and CTFC to develop a legal framework to regulate crypto. Trump himself is also connected to cryptocurrency via his family’s cryptocurrency and trading venture World Liberty Financial. Pro-cryptocurrency groups spent $245 million in this year’s elections, more than any other industry, to support candidates across the country seen as friendlier to crypto. All of that likely means that the regulatory landscape under a Trump administration will be much friendlier for crypto following heavier regulations and a slew of lawsuits against crypto companies during current SEC chair Gary Gensler’s tenure. “The recent wave of investment in the crypto space is largely driven by the growing belief that years of regulatory uncertainty and lawfare may finally be giving way to clarity,” said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab. Gensler’s SEC cracked down on trading platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken, arguing that the buying and selling of cryptocurrency should have the same oversight as something like a stock or bond, and that investors should have access to the same kinds of information about crypto companies as they would have about a company that they are buying stock in. Crypto trading platforms and associated companies, however, argue that crypto tokens aren’t the same as stocks and therefore shouldn’t have the same regulations applied. The SEC has brought lawsuits against several major crypto platforms, including Coinbase, which are ongoing. But they could be dropped under the Trump administration, and regulation around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is likely to change significantly under Trump. Under a Trump regulatory regime, cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase could operate with less threat of litigation, making it easier for people to trade on their platforms. Enthusiasts say this will spur innovation in the industry, but it could also mean that individual traders using such platforms are more exposed to fraud, theft, and the volatile nature of the currency. Over the past five years, and particularly following the downfall of crypto trading platform FTX in 2022, the narrative around cryptocurrency’s utility has changed. Now, it’s being touted more as an investment instrument rather than a form of currency that can be used like cash, White said. And that pivot is also helping its valuation. In January, the SEC gave the green light to the first bitcoin exchange-traded funds (or ETFs) in the US. ETFs are baskets of financial instruments (such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or in this case, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum) that are bought and sold on a regulated stock exchange. ETFs offer anyone indirect access to cryptocurrency, if they choose to invest. Put simply, if the value of bitcoin increases, so does the value of these ETFs — but because of the bundled nature of ETFs and their presence on a regulated exchange, investors are more insulated from loss if bitcoin’s value declines. Firms including BlackRock, Invesco, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Ark Invest have rolled out bitcoin funds, which offer new investors, especially those who might be more risk-averse, easy ways to purchase or gain exposure to cryptocurrency. Previously, investors had limited options for trading bitcoin. They could go on a cryptocurrency exchange to directly buy bitcoin, but then would have to figure out how to safely and conveniently store it long-term. (Cryptocurrency held on an exchange can be vulnerable to theft, while crypto stored offline is safer but difficult to trade.) They could also invest in risky bitcoin futures, agreeing to buy or sell the currency at a later date at a certain price. Now, ETFs offer an establishment-backed option. “While no one can predict the exact inflection point or when the price will stabilize, the long-term driver of bitcoin’s rise is its evolution — not just as digital gold, but as a foundational layer of global financial infrastructure,” Catalini said. However, Vasudevan said that there is still reason to believe that crypto’s climb won’t last forever. Bitcoin has surged before, only to crash precipitously. In November 2022, bitcoin’s value dropped 20 percent, to below $16,000, in a matter of days after the spectacular downfall of the crypto exchange FTX. The concern remains that the price of crypto is based purely on speculation, rather than any inherent value. “This has all the makings of another bubble, one that is being stoked by the prospect of a more favorable regulatory environment and the possibilities it is opening for new products and funds that can draw in more and more people into these markets,” Vasudevan said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Advertising Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE:IPG) stands against the other advertising stocks. Ad spending in 2024 received a significant boost from recurring events such as the US election and the Olympics, and experts believe that these spending patterns are likely to add billions to the market. Media agency Magna increased its US ad spending forecast for the year, expecting revenue growth of 11.4% to $377 billion, per the news shared with Marketing Dive. The company expects non-cyclical ad spending to grow by 8.9%, reflecting a rise from 8.2% in previous forecasts. This marks one of the best performances for the category in 20 years. This revision stemmed from improved macroeconomic conditions, healthy appetites in digital and streaming, and cyclical events, such as the elections and the Summer Olympics. As per PwC, fueling revenue growth by selling E&M products directly to users is challenging. Of the 3 major categories i.e., consumer spending, connectivity, and advertising, consumer spending is the smallest and slowest growing. The connectivity category i.e., fixed and mobile services, topped US$1.1 trillion in 2023. Advertising outpaced consumer spending in 2023 and should top US$1 trillion in 2026. PwC believes that it is expected to grow at a 6.7% CAGR through 2028. With advertising expected to make up ~55% of total E&M industry growth over the upcoming 5 years, PwC believes that it will become a more important part of companies’ business models. For strategic reasons, all participants in the E&M industry are required to be more skillful at selling ads. According to PwC, the changes to the way businesses approach the ad business are expected to be seen in 3 key areas. Firstly, the monetization of data is expected to fuel more sophisticated advertising models. Next, the connection will be closer between the discovery of products and services and their purchase and consumption. Finally, it will be important for companies to understand how global privacy regulations impact growth. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. As per Mediatool, key advertising trends to look out for include an emphasis on authenticity, visual content domination, integration of AI, mobile-centric campaigns, and growth of social commerce. AI/ML has become important in the world of digital advertising. As of now, 32% of marketers leverage AI for creating, managing, and optimizing their ads. According to Market.us, the global AI in advertising market is expected to reach $28.4 billion in the year 2033 with a CAGR of 28.4%. This was valued at $6.7 billion in the year 2023. Based on the application, targeted advertising dominated the broader market with a share of 31.1% in 2023.

(NYSE:IPG) offers advertising and marketing services. The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE:IPG)’s stock has been on analysts’ radar as they believe that the impact of significant account losses might weigh on the company’s future performance. The account losses, which include the loss of Amazon’s media account, might create a headwind on revenue and margins. Furthermore, losses of creative revenues from Pfizer and GM are likely to impact the company’s 2025 performance. However, industry experts opine that The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE:IPG) is now well-placed to turn tides and might now witness a revival. This is because of its focus on several strategic initiatives targeting to improve its competitive position and fuel future growth. The company continues to emphasize key areas like Retail Media, Data, Generative AI (GenAI), mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and production improvements.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Advertising Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Thumzup Media Corporation (NASDAQ:TZUP) stands against the other advertising stocks. Ad spending in 2024 received a significant boost from recurring events such as the US election and the Olympics, and experts believe that these spending patterns are likely to add billions to the market. Media agency Magna increased its US ad spending forecast for the year, expecting revenue growth of 11.4% to $377 billion, per the news shared with Marketing Dive. The company expects non-cyclical ad spending to grow by 8.9%, reflecting a rise from 8.2% in previous forecasts. This marks one of the best performances for the category in 20 years. This revision stemmed from improved macroeconomic conditions, healthy appetites in digital and streaming, and cyclical events, such as the elections and the Summer Olympics. As per PwC, fueling revenue growth by selling E&M products directly to users is challenging. Of the 3 major categories i.e., consumer spending, connectivity, and advertising, consumer spending is the smallest and slowest growing. The connectivity category i.e., fixed and mobile services, topped US$1.1 trillion in 2023. Advertising outpaced consumer spending in 2023 and should top US$1 trillion in 2026. PwC believes that it is expected to grow at a 6.7% CAGR through 2028. With advertising expected to make up ~55% of total E&M industry growth over the upcoming 5 years, PwC believes that it will become a more important part of companies’ business models. For strategic reasons, all participants in the E&M industry are required to be more skillful at selling ads. According to PwC, the changes to the way businesses approach the ad business are expected to be seen in 3 key areas. Firstly, the monetization of data is expected to fuel more sophisticated advertising models. Next, the connection will be closer between the discovery of products and services and their purchase and consumption. Finally, it will be important for companies to understand how global privacy regulations impact growth. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.

Title: Why Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is the Best Fuel Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Fuel Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) stands against other best fuel stocks to buy now. Fuel stocks, often referred to as energy stocks, represent shares of companies involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, as well as those specializing in drilling for these resources. Additionally, companies that refine crude oil into usable products, such as gasoline and diesel, also fall under this category. In an interview with Bloomberg on December 5, Amrita Sen, Founder and Director of Research at Energy Aspects, discussed the current state of the oil market and the upcoming OPEC+ meeting. Sen noted that OPEC+ members are unlikely to increase production, given the traditional maintenance season in Q1 and Q2, which typically leads to crude stock builds. Instead, she expects the group to delay the planned output to effectively get rid of the seasonal builds and reassess the market in the second half of the year. Sen highlighted that the current state of global inventories is incredibly low and that in the US, inventories are expected to end the year below 420 million barrels, which is at their lowest since 2007. Despite this, oil prices have been stuck at a low price, as analysts and industries are expecting a bearish 2025 and are discounting their current inventories When asked about the risk of a serious breakdown in OPEC+ members, Sen said that it is unlikely to happen as the members are committed to maintain a stable price, rather than engaging in a price war. She recalled the price war in April 2020, which led to a decline in prices, and said that OPEC ministers want to avoid a repeat of that scenario. While they do want prices to be higher, they also realize that if there is a breakdown and the market is not managed properly, prices can also go lower. READ ALSO: 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts and 7 Best Emerging Markets Stocks To Buy Now. Sen agreed that the recent commencement of Canadian oil shipments to international markets via the Trans Mountain pipeline represents a significant development in the industry and has enabled Canadian producers to benefit from increased access to global markets. Sen notes that China has a strong preference for Canadian heavy oil, primarily due to its consistent quality, which is well-suited to the requirements of modern Chinese refineries. Sen also said that all the new refineries coming online in China, India, and other South Asian countries are primarily designed to process medium or heavy sour crude oil, and its demand is projected to reach a net 800,000 barrels per day. Sen pointed out that the refining capacity in regions such as Europe, North America, and other OECD countries is expected to decline, with a projected loss of 1 million barrels per day during the next year, comprising 400,000 barrels in Europe and an additional 400,000 in the United States, due to environmental concerns. Looking ahead to 2025, Sen expects the average oil price to average around $80 for Brent, but there are risks skewed to the upside due to the possible tightening of sanctions on Iran, Venezuela, and Russia under the Trump administration. Energy plays a crucial role in the global economy, as it provides the essential resources needed to power industries, transportation, and homes. The oil and gas industry continues to play a pivotal role in meeting the world’s energy needs, even as the push for cleaner alternatives gains momentum. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 8 best fuel stocks to buy now. To compile our list of the 8 best fuel stocks to buy now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 25 largest companies in the oil and gas sectors. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 8 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Oil derricks in the background with a few workers in the foreground, emphasizing the company’s oil and gas production activities. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71 Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is a global energy company engaged in crude oil exploration, production, and marketing. The company maintains a significant presence in the U.S., the Middle East, and Latin America, serving as a key supplier of crude oil to refineries and industrial sectors. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is focusing on utilizing its existing infrastructure in the Delaware basin acreage to develop secondary benches inside the existing wells by leveraging technology. By doing so, the company aims to replace reserves at a low cost. Additionally, the company is reducing costs through infill development and has been able to add considerable reserves through extensions and discoveries. As a result, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is replacing reserves while investing less than its current depreciation and depletion costs. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) plans to maintain a five-rig program within its CrownRock assets through 2025, targeting mid-single-digit production growth. The company is also focused on retaining flexibility in capital expenditures across its broader U.S. onshore portfolio to respond to shifts in commodity prices. With the integration of CrownRock assets and strong performance from new wells in the Permian Basin, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) anticipates achieving a production level of 1.45 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in Q4. Overall, OXY ranks 2nd on our list of best fuel stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of OXY to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Republican AGs sue BlackRock, other investment firms over ‘woke’ climate action efforts

The Lawrence Energy Center in Kansas burns coal for electric power. A federal lawsuit filed by 11 Republican attorneys general claims institutional investors BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street committed antitrust violations to lower supply and increase the cost of coal. (Photo by Jill Hummels/Kansas Reflector) Major institutional investors have artificially lowered coal production and raised energy costs for consumers in an effort to lower global carbon emissions, a federal lawsuit claims. Republican attorneys general in 11 states filed a joint lawsuit last month against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, claiming the organizations’ efforts to pressure coal companies to lower carbon emissions and respond to climate change amount to anti-competitive business practices. All three companies, the lawsuit says, have acquired significant shares in the largest publicly-traded coal companies to coerce their management. “For the past four years, America’s coal producers have been responding not to the price signals of the free market, but to the commands of Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chairman and CEO, and his fellow asset managers,” the lawsuit says. BlackRock is the world’s largest financial asset manager. The case was in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on behalf of the states of Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming. The case asks the court to find that the companies have violated federal antitrust laws and prohibit them from using their stock holdings in coal companies to limit output. In a statement, State Street called the lawsuit “baseless.” “State Street acts in the long-term financial interests of investors with a focus on enhancing shareholder value,” the company said. “As long-term capital providers, we have a mutual interest in the long-term success of our portfolio companies.” In 2020, Fink wrote in a letter to CEOs that “climate risk is investment risk” and announced efforts to “place sustainability at the center of our investment approach.” He said companies and investors had a meaningful role to play in the transition from fossil fuels and coal to clean energy. The following year, BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, acknowledging an “urgent need to accelerate the transition towards global net zero emissions” and committing to work to reduce carbon emissions. Black Rock and State Street also signed onto Climate Action 100+, a similar initiative where investors work with companies “on improving climate change governance, cutting emissions and strengthening climate-related financial disclosures. Burning coal produces carbon dioxide, the most prevalent greenhouse gas and a significant drive of climate change, scientists say. It also produces sulfur dioxide, particulates and other emissions that can be harmful to human health. Coal made up 19% of energy-related carbon emissions in 2022 and more than half of emissions from electric power companies, according to the Energy Information Administration. In a press release, Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers’ office accused the three companies of weaponizing their shares of the coal market. “Whether it comes from state or federal governments or the private sector,” Hilgers said, “the radical climate agenda harms Nebraskans.” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey vowed to “not stand idly by while these companies hamper energy production and raise prices for Missouri consumers.” Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office said in a press release that he was “taking further action to stop work corporatists and their left-leaning allies in government from driving up energy costs for hardworking Hoosiers.” “Coal has been the backbone of Indiana’s economic success for decades,” Rokita said. “The demand for electricity has gone up and these (environmental, social and governance) titans are reaping the benefits of these skyrocketed prices by keeping their thumb on production.” And Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said she would keep “fighting until we take down every cog of the woke machine and protect hardworking families and farmers.” “While Woke Wall Street lines its own pockets,” Bird said, “families and farmers are forced to pay the price.” GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.

Title: U.S. Bitcoin ETFs Surpass Satoshi Nakamoto’s Stack, Now Holding ‘Mind-Blowing’ 1.1 Million BTC

After months of accumulating billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, the successful BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched earlier this year collectively hold more of the alpha crypto than its mysterious, pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. A chart posted on X (aka Twitter) on Dec. 6 by Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shows that the 11 spot Bitcoin funds now trading on U.S. stock exchanges hold as much as 1,103,965 BTC as of Dec. 5. Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator (or creators) mined the first Bitcoin back in 2009 under the moniker Satoshi Nakamoto, and their true identity has remained a mystery. Satoshi is believed to have mined roughly 22,000 of the first blocks, which, when multiplied by the 50 BTC block reward at the time, gives 1.1 million BTC. “The US spot ETFs have just passed Satoshi in total Bitcoin held, now hold more than 1.1 million, more than anyone in the world, and they’re not even a year old yet, literally babies still. Mind-blowing,” Balchunas quipped. KING OF THE HILL: The US spot ETFs have just passed Satoshi in total bitcoin held, now hold more than 1.1m, more than anyone in the world, and they're not even a year old yet, literally babies still. Mind blowing. h/t @EdmondsonShaun for the data pic.twitter.com/FQBIGGz5ei The 11 ETFs’ unprecedented accumulation signals significant investor interest in Bitcoin exposure via highly regulated investment products, despite these red-hot vehicles only going live in the US market in January. The most prominent BTC ETF is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets under management. The IBIT recently topped 500,000 BTC (or over $50 billion) in AUM just as the price of the maiden cryptocurrency hit the $100,000 milestone for the first time on Wednesday. Notably, BlackRock boss Larry Fink conceded earlier this year that he was wrong about crypto and has changed his stance over the last five years. Spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT have played a huge role in bringing traditional institutional and retail investors into the crypto market. The data cited by Balchunas indicates that the cumulative ETF holdings now exceed those of crypto giant Binance by 41%. In addition, the ETFs hold roughly 62% more BTC than is held by software firm MicroStrategy — the world’s largest Bitcoin corporate holder. All in all, it is unlikely that Satoshi will ever move their 1.1 million BTC. As ZyCrypto previously reported, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently contended that the enigmatic Bitcoin originator is no longer alive.

Wall Street firms spend a pretty penny on executive salaries and compensation, especially for those at the helm. In addition to pay packages often totaling tens of millions of dollars, most CEOs in the financial sector receive other benefits. Given the high-profile nature of their jobs, security details and systems, as well as private cars and planes, are often costs that major firms are willing to incur to keep executives safe. Here’s what some Wall Street giants are shelling out for their CEOs’ safety. Read more: Here’s how much Big Tech spends guarding its wealthiest CEOs JPMorgan Chase (JPM) paid around half a million dollars — $523,271 — on CEO Jamie Dimon’s security in 2023, including $362,226 for personal use of the company plane, $30,400 to use corporate cars, and $150,645 for the cost of residential, personal travel, and related security, according to the company’s 2024 proxy statement. The veteran CEO received $36 million in total compensation last year. Security expenses for BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink reached $780,350 last year. That included $216,837 for security personnel and $563,513 to upgrade his home security system, the company disclosed in regulatory filings. BlackRock said the added security measures were recommended by an independent, third-party study and supported by the board of directors. This was increased from 2022 amid growing backlash about the company’s diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) practices. Fink received $26.9 million in total compensation in 2023. Goldman Sachs (GS) paid $77,231 for personal car use and $29,990 for “personal security” for its CEO, David Solomon, totaling $107,221 in 2023. Solomon is expected to use the investment bank’s corporate aircraft, including for personal travel, for security reasons, Goldman said in its most recent proxy statement. He received $31 million in total compensation last year. In 2023, Blackstone (BX) spent $4,579,444 related to security services for CEO Stephen Schwarzman and members of his family, the company disclosed in its annual report. The firm said the sum was for its own benefit, and did not personally benefit Schwarzman. The CEO received $119.8 million in total compensation last year. A 2022 security assessment conducted by an independent security consultant found that Wells Fargo (WFC) CEO Charles Scharf “should avoid traveling by commercial ground transport or aircraft” for security purposes, the company said in its 2024 proxy statement. As a result, Wells paid $100,212 for Scharf’s personal use of the company aircraft and $3,454 for commuting using the company car in 2023. Additionally, the bank spent $81,264 on assessing and implementing residential physical and cyber security improvements and ongoing maintenance, of which $66,465 covered installation expenses, Wells disclosed. That added up to $251,395. Scharf received a $29 million pay package last year. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) provides personal and home security services for its CEO Warren Buffett. Last year, the cost for these services was $313,595. “Berkshire’s Board of Directors believe that in light of Mr. Buffett’s critical role as Berkshire’s CEO and given that Mr. Buffett spends a significant amount of his time while at home on Berkshire business matters that such costs represent bona fide business expenses,” the company said in its 2024 proxy statement. Unlike most other CEOs, Buffett does not rely on Berkshire-owned jets for personal use. Instead, he is a fractional NetJets owner, paying standard rates to access private jets for personal travel. He uses Berkshire aircraft for business purposes only, the Omaha-based conglomerate said. The 94-year-old received $413,595 in total compensation last year, which includes his longstanding annual salary of $100,000. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
