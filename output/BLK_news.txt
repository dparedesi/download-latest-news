Title: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit Lowest Level in Years Amid Whale Accumulation
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/12/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-hit-lowest-level-in-years-amid-whale-accumulation/
Time Published: 2024-12-04T14:27:00Z

* Bitcoin exchange reserves have decreased to their lowest level in years due to significant outflows since the US presidential election. * The outflows are attributed to the cryptocurrency market rally following Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance during the campaign. * Bitcoin whales have been accumulating BTC, with 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entering whale reserves in a single day. The total amount of Bitcoin exchange reserves has dropped to its lowest level in years after massive outflows have been seen since the US presidential election in early November led to a massive cryptocurrency market rally. According to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, over 171,000 BTC have moved off of cryptocurrency trading platforms since Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the election, leading to a market rally given his pro-crypto stance during the campaign. The firm’s data notably shows there has been a steady decline in Bitcoin exchange reserves since the beginning of this year, as there were then around 3 million BTC on cryptocurrency exchanges. The figure has since plunged to around 2.64 million coins. As CryptoGlobe reported, Bitcoin whales have been steadily accumulating over the last few weeks as BTC trades below the psychological resistance level around $100,000. CryptoQuant data shows that 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entered whale reserves in a single day late last month. A lower amount of Bitcoin on exchanges suggests that there is less supply available on the market, which if coupled with steady or rising demand could lead to a cryptocurrency price rise. The price of Bitcoin has been strolling to surpass the $100,000 psychological barrier after surging exponentially after Trump secured the US elections. The cryptocurrency is at the time of writing trading at $96.700 after moving up more than 40% in the last month. While whales are accumulating, the total holdings of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) offered by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, have grown to surpass the 500,000 BTC mark. Another entity heavily accumulating the flagship cryptocurrency is Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which accumulated an additional 15,400 coins for $1.5 billion earlier this month to bring its total BTC holdings above the 400,000 threshold.

The startup said on Wednesday that it has broken ground on the installation of 24 EV fast chargers at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The installation doubles the airport’s existing EV charging capacity. This is the second time Revel has partnered with New York’s Port Authority, which acts as the landlord and regulator for the city’s ports, to install fast chargers. The two are also building out 48 fast charging ports near LaGuardia Airport. Both airport projects are expected to be completed in 2025. Revel and the NY Port Authority plan to place the chargers — which will support both the Combined Charging System and the North American Charging Standard — at JFK Airport’s west cell phone lot, which is where drivers, including Revel’s ride-hail drivers, often wait for passengers to arrive. The ports promise to charge an EV from 20% to 80% within 15 to 20 minutes. Revel, which began as an e-moped sharing service before launching an all-electric ride-hail platform and building NY’s first EV charging hub, currently runs four public 24/7 fast-charging stations. These feature a total of 64 ports in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, and the company plans to add five more across the city, including the two at the JFK and LaGuardia airports. The startup’s playbook has been to roll out ride-hail services alongside charging stations so that the chargers see maximum utilization. Revel says its stations are used roughly 50/50 by its ride-hail drivers and by other EV owners. A Revel spokesperson told TechCrunch that the majority of those EV owners are ride-hail drivers for competing platforms — the company gives Uber drivers a 25% discount at its sites as part of a partnership with the ride-hail and delivery giant. In October, Toyota and Revel agreed to give Toyota and Lexus EV owners free access to Revel’s charging stations. “It’s impossible to electrify rideshare without an abundance of charging near airports,” Frank Reig, co-founder and CEO of Revel, said in a statement. “Revel’s JFK site will be one of the most used fast charging stations in the country, and with the Port Authority’s support, we’re on track to open it in a matter of months.” Revel launched its ride-hail platform in 2021, featuring an all-Tesla fleet driven by its own employees. But this September, the company laid off its employee drivers and implemented a gig-work system, where it rents out its cars to the workers. Today, its fleet of 550 cars includes other EVs, like the Kia Niro. Revel is funding the installation of the charging ports at JFK Airport. The startup has raised roughly $275 million to date, per PitchBook, from investors including BlackRock, Toyota Ventures, and Maniv, and is currently raising more capital to fund its expansion, according to the company. Outside of New York, Revel recently broke ground at a charging station in downtown San Francisco (it plans to open the station in the first quarter of 2025), and has plans to open a site in Los Angeles in 2026. A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch Revel has eight active leases for sites across the Bay Area, is actively acquiring other sites, and plans to open more than 100 charge ports in the region in the coming years.

Title: Predicting proprioceptive cortical anatomy and neural coding with topographic autoencoders
URL: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012614

Full Content:
Proprioception is one of the least understood senses, yet fundamental for the control of movement. Even basic questions of how limb pose is represented in the somatosensory cortex are unclear. We developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topo-VAE) to compute a putative cortical map from a large set of natural movement data. Although not fitted to neural data, our model reproduces two sets of observations from monkey centre-out reaching: 1. The shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates despite the model having no knowledge of arm kinematics or hand coordinate systems. 2. The distribution of neuronal preferred directions (PDs) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model makes several testable predictions: 1. Encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry of PDs. 2. Few neurons will encode just a single joint. Our model provides a principled basis for understanding of sensorimotor representations, and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, with applications to the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots. It is well established that proprioception is essential for effective for motor control, yet our understanding of proprioceptive coding in somatosensory cortex lags behind that of more studied sensory modalities such as vision and touch. Here, we use unsupervised learning of a deep neural network imposed with biological constraints to reproduce coding properties of proprioceptive neurons in area 2 of primary somatosensory cortex. With this model, we demonstrate that the tendency for area 2 neurons in close physical proximity to share similar directional tuning can be explained by local topographic organisation driven by Mexican hat lateral effects, a phenomenon that is otherwise unobservable with the spatial resolution of available electrode microarray recordings. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of local topographic organisation in area 2 proprioceptive neurons. We also predict that the structure of proprioceptive receptive fields is typically multi-joint rather than single-joint in nature and provides, to the best of our knowledge. We find that our model best reproduces the tuning properties of neural data when training on natural kinematic recordings, rather than those from a stereotyped task, underlining the importance of training on data that reflect the natural distribution of sensory stimuli.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Somatosensation includes the familiar sense of touch, provided by receptors in the skin, and proprioception, the much less consciously perceived sense that informs us about the pose, motion and associated forces acting on our limbs. Both are essential for our ability to plan, control and adapt movements. In engineering, the control of robotic movement would be impossible if the controller did not know the location of its actuators; correspondingly in human motor control, popular frameworks for explaining many types of movement, such as optimal feedback control theory [1,2], are dependent on feedback such as that provided by proprioception. Moreover, individuals with proprioceptive neurological deficits, such as patient IW, have profound motor deficits even in the presence of vision and an intact motor system [3,4]. Similarly, recent major developments in the control of limb movement through intracortical Brain Computer Interfaces are centred on restoring somatosensory sensory feedback as well as effecting motion [5–8]. Thus far, these efforts have been almost exclusively limited to the sense of touch, in part because of our better understanding of that modality. However, restored proprioceptive feedback is also likely to be needed to adequately restore functional capability [9–11]. Unlike hearing or vision, proprioceptive afferent pathways originate not from a single organ but from diverse families of mechanoreceptors within muscles, tendons, joints, and even the skin [12]. Proprioceptive information ascends within the dorsal column pathway through the dorsal root ganglia, the dorsal column nuclei, and thalamus before arriving in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Crucially, neurons are somatotopically organised throughout this pathway, meaning that neighbouring neurons encode stimuli from closely related parts of the body. This gives rise to the sensory homunculus, which results from the ordered mapping of tactile representations of the body’s surface across the cortical surface [13]. Although proprioception is generally acknowledged to be critical to motor behaviour, the corresponding proprioceptive maps ‐ particularly that of primate area 3a, but also the mixed modality area 2 ‐ are much less obviously structured than those of the touch (areas 1 and 3b). We know that the proprioceptive and tactile systems often encode overlapping information, e.g. mechanoreceptors in our skin and interosseous membranes respond to deformation and vibration, contributing to the sense of body position and movement [3]. Indeed, the firing rates of somatosensory neurons with cutaneous receptive fields in area 2 can be used to decode limb movement as accurately as those with muscle fields [14]. While proprioceptive cortical areas are critical for our ability to generate goal-directed complex behaviour it is unclear what properties of proprioceptive cortical coding facilitate this capability. Crucially, we lack an accepted hypothesis about the computational principles that drive the mapping of proprioceptive arm representations onto the cortex. The limited nature of our understanding of proprioceptive neural representations in the brain is in large part due to the difficulty of delivering independent proprioceptive stimuli in comparison to other senses, such as vision [15] and touch [16]. To overcome this limitation, we combined computational modelling and natural movement kinematic data to test hypotheses of organisational mechanisms that are currently beyond the capability of microarray recording techniques, where the distance between electrodes is too great to observe spatial organisation at the level of neighbouring neurons. This combination of experiment and theory has been useful for explaining population-level coding in other sensory modalities, such as vision [17] and touch [18,19], but has only recently begun to be applied to proprioception [20,21]. Much of the computational theoretical work on other senses has either focused on predicting specific neural coding features from natural sensory statistics [18,22], or has ignored the details of neural coding and focused on the spatial distribution of stimulus representation across the cortex [23]. Our chosen system was the proprioception of the right arm (Fig 1A) for which we had collected natural behavioural data from daily life in humans (food preparation, eating, etc; Figs 1B and S1) as well as constrained, planar centre-out reaching in both humans and monkeys (Fig 1C). This data describes the joint angle kinematics of the of the body over time and thus stands in for the proprioceptive sensory state. We aimed to relate kinematics to proprioceptive encoding with modelling and comparisons to existing single-unit recordings from monkeys. We formulated a novel computational model that predicts both neural coding of single neurons and the spatial organisation of these neurons across the cortex (Fig 1D–1G). We chose a small set of general computational elements that reflect principles and mechanisms found in sensory systems but have not been previously unified, which are as follows: Models should 1) use the information maximisation principle, which postulates that efficient sensory representations in the brain reflect natural sensory statistics, and implies that they are essential in shaping neural representations, 2) be stochastic, generative, and decodable, to reflect the natural variability in the data, produce neural activity to mimic that of the biological system, and offer the means to reconstruct the relevant original sensory input from its output, 3) implement, in Marr’s sense [24], neural computations that are performed by locally interacting neurons through synaptic interactions, rather than by an abstract computational machine.

(H) Flow of natural and planar movement data (joint angular velocities) in this work. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012614.g001 In the context of proprioception, these principles require that our model should learn how to translate proprioceptive inputs from movements of the body into a latent representation of proprioception (which is read out as neural firing). In addition to performing efficient feature learning of a spike-based code, the model should have minimal inductive bias regarding a particular sensory modality, in that it can be generalised to modelling other regions of sensory cortex. By training the model on natural movement stimuli, it should learn representations that can maximise information about the environment with the limited bandwidth of neurons that is available at any given encoding step, thereby implementing efficient coding [25–27]. Given these requirements, we chose to use an unsupervised deep neural network model, a variational autoencoder (VAE) [28] (Fig 1D) to perform efficient feature learning of proprioceptive stimuli. The primary training objective of an autoencoder is to reconstruct the input stimuli, enabling the model to learn in an unsupervised manner. Furthermore, in our use case, the encoder component of the VAE model parameterises a latent Bernoulli distribution to imitate the activity of spiking neurons. In following our third outlined principle and the observation that spatial organization is relevant to cortical coding, we introduce a 2-dimensional structure to the latent (“bottleneck”) layer of the VAE (Fig 1E). A conventional “vanilla” VAE model will capture the properties of encoded sensory features but would be devoid of any of the spatial properties of cortical neurons that are critical for determining how sensory stimuli are represented across the cortical surface. Incorporating spatial relationships in neural coding models has proven an important consideration for understanding neural computation, where anatomical structure and function in neural computation are fundamentally linked by biophysical constraints [30–33]. We therefore also implemented a topographical mechanism, using a lateral interaction term between the units in the VAE’s latent layer (see Methods for detailed motivation and mathematical description; Fig 1F). This term corresponds biologically to a spatial distribution of short-range excitatory and longer-range inhibitory synaptic interactions between neurons (Fig 1G). We call our model the “topo-VAE” and compared it with existing recordings from area 2 of somatosensory cortex. It could equally well be applied to other proprioceptive areas such as 3a or even 5. With further adjustments, such as replacing the linear decoder (or even the MLP encoder) layer with more elaborate architectures, it should be possible to apply this model to the study of spatial organisation in other sensory modalities, including touch, vision, and hearing. Here, the approach has enabled us to uncover novel insights into proprioceptive coding by linking anatomical structure and function so that we can test our model’s predictions using the sparse set of obtainable data. We developed a novel model of cortical sensory representation (see Methods for details) that predicts both function and structure–the topo-VAE model. We trained, and validated, and tested our model as follows (Fig 1H): We trained our topo-VAE model on natural daily human arm movement kinematics and explored the emergent proprioceptive representations in its cortical layer (i.e. the latent layer of the topo-VAE). After training, we used the model to generate neural responses by providing it kinematic data from a centre-out reaching task performed by human subjects. We then compared the properties of these simulated neural activities (i.e. the generated spike trains) to those of S1 neurons which were previously recorded from monkeys performing a planar centre-out reaching task, for which macaque and human arm kinematics are known to be similar [34]. We characterised the proprioceptive neural representations at two levels of description: first, we considered the spatial tuning curves of individual neurons and second, we considered the organisation of tuning preference maps across our model’s cortical surface. We used three sets of measurements to summarise the neural coding properties of S1 neurons for this centre-out task: 1) the preferred direction (PD) of single-neuron firing rates, 2) features of the tuning surface defined by firing rate modulation as a function of both direction and speed of movement, and 3) the overall distribution of firing rates throughout the behaviour. First, we analysed PDs of neurons in the recordings and in our modelling (Fig 2). The PD refers to the movement direction of the hand (when performing the centre-out reaching task) in which a neuron was most active. The tuning surface refers to the inferred firing rate response of a neuron to a given range of endpoint directions and velocities, which is generated using a Poisson GLM trained to map from x and y endpoint velocities to the firing rate of a neuron. We found that generally, the parametrically fit PD tuning surfaces exhibited by modelled neurons were similar in appearance to those of recorded neurons (cf. Fig 2A and 2B, top panel for the 12 best matches between modelled and recorded neurons, bottom panel for 12 examples from the ∼50th percentile of match quality. Further examples of each can be found in S2 Fig). At the population level, while there was a statistically significant difference (p<0.005; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) between the distribution of PDs of modelled and recorded neurons (Fig 2C), the distributions were similar in that they were both bimodal (S3 Fig), with a bias towards the 120°/300° reach axis (Mean: 97° vs 115°, natural-trained model vs recorded) (Fig 2D). Previous experimental studies have suggested such coding biases are a natural consequence of musculoskeletal constraints in the arm [35,36], which cause the natural distribution of right arm reach movements to favour the 120°/300° reach axis. Under the efficient coding hypothesis, this becomes reflected in the coding properties of the sensory neurons. To test this theory, we trained a second model on stereotyped movement stimuli from the centre-out reach task only. We compared the reconstruction quality (R2 scores) of natural-trained and planar-trained models by evaluating them on planar and natural movement data, respectively. We found that the natural-trained model generalised to planar movement data significantly better than the planar-trained model generalised to natural movement data (0.81 ±0.02 vs 0.73 ±0.04, natural-trained vs planar-trained; p<0.005; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The planar-trained model produced a PD distribution that was also significantly different from the PD distribution of recorded neurons (p<0.005; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), but unlike the natural-trained model, the reach axis bias was perpendicular to that of recorded neurons (Mean: 49° vs 115°, planar-trained modelled vs recorded) (Fig 2D and 2E). This suggests that certain features of proprioceptive coding are only emergent when the coding is conditioned on the natural distribution of stimuli.

Two such features were compared (Fig 3A): Half-peak widths measure how sharp the tuning of a neuron is, where smaller half-peak widths indicate sharper tuning, and velocity gradients measure how sharply the firing rate of a neuron changes as a function of the endpoint velocity in the direction of tuning (note that the velocity gradient measurements were adjusted to control for differences in mean firing rate between modelled and recorded neurons). While there was a statistically significant difference between the feature distributions of modelled and recorded neurons (p<0.005 for both features and all model variations; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), Jensen-Shannon divergence between distributions was minimised (Fig 3B and 3C) when the model included lateral effects and was trained on natural movement data. This would suggest that both model constraints are important for reproducing the tuning properties of recorded neurons. One concern was that the distributions of tuning curve geometry between modelled and recorded neuron populations were similar only because of the Poisson GLM fitting process–perhaps fitting a Poisson GLM to any random data would produce distributions like these. To verify that this was not the case, we shuffled the firing rate data from modelled neurons to remove any correlation between endpoint velocities and firing rates and trained an additional Poisson GLM on this data. The shuffling produced a very different pair of distributions for the geometric features, with flat, poorly tuned curves–suggesting that any similarities we saw between the original unshuffled curves were in fact due to similarities in the underlying structure of the modelled and recorded neuron data. This provides an empirical lower bound of the similarity between feature distributions, and would suggest that similarity between the distributions of modelled and recorded neurons is not trivially the result of using a GLM (Fig 3B and 3C).

We compared the distributions at different endpoint velocities and found that they differed significantly in both modelled and recorded neurons (p<0.005; two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test), indicating velocity dependence in both. In summary, modelled neurons in the topo-VAE exhibit various tuning properties such as preferred direction and endpoint-velocity modulation of firing rates which are structurally similar to those of recorded neurons. While the population statistics of these tuning properties differ significantly between modelled recorded neurons, the combined lateral effects that constrain our model and the training data that reflects the natural distribution of arm movement, increase the similarity, all without fitting our model to any neural data. Having demonstrated similarity in the tuning statistics between modelled and recorded neurons, we next compared the spatial relationship of PDs in our model neurons to those in the monkey brain within the constraints of the 400 μm spacing of the recording electrodes (Fig 4). While neurons recorded at two adjacent electrodes corresponded to a distance that was substantially beyond the effective range of the Mexican hat distance function, many electrodes recorded data from more than one distinguishable neuron. The distance between these neurons was within the local neighbourhood of neurons in our model. We could thus compare the similarity of neural coding properties (specifically, the PDs) between neurons recorded on the same electrode to the similarity between neurons on different electrodes (cf. Fig 4A). In modelled neurons, same-electrode PD differences followed an exponential distribution, such that the probability that two neurons had similar (within 30 degrees) PDs was much higher than chance (p = 0.81; Fig 4C., blue histogram). Conversely, the probability that two neurons on the same electrode had nearly opposite PDs (between 150° and 180°) was very low (p = 0.032; Fig 4C orange histogram). These distributions were significantly different for nearby vs distant neurons (p<0.05; two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test). We then ran the same analysis on recorded neurons (Fig 4C) and found that there was no significant difference between the nearby PD difference distributions (orange) in modelled vs recorded neurons when σ = 2 (p > 0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Different choices of the neighbourhood hyperparameter, σ, led to differences in the exponential distributions of PD difference (S4B and S4C Fig). Small neighbourhood values (σ = 1, S4B and S4C Fig, left) led to more uniform distributions, whereas larger neighbourhood values (σ = 3, S4B and S4C Fig, right) led to a more exponential distribution, both of which were significantly different from the distributions observed in recorded neurons (p < 0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). This would suggest that a lateral effect range of σ = 2 most accurately captures lateral interaction distances in proprioceptive cortex.

The model predicts that PDs are clustered in blob-like structures of similar PDs with boundary regions where the PDs rotate smoothly toward neighbouring directions (Fig 4D). This arrangement is interrupted by small, sparsely spaced “pinwheel” regions, representing all PDs in a small neighbourhood, which is consistent with same-electrode similarity of Fig 4B and 4C. Next, we examined which specific elements of the lateral interaction were important for reproducing the recorded data. We verified through model ablation the importance of the shape of the Mexican hat function (blue curve in Fig 5A), which determines the strength of excitatory and inhibitory connections as a function of distance between two neurons. We found no lateral effect function with a significant effect on input data reconstruction accuracy when compared to a model with no lateral effects (P<0.005; ANOVA). Flipping the function upside down (i.e., short range inhibition and intermediate range excitation, yellow curve in Fig 5A) eliminated the obvious topographic structure (Fig 5B, yellow box). Similarly, removing either the excitatory (purple curve in Fig 5A) or inhibitory component (red curve in Fig 5A) produced results unlike the localised topographic structure of our primary model against which the recorded data was validated (Fig 5B, purple and red boxes, respectively), suggesting that the specific Mexican hat shape was important for reproducing biological results.

(B) resulting PD maps for each function (colour matched to 5D). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012614.g005 We also investigate whether this topographic organisation emerges when the model is trained on shuffled kinematic data, to determine if the inherent structure of movement data (e.g. the covariance between joints and the constraints due to musculoskeletal geometry) contributes to the topographic organisation. We find that, while some level of organisation remains (S5A Fig), it is less pronounced (S5B Fig), suggesting that the structure of natural movement shapes topographic organisation in conjunction with lateral effects. In addition to predicting the spatial organisation of proprioceptive coding, our model enables testable predictions about the representation of movements involving multiple joints (wrist, elbow, shoulder) across the neural population. To obtain a measure of how the 3 joints (Fig 6A) are encoded across the cortical surface relative to each other, we found the average correlation with firing rate for all the degrees of freedom of each joint. All joints were evenly represented across the whole population (Fig 6B), but no neurons correlated with only one joint. Many modelled neurons were correlated even with non-adjacent joints, e.g. elbow-wrist or even all three joints, possibly a result of the natural covariance patterns that exist between joints. For pairwise joint sensitivity comparisons see scatter plots (S6 Fig). (A) Joint angle axes, 3 per joint. (B) 3D plot showing the relative sensitivity of each neuron to joint inputs.

The maps had a spatial pattern of ripple-like transitions between positive (white) and negative (black) correlations (Fig 6C), producing topographic clusters of neurons that are sensitive to particular joints (Fig 6D). The scale of these clusters approximately matched the that of the Mexican-hat lateral connection range. Regions of pure red, green, or blue in Fig 6D would correspond to neurons responsive to only shoulder, elbow, or wrist respectively. Instead, colours that are the result of blending two or more joints predominate. Here, we combine natural proprioceptive stimuli with a novel model of neural coding and topographical organization of neurons in somatosensory cortex to help develop our understanding of proprioceptive coding and allowing us to paint a picture beyond that we can see through the restricted lens of neural recordings. Core to our approach was allowing the model to learn to represent the statistics of natural human movements rather than stereotyped movements, which under the efficient coding hypothesis is key to understanding sensory representations in the nervous system [27,37–39]. Our topo-VAE is designed to reflect information processing in cortex: we hypothesise that the cortex learns, through experience, an efficient representation of the somatosensory world which we replicate here as a deep autoencoder network. The network learns a nonlinear mapping from kinematic inputs into a “cortical” latent space of spiking neurons, which embodies a stochastic, generative model of movement-related neural activity. While VAEs have been used before to learn both single neuron and population level features from spike train data [40,41] a vanilla VAE cannot induce a topographic mapping on the data. Consequently, they cause nearby input variables (stimuli) to be represented in arbitrary locations across the latent space. By contrast, the latent space of a topo-VAE is arranged as a two-dimensional cortical surface, thereby creating a population of neurons on a square grid. This enables a lateral interaction term between neighbouring neurons to be added, that shapes cortical activity into local neighbourhoods, allowing it to learn cortical-like spatial structure as well as temporal single-neuron activity patterns, both of which we compare to recorded neural data. Previous self-organising maps [23,42,43] operate on less biologically plausible grounds. For example, Kohonen-type maps operate on winner-takes-all, non-spiking activation (and consequently, their training updates synaptic connections in a winner-takes-all form as well) [43]. Therefore, only one neuron can ever be active for given a sensory stimulus in a Kohonen map, a property very unlike actual proprioceptive cortex. In contrast, any number of neurons in our topo-VAE can be active simultaneously (and consequently, all synaptic connections are updated as sensory information is processed). Likewise, Poisson GLMs consider only the input statistics when producing simulated neural responses. While it is possible to reproduce the coding properties of individual neurons from convergence of peripheral inputs to a GLM, those models can tell us little about the role of neighbouring cells in shaping receptive fields or neuroanatomy-neural function relationships in general. It is important to note that there would be alternative ways to introduce lateral effects in the latent space which might better reflect biological circuits than the loss term used here. For example, our current approach simply encourages nearby neurons to be active when driven by similar inputs, and distant neurons to be active for differing inputs. However, lateral effects in biological circuits involve causal excitatory and inhibitory interactions between neurons. Such interactions may be better modelled in a network with recurrent feedback, which would also enable the latent space to be conditioned on sequences of stimuli. Alternatively, conditional random fields [44,45] could capture this property without the need for recurrent feedback, by conditioning the probability of a neuron firing on both the input, and the state of neighbouring neurons (defined by an undirected graph similar to Ψ). Emergent from our model, were neurons with tuning surfaces comparable to those of recorded neurons as monkeys performed the same centre-out task (Fig 2A and 2B). Furthermore, higher-level features of the modelled neurons, such as PD distributions and the distributions of tuning curve features, were comparable to recorded neurons, particularly when the model was constrained by lateral effects and trained on stimuli that reflected the natural distributions of arm movement (Figs 2 and 3). However, they were not captured perfectly (e.g. the PD and tuning geometry distributions of modelled neurons were still significantly different from those of recorded neurons, p<0.005; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Despite this, the current model is able provide multiple predictions about the nature of proprioceptive coding, one of which we partially validate with our limited neural data. Future work includes identifying additional constraints that can allow the model to better reproduce neural data from proprioceptive cortex. The well-known somatosensory homunculus represents only the tactile component of somatosensation and its well-ordered map of the skin receptors. Since the human tactile homunculus has driven much of neuroscience’s intuition about somatosensory representations, it is tempting to hypothesise that proprioceptive representations might also be similarly structured. However, proprioception is driven not by receptors embedded in a “simple” two-dimensional sheet, but rather by different types of muscle receptors with varying dynamics, that span one, two, and even three joints. Thus, the expectation that proprioception and touch might share a similar homunculus may not be reasonable. Indeed, instead of a point-to-point mapping to the limb, in our model, we find structure akin to the pinwheels of the visual cortex, here representing hand movement direction instead of orientation selectivity. While the relatively large spacing of electrodes used to record neural data from area 2 does not allow us to confirm the pinwheel anatomical structure directly, there are signatures of it in the recordings, such as the fact that neurons recorded on a given electrode tend to have more similar PDs than those recorded on separate electrodes–a necessary, but not sufficient property for proprioceptive pinwheels. Our model predicts not only the spatial organisation of tuning, but also the receptive fields of single neurons–although this prediction remains difficult to test with our currently available data. We find that modelled neurons encode combinations of joints, both adjacent (shoulder-elbow) and distant (shoulder-wrist). Such convergence in monkey somatosensory cortex has been observed for the hand [46,47] and must be present to some extent in the proximal arm, given its multi-articular muscles. Our model used only joint-based inputs (i.e., the kinematic state or pose of the arm) but knows nothing about the musculoskeletal mechanics of the limb (e.g., the fact that bi-articulate muscles span multiple joints), beyond what can be inferred from correlations between joint angles. Nonetheless, multi-joint coding emerged for most neurons in our model. The correlations between motion of different joints that we observe in the natural data are substantial (4 principal components explain 80% of the variance of the seven degrees of freedom of the arm) and are the result of three main factors: 1) the biomechanics of the body, including the way many muscles span multiple joints, 2) the way the brain controls movements and 3) the tasks performed. Arguably, task requirements drive a substantial amount of the correlations. By training the topo-VAE on a highly varied dataset of natural movement, we enable it to generalise from these natural tasks to planar centre-out movements. Using this same dataset, Ejaz and colleagues showed that the pairwise similarity of finger-specific fMRI activity patterns in human sensorimotor cortex was better explained by the correlation structure of hand movements than muscle activity [37]. Therefore, the emergence of multi-joint proprioceptive receptive fields may be a further example of the shaping of neural activity by higher-order features of movements [48], analogous to higher-order features of visual receptive fields, such as edges in V1 [22]. It is important to acknowledge that while the comparisons between modelled and recorded neurons are promising, it is largely a qualitative similarity, particularly at the level of population statistics. Understanding what further constraints might enable our model to better reproduce these features will be an important step in further elucidating the principles that shape proprioceptive representations in the brain. We also make the key assumption that the proprioceptive organizational principles captured by our topo-VAE model based on the kinematics of human movement would extend to monkeys. While this assumption seems to have largely held, there may still exist differences that contribute to the inconsistencies between our model and recorded neurons. This may be addressed in future work using musculoskeletal models [49,50] to identify upper limb kinematics that are inconsistent between macaques and humans and filter them from the training data. Another key limitation of the current model is the use of only joint kinematics. Biological inputs to proprioceptive cortex are received from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, which convey muscle length, velocity, and force information. An important future direction will be to test the topo-VAE on such inputs, whether they be recorded experimentally or inferred from existing kinematic data using musculoskeletal simulations. Furthermore, because of its accessibility with Utah multielectrode arrays, we compared our modelled neurons to those recorded in area 2 of the somatosensory cortex, an area that combines cutaneous and muscle information in single neurons. Area 3a, on the other hand, has only muscle-receptor inputs, and shares many features with the adjacent motor cortex. One might expect an even closer correspondence between our model and area 3. Lastly, we would like to highlight the observation that, when trained on the stereotyped centre-out-data only, the topo-VAE predicted recorded neuron data more poorly than when it was trained on the richer natural movement data. We interpret this to reflect the efficient coding hypothesis [26], whereby a population of sensory neurons are optimised to code stimuli representative of those found in their natural environment. Such codes are well documented in the visual [22] and auditory systems [51]–here we provide evidence that this may also be the case for proprioceptive neurons. This points towards the importance of working with training data that matches the natural distribution of stimuli when modelling sensory neurons, as it suggests important features of the neural code (such as the complex receptive fields predicted by our model) will only be elucidated under these conditions. This observation may be of great importance for the many proprioceptive and motor neurophysiology experiments that have been conducted in highly constrained lab settings, settings that may not contain adequate ethologically relevant kinematic statistics to uncover the true coding of cortical neurons. Undertaking electrophysiological experiments with a broader repertoire of movements may affect proprioceptive neuroscience as much as the adoption of natural images did for understanding vision. All surgical and experimental procedures were fully consistent with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Northwestern University under protocol number IS00000367. All human participants provided written consent, and experiments were approved by Imperial College Research Ethics Committee under Reference No. 18IC3815. In the following we lay out the rationale for building our model and the model itself, the various forms of data we collected for model training and validation, and the validation methodology. The topo-VAE model (cf. Fig 1D–1G) uses the autoencoder framework to model sensory representations. Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient encodings of unlabelled data [52]. We choose a variational autoencoder (VAE) [28] because we want the latent cortical layer to capture the stochasticity and variability inherent to neural representations [53]. Let be a set of N sensory stimuli consisting of D features, following the natural behaviour distribution p(X). A group of cortical neurons, arranged in a 2D grid, are activated by the sensory stimuli X and generate firing patterns . This relationship is captured by the conditional distribution p(Z│X), which is dependent on p(X), and therefore intractable. However, it is possible to approximate p(Z│X) through variational inference by optimising a more tractable distribution, q(Z), to minimise the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which can be derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence between q(Z) and p(Z│X): (1) By maximising the ELBO, we avoid having to compute p(X) while still guaranteeing that the DKL[q(Z)││p(Z│X)] is minimised, since: (2) where log p(x) is a fixed quantity for a given X. In the case of a VAE, P(Z│X) is approximated by an encoder network qθ(Z│X) and P(Z│X) by a decoder network pϕ(X│Z), where θ and ϕ represent the trainable parameters of the encoder and the decoder, respectively. For a given data sample xn the network is optimised according to the loss function: (3) Where is the negative log-likelihood of the nth data sample (the reconstruction loss), and DKL[qθ(z│xn)│p(z)] is a regularisation term that pushes qθ(z│xn) towards some prior distribution (which can also be thought of as enforcing an expected firing rate on the neurons in the latent space). In a conventional VAE the encoder network parameterises a Gaussian latent distribution. However, we choose to have the encoder network parameterise a Bernoulli latent distribution, such that zn is sampled from a distribution of {0,1}, thus constraining the model to a spike-based encoding scheme (which allows modelled neurons to be analysed with the same methods as those used for the recorded neural data.). This sampling step is made differentiable (enabling gradient estimation of network parameters) using the Gumbel-softmax trick [54]: (4) where τ is the softmax temperature, which causes zn to become one-hot as τ approaches 0 (a value of 0.1 is used for this work), gi is a random sample from the Gumbel distribution G(0,1), defined by the probability density function: (5) and π = [p 1-p] is a vector defining the probability of a neuron spiking vs. not spiking, where p is set by the output of the encoder network for each neuron. For the Bernoulli prior, values closer to 0.5 enforce greater noise in the spiking activity of latent neurons. We choose a Bernoulli prior of p(Z = 1│X) = 0.01, which was found to enforce sparse activity in the latent space without decreasing reconstruction quality (S7 Fig, top panel). In a conventional VAE, latent neurons lack the spatial relationships that constrain neural codes in cortex. Given this, we add a simple organisational mechanism that links learning of neighbouring latent neurons, effectively implementing cortical lateral connectivity with short range excitation and longer-range inhibition, by adding an additional term to the loss function of the VAE (Eq 3). This term is constructed by first assigning a unique 2D position to each neuron in the latent space, defined by , which arranges neurons in an M × M topographic map. We then define a function, ψ, to specify the desired activity relationship between neurons. The Mexican-hat function, which transitions with distance from excitation to inhibition before vanishing [55] is a natural choice for cortical neurons (Fig 1F and 1G). For two neurons with indices, p,q ∈[1,M], the function ψ(p,q) returns the desired lateral effect between these neurons: (6) where d(ωp,ωq)2 represents the Euclidean distance between neurons with indices p and q in the cortical grid: (7) and σ is a hyperparameter defining the common length scale of local excitation and intermediate-range inhibition. As shown in Fig 1G, the transition from maximum excitation to maximum inhibition spans a distance of 2σ and the lateral effect vanishes at about 4σ. This term forms the basis of the topography in the topo-VAE, enabling it to learn both receptive field tuning properties (in an unsupervised manner through deep feature learning) and establishes a topographic relationship between neurons. To compare our modelling and recording results, we chose hyperparameters of the topographic map with consideration of 1) spatial densities of S1 neurons and 2) characteristics of the neural recording devices. The density of neurons in S1 is about 8M – 17M per cm3 [56,57] of which 70% to 90% are pyramidal cells [58]. The thickness of cortex varies from 1 mm to 4.5 mm [59,60]. The Utah electrode array has 100 microelectrodes arranged in a 10 x 10 configuration with 400 μm separation along each axis, thus spanning 3.6 mm x 3.6 mm of the cortex. We model neuronal anatomy as voxels or cubes, where the number of pyramidal cells contained within 1mm3 of cortex varies from 12,000 to 100,000, which means every 1 mm along the cortical surface crosses about 20–50 pyramidal cells (see Fig 1C). The electrode array therefore captures a grid of approximately 80 x 80 neurons (for an evaluation of how decreasing this grid size affects the reconstruction score of the learned encoding, see S8 Fig). This means the range of the lateral effect parameter σ translates to a 1–2 neuron spacing on our cortical model grid (assuming the radius of dendritic input to these cortical neurons of around 200 μm [61]). The precise value of σ was determined post-hoc using model selection by numerically sweeping through a set of values (σ = {1,2,3}) and selecting the value that best reproduced Fig 4C. It is important to note that Fig 4B and 4C were similar across all tested values of σ when the Mexican hat lateral effect was used, while no other lateral effects achieved this similarity at any value of σ. The topographic property of the VAE arises from the lateral effect component of the loss function (Eq 6). As a control, we tested our model with no lateral effects (Fig 5A–5D), and with several different distance functions (Mexican hat, inverted Mexican hat, excitation only, inhibition only; Fig 5F and 5G). The inverted Mexican hat lateral effect is the additive inverse of the Mexican hat function (Eq 6). Excitation-only lateral effect is defined as: (8) and the inhibition-only lateral effect is the additive inverse of the excitation-only lateral effect (Eq 8). From the perspective of probabilistic inference, this regularisation item is equivalent to amending the prior distribution p(z)) and modifies the target function as: (9) where the normalisation factor is a constant. In this form, both the firing sparsity and the lateral effect are expressed within the amended prior distribution p*(z) and the target function is maintained in a standard variational autoencoder framework. The overall total loss function for optimising the topo-VAE model is therefore given by: (10) where Ψ is a matrix representing the pairwise interactions between all the neuron indices in the range [1,M], with each element Ψp,q = ψ(p,q), and γ weights the importance of the KL-lateral effect terms during optimisation. For the model we present in the results, γ was chosen such that the reconstruction score of the model was not decreased by excessive topographic organisation. If γ is set too low, no topography occurs. If γ is set too high, just a few neurons (that are closest neighbours of each other) will dominate the activity in the latent space across all input stimuli, resulting in poor reconstruction. Based on this, we found γ = 20 to be an ideal value (S7 Fig, bottom panel). The encoder component of the model contains a fully connected hidden layer of size 500, with a tanh activation function, and a final linear readout layer with a sigmoid activation function. The reconstruction error of the model is measured using mean squared error. The decoder network is a linear mapping from neural activities Z to the reconstructions of the sensory stimuli . The topo-VAE model was implemented in Python using PyTorch [62] and run on a GPU workstation. All models were trained for 100 epochs using the Adam optimiser with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 400 (found using a random search over hyperparameters to maximise reconstruction score). We recorded full-body movements from 18 healthy right-handed participants in two experimental scenarios. In the natural behaviour scenario (see Figs 1B and S1), subjects performed unconstrained daily tasks in a working kitchen environment. As food preparation and feeding are universal behaviours, the only direction given to subjects was to prepare and eat an omelette. For this modelling work we used only the arm movement data (including wrist but not digits). The average recording time across subjects was 22 minutes. In the second movement scenario, a subject performed planar centre-out reaches in a 20x20 cm horizontal task space (see Fig 1C) to mimic the movement data for the monkey task. The horizontal task space was aligned 20 cm below the subject’s shoulder and centred on the mid-line at 30 cm forward of the chest. Arm movements in both scenarios were recorded at 60 Hz by an XSENS 3D motion tracking suit, a full-body sensor network based on inertial sensors. We used biomechanical models and fusion algorithms (including calibration and validation) to estimate joint angles. Fig 1A shows the biomechanical structure and coordinate system used in this paper. Arm movement datasets were formatted as time series of angles between segments following the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) Euler angle extractions [29] in a ZXY coordinate. For the elbow and the wrist, angular rotations of Z, X and Y represent flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and internal/external rotation, respectively. During planar movements, we used optical tracking as well as the motion tracking suit for capturing the endpoint (hand) position on the task square. Data from the inertial and optical motion tracking systems were synchronised manually via cue-based movements before, during and after the recording period. We computed angular velocity profiles from the recorded data and analysed the natural movement dataset Xnat and the planar movement dataset Xpl. The first two principal components of the planar movements explained over 95% of the total variance, but only half of the variance of the natural movements. This reveals that joint velocities of planar movements are highly constrained, as expected, to a 2-dimensional subspace. We applied the manipulative complexity metric [63] to quantify the complexity of the movements, which is defined as: (11) Where VAFi is the variance captured by the ith PC. Larger values of C indicate higher complexity and a value of C = 1 means that all PCs contribute equally to the total variance. The complexity of planar movements was 0.06, much lower than the natural movement complexity of 0.5. We defined the direction θ and speed v of planar movements in world coordinates: 90°/270° are respectively away from and towards the chest, 180°/0° are to the left and right. At training time, we also pre-process the input data. The empirical distribution of joint angular velocities during movements in our tasks is symmetric, unimodal, with sharp peaks at zero and heavy tails towards large speeds. To ensure equal contributions to model optimisation, these features are standardised without mean centring (since they are already approximately zero-centred, and to preserve the correspondence of a zero-valued input to zero joint angular velocity). This pre-processing also improves the training efficiency and convergence of our model without breaking the spatial structure of natural movements. In addition, since the original kinematic data is sampled at a frequency of 60Hz, we subsample the training data at a depth of 1%, to remove redundancy and improve training times, without significant effects on the outcome of the model. After training, we evaluate the converged model with data from the planar reaching task, which undergoes the same pre-processing steps as the training data. Preferred directions are one of the primary tuning properties used when comparing modelled and recorded neurons in this work. To calculate the preferred direction of a neuron (both modelled and recorded), we use a simple bootstrapping procedure. For each iteration, we draw random points from the dataset conforming to a uniform distribution of movement directions and fit Poisson generalised linear models (GLM) with angular velocity inputs to the firing rate for the sampled timepoints. For a given input X ‐ a T by 2 (number of velocity inputs) matrix ‐ the GLM model predicts a probability mass function of firing rates, y, according to: (12) Sampling y from this distribution gives a T (number of time points) by N (number of neurons) matrix of firing rate estimates. β is a 2 by N matrix of encoding parameters, which is optimised using maximum likelihood estimation. The preferred direction is then calculated from the encoding vector of the GLM as: (13) In these equations, a bootstrapped PD estimate of neuron i is defined by and , the GLM parameters for mapping hand velocity in the y and x directions to firing rate estimates. We take the circular mean of the PD estimates over all bootstrap iterations to find the PD for each neuron. This method of PD calculation is used for both recorded and modelled neurons. To quantify the sensitivity of neurons to specific joints (Fig 6), we individually perturb each input feature of the model and measure the Pearson correlation between individual neurons in the latent space and that feature. Since each joint is represented by three input features (angular velocity in the Z, X, and Y axes), we use the mean of the absolute correlation across all three axes to quantify the sensitivity of a given neuron to a particular joint. We used a combination of previously recorded data in which three rhesus macaques performed a planar, centre-out reaching task while seated, using a two-link planar manipulandum. A cursor displayed on a monitor tracked the position of the manipulandum and provided visual feedback for the monkey as he reached for a target on-screen. The monkey moved the cursor to a central target in the workspace. After a random delay period, 1 of 8 targets spaced evenly in a circle around the central target appeared on the screen and the monkey moved the cursor toward it upon an audible ‘go’ cue. After placing the cursor in the target for a random hold time of 0–500 ms, the monkey received a liquid reward and returned the cursor to the central target. We used 6 experimental sessions across three monkeys; two sessions contain data that has been previously published [64], and the rest will be published alongside this study. All procedures were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Northwestern University under protocol #IS00000367. Once a monkey was trained on the experimental apparatus, a 96-channel microelectrode array with 1 mm iridium-oxide coated electrodes (Blackrock Microsystems, Inc.) was pneumatically inserted in Brodmann’s area 2, near the intraparietal sulcus [64]. The implantation site was chosen to avoid cerebral vasculature and maximise proximal arm representation. All surgery was performed under isoflurane gas anaesthesia (1–2 percent) except during intraoperative recording to identify the arm representations, when the monkey was transitioned to a mixture of <0.5% isoflurane and remifentanil (0.4 ug/kg/min). The data were recorded from the microelectrode array using the Cerebus multichannel data recording system (Blackrock Microsystems, Inc.). Thresholded waveforms and timing of behavioural task events were synchronised and recorded for offline analyses. The position of the handle was recorded at 1kHz. We discriminated single neurons using Offline Sorter (Plexon, Inc., Dallas TX). 383 recorded neurons were found to be suitable for subsequent analysis.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Aluminum and Aluminum Mining Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Constellium SE (NYSE:CSTM) stands against other best aluminum and aluminum mining stocks to buy. Aluminum is a versatile and lightweight metal known for its low density and being roughly one-third the weight of steel or copper. Its unique properties, such as high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and excellent conductivity, make it essential in various sectors, including transportation, construction, and packaging. One of the primary drivers of aluminum’s growth is the increasing focus on sustainability across industries. With its recyclability and lower carbon footprint compared to other metals, aluminum is becoming a go-to material for green technologies. The automotive and electric vehicle (EV) industry, in particular, is driving demand for aluminum as manufacturers seek lightweight materials to improve efficiency and range. By incorporating aluminum into vehicle designs, automakers also meet regulatory standards for emissions reduction. Aluminum also plays a critical role in the renewable energy sector, as the production of solar and wind products requires significant amounts of aluminum. In addition to these industries, aluminum’s unique properties make it an ideal material for food packaging, and the construction sector, including infrastructure, and development. In the report, Opportunities for Aluminium in a Post-COVID Economy, conducted by CRU International, the global demand for aluminum is projected to rise by nearly 40% by 2030. The aluminum sector will need to produce an additional 33.3 million tonnes to meet this demand, with production increasing from 86.2 million tonnes in 2020 to 119.5 million tonnes by 2030 across all industrial sectors. According to the report, two-thirds of this demand growth is expected to come from China, which will require 12.3 Mt, whereas the rest of Asia will add a further 8.6 Mt. North American region will require 5.1 Mt and Europe 4.8 Mt. Together, these four regions alone will account for more than 90% of the additional aluminum required globally.

In an interview with CNBC on November 12, William Oplinger, President and CEO of Alcoa, said that he considers the Chinese market a crucial factor in the aluminum industry. He noted that China’s enormous appetite for commodities, particularly in the green sector, has a significant impact on the aluminum market. China currently produces around 45 million metric tons of aluminum, out of a global market of 75 million metric tons. However, the country has capped its production capacity at 45 million metric tons, meaning that any growth in demand will be met through secondary and recycling sources. In terms of near-term dynamics, Oplinger expressed optimism about the demand for aluminum, citing continued strength in the packaging business, growth in the automotive and transportation sector, and potential growth in building construction spurred by lower interest rates worldwide. Looking ahead to the long term, Oplinger emphasized the importance of aluminum in the energy transition economy, highlighting growth opportunities in areas such as electrical conductors, photovoltaic cells, and electric vehicles. On November 29, China’s finance ministry announced that it would be making significant changes to its export tax rebate policy, set to take effect on December 1. The ministry announced that it will cancel the export tax rebate for several products, including aluminum and copper products. The announcement had an immediate impact on the market, with aluminum prices surging on the London Metal Exchange. Traders are anticipating that the cancellation of the export tax rebate for aluminum will curb the heavy flow of Chinese aluminum exports, leading to a reduction in global supply and a subsequent increase in prices. As the aluminum industry continues to evolve amidst a changing global landscape, one thing remains certain, the growing demand for this versatile metal looks bright. With growing demand, shifting market dynamics, and emerging trends shaping the sector, now is an exciting time for investors to explore opportunities in the aluminum market. For this article, we sifted through Base Metal ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 companies that are involved in the production, extraction, processing, or sale of aluminum and aluminum-related products. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, as of the third quarter. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A closeup of a freshly rolled aluminum product being produced in a factory. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 Constellium SE (NYSE:CSTM) specializes in aluminum rolled products, structural parts, and extruded products for the aerospace, automotive, and packaging industries. The company’s clients include leading automakers and beverage companies. Constellium SE (NYSE:CSTM) is investing heavily in recycling technologies to enhance its sustainability profile and improve operational efficiency. On November 12, 2024, Constellium SE (NYSE:CSTM) made a significant announcement regarding a major breakthrough in aluminum recycling for the automotive industry. The company successfully implemented Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) technology at an industrial scale. This innovation addresses a significant challenge in automotive aluminum recycling, which is the proper segregation of alloy families. Traditionally, mixed alloys from scrap were downcycled, limiting their use in high-value applications. However, the LIBS sorting technology enables rapid and accurate sorting of aluminum scrap, achieving over 95% purity for both alloy families. This means that recycled aluminum can be used to produce high-quality solutions without compromising material integrity. This achievement has the potential to transform aluminum recycling practices on a global scale. The company’s Vice President of Global Automotive, Dieter Holl, highlighted the significance of this innovation, stating that it is an “unprecedented leap forward for the industry” and allows for the recovery of high-quality alloys from pre-consumer scrap, reducing the carbon footprint and supporting customers’ sustainability goals. Overall, CSTM ranks 3rd on our list of best aluminum and aluminum mining stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of CSTM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CSTM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Super Micro Computer has had its ups and downs recently but it’s still a major player in the AI revolution. Investors were reminded of that Wednesday, courtesy of Elon Musk’s xAI start-up. The company is expanding its supercomputer facility in Memphis to house at least 1 million graphics processing units (GPUs), the Greater Memphis Chamber said in a press release Wednesday. The bull market looks to be in full force as valuations continue to rise higher for many stocks. Three of these hot stocks that investors should be extra careful about these days are MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR), and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). Although they have generated some fantastic returns for investors, you may want to consider taking a second look at these stocks before deciding to invest in them, as their valuations are at absurdly high levels. The benchmark stock indexes keep climbing to new heights, but there are plenty of attractive wallflowers at this dance. A couple of overlooked dividend payers offer high yields and reliable dividend payout growth, but you wouldn't know it by looking at their stock prices. Shares of W.P.

Here's why the top-heavy nature of the Vanguard Energy ETF could be a good thing and why the fund is worth buying now. The energy sector is unique because the competition is high, and it is sensitive to changes in oil and gas prices. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) both are playing key roles in one of today's hottest growth areas: artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia sells graphics processing units (GPUs) that power critical tasks such as the training and inferencing of models, along with many other related products and services. Supermicro is a behind-the-scenes player, integrating these and other top AI chips into its servers and workstations for data centers. Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee recently told CNBC that he expects Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) to finish the current year "well above $100,000." Last week, Lee made an ever bolder prediction: Bitcoin could exceed $250,000 within 12 months, due in part to the adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT). The Dow Jones rose Thursday after the Labor Department's surprise jobless claims. Nvidia stock threatened to snap a win streak. CEO Brian Thompson was gunned down early Wednesday morning in Manhattan. A falling-interest-rate environment is generally a positive catalyst for the stock market. Having said that, there are some areas of the stock market that tend to benefit from falling rates more than others. One in particular is real estate, and it could be a great time to shop for top-notch real estate stocks while the Federal Reserve is still in the early stages of its rate-cutting cycle. The S&P 500 has hit record levels this year and many stocks have generated fantastic returns for investors. Among the S&P 500's worst performers thus far in 2024 are Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Sign in to access your portfolio

Managed by Fortlake—recently named Fixed Income Manager of the Year in Australia— the fund’s units will be transformed into digital tokens, a process called tokenization, where real-world assets are represented on a blockchain, the companies announced exclusively to Decrypt. The collaborations seek to simplify asset management by bringing traditional financial assets on-chain and expanding access to decentralized finance (DeFi). The trio believes the fund’s tokenization leads to new opportunities within DeFi, “such as integrations with lending markets, use as a high-yield stablecoin savings solution, or as margin trading collateral.” “Partnering with Backed, Sonic, and Chainlink to tokenize the Sigma Opportunities Fund is a substantial development in the way we provide access to our fund for the rapidly growing digital asset investor base,” Christian Baylis, founder and CIO of Fortlake said in a statement. “We believe this collaboration marks the beginning of a new era in traditional asset management fundraising.” As a global fixed-income investment strategy targeting high yield, the fund targets returns between 7 and 10%, according to Fortlake’s own product disclosure statement. Fortlake has over $1 billion in assets under management across all of its funds. Tokenization will occur using Backed’s Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS) platform. Those tokens will be backed 1:1 by units, ensuring their value corresponds to the real-time Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund—essentially the fund’s worth per share. “Tokenizing the Fortlake Sigma Fund is a major step forward in the blockchain landscape,” said Adam Levi, co-founder of Backed. “It showcases how institutions can use blockchain technology to simplify back-office operations and reach new capital.” The tokens will then be integrated into the Sonic blockchain, a platform capable of processing 10,000 transactions per second with one-second finality. Chainlink’s SmartData technology also ensures the fund’s value (NAV) is accurately recorded on the blockchain, the trio said. Chainlink’s Proof of Reserves feature verifies that the fund always backs the tokens, so investors know their assets are secure. Chainlink also uses CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) to allow these tokens to work across multiple blockchains. The partnership points to the growing interest in blockchain-based solutions for asset management.

Title: Why Is Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB) Among the Dividend Kings You Should Consider?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Dividend Kings List: Top 15. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) stands against the other dividend kings you should know about. Dividend Kings are a distinguished group of companies that have achieved at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. While some of these companies are part of the S&P index, the two categories are not entirely overlapping. The appeal of Dividend Kings became especially clear after the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. During this time, numerous companies either reduced or suspended their dividends, leaving income-focused investors disappointed. Many had assumed that dividend-paying stocks were inherently lower risk, only to face steep share price drops alongside payout cuts. However, Dividend Kings stand out for their remarkable consistency, boasting 50 years of uninterrupted dividend increases. This long history of reliable payouts provides a sense of stability, even in volatile market conditions. Investors often gravitate toward firms with a track record of consistent dividend growth, as such companies tend to perform well in declining or stagnant markets. Even during periods of strong market performance, dividend growers have captured a significant share of the gains. Following a long-term dividend growth strategy can aid in compounding returns for investors. A T. Rowe Price report highlighted that, between 1985 and 2022, companies in the Russell index that consistently increased dividends outperformed the broader benchmark. Furthermore, these companies exhibited lower price volatility compared to the overall market. Earning income through dividend stocks is a gradual process that requires patience and a commitment to long-term investing. These stocks are particularly suited for investors with a long-term horizon, as they have consistently outpaced inflation over time. According to data from Morningstar and Yale University's Robert Shiller, since 1871, the market’s dividends per share have grown at an annualized rate 1.6 percentage points higher than inflation. Moreover, the gap between dividend growth and inflation has widened in recent years. Over the past 50 years, dividends have outpaced inflation by 2.5 percentage points annually, and in the last 20 years, the margin has grown to 4.6 percentage points per year. During market rallies, dividend-growing stocks may underperform as investor enthusiasm and momentum often take precedence over fundamentals such as valuation and business quality. This trend has been especially noticeable in the recent past, with dividend stocks lagging behind the broader market. Nonetheless, maintaining a long-term strategy centered on dividend growth can be advantageous, as the benefits accumulate over time with each increase in payouts. Companies with solid fundamentals and robust financial stability are typically well-positioned to sustain and grow their dividends. In contrast, smaller or emerging businesses often prioritize reinvesting earnings into their operations to fuel growth. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend kings with the highest yields. Our Methodology: To create this list, we examined a set of over 50 dividend king companies, recognized for consistently increasing dividends for 50 years or more. From this group, we selected companies with the highest dividend yields as of December 3 and organized them in ascending order based on their yield, from lowest to highest. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 900 as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A stack of disposable diapers in the foreground with a mother and her baby in the background. Dividend Yield as of December 3: 3.51% Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) is an American consumer goods company that offers a wide range of related products to its consumers. Since the pandemic, many large consumer goods companies have increased their prices to counteract rising costs, which are now starting to stabilize from their peak levels. This has led to increased competition from more affordable brands as consumers focus on getting better value for their money. Kimberly-Clark Corporation peaked in August 2020, trading at approximately $158 per share. Since then, the stock has been unable to reach this price again and has actually fallen by nearly 13% during this period. However, in the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 11%. In the third quarter of 2024, Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) reported revenue of $4.95 billion, which fell by 4% from the same period last year. Under the Powering Care strategy, the company is fast-tracking its innovation pipeline and cutting costs to provide higher-quality consumer solutions across all price ranges. It is also streamlining its operational structure to become more agile and responsive in the market. The company is on track to achieve strong growth in operating profit, margins, and EPS in 2024 while continuing to invest in sustaining business momentum into 2025. Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)'s cash generation remained strong this year. In the first nine months of 2024, the company reported an operating cash flow of $2.4 billion, up from $2.3 billion in the prior-year period. During this period, it returned $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It is one of the best dividend kings on our list as the company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 52 years. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $1.22 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.51%, as of December 3. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) grew to 45 in Q3 2024, from 43 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $1 billion. Overall KMB ranks 10th on our list of the dividend kings you should know about. While we acknowledge the potential of KMB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KMB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: After Ripple’s XRP surge price now compares to America’s top 100 companies by market cap

XRP could outshine 86% of S&P 500 firms, including Pfizer and Citigroup. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ripple’s XRP price surge propelled its market capitalization past $150 billion, which would place it among the top 100 companies in the United States if it were a corporate entity. Data from CryptoSlate shows that the digital asset, whose value more than doubled in the past month to as high as $2.82 on Dec. 3, significantly outperformed Bitcoin by a staggering 200%. While XRP’s price has slightly retraced to $2.61 as of press time, the asset still registered an impressive 409% increase after the November US elections. Nevertheless, this surge has helped boost XRP’s market cap to around $150 billion, a more than five-times increase from around $28 billion at the beginning of November. XRP now ranks as the third-largest crypto, trailing only Bitcoin and Ethereum but surpassing Tether’s USDT stablecoin, the Binance-backed BNB Coin and Solana network. Market analysts attribute this growth to several factors, including growing institutional interest. There is optimism that a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the upcoming administration could further benefit both XRP and Ripple. According to CompanyMarketCap data, if XRP were classified as a standalone company, its market cap would rank it among the top 100 US firms, surpassing notable companies like Nike and financial institutions like Charles Schwab. Further analysis with Stock Analysis suggests that XRP would be the 68th largest company in the S&P 500, surpassing 86% of the stocks within the index. Specifically, XRP would be valued higher than pharmaceutical giant Pfizer ($144 billion), Citigroup ($136 billion), and defense contractor Lockheed Martin ($122.5 billion). However, it would trail behind BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, with a market value of $160 billion, and Uber, the ride-hailing transportation company, with a valuation of $150 billion. XRP’s market value would also be more than three times greater than that of NASDAQ, valued at $46.55 billion, and gaming firm Electronic Arts, worth $43.98 billion. The S&P 500 Index, which tracks 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the US, is a key performance benchmark for the American stock market. While it is not exclusively based on market cap, it is widely regarded as a critical measure of the performance of major US equities. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Conservative Microsoft Eyes Bitcoin As MicroStrategy And Nvidia Lead

Nvidia earns profits from bitcoin mining, while Microsoft contemplates investing in bitcoin (Photo ... [+] by Rasit Aydogan/Anadolu via Getty Images) Students of history know that even the most iconoclastic revolutionary sooner or later becomes a conservative. It’s no different in the tech sector. Those AI founders who are currently tearing up the rulebook? The decentralization pioneers building the next iteration of the web? One day they too will be legacy firms, grappling with upstart innovators in the battle to remain relevant. So when Silicon Valley aristocracy like Microsoft changes tack and embraces an emerging technology like bitcoin, everyone needs to sit up and take notice. Next month, the software giant that did so much to create the modern world will vote on ‘an assessment in investing in bitcoin’ — admittedly, in the teeth of opposition from many on its board. It’s not Microsoft’s sheer size that makes this so significant, although its staggering $3 trillion valuation can’t be ignored. It’s that the philosophy of bitcoin and blockchain runs directly counter to the principles of centralization on which today’s Big Tech monopolies were built. Were Microsoft to buy into bitcoin, it would be a not-so-tacit admission that the future is decentralized, and that even the world’s biggest companies have little choice but to turn their most dearly-held assumptions on their head. Microsoft is considering Bitcoin as an investment (Photo by Jeenah Moon/Getty Images) Let’s not get ahead of ourselves: there’s perhaps an equal chance Microsoft shareholders will vote not to put bitcoin on its balance sheet…at least, not just yet. The very fact they’re considering it at all, however, has ramifications for the whole crypto industry, financial markets, governments, regulators — in fact, for all of us. The early years of bitcoin were defined by intense skepticism from financial, political, and corporate elites. This didn’t stop risk-taking enterprises like MicroStrategy from going hard and going early. Michael Saylor was roundly derided for his bet on bitcoin, but the joke is now on his critics: the strategy has been insanely lucrative, with MicroStrategy reported to have made a profit of $11 billion on its investment at the last count. “Oil tanker” enterprises with a low risk appetite like Microsoft were never going to pivot so quickly. The question is, why now? Doesn’t Microsoft’s slowness, its caution, its which-way-the-wind-blows posture mean it’s late to the bitcoin party? MicroStrategy continues to invest in Bitcoin (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via ... [+] Getty Images) Quite the opposite. Microsoft is a conservative organisation, and its consideration of bitcoin is founded on a (perhaps, grudging) acceptance of important geopolitical, macroeconomic, and adoption trends. Thanks in part to visionaries like MicroStrategy along with major financial institutions like BlackRock, not to mention growing political and regulatory approval for crypto and its derivatives, bitcoin’s risk profile has changed. While Nvidia has not directly invested in Bitcoin, the company has significantly benefited from the cryptocurrency sector, particularly through the demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in Bitcoin mining. This demand has contributed to Nvidia's substantial revenue growth. Notably, Nvidia faced a shareholder lawsuit alleging that it misrepresented the extent of its revenue derived from cryptocurrency mining. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear Nvidia's appeal in this case, highlighting the company's indirect involvement in the cryptocurrency industry. Meanwhile, blockchain continues to innovate, with Layer 2 solutions adding new functionalities on a seemingly daily basis, and powering increasing convergence between the fiat and crypto ecosystems. These are just some of the key factors driving bitcoin’s transformation from a speculative asset into the basis for a conservative investment strategy. Microsoft might be classed as a “follower” compared to MicroStrategy, but it could well be a bellwether for other conservative corporations. There are many tech entrepreneurs who can relate to President-elect Trump. They see him (much as they see themselves) as the Great Disruptor: someone unafraid to shake things up, to shoot first and ask questions later; to coin a phrase, someone who moves fast and breaks things. On bitcoin, however, Trump is more of a weathervane than a signpost. His position has shifted with the wind — it wasn’t so long ago that he was calling it “a scam against the dollar”. His wholehearted embrace of bitcoin may have moved the markets towards the long-promised milestone of $100,000 mere days after his election, but the most significant developments were already in train before he’d even announced his candidacy. These were carried out not on the financial markets but in the corridors of power. Trump supporting Bitcoin. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images) You don’t have to be a bitcoin obsessive to know that Congress (along with other legislatures worldwide) has been working hard on developing new laws governing crypto and digital assets. This isn’t the place to cover them all, but they include legislation like FIT 21 in the US and, of course, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), widely recognised as the world’s most ambitious and comprehensive set of regulations for crypto. The intricacies and specifics of these new regulations are less important than the wider trend they illustrate. Governments, which fought for so long against the horrifying concept of money and financial networks they couldn’t control, have finally accepted bitcoin and blockchain as a fact of life. They are now drawing up a roadmap to institutional adoption. The momentum is all in the direction of regulation that brings crypto within established financial structures; this regulatory clarity in turn breeds the kind of confidence that makes even the likes of Microsoft consider moving bitcoin onto their balance sheet. The entry of conservative corporations into bitcoin has profound consequences for the currency’s trajectory. Naturally, when skeptics of this size change their mind and add bitcoin to their treasury, it is a huge vote of confidence that increases the legitimacy, not only of the currency, but of the whole ecosystem that surrounds it. Of course, Microsoft is defined by more than its age and outlook. There’s its balance sheet and previously-mentioned valuation — whales don’t come much bigger. If Microsoft enters bitcoin in a big way, it would cause tsunami-size ripples throughout the market. Moreover, remember that the company’s operating systems run most of the computers on every desk and in every home (and a decent proportion of mobile devices, too). It’s inconceivable that Microsoft would be content simply to hold bitcoin without finding ways to add value to both its business and its balance sheet by developing new crypto- and blockchain-powered utilities, and integrating them into its software empire. These are wild times for crypto, but the adoption by ‘conservative’ enterprises could also herald a new period of stabilization by reducing the influence of retail speculation on the price. A more stable bitcoin would, in turn, attract even more interest from corporations that were once reluctant to invest. Whichever way Microsoft shareholders vote, they should remember that success in business today requires the agility and drive to constantly rethink, reinvigorate, react, and reinvent.

Title: Wall Street stocks advance, dollar dips amid Fed outlook, political turmoil in South Korea, France

Business BOSTON/LONDON :Global shares were mixed and the euro was steady on Wednesday as markets digested political turmoil in South Korea, where martial law was imposed then lifted hours later, and in France, where a no-confidence vote toppled the government. Wall Street's major stock indices gained, with traders appearing more focused on the outlook for lower domestic interest rates and strong third-quarter results from the likes of enterprise cloud company Salesforce and chipmaker Marvell Technology . UnitedHealth shares gained 0.6 per cent even as Brian Thompson, the CEO of its insurance unit, was fatally shot on Wednesday morning in New York City, several media outlets reported, citing police officials. The S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent to 6,073 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped around 1 per cent to 19,680 - both record highs - while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.44 per cent, to 44,900. U.S. Treasury yields fell after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday the recent performance of the economy will allow the U.S. central bank to be more judicious with the future path of interest rate cuts. Given better-than-expected growth relative to expectations earlier this year, “we can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral” with rate policy, Powell said. In South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy, lawmakers called on President Yoon Suk Yeol to resign or face impeachment after he declared martial law late on Tuesday, only to reverse the move hours later. The crisis left South Korea's benchmark KOSPI index down 1.4 per cent, taking its year-to-date losses to over 7 per cent and making it the worst performing major stock market in Asia this year. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which counts Samsung Electronics as one of its top constituents, fell 0.15 per cent. Most Asian markets aside from South Korea rose. The won currency, buoyed by suspected central bank intervention, steadied but remained close to the two-year low against the dollar that it hit late on Tuesday. South Korea's finance ministry said it was prepared to deploy unlimited liquidity into financial markets. Reports said the financial regulator was ready to deploy 10 trillion won ($7.1 billion) in a stock market stabilisation fund. "Martial law itself has been lifted, but this incident creates more uncertainty in the political landscape and the economy," said ING senior economist Min Joo Kang. Meanwhile, in Europe, stocks gained about 0.4 per cent and the euro traded near a two-year low ahead of the no-confidence vote in France. French lawmakers later voted to oust the fragile coalition of Prime Minister Michel Barnier, deepening the political crisis in the euro zone's second-largest economy. Barnier's government is France's first to be forced out by a no-confidence vote in more than 60 years, at a time when the country is struggling to tame a massive budget deficit. The single currency, last at $1.0518, up 0.1 per cent on the day, has fallen 5 per cent over the last three months, when investors began bracing for tariff-heavy policies from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. US POLICY PATH Away from political turmoil, investors are hoping for more clues on the policy path the Fed will likely take next year, with a much-anticipated November employment report due on Friday. U.S. job openings increased solidly in October while layoffs dropped by the most in 1-1/2 years, data showed on Tuesday, suggesting the labour market is slowing, even as another survey showed employers were hesitant to hire more workers. U.S. economic activity also expanded slightly in most regions since early October, with employment growth "subdued" and inflation rising at a modest pace and businesses expressing optimism about the future, the Fed said on Wednesday in a summary of surveys and interviews from across the country known collectively as the "Beige Book." The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 3.3 basis points to 4.188 per cent, from 4.221 per cent late on Tuesday. St. Louis Federal Reserve President Alberto Musalem said he expects the Fed will be able to continue to cut interest rates, but warned that the pace of future actions has grown less clear. The BlackRock Investment Institute (BII) said on Wednesday in its outlook note for 2025 that it sees persistent U.S. inflationary pressures from rising geopolitical fragmentation, big spending on AI and low-carbon transition. In debt markets, BII raised its weighting on short-term U.S. Treasuries to "neutral" from "underweight", saying market pricing now roughly matches its expectations for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve next year. "We think it will cut further in 2025, and growth will cool a little, but with inflation still above target the Fed won't have room to cut much past 4 per cent, leaving rates well above pre-pandemic levels," BII said in its outlook. Markets are now ascribing an about 75 per cent chance of a 25 basis point cut this month, with 80 bps of cuts expected by the end of next year. In currencies, the dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, ticked down 0.1 per cent to 106.19. "Our baseline view is that the USD will strengthen in 2025 but face an air pocket of weakness early in the year on continued Fed rate cuts and uncertainty over policy implementation," Standard Chartered currency strategists wrote in a note on Tuesday. Oil futures slipped on Wednesday as traders awaited an imminent OPEC+ decision on supply, while a larger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles last week lent some support to prices. U.S. crude fell 1.57 per cent to $68.84 a barrel and Brent fell to $72.56 per barrel, down 1.44 per cent on the day. [O/R] In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin gained 0.65 per cent to $96,693 and Ethereum rose 6.19 per cent to $3,838 as Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins to run the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is seen as a crypto industry-friendly pick.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Small Cap AI Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verint Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:VRNT) stands against the other small cap AI stocks. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy joined CNBC's 'Squawk Box' on November 26 where he emphasized the need for a new group he has created, the Alpha Institute, which aims to advocate for pro-technology proposals. He highlighted the importance of focusing on long-term technological advancements, particularly in AI and quantum technology, which he believes are critical for America's future competitiveness. McCarthy noted that legislators often become bogged down in daily issues and fail to consider the long-term implications of their policies. He shared that three years ago, he initiated a course to educate members of Congress on AI and quantum technologies, recognizing their significance in various sectors such as energy and defense. He argued that without reforming processes like permitting and enhancing the energy grid, the US risks falling behind in the AI race. Later on December 2, Jay Jacobs, head of US BlackRock Thematic and Active ETFs, joined ‘Halftime Report’ with CNBC’s Bob Pisani to discuss the key themes to watch in the ETF space heading into 2025. Jacobs emphasized that one major trend for 2025 will be the acceleration of AI infrastructure and its integration into consumer issues. He outlined 3 distinct stages of the AI theme: the build phase, where significant investments are made in infrastructure; the mass adoption phase across enterprises and individuals; and the transformation stage, which will see entirely new industries emerge from AI advancements. Jacobs pointed out that during the build phase, ETFs focused on semiconductors, such as SOXX, and digital infrastructure like IDTT will benefit significantly. As companies adopt AI technologies, software names are expected to gain traction, leading to a transformation that could create new market opportunities over the next five to ten years. Methodology We sifted through media reports and ETFs to look for AI companies trading under $5 billion. That’s our definition of small-cap stocks. We then selected the 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

By replacing the legacy touch-tone IVR system with Verint Systems Inc.'s (NASDAQ:VRNT) IVA, the company has streamlined customer interactions. The IVA's advanced intent recognition and seamless integration with back-end systems enable it to accurately respond to customer inquiries, leading to significant cost savings and improved customer satisfaction. Verint Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:VRNT) Systems' AI-powered solutions have proven to be highly effective in driving significant business benefits for its customers and position the company as a leading player in its market.

Title: BlackRock bets on AI-driven stocks rally but US debt clouds 2025 outlook

Business Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., November 22, 2024. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo NEW YORK :BlackRock expects the artificial intelligence boom to continue to boost U.S. stocks next year and support economic growth more broadly, although rising U.S. government debt levels could threaten its upbeat 2025 forecasts. Innovations in AI technology will likely benefit U.S. stocks more than their European peers, while private markets will increasingly play a key role in financing AI-related infrastructure, the BlackRock Investment Institute, a research arm of the world's largest asset manager, said on Wednesday. "We stay risk-on ... and go further overweight U.S. stocks as the AI theme broadens out," it said in a 2025 outlook report based on views of senior portfolio managers and investment executives at BlackRock, which manages $11.5 trillion in assets. While U.S. economic growth may cool a little next year, the Federal Reserve will likely not be able to meaningfully lower interest rates as inflation remains sticky and above the central bank's target, the institute said. It does not expect interest rates to go below 4 per cent from their current 4.5 per cent-4.75 per cent range. Continued price pressures due to factors such as geopolitical fragmentation and infrastructure expenditure could weigh on the bond market. "We're watching very closely rate repricing dynamics, we're also watching very closely tariffs announcements that can lead to higher inflation expectations and markets volatility," BlackRock Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li said on Wednesday. Investors will likely demand higher compensation to hold long-term government debt to account for inflation and wide U.S. deficits, the institute said. This will put upward pressure on long-term Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices. "We are underweight long-term U.S. Treasuries on both a tactical and strategic horizon – and we see risks to our upbeat view from any spike in long-term bond yields," it said. BlackRock prefers U.S. corporate debt over Treasuries, as well as government bonds in other developed markets such as the United Kingdom, where the Bank of England will cut interest rates more than what the market is pricing, the institute said. In stocks, it favors sectors such as tech and healthcare, while it sees assets like gold and bitcoin as alternatives to government bonds to offset stock market declines. BlackRock this week announced plans to buy credit investment manager HPS Investment Partners for about $12 billion, in a deal that will further its offerings in private credit, a key area of growth for the New York-based asset manager. The institute said private markets can offer exposure to companies driving AI adoption and to infrastructure projects. Amanda Lynam, head of macro credit research at BlackRock, said on Wednesday global private credit assets under management are expected to roughly double to $4.5 trillion by 2030. "We are not at all, in our view, saturated, even in the North American market, which is the largest. We see a lot of room for growth in these markets," she said.

Title: SoundHound AI Inc. (SOUN): Revolutionizing Conversational AI with Voice Technology and Rapid Growth

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Small Cap AI Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SoundHound AI Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) stands against the other small cap AI stocks. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy joined CNBC's 'Squawk Box' on November 26 where he emphasized the need for a new group he has created, the Alpha Institute, which aims to advocate for pro-technology proposals. He highlighted the importance of focusing on long-term technological advancements, particularly in AI and quantum technology, which he believes are critical for America's future competitiveness. McCarthy noted that legislators often become bogged down in daily issues and fail to consider the long-term implications of their policies. He shared that three years ago, he initiated a course to educate members of Congress on AI and quantum technologies, recognizing their significance in various sectors such as energy and defense. He argued that without reforming processes like permitting and enhancing the energy grid, the US risks falling behind in the AI race. Later on December 2, Jay Jacobs, head of US BlackRock Thematic and Active ETFs, joined ‘Halftime Report’ with CNBC’s Bob Pisani to discuss the key themes to watch in the ETF space heading into 2025. Jacobs emphasized that one major trend for 2025 will be the acceleration of AI infrastructure and its integration into consumer issues. He outlined 3 distinct stages of the AI theme: the build phase, where significant investments are made in infrastructure; the mass adoption phase across enterprises and individuals; and the transformation stage, which will see entirely new industries emerge from AI advancements. Jacobs pointed out that during the build phase, ETFs focused on semiconductors, such as SOXX, and digital infrastructure like IDTT will benefit significantly. As companies adopt AI technologies, software names are expected to gain traction, leading to a transformation that could create new market opportunities over the next five to ten years. Methodology We sifted through media reports and ETFs to look for AI companies trading under $5 billion. That’s our definition of small-cap stocks. We then selected the 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A software engineer focused on a computer screen, writing code to create a conversational assistant. Market Cap as of December 2: $4.07 billion Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 11 SoundHound AI Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) is a leading voice AI company that empowers businesses to create exceptional conversational experiences. Its suite of products, including voice assistant platforms, natural language understanding, and speech recognition technologies, caters to a diverse range of industries such as automotive, television, IoT, and customer service. One notable example of its impact is the company's Amelia AI Agents. These advanced AI-powered virtual assistants have successfully processed over 100,000 customer calls for Apivia Courtage, a prominent French insurance broker, by November of this year. By automating routine tasks and providing efficient customer support, Amelia AI Agents have reduced the workload of human agents by ~20%, freeing them to focus on more complex issues. This has significantly improved both efficiency and customer satisfaction. The company's strategic focus on AI has fueled impressive growth, as evidenced by an 89.13% year-over-year revenue increase in Q3 2024, driven by the rising popularity of voice-based interactions and the increasing demand for AI-powered customer service solutions. As SoundHound AI Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) continues to innovate and push the boundaries of AI technology, it is well-positioned to drive future growth. Overall SOUN ranks 10th on our list of the best small cap AI stocks to buy according to hedge funds. As we acknowledge the potential of SOUN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SOUN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs close in on Satoshi Nakamoto, BlackRock leads the charge

The dominance of Nakamoto’s holdings faces potential disruption as Bitcoin ETFs continue their rapid accumulation. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin [BTC] ETF (IBIT) has emerged as a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market, now holding over 500,000 BTC and securing its position as the third-largest Bitcoin holder globally. With holdings valued at approximately $48 billion, BlackRock has acquired 2.38% of Bitcoin’s total supply in just 233 trading days since IBIT’s launch. By offering an exchange-traded product (ETP), BlackRock has provided investors with streamlined access to BTC, bypassing the complexities of direct ownership and reinforcing its commitment to advancing institutional Bitcoin adoption. As expected, Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive creator of Bitcoin, remains the largest individual holder of the cryptocurrency, with an impressive 1.096 million BTC—equating to 5.22% of Bitcoin’s capped supply. However, the dominance of Nakamoto’s holdings faces potential disruption as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continue their rapid accumulation. These funds, which already surpassed MicroStrategy’s holdings earlier this year, are now just 13,000 BTC away from matching Nakamoto’s monumental stash. Source: James Van Straten/X This race underscores the growing influence of institutional investors in reshaping the Bitcoin landscape. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are rapidly closing in on a significant milestone, with total holdings reaching 1.083 million BTC after a $353.67 million inflow on 2nd December, according to Sosovalue. In fact, as of the latest update from Farside Investors, BTC ETF saw inflows worth $676 million on 3rd December. Thus, to match Nakamoto’s 1.1 million BTC holdings, these ETFs would require an additional $1.23 billion inflow at current market prices. Sosovalue data further highlights that, aside from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), all other spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded positive cumulative inflows as of 2nd December as on 3rd December GBTC received zero flows. However, while optimism surrounds the institutional adoption of Bitcoin, critics within the crypto community voice concerns over potential centralization. They argue that entities like BlackRock, with its rapidly growing Bitcoin holdings, could undermine the very principles of decentralization that BTC was founded upon. Designed to empower individuals and reduce reliance on centralized control, the rise of institutional dominance is seen by some as a contradiction to Bitcoin’s ethos, raising questions about the long-term implications for the cryptocurrency’s foundational values. For instance, one user on X noted, “There once was a dream that was Bitcoin… this is not it,” Additionally, the latest filings by BitcoinTreasuries data show a dynamic shift in Bitcoin holdings among major corporate players. While MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 402,100 BTC following its recent $1.5 billion purchase funded by share sales, institutional ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT are surpassing corporate treasuries in Bitcoin accumulation. Meanwhile, crypto miner MARA Holdings has solidified its position as the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, amassing 34,794 BTC after acquiring 6,484 tokens for $618.3 million in recent months. This growing competition highlights the accelerating adoption of BTC among both institutional investors and corporate entities. Amidst the ongoing buzz, Bitcoin was trading at $96,635.38 after a hike of 1.35% in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap.

Title: Republicans’ War on ESG Has Reached New Heights of Stupidity
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/188985/ken-paxton-vanguard-blackrock-state-street-esg-climate
Time Published: 2024-12-04T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Eleven Republican state attorneys general, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, are suing three of the world’s biggest asset managers. Blackrock, State Street, and Vanguard, Paxton’s office claims, are engaged in a “conspiracy” to “artificially constrict the market for coal through anticompetitive trade practices.” The Republicans’ case seems to hinge on the fact that these three financial firms were at one point members of Climate Action 100+ and Net-Zero Asset Managers, “investor-led” initiatives meant to align corporations behind a somewhat vague set of commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The push is part of a yearslong effort by the GOP to target environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, investment criteria. The GOP claims that these have been a vehicle for major financial institutions to push woke, green agendas through stock ownership. In this case, the attorneys general contend that the asset managers have deliberately acquired large shares in publicly traded coal companies and then used their “combined influence over the coal market” to exert anticompetitive pressure in order to simultaneously “accommodate ‘green energy’ goals” and drive up coal prices, allowing them to see “extraordinary revenue gains.” It’s a wild claim on a few fronts. Coal usage has been steadily declining in the United States for well over a decade. From 2000 through 2010, coal accounted for an average of 48.6 percent of U.S. electricity generation. The last year it was above 40 percent was in 2011. Coal generation declined steadily—by about 10,000 megawatts per year—through 2020, per the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. As the Covid-19 pandemic set in that year, coal was fueling just 20 percent of U.S. electricity generation; this year, it provided only around 16 percent of power here. Coal production has rapidly declined over the same time period. In 2014, the U.S. produced more than one billion short tons of coal. Last year, it produced 578 million. Those declines are due largely to the shale boom, wherein cheap methane gas was able to replace coal on the grid throughout most of the country. Those trends have been especially dramatic in Texas, which is also a leading wind producer. Last year, Texas got just 13 percent of its power from coal; 22 percent came from wind and 51 percent from gas. The three financial firms Paxton is suing, moreover, have never given the impression of being all that committed to environmental goals: Vanguard withdrew from the Net-Zero Asset Managers alliance in 2022 and was never a member of Climate Action 100+. State Street left C100+ in February, and Blackrock transferred its membership in that initiative to a smaller international arm after the alliance announced that members would need to ramp up corporate disclosures and take some actions to actually reduce emissions. It’s a losing battle to try to point out all the incoherence here. Anti-ESG crusaders argued that asset managers like Blackrock were “discriminating” against oil and gas companies while those same companies enjoyed record profits and as domestic oil and gas production hit record highs. If the financial sector is orchestrating a vast conspiracy to undermine the fossil fuel industry, it doesn’t seem to be going very well. Whether any Republican elected officials actually believe that to be the case is basically irrelevant, though. As the next Trump administration prepares to take over, the GOP is presumably hoping to use the Justice Department and the many other new tools at its disposal to defend the fossil fuel industry against its supposed enemies on Wall Street, long-standing market trends, and even itself. Cases like this one are just more grist for the mill—however little sense they make. Kate Aronoff is a staff writer at The New Republic.

Bitwise outflows offset by BlackRock and Fidelity's contributions, totaling $1.03 billion in December ETF. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted over $1 billion in inflows during the early days of December, according to recent Farside data. On Dec. 2, BlackRock led with $338.3 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity with $25.1 million. Total inflows for that day reached $353.6 million. The following day, Dec. 3, saw increased activity. BlackRock’s ETF recorded $693.3 million in inflows, while Fidelity added $52.2 million. Despite Bitwise experiencing outflows of $93.5 million, total inflows amounted to $676 million. Cumulatively, Bitcoin ETFs have amassed $1.03 billion in inflows for December so far, bringing total assets under management to approximately $31.7 billion. Major asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others are contributing significantly to this surge. This influx coincides with Bitcoin’s recent price rally, which is again threatening the $100,000 mark, currently sitting around $97,000.

Title: Detached home by the sea in Blackrock for €1.25m
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/property/residential/2024/12/04/detached-home-by-the-sea-in-blackrock-for-125m/

There are a couple of options available to prospective buyers of Carraig Rua in Blackrock. The four-bedroom detached house was originally built in 1986 to include a dental practice and private residence. The owners lived and worked here until they retired about three years ago. The house has since been fully renovated and is now laid out as a home with no evidence of the surgery. However, it still has planning permission in place for a medical or dental practice on the ground floor. This makes it an interesting prospect for the likes of doctors, dentists, physiotherapists or psychologists who are looking to run a business from the comfort of their own home. If the potential new owners don’t intend to incorporate the medical practice, however, a change of use permission to residential-only will be required. The redbrick home comes to the market seeking €1.25 million through DNG. With a floor space of 210sq m (2,260sq ft), the property is in turnkey condition, and features bright and spacious rooms. The wide hallway allows access to all rooms on the ground floor. To the left is a bedroom with en suite bathroom, and to the right is a study and a large living/diningroom. A breakfast bar divides this living space and the long kitchen, which runs the length of the house. The bright room is lit up by a series of rooflights overhead and is fully fitted with white wall and floor units. Off the kitchen is a utility room and pantry. Upstairs there are three bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms and one with a walk-in wardrobe. The property uses gas central heating and has a C1 Ber rating. It is located on a laneway at Temple Crescent, just off Seapoint Avenue. Over the years, more houses have been built here on sites that would have originally been the back of the larger homes on Alma Road. The original coach house wall still surrounds Carraig Rua, with some of the blacksmith’s iron hooks still attached. Set behind electric gates, the property feels private and secure. The large site is currently set in concrete to provide parking for patients, but the potential is there to landscape the generous garden to create a greener space. This area is very popular with families as schools such as Blackrock College, St Andrew’s and Rockford Manor are all close by. Seapoint, Blackrock and Monkstown are within walking distance from Carraig Rua, with the Dart station less than five minutes away on foot. The owners are sad to say goodbye to the house that was a lot more than just a home. They will especially miss their lunchtime walks down to Seapoint, but they hope that new owners will be as happy here as they were.

BlackRock expanding in private credit BlackRock will acquire HPS Investment Partners, a firm focusing on private credit investments, for $12 billion, the company announced Tuesday.

[PRO] Scrutinizing policies more than data Ever since inflation in the U.S. shot up, the monthly jobs report, along with inflation readings, have become key pieces of economic data that swayed markets. With disinflation in progress, traders seem to be redirecting their attention to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies. December may have triggered the thawing of Mariah Carey, but stocks are beginning the month chilly. The S&P 500 was essentially flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.17%. The Nasdaq Composite, however, managed to climb 0.4%, thanks to Apple rising 1.3% for a new 52-week high. It's unlikely that stocks will remain in permafrost this month. December's historically the third-best month of the year, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. The stock market may falter a little at the start of December, writes CNBC's Bob Pisani, because of tax loss selling – a phenomenon in which investors sell assets that are making a loss to reduce the tax burden on other assets making capital gains. But stocks tend to regain forward momentum as the year wraps up. "These strong returns are historically often back-end loaded," said George Smith, portfolio strategist at LPL Financial. Moreover, in presidential election years, December typically moves up one notch to become the second-best month for stocks. As Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, noted, "When the market is up 10% or more with a newly elected President, it has never gone down in the month of December." Also, investors are likely awaiting the U.S. jobs report for November, out this Friday, before making any major moves. The numbers will be the U.S. Federal Reserve's last look at the labor market before their rate-setting meeting from December 17 to 18. The markets are currently pricing in a 72.9% chance the Fed will lower rates by 25 basis points at that meeting, a more optimistic bet than the 59.4% last week, according to the CME FedWatch tool. If the Fed does cut rates, that incision will probably scrape off any lingering frostbite on the stock market as well, in time for them to hear sleigh bells ringing. — CNBC's Bob Pisani, Sarah Min, Hakyung Kim, Sean Conlon, Lisa Kailai Han and Alex Harring contributed to this report.

Title: DEI is dead. The Establishment Media Just Doesn’t Want You to Know It
URL: http://www.newgeography.com/content/008377-dei-dead-the-establishment-media-just-doesn-t-want-you-know-it
Time Published: 2024-12-04T00:28:38Z
Full Content:
Even before November, the once trendy concepts of DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) were already sinking. Now the election of Donald Trump all but guarantees their accelerated decline. The DEI push gained momentum during the 2020 George Floyd riots, after being nurtured for years on most college campuses. Many companies, including Walmart, adopted its associated practices. But new research from The Conference Board indicates that over half of executives anticipate continuing the pushback of DEI initiatives. Among the firms stepping back from DEI include Boeing, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, and Black & Decker, and the biggest of all, Walmart itself. Like DEI, corporate types saw in ESG a means of expiating the sins of the past. Both draw support from cultural arbiters as well as corporate human resources departments and Left-wing non-profits like the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Open Society Foundations, and from “progressive” billionaires. Economics was sinking ESG even before the election, as its one-time promoter, BlackRock’s Larry Fink, has acknowledged. A recent analysis of major funds found that BlackRock and others who had binged on ESG have underperformed those funds not so encumbered. US sustainability funds faced their worst year on record in 2023, according to a Morningstar. The GOP takeover is sure to make things worse. Republican state legislatures – Florida, Kansas and Idaho among them – have passed laws that ban or limit the consideration of ESG, providing direct opposition to these green investment pledges. DEI is, if anything, even less favoured. The recipe of racial quotas and the systemic destruction of merit was already unpopular before Trump’s victory. Over the last two years, corporate DEI departments were slashed. One third of DEI professionals lost their jobs in 2022. The idea of racial quotas in hiring and college admissions is rejected by the vast majority of Americans and minorities. Trump is aware of this and, under the influence of activists like the Manhattan Institute’s Christopher Rufo, could ban aid to schools that adopt DEI and quota policies. Given the extreme dependence on Washington, bloated universities will either have to cut staff or change direction. To be sure, both the green and the diversity industries will fight back. Like the “climate industrial complex”, DEI has become a business that, according to McKinsey, was worth over $7.5 billion globally in 2020. DEI’s advocates, universities in particular, will look for ways to get around new directives and court rulings. ESG is similarly threatened by the ascension of a president seeking to expand energy production, continuing the US’s profitable role as the world leader in oil and gas. Given the inevitability and continued growth of hydrocarbons, eliminating them post-haste would largely deliver the economic future to China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, and hand more power to all those lovely liberal democracies of the Middle East. Worst still, some of these policies seem to have little apparent impact on the actual climate. For its part, DEI fails because it is based on a largely false notion of the nature of America. The US is far from the “apartheid state” portrayed in schools. Instead, it is an increasingly integrated country where minorities do not automatically back their self-appointed tribunes. Nearly half of all Latinos voted for Trump, as did growing numbers of Muslims, Asians and even Black males. The whole idea that people should be judged on their degree of victimhood – gender, race, national origin – strikes most as manifestly unfair. Critically, minorities no longer cluster mostly in ghettos and barrios. In the 53 metropolitan areas with more than 1,000,000 residents, more than three-quarters of black and Hispanic residents live in racially and ethnically diverse suburbs, ranging from 20 per cent to 60 per cent non-white. Minorities are also moving away from big cities like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Portland (whose city council is demanding reparations for the very people who are exiting the inner city). In contrast, their numbers are rising in many red state metros like Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Boise, and Las Vegas. Racial identity itself is changing. Elements of the Left favour segregating students, but the damned kids keep insisting on doing the opposite. Gallup has found that approval for interracial unions has risen from 4 per cent in 1958 and 50 per cent in the mid-1990s to 94 per cent today. The fastest growing race in America is mixed-race; one in ten babies born in the US have one white and one non-white parent, and 12 per cent of black Americans are now immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean, and elsewhere. The abandonment of DEI could actually improve race relations. There is a growing literature, including a recent report from Network Contagion, that shows that DEI policies increase racial tensions rather than soothe them. Luckily for the DEI mavens, much of the establishment media refuses to cover such analyses, responding to the ideological predilections of staff at places like The New York Times and Bloomberg. The demise of DEI and ESG marks a landmark shift away from a decade of incessant virtue-signalling. The debate should now focus not on some abstract notion of “justice” but on how to make life better for working people of all ages. We can expect hysteria from eco and social justice warriors about the imminent climate catastrophes or the return to Jim Crow, slavery and anti-miscegenation laws. Yet at least for the next four years, the promoters of both ESG and DEI will be on the defensive, as Americans continue to build – on their own – the world’s most prosperous, and dynamic, multi-racial society.

Title: SolarZero collapse: Angry tradies want to rip solar panels off roofs

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Workers from SolarZero protesting outside BlackRock's Auckland office last Friday. Liquidators says it's still too early to say if there will be funds to pay secured creditors. Photo / Dean Purcell SolarZero liquidators have moved to seize solar panel stock from contract installers. “But some of our members are saying ‘We won’t relinquish stocks’,” Master Electricians chief executive Alexandra Vranyac-Wheeler told the Herald. The hardware could be held hostage until SolarZero - or the liquidators now in control of the BlackRock-owned firm - paid out. And for panels that have already been attached to customers’ roofs, some Master Electricians are threatening, “I’m going to go uninstall them if I haven’t been paid for the installation”, Vranyac-Wheeler says. Her advice to members: Cool your jets. The Master Electricians’ boss said she appreciated her members’ anger, but had also told them to act ethically. Master Electricians had sought legal advice, which came through last night. “In short, members must notify the liquidators of any [SolarZero] equipment they hold so the liquidator can arrange for it to be picked up. It cannot be held back as a means of ensuring payment from the liquidators.” Some $4.1m is owed to trade creditors, the first report says. Her members had to appreciate that SolarZero operated on a separate model. Usually, an installer would buy solar panels and batteries from a wholesaler. With SolarZero’s model, the firm retained ownership of the hardware through the life of the customer’s 25-year contract. Vranyac-Wheeler said 15 former installers for SolarZero who were Master Electricians have come forward - including Laser Electrical overnight. The amount owed to the industry group’s members was at least $118,000. She said SolarZero customers had been looked after, but contractors had been left hanging. “Two non-members have also come forward. One is owed $70,000 who will probably have to fold his business,” she said. Vranyac-Wheeler said she would approach the Government about co-operating on a “retentions fund” or “rainy day fund” to aid small businesses in such collapses. She said a small levy on cable sales would be one potential way to fund it. The first report by liquidators Russell Moore and Stephen Keen revealed, as expected, that they were still in the process of getting a full picture of the amounts owing amid a complex structure involving multiple SolarZero entities and tens of millions in intra-company loans. So far they have found just over $40 million due secured and unsecured creditors. The Inland Revenue Department and staff are near the front of the queue as preferred creditors. Outstanding taxes don’t figure in their first report, but Moore and Keen wrote: “We anticipate there will be amounts owing to the IRD once the pre-liquidation returns are filed”. The liquidators say they are aware of 173 preferential claims totalling $1.8m, “representing holiday pay owing to employees for accrued entitlement”. Their report also notes unsecured employee claims of $3.1m, due to a per-employee cap of $31,820 on preferential claims. The Government’s NZ Green Investment Fund, which extended a $145m credit line to SolarZero - $115m of which had been drawn down by the time of the liquidation - is listed as the only secured creditor so far. NZGIF is the primary beneficiary of one of the two special purpose vehicles holding the securitised debt - on the face of things affording it a measure of protection as the liquidators continue to assess the group’s commercial set-up. The report lists 598 unsecured creditors, who have until January 15 to prove their debt claims. The report says at this stage it is unknown if there will be sufficient funds to meet secured claims in full, but it does not paint a promising picture. SolarZero’s primary assets - its solar panels and batteries (mostly bought from China’s JA Solar and Japanese firm Panasonic, listed as creditors) - are installed at 15,000 homes and the 25-year customer contracts associated with them were securitised as debt held by two special purpose vehicles, which were placed under Public Trust control shortly before the liquidation. “Accordingly, these assets are not available to meet the claims of creditors,” the first report says. The available assets - including some $3.6m in solar panel stock, which the liquidators are in the process of retrieving from installers - and $22,275 in cash in the SolarZero group’s bank accounts - are modest. At this point, the creditors’ best hope could be a sale of the business - which is potentially on the cards. “Since the appointment, we have received expressions of interest from parties seeking to buy all or part of the SolarZero business. “We are keeping an interested-parties register, and we are working to develop options for a possible sale with all other stakeholders and Verofi [the firm named as the standby customer contract servicer shortly before the liquidation].” The liquidators are also investigating whether SolarZero’s intellectual property is saleable - including its “proprietary solar communications apps” and its “virtual power plant” technology, developed in-house, that allowed multiple customers to sell surplus power back to the grid - as they did during the March 10 cold snap. Any buyer will have to engineer a turnaround. The report reveals for the first time the amount that US private equity giant BlackRock paid for SolarZero in mid-2022 - $110m - and that BlackRock vehicle GRPIII injected significant additional capital to the group since its 2022 acquisition, totalling $147.8m in addition to the purchase price. Separately, BlackRock has told the Herald it did not take any funds out of the business. It adds: “Operationally, the group was not able to generate profit, nor did it reach break-even”.

Title: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF Now Holds $48 Billion in BTC

The world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has quickly become a major player in the cryptocurrency space after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of various spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds back in January, to the point it now holds over 500,000 BTC. According to data from the firm’s website its spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) now holds a total of 500,380.09 BTC with a market value above the $48 billion mark, making it one of the largest holders of the cryptocurrency. The rapid accumulation, amounting to 2.38% of all Bitcoin ever to be created in just under a year, reflects a significant shift in BlackRock’s stance on the digital asset. CEO Larry Fink, once a vocal critic, now views Bitcoin as an “independent asset class” with transformative potential. It’s worth noting that BlackRock’s IBIT doesn’t hold BTC for the firm directly, but rather for investors leveraging its fund to gain exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency. Some of these investors include clients of Wall Street giants, including Goldman Sachs. As CryptoGlobe reported the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, has recently announced it acquired an additional 15,400 Bitcoin for $1.5 billion, at an average price of $95,976 per coin, which helped its total BTC balance surpass 402,100 coins. According to a post shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) by the company’s co-founder and chairman, Michael Saylo, MicroStrategy has achieved a BTC Yield of 38.7% so far this year, and 63.3% year-to-date and now holds 402,100 BTC that were acquired for $23.4 billion. The company has acquired its BTC at an average of $58,263 per coin and its entire BTC stash is now worth $37.4 billion. The move comes at a time in which Bitcoin whales have been taking advantage of the flagship cryptocurrency’s recent price dip to keep on accumulating BTC after short-term holders moved nearly $4 billion in the cryptocurrency to exchanges. According to CryptoQuant analyst Cauê Oliveira, Bitcoin whales took advantage of the “panic selling” to accumulate, with 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entered whale reserves in a single day after short-term holders’ sales. In a post, the analyst noted that the figure was “reflected in institutional addresses on the network” but suggested more BTC was accumulated, as the funds that weren’t withdrawn from cryptocurrency exchanges and remain in users’ accounts aren’t counted. Per his words, the whale accumulation hasn’t been sufficient to demonstrate a “more widespread buy-the-dip” pattern,” which he said remains concentrated among institutional investors.

Title: Crypto price predictions: HBAR, iDEGEN, Bitcoin

BTC/USD has been trading steadily above $90,000 for two weeks now; missing the all-important mark of $100,000 by less than 5 dollars on 22nd November. Even with the range-bound trading, the bullish trend persists. In fact, according to CoinMarketCap, greed continues to define the crypto market space. This week, the index is at an extreme greed level of 80 compared to last month’s neutral of 55. Even with the bullish trend, investors appear to be somewhat cautious. Bitcoin price has dropped by over 2% since the start of the weekend. As highlighted on sosovalue, BTC ETFs had daily net inflows of $353 million as of 2nd December. Of this number, BlackRock contributed $338 million with Grayscale and VanEck recording outflows of $28 million and $10 million respectively. The caution has further been heightened by the US government’s move to transfer Bitcoin worth $1.92 billion to a new address. While the intention is unclear, there are speculations over a possible selloff. In the recent past, countries like Bhutan and Germany have made huge selloffs of their BTC holdings. In recent years, cat and dog-themed meme coins have redefined the crypto space. While they are still a crucial part of the market, there is a new widely-hyped entrant; AI meme coins. At the center of this buzz is iDEGEN, an advanced AI agent born on X and shaped by the cryptocurrency community. So intense is its hype that its auction has already raised over $1 million and yielded gains of over 100800% to the early adopters. Interestingly, it is still at the experiment stage. As opposed to the usual presale, iDEGEN has chosen a different path; a dynamic auction. To start with, the total IDGN tokens are 11,111,111,111 with the auction being divided into 5-minute intervals.This means that every time there are consecutive buys within a span of 5 minutes, its price rises by 5%. If no bid is placed within two 5-minute periods, the price drops by 5%. At the end of the auction, IDGN launching price will be 10% higher than the final price at the auction. At that point, all unsold tokens will be destroyed. In addition to this pricing-based excitement, its freeness has further contributed to iDEGEN going viral. Unlike centralized companies like OpenAI, iDEGEN has no guard rails. In fact, the only applicable rule for this AI agent is that it has to post on Crypto Twitter(CT) after every 60 minutes. Between one post and the next, it internalizes the information availed to it by the crypto degens. This is exactly what the savvy investors are banking on; securing some IDGN tokens before its value skyrockets. Different groups within the CT space will strive to control this AI agent. This push and pull is bound to intestify its virality with the investors being the ultimate beneficiaries. Besides, the program’s unconstrained nature means that it can evolve in different ways. This includes trading the existing assets or even creating its own. With this infinite potential, the market’s focus is set to remain on iDEGEN for a long time. You can buy the iDEGEN token here. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) has been trading in the green for five consecutive weeks, hitting a level last recorded in January 2022 on 3rd December. Over the span of those five weeks, the crypto has been up by more than 700%. As at the time of writing, its market cap stood at $12.49 billion, up by 17%. Besides, its trading volumes were up by 61% over the past 24 hours at $7.55 billion. The hype around this token has more traders fearing to miss out on a profitable opportunity. As a result, an increasing number of investors are accumulating the HBAR tokens.

Title: Why Is Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Among the Big Data Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Big Data Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against the other big data stocks. Big data refers to large and diverse collections of data that cannot be managed by traditional data processing tools. Although the need to manage large data sets goes back to the 1960s and 1970s, it was around 2005 when open-source frameworks were created to store and analyze big data sets. Then, the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled gathering more data on product performance and customer usage patterns with more devices connected to the Internet. With the current expansion of generative AI and cloud computing enterprise use, big data continues to grow. According to a report by Research and Markets, the big data market is projected to grow from $220.2 billion in 2023 to $401.2 billion by 2028, at a compound annual growth rate of 12.7% during the forecast period. Region-wise, North America holds the largest market share, driven by early adoption of big data solutions, a mature IT infrastructure, and a strong focus on innovation. Simultaneously, Asia Pacific serves as the fastest-growing segment in the market as a result of rapid digitization, proactive government support for technological advancements, and growing internet connectivity. Big data offers numerous benefits such as enhancing predictive capabilities, better insights, strategic decision-making, personalized customer experiences, and improved operational efficiency. The use cases for big data are diverse spanning various industries including retail and ecommerce, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, as well as government and public services. For instance, the e-commerce giant Amazon utilizes big data gathered from customers to fine-tune its recommendation engine to recommend products to customers who tend to feel overwhelmed by the variety of choices available to them in the modern era. Such suggestions tend to drive impulsive purchases. Simultaneously, the biotech leader AstraZeneca has unlocked the potential of data and AI-driven drug discovery and development. The firm claimed to hold a vast trove of oncology data from numerous consenting patients, including clinical, imaging, and multi-omics data. This data is fed by the firm's Oncology Data Science team into a system that uses AI and other statistical tools to generate novel hypotheses in oncology drug development. Other than data from its clinical trials, the firm also collaborates with external companies to leverage real-world data that represents patients from across the globe. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 12 best big data stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we went through relevant ETFs and media reports to make a list of big data stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 12 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 12 best big data stocks to buy according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q3. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:PLTR) is an American software company focused on big data analytics. The firm makes products for human-driven analysis of real-world data and focuses on creating the world’s best user experience for working with data.

The US market remains the core of the firm’s business and growth, with the US institutions rapidly adopting the firm’s platforms and artificial intelligence capabilities more broadly. Palantir is experiencing an unwavering demand for its advanced artificial intelligence technologies from the US government and commercial customers. The third quarter was definitely strong for Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) amidst the unrelenting AI demand from the US. The firm generated the largest profit in the company’s twenty-year history, reaching $144 million in net income. Palantir reported revenue growth of 30% year-over-year while U.S. revenue grew 44% year-over-year. The firm was also successful in boosting its customer count by 39% year-over-year. Thus, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a leading big data stock that is witnessing accelerating business growth under a U.S.-driven AI revolution. As of Q3, the stock is held by 43 hedge funds. Overall PLTR ranks 9th on our list of the best big data stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Tara Reade: Biden’s foreign policy isn’t just a failure, it’s an existential crisis

You can find Tara’s work at tarareadepodcast.com The US government has long touted its role as a beacon of diplomacy and stability, but the Biden administration’s foreign policy lays bare the tragic reality: A pattern of hubris, aggression, and reckless decision-making. Instead of fostering peace, key players such as Antony Blinken, Victoria Nuland, James Rubin, and Jake Sullivan have driven the US to the brink of World War III by engaging in dangerous provocations with Russia. These figures are well known, although some remain in the shadows more than others. For instance, Rubin has worked with Biden since the 1990s and was mentored by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. You rarely see him in front of the cameras but his hawkish diplomacy style (or lack thereof) has its fingerprints all over the Biden regime’s foreign policy positions. The escalation didn’t begin with Joe Biden either. Former President Barack Obama and other elites were all over Ukraine’s 2014 Maidan coup, where the US helped orchestrate the ousting of a democratically elected government, one that had sought cooperation with Moscow. For the past eight years, this interventionist, aggressive approach has left a trail of destruction, destabilizing Eastern Europe and alienating nations that have long resisted the West’s hegemony. Yet, under Biden, this dangerous trajectory has accelerated. Let’s consider the Minsk agreements, which were supposed to be a roadmap to peace in eastern Ukraine. Instead of pressuring Kiev to honor its commitments, Washington abandoned diplomacy and doubled down on its anti-Russia stance, pushing NATO’s military infrastructure ever closer to Russia’s borders. These actions ignored years of warnings from experts who cautioned that such moves would leave Moscow with no choice but to respond. Not to mention the thousands of sanctions against Russia in an attempt to freeze its economy. But Russia has proven as impervious to frozen assets as it is to winter. The Russian economy is now ranked fourth in the world by purchasing power parity. The Biden administration has effectively surrounded itself with hawks who are less interested in negotiation and more intent on maintaining US dominance at any cost. Victoria Nuland, the former under secretary of state infamous for her leaked “F**k the EU” comment during the Maidan crisis, embodies the disdain for genuine diplomacy that has infected Washington. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, with his unyielding approach to international relations, has proven incapable of understanding the value of compromise. Meanwhile, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan’s focus on projecting short-term US power undermines long-term global stability. Sullivan’s anti-China sentiments are also well known. The nightmare team Biden and Obama had around them are a reason for failed diplomacy, the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, and endless wars amping up. It is well known that Washington has turned Ukraine into a proxy battlefield and Blackrock playground. According to General Michael Flynn in a recent X panel that I also took part in, Ukraine is a big money laundering scheme for the globalist elites. Biden has been feeding billions of taxpayer dollars into a war effort designed not to protect Ukrainian sovereignty but to weaken Russia as a front to enrich a few and destroy many. This unconscionable strategy has brought the world closer to nuclear confrontation than at any point since the Cold War. The administration’s insistence on escalation, rather than conversation, demonstrates a stunning disregard for human life – not just in Eastern Europe but worldwide. Yet the failures of US foreign policy don’t end there. By treating Russia as a pariah state and dismissing its legitimate security concerns, the Biden administration has pushed Moscow into strengthening alliances with other global powers, most notably China. The US’ actions have also alienated the Global South, where nations increasingly view Washington as a destabilizing force. The BRICS group – which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, and the UAE – has emerged as a counterweight to US hegemony, with its member nations openly rejecting the dollar’s dominance and the unipolar world order. The tragedy is that this was all avoidable. Washington had countless opportunities to engage in meaningful dialogue with Moscow. Instead, it chose the path of arrogance, dismissing diplomacy as weakness and treating great-power competition as a zero-sum game. In doing so, the Biden administration has not only endangered the American people but also placed the entire world on the precipice of a nuclear exchange. As someone who has seen the darker side of US politics, I know firsthand how Washington’s obsession with power can leave devastation in its wake. The Biden administration’s foreign policy isn’t just a failure – it’s an existential crisis. The question now is whether there is still time to change course. The stakes could not be higher. The world doesn’t need more war. The world needs leaders who are not interested in profiting from war, but in stability and peace. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been showing patience so far. As he has stated many times, Russia truly does not want to war with NATO and the US, but how many more of Russia’s red lines will be crossed? The clock is ticking until President-elect Donald Trump takes office – hopefully with a different foreign policy strategy. Until that happens, we are all living on borrowed time.

Title: ‘Illegal weaponization’: States sue coal-industry investors for threatening energy supplies

By Bob Unruh December 3, 2024 Multiple states have joined in a lawsuit against several major investors in the coal industry far taking their climate change ideology too far – and actually threatening the nation’s energy supply. Fox News reports Wyoming, Texas, West Virginia and eight other states have gone to court against BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, charging the industrial investing giants bought into and then used their leverage with various coal companies to “artificially” limit the industry. “These companies should only be maximizing returns for investors, not working to advance their radical climate change agenda by leveraging their holdings and pressuring American energy companies,” charged West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.

According to the report, he warned his state stood to be directly harmed by the actions alleged as coal-fired power plants account for nearly 90% of Mountaineers’ electricity generation in 2022. Other states that are plaintiffs in the case include Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana and Nebraska. The West Virginia Office of Miners’ Health & Safety reported 55,000 West Virginians work in coal mines as of 2023. Ken Paxton, the attorney general for Texas, said, “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. “BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices. Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers. This is a stunning violation of state and federal law.” A report at Cowboy State Daily explained Wyoming’s concerns. The report said the lawsuit is over “three massive investors” who are accused of “colluding to downsize coal companies in the name of achieving net-zero carbon emissions, and driving up energy prices for Americans and monopolizing the market in the process.” The report explained the defendants “all acquired large percentages of major coal companies, then used their influence to bully the companies into cutting production.” A statement from Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon’s office said the defendants, each, “has individually acquired substantial stockholdings in every significant publicly held coal producer in the United States. Each thereby has acquired the power to influence the policies of these competing companies and significantly diminish competition in the coal markets.” The defendants in 2021 had confirmed they would be activists in the climate agenda, with goals of cutting coal out of the energy production industry as much as possible. Gordon said, “Under the guise of ESG policies, (the investors) have leveraged their holdings and voted their shares to artificially constrain the supply of coal and significantly diminish competition in the markets for coal, which resulted in increased energy prices for American consumers and extraordinary profits for the asset managers.” The case seeks a court declaration the companies “violated an anti-monopoly federal law; to award damages to the states; to stop the investors from using their stock, proxy voting or other means to restrain coal output; and make the investors pay civil fines and penalties for violating a Texas business law, among other penalties,” the report said. The investors own about 30% of Peabody Energy, 34% of Arch Resources and small portions of other coal companies, like Black Hills Corp., the report said. Congress, since 1914, has banned acquiring stock where the effect is to substantially lessen competition. The report explained, “From 2019 through 2022, Peabody Energy’s production fell by 34.7 million tons, or 25.5%, says the complaint. Its revenues rose by $358.5 million during the same period, and its profits soared by $1.593 billion, or 853.9%. Arch Resources’ production fell by 9.4 million tons over that timeframe, or 11.7%, while its revenues rose by $1.448 billion and its profits skyrocketed by $1.097 billion, or 469.2%, says the complaint.” Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists.

Title: BlackRock More Than Doubles Private Credit Business With HPS Investment Partners Acquisition

BlackRock announced Tuesday that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire private credit manager HPS Investment Partners LLC for $12 billion. The transaction is expected to close by the middle of 2025. HPS manages $148 billion in combined assets across both private credit and public credit strategies. The acquisition would more than double BlackRock’s $90 billion in private debt assets. The firm manages more than $11 trillion in total. According to the most recent figures from HPS, the fund’s private credit assets under management total about $123 billion, with public credit AUM of about $22 billion. “The combined private credit franchise will work side-by-side with BlackRock’s $3 trillion public fixed income business to provide both public and private income solutions for clients across their whole portfolios,” according to a BlackRock statement.

Sign up for CIO newsletters.  The credit manager was said to have been in talks with multiple suitors, including CVC Capital Partners, and considered an initial public offering, according to Bloomberg. Emirati fund Lunate reportedly also considered taking a minority stake in the manager. The acquisition would mark one of the largest acquisitions of a private credit manager, as banks and other financial institutions do not want to be left behind in the private credit boom. In 2019, Brookfield Asset Management acquired a 62% stake in credit manager Oaktree, adding $120 billion in assets. Brookfield managed $350 billion at the time. In late 2023, TPG ($213 billion assets under management) completed the $2.7 billion acquisition of Angelo Gordon, which managed $74 billion in credit and real estate assets at the time. Several banks have formed partnerships with private credit managers, such as a $25 billion alliance between Citi and Apollo Global Management, focused on direct lending, announced in September. In October, JPMorganChase announced partnerships with Cliffwater, FS Investments and Shankman Capital Management. According to PitchBook, institutional private credit AUM exceeded $1.6 trillion, as of December 31, 2023, with $520.2 billion in dry powder, according to the firm’s mid-2024 private debt report. In total, across institutional, retail and insurance funds, AUM exceeded $2 trillion. According to a statement, BlackRock expects the private debt market to grow to $4.5 trillion by 2030, more than doubling today’s figures. In October, BlackRock finalized the acquisition of infrastructure asset manager Global Infrastructure Partners, which managed $170 billion in assets. In July, the firm announced plans to acquire data provider Preqin for $3.2 billion. “For over 35 years, BlackRock has grown and evolved alongside the capital markets. With GIP, and now HPS, we are expanding our private markets capabilities across our comprehensive global platform,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a statement. “Our Aladdin technology, including eFront, and soon Preqin, will make access to private markets simpler and more transparent. These capabilities, together with our global reach, deep relationships, and powerful technology, differentiate our ability to serve clients.” Related Stories: BlackRock to Acquire Alternatives Data Provider Preqin Takeaways From BlackRock CEO Fink’s Annual Letter BlackRock’s Purchase of GIP Deepens Its Alts Exposure Tags: BlackRock, HPS Investment Partners, Larry Fink, Private Credit « WAMCO Appoints New CEO After Former CIO Charged With Fraud

Title: Why ConocoPhillips (COP) Has the Biggest Upside Potential Among Oil Stocks

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against the other oil stocks with biggest upside potential. In an interview with CNBC on November 26, Daan Struyven, Co-Head of Global Commodities Research at Goldman Sachs, discussed the current state of the oil market and the potential impact of a ceasefire in the Middle East on oil prices. Struyven noted that while the geopolitical risk premium in oil prices was fairly modest, he thinks that the market is focused on risks with a clear path to lower production. The market has not yet fully priced into this possibility, and the current price of oil is too low compared to inventory fundamentals. Struyven pointed out that global oil inventories have edged down this year, and the market has been in a deficit of around 0.5% of global markets. He thinks that many oil investors are pricing in a large surplus for 2025, which Struyven believes is not done yet and he sees significant upside risk to prices in the short term, potentially coming from lower production from Iran. READ ALSO: 12 Best ADR Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts and Top 8 Stocks To Buy In 8 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months. Struyven noted that while the Trump administration's goals are achievable, they are largely driven by technological advancements and LNG export plans that are already underway despite any policy change. He also agreed that the big oil companies are not eager to spend more money on production on current oil prices. Struyven also highlighted OPEC's influence on the market, emphasizing Saudi Arabia's preference for higher oil prices. He suggested that OPEC would likely defend a price floor of around $70 per barrel but would not hesitate to increase supply if prices climb above $80. This aligns with his expectation that oil prices will remain within a range of $70 to $85 per barrel. Finally, Struyven attributed the changes in the oil market to the success of US shale production, which has accounted for 100% of global oil production growth over the past decade. This has put downward pressure on long-term prices, making it less likely for oil prices to spike above $100 as they did in the past. The oil market is influenced by a range of factors, including geopolitical risks, production levels, and OPEC's strategies. The potential for a ceasefire in the Middle East, for example, could impact prices, but the geopolitical risk premium is still relatively modest. Despite this, oil prices remain lower than expected based on inventory fundamentals. While these dynamics shape the near-term outlook, long-term oil price increases above $100 are less likely due to the impact of US shale production, which has accounted for all global oil production growth over the past decade. For this article, we sifted through Energy ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 35 Oil stocks. We then sourced the analysts’ average price targets and picked the 10 stocks that had the highest upside potential, as of November 29. We also included their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database of 900 elite hedge funds as of Q3 of 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Upside Potential: 22.20% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66 ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a leading independent exploration and production company with extensive crude oil operations worldwide. The company specializes in unconventional oil production from U.S. shale formations and traditional reservoirs in global markets. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) supplies crude oil to refineries, industrial customers, and international markets. On November 22, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) finalized its acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO), enhancing its potential for long-term growth. The company anticipates achieving synergies exceeding $1 billion on a run-rate basis within the next 12 months. On October 31, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) announced its Q3 financial results. During the quarter, the company generated $5.8 billion in cash from operating activities, including $4.7 billion in cash from operations. It also raised its regular dividend by 34% to $0.78 per share and expanded its share repurchase authorization to $20 billion. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has presented a 10-year strategic plan emphasizing disciplined investment, steady growth, improved returns, and substantial cash distributions to shareholders. This approach positions ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) uniquely among its peers. Overall, COP ranks 9th on our list of oil stocks with biggest upside potential according to analysts.

We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar These Days. In this article, we are going to take a look at where HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) stands against other top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. The debate around AI systems hitting a “data wall” or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said: “All it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it’s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI’s Alexander Wang to Anthropic’s Dario Amodei to Databricks’ Ali Ghodsi weighing in.” Jensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said: “A foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it’s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we’re learning, however, is that it’s not enough that we’ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.” Read Huang’s comments in detail here. Bosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said: “…..also acknowledge that this alone isn’t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.

A laptop, showing off the companys sleek notebook computers and workstations. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 42 HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) recently posted quarterly results and the stock fell amid downbeat Q1 guidance. Citi maintained its Neutral rating on HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) but reduced the price target to $36.50 from $37. Analysts, led by Asiya Merchant, noted HP’s stock fell due to weaker-than-expected guidance, driven by subdued PC recovery and inflated commodity costs impacting margins in the short term. While they expect the PC recovery to gain momentum in upcoming quarters with margin improvement, the Print segment exceeded expectations. However, HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) anticipates a low single-digit decline in the overall market through fiscal 2025. Margins are expected to remain at the top of HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ)’s target range, thanks to a shift towards more profitable units and cost actions. The analysts noted that EPS for the year will likely fall a penny below consensus expectations at $3.60 (midpoint), but still below Citi’s forecast. On the other hand, Evercore kept an Outperform rating and a $40 price target. Amit Daryanani and his team highlighted HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ)’s solid results despite weak PC market conditions. While there are concerns about below-seasonal EPS guidance for Q1, the analysts believe the second-half guidance is reasonable given industry dynamics. TD Cowen maintained its Hold rating but raised the price target to $39 from $32, citing soft end markets that hinder the company’s progress with cost restructuring. The analysts noted that HP’s Q4 EPS met Street estimates, but the outlook missed expectations due to continued softness in the PC market and higher variable compensation costs for fiscal Q1 2025. Importantly, the analysts said HP’s fiscal 2025 EPS outlook is in line, as PC growth in the second half of the year and strong Print profitability should drive mid-single-digit EPS growth. While premium PC mix and the repricing of PC parts support Free Cash Flow, weak consumer PC demand and challenges in Print may limit HP’s ability to achieve significant EPS growth. J.P. Morgan maintained its Overweight rating but lowered the price target to $40 from $41. Overall, HPQ ranks 10th on our list of top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of HPQ, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HPQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Stellantis' CEO stepping down shows how the auto industry is struggling to shift into high gear right now

Good morning! We've officially entered the season of company holiday parties. An etiquette expert shared some helpful tips to follow. (Take it easy on the booze.) In today's big story, an automaker CEO's resignation shows how tough a year the industry is having. What's on deck: But first, I'm just trying to get out of first gear. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. As dealerships look to clear their lots to make room for next year's models, automakers are also doing some housecleaning. Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares resigned this weekend as the Jeep and Chrysler owner battles sliding sales. His expedited departure — Tavares was scheduled to leave in 2026 — shows how choppy the automotive industry remains. Stellantis' struggles have been particularly bad. Tavares's cost-cutting approach initially helped, but more recently the company's US sales were down 17% this year compared to last year, writes Business Insider's Nora Naughton. The new boss will have plenty of issues to sort through, including a legal battle with the United Auto Workers union, writes BI's Tom Carter. So, what's got the auto industry stuck in gear? There are three big issues at play here: The EV problem: Arguably the biggest issue facing automakers is slowing demand for electric vehicles. While EV sales are still rising, they aren't pacing how they were a few years ago. That's forced automakers to recalibrate strategies that were anticipating the EV good times would keep rolling. Hybrid cars are also making a comeback, further complicating plans. The China problem: As if the EV market wasn't hard enough, there's the added challenge of Chinese competitors gaining market share. Their budget-friendly EVs are proving to be a huge hit in the world's largest auto market (China), much to the annoyance of Tesla. They also turned heads at Europe's largest auto show this year. Even Ford CEO Jim Farley acknowledged how much he enjoyed a Chinese EV. (It hasn't been a complete lovefest; he also called China's auto industry an "existential threat.") The tariff problem: President-elect Donald Trump's surprise announcement to enact a 25% tax on goods imported from Mexico is the newest hurdle for automakers. The US imported more than $65 billion worth of car parts from Mexico last year. Tesla also previously announced plans for a new $10 billion factory in Mexico. Trump's trade plans might not ultimately be implemented, but the uncertainty means car manufacturers could reconsider their supply chains.

Title: Collect 12% Yields By Investing Like A Billionaire In 2025

Senior businessman in suit flying in private jet and listening to music via wireless earphones. If you’ve been investing for a while, you’ve probably thought about private equity more than once. Adding exposure to “PE” firms, which buy and sell privately held businesses, is a great way to diversify beyond the big names of the S&P 500. But of course, to get in on that action, we have to be either institutional investors or have a net worth high enough to be “accredited.” Most people stop there. But there is a way to access private equity through a kind of lesser-known “back door.” For example, you could buy an ETF like the Invesco Global Listed Private Equity ETF (PSP) right on the stock market. The fund holds publicly traded PE firms like Blackstone, KKR & Co. (KKR) and the Carlyle Group (CG). It’s also had a pretty decent run, with a 9.1% annualized return over the last decade. More recently, though, PSP’s returns have been a bit weaker, reflecting a PE market recovering from its overvaluation in 2021. PSP Total Returns However, private equity is recovering in 2024, with a year-to-date return above 25% both for PSP and the index on which it’s based: the S&P Global Listed Private Equity Index. That makes now an interesting time to invest in the PE space. But we can do better than PSP and its 2.9% yield (an annualized calculation based on the fund’s latest quarterly distribution) with the double-digit yielders I’ll show you in a bit. Doing so means we can use the higher cash flow to pay our bills and become more financially independent, of course. But a large income stream has a different function when it comes to private equity. Since this market can be highly volatile, a high dividend ensures we’re getting more of our return in cash, and at regular intervals. We can then either use these funds to diversify away from private equity or buy more at a bargain when the market turns against these assets. This is better than what most people do: Sell a bigger portion of their low-yielding “regular” stocks to generate cash. Trouble is, it’s easy to give in to emotion and do this more during bear markets, when it’s the worst time to do so financially. With that in mind, there are two closed-end funds (CEFs) with big parts of their portfolios in private equity that are compelling here: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ), which yields 13% as I write this, and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), with a 12.1% yield. BIGZ has about a quarter of its assets in private equity, and BSTZ is closer to a third. Both funds mainly focus the rest of their holdings on tech companies, like NVIDIA (NVDA) and chipmaker Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), that are themselves exposed to private firms through their vendors and customers. This diversification has helped both funds recover strongly since the 2022 selloff, with the last year showing particularly strong returns for BSTZ (in purple below). That’s partly because it devotes more of its portfolio to private equity. BSTZ/BIGZ Total Returns In total, BIGZ’s private equity investments have seen a 44.1% decrease in their value on average, since the fund’s inception in 2021 (you can see a breakdown of the performance of BIGZ’s PE holdings and those of BSTZ here, on pages 9 and 14, respectively). This also explains why BIGZ trades at a 10.2% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio) today. Management is just not doing the best job on the PE side. BSTZ, meantime, has had a positive 30.9% return on its PE investments, but that’s going back to late 2019, since the fund is older. This is clearly much better, which explains why BSTZ’s discount to NAV is much smaller than that of BIGZ, at 7.3%. Plus, BSTZ’s 12.1% dividend gives you more control over your investment than you’d have if you just bought PSP, the private-equity ETF we mentioned earlier. Plus—and this is the real key here—BSTZ’s performance is getting better over time as the PE market recovers, which may be why the CEF (in orange below) has been outrunning PSP lately: BSTZ Outperforms That makes BSTZ the best buy here—not just for the PE exposure and the 12.1% income stream, but also because we can still get in at a decent discount as private equity continues to recover.

BlackRock is buying credit investment manager HPS Investment Partners in a stock deal valued at about $12 billion, giving it more ways to service its insurance clients BlackRock is buying credit investment manager HPS Investment Partners in a stock deal valued at about $12 billion, giving it more ways to service its insurance clients. BlackRock said Tuesday that the transaction includes equity issued by a subsidiary, and that the equity can be exchanged on a one-for-one basis into BlackRock common stock. The company said the transaction creates an integrated private credit franchise with approximately $220 billion in client assets. HPS has approximately $148 billion in client assets and is an independent provider of private credit for insurance clients. BlackRock said that the acquisition of HPS will position it to be a full-service, fiduciary provider of public-private asset management and technology solutions for insurance clients. BlackRock and HPS will create a new private financing solutions division. “Today marks an important milestone in our drive to become the world’s leading provider of private financing solutions,” HPS CEO Scott Kapnick said in a statement. “Our partnership with BlackRock will further strengthen our position in this fast growing but increasingly competitive market.” HPS is one of several acquisitions BlackRock has made this year. In January the New York company announced that it was buying independent infrastructure fund manager Global Infrastructure Partners in a cash-and-stock deal valued at more than $12 billion. That transaction was completed in October. BlackRock then announced in June that it was buying private markets data provider Preqin in an approximately $3.2 billion deal. The acquisition is targeted to close before the end of the year. The transaction with HPS is expected to close mid-2025. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

"We have always sought to position ourselves ahead of our clients' needs. Together with the scale, capabilities, and expertise of the HPS team, BlackRock will deliver clients solutions that seamlessly blend public and private," CEO Larry Fink said in a statement. The deal, which is expected to close in mid-2025, comes during a boom for the private credit space. Comparable publicly traded companies to HPS such as Blue Owl Capital and Ares are up 54.6% and 46%, respectively, for 2024. Those gains are well ahead of BlackRock's 25.7% year-to-date gain. The transaction also creates "an integrated private credit franchise" with about $220 billion in assets, per BlackRock. HPS manages about $148 billion in assets. BlackRock oversees $11.5 trillion as of the third quarter. Sources told CNBC that HPS first sought to go public, which caught BlackRock's attention as it looks to grow its alternative assets business. BlackRock earlier this year announced it would acquire Global Infrastructure Partners and private market data provider Preqin for $12.5 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. The deal is also expected to raise BlackRock's private market AUM and management fees by 40% and roughly 35%, respectively.

Company unveils strategy to expand America's largest fiber broadband network1 to 50 million+ total locations2.Company provides long-term guidance for sustained growth in consolidated service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted EPS, underpinned by continued capital investment.Company expects improved financial performance to support $40 billion+ of anticipated shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases over the next three years, including an initial share repurchase authorization of $10 billion that management expects to complete by the end of 2026.Company to webcast Analyst & Investor Day presentation at 2 p.m. ET today on the AT&T Investor Relations website. DALLAS, Dec. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of its 2024 Analyst & Investor Day presentation, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: NYSE:T) unveiled a bold, multi-year strategic plan highlighted by continued profitable 5G and fiber subscriber growth. This growth is expected to fuel enhanced shareholder returns on network investments through a robust and balanced capital allocation program. "Over the last four years, we've achieved durable and profitable subscriber growth, generated attractive returns on network investment, and strengthened our balance sheet," said John Stankey, AT&T CEO. "We're putting customers first to become the best connectivity provider in America. Our plan expands the country's largest fiber network to more than 50 million total locations, modernizes our wireless network and rewards our shareholders. As we grow, we expect to return more than $40 billion to shareholders over the next three years through dividends and share repurchases. With this bold strategy, we are entering a new era of sustained growth at AT&T." Momentum to Continue with Investment-Led Strategy and Customer-Centric ApproachAT&T is making progress on its journey to become the best connectivity provider in America. Over the past four-plus years, the Company has streamlined its operations and centered its business around the customer as it enhanced and simplified their experiences with AT&T. The Company has also greatly expanded its 5G and fiber services to more people and places and is the largest capital investor in U.S. connectivity infrastructure since 2019. With the plans announced today, the Company will unlock new capabilities that further its momentum while investing in future growth “ ultimately enabling more robust shareholder returns. As a result of continued investment, the Company expects to be in a differentiated position within the connectivity industry by the end of the decade. In Mobility, the Company is building a more efficient, high-capacity, programmable and open network. By 2027, it expects to have largely completed the modernization of its 5G wireless network with open technology, with deep mid-band 5G spectrum covering 300 million+ people by the end of 2026. This network will support super-fast download speeds and serve as a platform for new product and GenAI innovation. In broadband, the Company is creating even more distance between itself and the competition on what is already the largest fiber broadband network in America. By the end of 2029, it expects to reach 50 million+ total locations with fiber. This includes expectations to pass about 45 million locations through its organic fiber deployment and serve 5 million+ fiber locations through Gigapower, its joint venture with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), as well as through agreements with commercial open-access providers. The Company's fiber expansion will greatly increase its opportunity to serve customers how they want to be served, by one provider in a converged manner. While building the network of the future, the Company is actively working to exit its legacy copper network operations across the large majority of its wireline footprint by the end of 2029. The Company believes sustaining industry-leading levels of network investment and pursuing these strategic objectives will ultimately allow it to offer the best value, greater personalization and security and more customer-centric products and services on the largest, highest-capacity, lowest-marginal cost network in America. Long-Term OutlookAT&T expects to achieve the following 2025 and long-term financial targets through 2027. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, and as a result of the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity method investment, the Company plans to report adjusted EPS and free cash flow excluding earnings and cash flows related to DIRECTV. The Company continues to expect the sale of its entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG to close in mid-2025. For comparability to these targets, the Company has provided a recast of historical results for these two financial measures in its Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024.Consolidated service revenue growth in the low-single-digit range annually from 2025-2027.Mobility service revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range annually.Consumer fiber broadband revenue growth in the mid-teens annually.Adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% or better annually from 2025-2027.Mobility EBITDA growth in the 3% to 4% range annually.Consumer Wireline EBITDA grows at a double-digit compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2027.Business Wireline EBITDA declines at a low-double-digit CAGR through 2027; Business Solutions EBITDA approaching stabilization by the end of 2027.Capital investment in the $22 billion range annually from 2025-2027.Free cash flow, excluding DIRECTV, of $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $18 billion+ in 2027.In addition, AT&T expects to receive $5.4 billion of after-tax cash payments in 2025 and $0.5 billion in 2029 related to the sale of the DIRECTV investment.Adjusted EPS, excluding DIRECTV, of $1.97 to $2.07 in 2025, accelerating to double-digit percentage growth in 2027.$3 billion+ in run-rate cost savings by the end of 2027, inclusive of the Company's target of achieving $2 billion+ in run-rate cost savings by mid-2026.Long-Term Capital Allocation Plan: $50 Billion+ of Financial Capacity Supports $40 Billion+ of Dividends and Share RepurchasesAT&T expects this plan to provide $50 billion+ of financial capacity over the next three years, largely through organic growth. Financial capacity represents anticipated free cash flow after distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's stake in DIRECTV to TPG, as well as net borrowing capacity after the Company achieves its net leverage target. The Company continues to expect to achieve its net leverage target of net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA in the 2.5x range in the first half of 2025, and maintain leverage within this range through 2027. The Company expects to return $40 billion+ of this financial capacity to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Under this capital return plan, the Company expects to maintain its current annualized common stock dividend of $1.11 per share. This plan would result in $20 billion+ in total dividend payments, with capacity for about $20 billion in share repurchases, from 2025-2027. Under this plan, the Company also expects approximately $10 billion in incremental financial flexibility for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Of the $20 billion share repurchase capacity, AT&T's Board has authorized an initial tranche of approximately $10 billion in common stock repurchases. Management expects share repurchases under this authorization to commence when the Company reaches its net leverage target range and expects to conclude by the end of 2026. Additionally, the Company expects approximately $10 billion of share repurchases in 2027, pending Board authorization. 2024 OutlookFor the full-year, AT&T expects:Wireless service revenue growth in the 3% range.Broadband revenue growth of 7%+.Adjusted EBITDA growth in the 3% range.Capital investment at the high-end of the $21 to $22 billion range.Free cash flow in the $17 to $18 billion range, tracking toward the midpoint of this range; excluding approximately $2.5 billion of after-tax cash payments from DIRECTV, free cash flow in the $15 billion range.Adjusted EPS of $2.20 to $2.25, reflecting an increase from the previously provided $2.15 to $2.25 range. This includes an expected adjusted equity in net income from DIRECTV of approximately $0.30 per share post-tax. When excluding this, the Company expects adjusted EPS in the $1.90 to $1.95 range.Tune Into AT&T's Analyst & Investor Day PresentationThe Company will provide more details around its strategy and plans to drive strong returns to shareholders today at 2 p.m. ET.

Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP MeasuresSchedules and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to the most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) can be found at investors.att.com. Additionally, historical reconciliations for adjusted diluted EPS and free cash flow, excluding DIRECTV, can be found in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures frequently used by investors and credit rating agencies. EBITDA is net income plus income tax, interest and depreciation and amortization expenses minus equity in net income of affiliates and other income (expense) “ net. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from operating revenues and operating expenses certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Adjusted EBITDA and net debt (defined below) estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected Adjusted EBITDA and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics and related ratios without unreasonable effort. As a supplemental presentation to our Communications segment operating results, AT&T Business Solutions results are provided in the Financial and Operational Schedules & Non-GAAP Reconciliations document on the company's Investor Relations website, investors.att.com. Business Solutions includes both wireless and fixed operations and is calculated by combining our Mobility and Business Wireline operating units and then adjusting to remove non-business operations. This combined view presents a complete profile of the entire business customer relationship and underscores the importance of mobile solutions to serving our business customers. At the segment, business unit or Business Solutions, EBITDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization. EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected segment, business unit or Business Solutions EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by excluding from operating revenues, operating expenses, other income (expenses) and income tax expense, certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, actuarial gains and losses, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Non-operational items arising from asset acquisitions and dispositions include the amortization of intangible assets. While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and those assets contribute to revenue generation. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, the Company plans to remove from adjusted earnings the equity in net income from our DIRECTV investment. Reconciliations of Adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and year-to-date 2024 to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. The Company expects adjustments to 2024 to 2027 reported diluted EPS to a non-cash mark-to-market benefit plan gain/loss and other items. The Company expects the mark-to-market adjustment, which is driven by interest rates and investment returns that are not reasonably estimable at this time, to be a significant item. For 2024, projected adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV in the $1.90-$1.95 range is calculated as projected adjusted EPS in the $2.20-$2.25 range, less an adjustment of approximately $0.30 to exclude approximately $2.8 billion (pre-tax) of adjusted equity income from the DIRECTV investment. Our projected 2024 adjusted EPS and projected 2024-2027 adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV depend on future levels of revenues and expenses, most of which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Free Cash Flow, for periods prior to 2025, is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV (classified as investing activities) minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, we plan to revise our definition of free cash flow to remove cash flows related to DIRECTV. Free Cash Flow excluding DIRECTV is expected to be defined as cash from operations minus cash flows related to our DIRECTV equity method investment (cash distributions less cash taxes paid from DIRECTV), minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). Reconciliations of free cash flow excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024 have been recast to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment and are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. For 2024, projected free cash flow in the $17-$18 billion range is $12.8 billion free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, plus an estimate of approximately $4.2-$5.2 billion for 4Q24 (cash from operating activities in the $10.7-$12.2 billion range, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0, minus capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range and cash paid for vendor financing in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, free cash flow of $12.8 billion is cash from operating activities of $26.9 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.9 billion, minus capital expenditures of $13.4 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.6 billion. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected 2025-2027 free cash flow excluding DIRECTV and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Capital Investment provides a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. In connection with capital improvements, we have favorable payment terms of 120 days or more with certain vendors, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Capital investment includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. For 2024, projected capital investment at the high-end of the $21-$22 billion range is $15.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ($13.4 billion of capital expenditures plus $1.6 billion of vendor financing payments) plus an estimate for 4Q24 of approximately $6.5-$7.0 billion (capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range plus vendor financing payments in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact capital expenditures, vendor financing payments and future levels of revenues, the Company is not able to provide reconciliations between projected 2025-2027 capital investment and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Financial Capacity for 2025-2027 of $50 billion+ represents anticipated cumulative free cash flow excluding DIRECTV (based on $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in $18 billion+ in 2027), less distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG ($5.4 billion of after-tax cash distributions and other payments not subject to tax in 2025), plus an increase in net borrowing capacity (resulting from projected growth in EBITDA while maintaining net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio in the 2.5x range) after the Company achieves its net leverage target. Financial Flexibility for 2025-2027 represents incremental financial capacity for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures, vendor financing payments, distributions to noncontrolling interests and borrowing capacity, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters of adjusted EBITDA (defined above). Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and time deposits (deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days, e.g., certificates of deposit and time deposits) from total debt. © 2024 AT&T Intellectual Property.

DALLAS, Dec. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of its 2024 Analyst & Investor Day presentation, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: NYSE:T) unveiled a bold, multi-year strategic plan highlighted by continued profitable 5G and fiber subscriber growth. This growth is expected to fuel enhanced shareholder returns on network investments through a robust and balanced capital allocation program. "Over the last four years, we've achieved durable and profitable subscriber growth, generated attractive returns on network investment, and strengthened our balance sheet," said John Stankey, AT&T CEO. "We're putting customers first to become the best connectivity provider in America. Our plan expands the country's largest fiber network to more than 50 million total locations, modernizes our wireless network and rewards our shareholders. As we grow, we expect to return more than $40 billion to shareholders over the next three years through dividends and share repurchases. With this bold strategy, we are entering a new era of sustained growth at AT&T." Momentum to Continue with Investment-Led Strategy and Customer-Centric ApproachAT&T is making progress on its journey to become the best connectivity provider in America. Over the past four-plus years, the Company has streamlined its operations and centered its business around the customer as it enhanced and simplified their experiences with AT&T. The Company has also greatly expanded its 5G and fiber services to more people and places and is the largest capital investor in U.S. connectivity infrastructure since 2019. With the plans announced today, the Company will unlock new capabilities that further its momentum while investing in future growth “ ultimately enabling more robust shareholder returns. As a result of continued investment, the Company expects to be in a differentiated position within the connectivity industry by the end of the decade. In Mobility, the Company is building a more efficient, high-capacity, programmable and open network. By 2027, it expects to have largely completed the modernization of its 5G wireless network with open technology, with deep mid-band 5G spectrum covering 300 million+ people by the end of 2026. This network will support super-fast download speeds and serve as a platform for new product and GenAI innovation. In broadband, the Company is creating even more distance between itself and the competition on what is already the largest fiber broadband network in America. By the end of 2029, it expects to reach 50 million+ total locations with fiber. This includes expectations to pass about 45 million locations through its organic fiber deployment and serve 5 million+ fiber locations through Gigapower, its joint venture with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), as well as through agreements with commercial open-access providers. The Company's fiber expansion will greatly increase its opportunity to serve customers how they want to be served, by one provider in a converged manner. While building the network of the future, the Company is actively working to exit its legacy copper network operations across the large majority of its wireline footprint by the end of 2029. The Company believes sustaining industry-leading levels of network investment and pursuing these strategic objectives will ultimately allow it to offer the best value, greater personalization and security and more customer-centric products and services on the largest, highest-capacity, lowest-marginal cost network in America. Long-Term OutlookAT&T expects to achieve the following 2025 and long-term financial targets through 2027. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, and as a result of the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity method investment, the Company plans to report adjusted EPS and free cash flow excluding earnings and cash flows related to DIRECTV. The Company continues to expect the sale of its entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG to close in mid-2025. For comparability to these targets, the Company has provided a recast of historical results for these two financial measures in its Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024.Consolidated service revenue growth in the low-single-digit range annually from 2025-2027.Mobility service revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range annually.Consumer fiber broadband revenue growth in the mid-teens annually.Adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% or better annually from 2025-2027.Mobility EBITDA growth in the 3% to 4% range annually.Consumer Wireline EBITDA grows at a double-digit compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2027.Business Wireline EBITDA declines at a low-double-digit CAGR through 2027; Business Solutions EBITDA approaching stabilization by the end of 2027.Capital investment in the $22 billion range annually from 2025-2027.Free cash flow, excluding DIRECTV, of $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $18 billion+ in 2027.In addition, AT&T expects to receive $5.4 billion of after-tax cash payments in 2025 and $0.5 billion in 2029 related to the sale of the DIRECTV investment.Adjusted EPS, excluding DIRECTV, of $1.97 to $2.07 in 2025, accelerating to double-digit percentage growth in 2027.$3 billion+ in run-rate cost savings by the end of 2027, inclusive of the Company's target of achieving $2 billion+ in run-rate cost savings by mid-2026.Long-Term Capital Allocation Plan: $50 Billion+ of Financial Capacity Supports $40 Billion+ of Dividends and Share RepurchasesAT&T expects this plan to provide $50 billion+ of financial capacity over the next three years, largely through organic growth. Financial capacity represents anticipated free cash flow after distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's stake in DIRECTV to TPG, as well as net borrowing capacity after the Company achieves its net leverage target. The Company continues to expect to achieve its net leverage target of net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA in the 2.5x range in the first half of 2025, and maintain leverage within this range through 2027. The Company expects to return $40 billion+ of this financial capacity to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Under this capital return plan, the Company expects to maintain its current annualized common stock dividend of $1.11 per share. This plan would result in $20 billion+ in total dividend payments, with capacity for about $20 billion in share repurchases, from 2025-2027. Under this plan, the Company also expects approximately $10 billion in incremental financial flexibility for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Of the $20 billion share repurchase capacity, AT&T's Board has authorized an initial tranche of approximately $10 billion in common stock repurchases. Management expects share repurchases under this authorization to commence when the Company reaches its net leverage target range and expects to conclude by the end of 2026. Additionally, the Company expects approximately $10 billion of share repurchases in 2027, pending Board authorization. 2024 OutlookFor the full-year, AT&T expects:Wireless service revenue growth in the 3% range.Broadband revenue growth of 7%+.Adjusted EBITDA growth in the 3% range.Capital investment at the high-end of the $21 to $22 billion range.Free cash flow in the $17 to $18 billion range, tracking toward the midpoint of this range; excluding approximately $2.5 billion of after-tax cash payments from DIRECTV, free cash flow in the $15 billion range.Adjusted EPS of $2.20 to $2.25, reflecting an increase from the previously provided $2.15 to $2.25 range. This includes an expected adjusted equity in net income from DIRECTV of approximately $0.30 per share post-tax. When excluding this, the Company expects adjusted EPS in the $1.90 to $1.95 range.Tune Into AT&T's Analyst & Investor Day PresentationThe Company will provide more details around its strategy and plans to drive strong returns to shareholders today at 2 p.m. ET.

Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsInformation set forth in this news release contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update and revise statements contained in this news release based on new information or otherwise. This news release may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available below and on the Company's website at investors.att.com. Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP MeasuresSchedules and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to the most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) can be found at investors.att.com. Additionally, historical reconciliations for adjusted diluted EPS and free cash flow, excluding DIRECTV, can be found in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures frequently used by investors and credit rating agencies. EBITDA is net income plus income tax, interest and depreciation and amortization expenses minus equity in net income of affiliates and other income (expense) “ net. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from operating revenues and operating expenses certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Adjusted EBITDA and net debt (defined below) estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected Adjusted EBITDA and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics and related ratios without unreasonable effort. As a supplemental presentation to our Communications segment operating results, AT&T Business Solutions results are provided in the Financial and Operational Schedules & Non-GAAP Reconciliations document on the company's Investor Relations website, investors.att.com. Business Solutions includes both wireless and fixed operations and is calculated by combining our Mobility and Business Wireline operating units and then adjusting to remove non-business operations. This combined view presents a complete profile of the entire business customer relationship and underscores the importance of mobile solutions to serving our business customers. At the segment, business unit or Business Solutions, EBITDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization. EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected segment, business unit or Business Solutions EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by excluding from operating revenues, operating expenses, other income (expenses) and income tax expense, certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, actuarial gains and losses, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Non-operational items arising from asset acquisitions and dispositions include the amortization of intangible assets. While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and those assets contribute to revenue generation. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, the Company plans to remove from adjusted earnings the equity in net income from our DIRECTV investment. Reconciliations of Adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and year-to-date 2024 to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. The Company expects adjustments to 2024 to 2027 reported diluted EPS to a non-cash mark-to-market benefit plan gain/loss and other items. The Company expects the mark-to-market adjustment, which is driven by interest rates and investment returns that are not reasonably estimable at this time, to be a significant item. For 2024, projected adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV in the $1.90-$1.95 range is calculated as projected adjusted EPS in the $2.20-$2.25 range, less an adjustment of approximately $0.30 to exclude approximately $2.8 billion (pre-tax) of adjusted equity income from the DIRECTV investment. Our projected 2024 adjusted EPS and projected 2024-2027 adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV depend on future levels of revenues and expenses, most of which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Free Cash Flow, for periods prior to 2025, is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV (classified as investing activities) minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, we plan to revise our definition of free cash flow to remove cash flows related to DIRECTV. Free Cash Flow excluding DIRECTV is expected to be defined as cash from operations minus cash flows related to our DIRECTV equity method investment (cash distributions less cash taxes paid from DIRECTV), minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). Reconciliations of free cash flow excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024 have been recast to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment and are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. For 2024, projected free cash flow in the $17-$18 billion range is $12.8 billion free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, plus an estimate of approximately $4.2-$5.2 billion for 4Q24 (cash from operating activities in the $10.7-$12.2 billion range, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0, minus capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range and cash paid for vendor financing in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, free cash flow of $12.8 billion is cash from operating activities of $26.9 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.9 billion, minus capital expenditures of $13.4 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.6 billion. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected 2025-2027 free cash flow excluding DIRECTV and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Capital Investment provides a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. In connection with capital improvements, we have favorable payment terms of 120 days or more with certain vendors, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Capital investment includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. For 2024, projected capital investment at the high-end of the $21-$22 billion range is $15.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ($13.4 billion of capital expenditures plus $1.6 billion of vendor financing payments) plus an estimate for 4Q24 of approximately $6.5-$7.0 billion (capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range plus vendor financing payments in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact capital expenditures, vendor financing payments and future levels of revenues, the Company is not able to provide reconciliations between projected 2025-2027 capital investment and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Financial Capacity for 2025-2027 of $50 billion+ represents anticipated cumulative free cash flow excluding DIRECTV (based on $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in $18 billion+ in 2027), less distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG ($5.4 billion of after-tax cash distributions and other payments not subject to tax in 2025), plus an increase in net borrowing capacity (resulting from projected growth in EBITDA while maintaining net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio in the 2.5x range) after the Company achieves its net leverage target.

A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update and revise statements contained in this news release based on new information or otherwise. This news release may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available below and on the Company's website at investors.att.com. Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP MeasuresSchedules and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to the most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) can be found at investors.att.com. Additionally, historical reconciliations for adjusted diluted EPS and free cash flow, excluding DIRECTV, can be found in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures frequently used by investors and credit rating agencies. EBITDA is net income plus income tax, interest and depreciation and amortization expenses minus equity in net income of affiliates and other income (expense) “ net. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from operating revenues and operating expenses certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Adjusted EBITDA and net debt (defined below) estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected Adjusted EBITDA and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics and related ratios without unreasonable effort. As a supplemental presentation to our Communications segment operating results, AT&T Business Solutions results are provided in the Financial and Operational Schedules & Non-GAAP Reconciliations document on the company's Investor Relations website, investors.att.com. Business Solutions includes both wireless and fixed operations and is calculated by combining our Mobility and Business Wireline operating units and then adjusting to remove non-business operations. This combined view presents a complete profile of the entire business customer relationship and underscores the importance of mobile solutions to serving our business customers. At the segment, business unit or Business Solutions, EBITDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization. EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected segment, business unit or Business Solutions EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by excluding from operating revenues, operating expenses, other income (expenses) and income tax expense, certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, actuarial gains and losses, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Non-operational items arising from asset acquisitions and dispositions include the amortization of intangible assets. While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and those assets contribute to revenue generation. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, the Company plans to remove from adjusted earnings the equity in net income from our DIRECTV investment. Reconciliations of Adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and year-to-date 2024 to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. The Company expects adjustments to 2024 to 2027 reported diluted EPS to a non-cash mark-to-market benefit plan gain/loss and other items. The Company expects the mark-to-market adjustment, which is driven by interest rates and investment returns that are not reasonably estimable at this time, to be a significant item. For 2024, projected adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV in the $1.90-$1.95 range is calculated as projected adjusted EPS in the $2.20-$2.25 range, less an adjustment of approximately $0.30 to exclude approximately $2.8 billion (pre-tax) of adjusted equity income from the DIRECTV investment. Our projected 2024 adjusted EPS and projected 2024-2027 adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV depend on future levels of revenues and expenses, most of which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Free Cash Flow, for periods prior to 2025, is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV (classified as investing activities) minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, we plan to revise our definition of free cash flow to remove cash flows related to DIRECTV. Free Cash Flow excluding DIRECTV is expected to be defined as cash from operations minus cash flows related to our DIRECTV equity method investment (cash distributions less cash taxes paid from DIRECTV), minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). Reconciliations of free cash flow excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024 have been recast to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment and are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. For 2024, projected free cash flow in the $17-$18 billion range is $12.8 billion free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, plus an estimate of approximately $4.2-$5.2 billion for 4Q24 (cash from operating activities in the $10.7-$12.2 billion range, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0, minus capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range and cash paid for vendor financing in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, free cash flow of $12.8 billion is cash from operating activities of $26.9 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.9 billion, minus capital expenditures of $13.4 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.6 billion. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected 2025-2027 free cash flow excluding DIRECTV and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Capital Investment provides a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. In connection with capital improvements, we have favorable payment terms of 120 days or more with certain vendors, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Capital investment includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. For 2024, projected capital investment at the high-end of the $21-$22 billion range is $15.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ($13.4 billion of capital expenditures plus $1.6 billion of vendor financing payments) plus an estimate for 4Q24 of approximately $6.5-$7.0 billion (capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range plus vendor financing payments in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact capital expenditures, vendor financing payments and future levels of revenues, the Company is not able to provide reconciliations between projected 2025-2027 capital investment and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Financial Capacity for 2025-2027 of $50 billion+ represents anticipated cumulative free cash flow excluding DIRECTV (based on $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in $18 billion+ in 2027), less distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG ($5.4 billion of after-tax cash distributions and other payments not subject to tax in 2025), plus an increase in net borrowing capacity (resulting from projected growth in EBITDA while maintaining net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio in the 2.5x range) after the Company achieves its net leverage target. Financial Flexibility for 2025-2027 represents incremental financial capacity for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures, vendor financing payments, distributions to noncontrolling interests and borrowing capacity, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters of adjusted EBITDA (defined above). Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and time deposits (deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days, e.g., certificates of deposit and time deposits) from total debt. © 2024 AT&T Intellectual Property.
