Six Christmas trees are dotted around a magnificent Co Down house where a book club made up of mainly Dubliners has just met. Camembert Santas were served on charcuterie boards by Co Tipperary-born Pádraig Mullally and his husband Ruairí, who hosted the monthly event in their cinnamon-scented livingroom. The couple live in a detached new-build in the sprawling Hillcrest village development in Bessbrook, a former Quaker village on the outskirts of Newry. “It may as well be a suburb of Dublin,” laughs Ruairí. “There’s 24 of us in the club and only two are from Newry; I’m one of them. The majority are from the South. There’s a lot of Dubs and there’s a guy from Limerick and another one from Wexford. There’s even a woman from Donegal.” During the day, the estate is like “a ghost town” as so many residents are working in Dublin, he adds. Mullally (33) grew up on a farm in Drangan and studied science in Cork; he drives to Blanchardstown in Dublin three days a week where he works for a pharmaceutical company. While a future move back to Tipperary hasn’t been ruled out, he “wouldn’t even consider” relocating to Dublin to be closer to work. “Our quality of life would be massively changed. We were only down in Dublin at the weekend and it was so much more expensive. And then if you think of the house prices,” Mullally says. [ A personal housing plan: Move to Newry, buy for €150,000 less, commute to DublinOpens in new window ] “Take for example our house – a four-bedroom detached with super handy proximity to Belfast and Dublin. You wouldn’t get anything in Dublin for £265,000 (what they paid). It would be unheard of.” Mullally is among the growing number of young professionals living in the border city while continuing to commute to Dublin. Post-pandemic remote working, cheaper rents and a lower cost of living are among the reasons for the increasing number of Southern-based workers renting or buying in Newry, according to local estate agent Ian Hall. “Some of them might have a connection or are moving back here,” he adds. “They’re younger, educated, probably travelled more and their jobs offer more flexibility in terms of where they can live. A lot of them work in professional services or IT.” Hall’s firm, Hanna Hillen, handled many of the sales in the nearby Gantry Lane development, which began four years ago and is almost complete. Diggers are on site where, according to one builder, the remaining houses will “go like hot cakes” as it is so close to Newry train station. A new hourly Belfast to Dublin train service was introduced at the end of October. Estate agent Micheál Hastewell recently sold a three-bedroom semi in Gantry to a couple from the South. “The young couple told me that they were sick of being slaves to Dublin. They were happy to buy something at probably half the price of what they can afford in Dublin,” he says. “But there is now huge demand for Newry – and the supply just isn’t here. “Even more recently, we rented a property down the old Warrenpoint Road. Again, it was a couple renting a shoebox of an apartment in Dublin. They saw a three-bedroom house online for £950 per month. “They’re saying Southern prices are out of control.” Hillcrest resident – and book club member – Emma Morgan (35) is a Dublin-based accountant from Skerries who has been living in the North since 2019. “My husband is from Newry. I always joke that I moved up for love and cheaper housing,” she says. Morgan’s plan was to stay temporarily and save up to buy a house in Skerries – where the average price for a three-bed semi is in excess of €500,000. That has now changed. “We bought our home in Newry at the same time my brother bought a two-bedroom apartment in Skerries. With the exchange rate, it was roughly the same price. We got ours for £212,000 and then paid an extra £15,000 for the sunroom. Already, the value of property in this estate has increased significantly. I redid our mortgage in April and they valued it at £280,000.” But it is more than the cost of property that is keeping her in the North: “If we moved back, there would be a significant impact on our quality of life purely because our money is not going to go as far down South. [ Northern Ireland house sales reach highest point in two yearsOpens in new window ] “Also, from the day I moved up here, I had friends. We’re all pretty much blow-ins – and from all about the place as well. It’s not just Dublin. I think the fact we are blow-ins, we’re looking for that bit of community, so the likes of the book club is great for that. “Joe, my husband, says that I now know more people than he does. I’ve made such an effort over the last five to six years. I joined every baby group going when I had my son.” Before going on maternity leave – she is returning to work next month – Morgan commuted to the office by train two to three times a week. The station is a short drive away. “I would get the 7.40am and be in at ten past nine. I’d get the 4.50pm home and get in at just after six o’clock. Those were roughly the hours I would be in and out of the house when I lived in Skerries. “The internet on the train is generally good and I logged the extra hours when I was working on the train. My boss was completely happy with that because the work got done. “Pre-Covid we were based in Thomas Street, but we’re now out in Blackrock. I used to get the train to Connolly and walk; now I get the Dart and it’s much of a muchness.” A town before it was granted city status in 2002, Newry was an economic black spot during the 1980s with rocketing unemployment rates and a depressed property market. Today, housing demand is outstripping supply. The peace process had a transformative effect, but Southerners would “never have contemplated” buying houses in Newry during the Troubles, says Ian Hill, who has been an estate agent for more than 20 years. “My dad bought a petrol station in Newry in 1983 and had it until 1996. That was a time whenever petrol was cheaper in the North and people would have been coming from the South. They would have been coming down just for a day, and that was a big thing,” he recalls. “Peacetime brought stability, and then you see some things shared – like the health service, for example. All those things break down barriers and maybe make it more comfortable for people from the South to live here.” In early 2025, work will begin on a further housing development close to the main A1 motorway. Paddy Gray, emeritus professor of housing at Ulster University, is aware of the emerging trend: “I think Newry’s an attractive place to live and people regularly travel over the Border. The salaries are much higher in Dublin and it’s not a long commute. When you think of people going to their jobs in London and spending an hour-and-a-half on the Tube, and all the stress of that.” Gray sits on the Residential Tenancies Board, an independent body that regulates the private rental sector in Ireland. Earlier this month, the board released data showing rental costs increased by 4.7 per cent in the Republic in the three months to June compared with the same quarter last year. The average cost of a new tenancy in the South now stands at €1,644 a month. Dublin rentals are highest, costing an average of €2,147. “Remember, these are only averages and figures can be skewed and are much higher in some cases,” adds Gray. In the North, prices are also rising. Government figures show the average price for a house in Northern Ireland was £190,553 between July and September, a rise of 6.2 per cent on the same period last year. In the Newry, Mourne and Down area, it was £201,305 (the fourth highest of the North’s 11 local government district areas), representing a 4.2 per cent increase on the previous year. Back at the Mullallys’ home in Hillcrest, they were preparing to spend Christmas in Tipperary. “I think we could live there one day. We’re farmers in rural Tipp, there’s a bit of frontage there – that’s why Ruairí married me,” jokes Pádraig. “We see the likes of my brother building a fabulous house in the country and that has sparked something. “But we have a life in Newry and Ruairí obviously has his family here as well. I feel like I have the best of both worlds here.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

And you know, Gen Z, you know, Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X kind of, you know, the younger traders are, this is where they’re allocating their funds to. And, you know, retail has definitely spoken, and institutions have definitely spoken, and they’re looking for that, that fourth industrial revolution allocation.” Sylvia also talked about the relationship between quantum computing and AI and explained how this technology would improve AI systems: “So chatbot AI is, you know, kind of version one. Quantum is taking everything to the next level. So you need quantum in order for it to be efficient. You need to process that data quickly. It will help, you know, essentially health care, cryptography, aerospace and defense, you know, blockchain technology. Anything you can think of will be better, too, with quantum supercomputing power.” READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we chose 10 AI stocks that are currently buzzing on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 160 Chris Grisanti, MAI Capital Management chief marketing strategist, made the case for Alphabet during a program on CNBC and said he believes the stock is undervalued. “I would urge investors to look through the antitrust stuff, which I would say will take at least half a decade to play out. Use this as an opportunity to crunch the numbers. It’s now selling at its lowest PE relative to the market of all time—about 80% of the market PE in an expensive market. This is the one MAG7 stock I really like. It can perform well if it hits its earnings numbers, it’s not overly expensive, and it offers a nice way to invest in that space even if you’re cautious about the other valuations.” Grisanti also reminded investors about Microsoft’s anti-trust issues back in the day and the stock performance: “I’d ask investors to take a deep breath. I am old enough to remember Microsoft in the late ’90s and their six-year battle with the antitrust authorities, where the government sought to break up the company. Microsoft lost the first round but eventually prevailed on appeal. During that time, the stock tripled.” The market has been ignoring Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s key secondary businesses and the stock remains undervalued despite concerns around AI search and regulatory onslaught. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s secondary ventures in AI, autonomous driving, and other areas are making solid progress, especially in the Waymo robotaxi segment. Currently, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s stock trades below 20 times forward earnings, offering potential upside as EPS and other financial metrics strengthen in coming years. For next year, the consensus EPS estimate sits around $9. However, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has consistently beaten projections, delivering $7.54 in trailing twelve-month EPS compared to the expected $6.79—a roughly 11% outperformance. With the 2025 EPS forecast at around $9, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could realistically achieve earnings closer to $10 if it maintains its historical outperformance rate. At a projected $10 EPS, Google’s forward P/E multiple would be approximately 17, a relatively low valuation for a diversified market leader. What are the key drivers for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)? Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains on track to reach a $100 billion revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In its autonomous driving division, Waymo has shown notable progress, with paid autonomous rides growing 200% quarter-over-quarter to 150,000 weekly rides as of late October, thanks to a fleet of 700 vehicles in service since August. This growth is significant: Waymo vehicles now average about 30.6 autonomous rides per day—substantially higher than Uber’s average of 4.18 rides per driver daily, based on Uber’s 31 million daily trips and 7.4 million drivers last quarter. This performance underscores Waymo’s competitive edge in autonomous ride volume compared to traditional ride-hailing. In the third quarter, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Search & Other segment saw a 12.2% year-over-year revenue increase, rising from $44.03 billion to $49.39 billion. YouTube advertising also performed well, with revenue up 12.2% to $8.92 billion from $7.95 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenue grew even more sharply, surging 27.8% from $8.34 billion to $10.66 billion. Google Cloud has been expanding steadily, with revenue climbing from $13.06 billion in 2020 to $33.09 billion in 2023. Notably, Google Cloud turned profitable for the first time in 2023, posting $1.72 billion in operating profit—a significant improvement from a $5.61 billion loss in 2020. This segment’s performance continues to strengthen, with the latest quarterly revenue reaching $11.35 billion, up 35% from $8.41 billion in the same period last year. Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), ie Google/YouTube, having returned 20.8% in the June quarter, gave a fair bit of that back by falling 8.8%. Its results seemed pretty positive, and appeared to beat expectations. Management claims its AI integration into its search business is working well, and the margin expansion from costs out is expected to continue. Market chatter suggests that the selloff stems from concerns about the high capital spending on servers and data center equipment. Alphabet has made it clear that this spending is necessary, and somewhat defensive as it can’t risk losing the AI war (a “build it, and they will come” approach). Also, the new Department of Justice case against it probably did not help matters. Nonetheless, we saw no need to adjust our estimates. We wrote last quarter that it traded at a premium to our valuation, but not so much as to warrant selling. With the share price falling and the premium reducing, our view is unchanged. It represents 4.4% of the Fund.” Overall, GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Oracle’s (ORCL) Strong Earnings and AI Partnership: What’s Next for the Software Giant?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against the other top performing dividend stocks in 2024. Over time, dividend stocks have shown consistent resilience in difficult market conditions. Despite the recent focus on AI, the long-term appeal of these stocks has grown. Income investors have noticed this shift, reflected in the increasing role of dividends in personal income. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices reveals that the share of dividend income has risen from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024, emphasizing the importance of dividends as a key income source. The report also noted that since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than a third of total equity returns in the broader market, with the rest coming from capital gains. The dividend growth strategy seems to be working for long-term investors as these stocks have generated strong returns over the years. Considering inflation, dividends have outpaced it, suggesting that investors should focus on these stocks. A report by Wisdom Tree highlighted that from 1957 to 2023, dividends grew at an average annual rate of 5.7%, which is over 2% higher than the inflation rate. The report also pointed out that dividends have only decreased in six years during the past 64 years, and only once by more than 5%. In comparison, stock prices fell in 18 of those years, with the worst decline exceeding 40% and an average drop of over 11%. Stock prices were more than twice as volatile as dividend cash flows, as short-term price movements are more influenced by market sentiment, while long-term value is driven by the stability of cash flows. READ ALSO: 10 Dividend Stocks For Steady Income This year, dividend stocks have underperformed compared to the broader market. The Dividend Aristocrat Index has gained only 6% year-to-date, while the market has surged by over 27%. Although this might seem discouraging for dividend investors, seasoned investors recognize that this presents a great opportunity to buy dividend stocks. Chris O’Keefe, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management, pointed out that the widening performance gap between the market and dividend stocks in 2024 creates an ideal time for investors to consider these equities. Along with O'Keefe, many analysts are encouraging investors to focus on dividend stocks due to their favorable outlook. The Dividend Aristocrats index has struggled to keep pace with the market since 2020. Dividend stocks saw a brief resurgence in 2022 as recession concerns led investors to seek out stable sectors like utilities and consumer goods, but the recovery was short-lived. By 2023, rising interest rates made bond and money-market returns more attractive than dividend yields, causing companies to adopt a more cautious stance and conserve cash amid economic uncertainty. This year, many of the top-performing stocks from the COVID era have once again driven the market to new highs. Despite underperforming for the past two consecutive years, analysts remain optimistic about dividend stocks. They believe that dividend-paying equities could see a resurgence in 2025, as investors are increasingly seeking cash returns. The broader market’s dividend yield recently dropped to a 20-year low, falling below 1.19%, significantly lower than the long-term historical average of 4.3%. With interest rates rising on risk-free investments like Treasuries, companies are recognizing the growing competition for yield. As a result, many are responding by increasing dividends or introducing them for the first time. Notably, several major technology companies began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market that they are positioning themselves as value plays within a high-growth sector. A team of IT professionals meticulously crafting a large-scale enterprise performance management system. For this article, we first used a stock screener to identify stocks that have reported positive returns in 2024 so far. From this selection, we chose dividend stocks with the highest year-to-date (YTD) as of December 25. The stocks were then arranged in ascending order of their YTD gains. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Year-to-Date Return as of December 25: 64.7% Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is an American software company, based in Texas. The company is mainly known for its top-notch data center infrastructure crucial to AI development and is facing demand that exceeds its current supply. The company's efficient operations have made it a preferred partner for leading AI startups, such as OpenAI, Cohere, and Elon Musk’s xAI. Despite these efforts, Oracle is still struggling to meet the high demand, with 162 data centers either operational or under construction as of the first quarter of fiscal 2025. To address this challenge, the company plans to significantly expand, aiming to grow its data center network to between 1,000 and 2,000 in the future. The stock has surged by nearly 65% since the start of 2024, which makes it one of the best performing stocks on our list. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) reported strong earnings in fiscal Q2 2025, with revenue totaling $14.06 billion, a 9% increase compared to the same period last year. Cloud revenue, which includes both Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), reached $5.9 billion, reflecting a 24% growth in both USD and constant currency. Within this segment, cloud infrastructure revenue (IaaS) amounted to $2.4 billion, marking an impressive 52% increase in both USD and constant currency. Oracle's cloud revenue is expected to surpass $25 billion for the current fiscal year. Parnassus Investments made the following comment about ORCL in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) announced second-quarter results that exceeded consensus expectations, driven by growth in its cloud infrastructure business, which is benefiting from demand for AI applications. Investor sentiment was further bolstered by the company’s announcement of a new partnership with Amazon.” Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has a strong cash position which supports its dividend payments. The company has paid regular dividends to shareholders since 2009. Over the last 12 months, its operating cash flow was $20.3 billion and its free cash flow during this period amounted to $9.5 billion. It offers a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.93%, as of December 25. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 91 funds held stakes in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), compared with 93 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $7 billion. Among these hedge funds, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall, ORCL ranks 5th on our list of the best performing dividend stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential for ORCL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORCL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: TikTok Ban: Free-Speech Groups, Members of Congress Urge Supreme Court to Save App on First Amendment Grounds

Groups alleging China's government has engaged in human-rights violations argue U.S. Constitution does not protect TikTok as “an unregistered foreign agent” By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Ahead of the Supreme Court‘s Jan. 10 hearing on whether to grant TikTok an emergency injunction to prevent it from being banned by the U.S. government, several groups and members of Congress have weighed in on the issue — both against the law, arguing it violates First Amendment rights of TikTok’s users, and in support of the ban because of national security concerns over its Chinese parent company. The Supreme Court agreed to hear TikTok’s appeal for an emergency injunction blocking a federal law — the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act — that will ban the popular video app unless Chinese parent ByteDance sells its stake. The high court scheduled arguments to hear TikTok’s appeal on Friday, Jan. 10, on an expedited timeline that will let the court consider the issue before the law is set to take effect on Jan. 19. According to the court’s docket, a total of two hours is allotted for oral argument. “The parties are directed to brief and argue the following question: Whether the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, as applied to petitioners, violates the First Amendment,” the Supreme Court’s docket listing for the case said. Related Stories VIP+ Celebrity AI: Using Talent Digital Replicas Kimberly Williams-Paisley Couldn't Speak for Two Years Due to Vocal Cord Paralysis and Lost Acting Jobs: 'I Felt Invisible' and 'Trapped in My Own Body' Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), along with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), filed an amicus brief with the court Friday in support of TikTok’s appeal. “All three are strong advocates of free expression and are deeply concerned that the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act will deprive millions of Americans of their First Amendment rights,” they said in the brief. Popular on Variety SEE ALSO: Trump Urges Supreme Court to Halt TikTok Ban While His Administration Works Out a ‘Negotiated Resolution’ “The TikTok ban does not survive First Amendment scrutiny,” Markey, Paul and Khanna wrote. “Its only historical parallels are illegitimate. Its principal justification — preventing covert content manipulation by the Chinese government — reflects a desire to control the content on the TikTok platform and in any event could be achieved through a less restrictive alternative. And its secondary justification of protecting users’ data from the Chinese government could not sustain the ban on its own and also overlooks that Congress did not consider whether less drastic mitigation measures could address those concerns.” Also backing TikTok in an amicus brief were eight free-speech groups — the ACLU, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Center for Democracy & Technology, Freedom of the Press Foundation, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, Progressive Policy Institute, Fight for the Future and Public Knowledge. In their brief, they noted “the government has not presented credible evidence of ongoing or imminent harm caused by TikTok.” “Banning TikTok would trample on the constitutional rights of over 170 million Americans,” Patrick Toomey, deputy director of ACLU’s National Security Project, said in a statement. “This social media platform has allowed people around the world to tell their own stories in key moments of social upheaval, war and natural disaster while reaching immense global audiences. The government’s attempt to cut U.S. users off from speaking and sharing on TikTok is extraordinary and unprecedented.” He added that TikTok “is a unique forum for expression online — and the connections and community that so many have built there cannot be easily replaced. TikTok creators can’t simply transfer their audiences and followers to another app, and TikTok users can’t simply reassemble the many voices they’ve discovered on the platform.” In a separate amicus brief, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, Free Press and PEN America also urged the Supreme Court to strike down the federal TikTok ban. In their brief, the groups argued the law is viewpoint-motivated because it “forecloses an entire medium of expression online.” The group claimed the government has no legitimate interest in banning Americans from accessing foreign speech, even if that speech reflects foreign manipulation, and that while the government has a legitimate interest in protecting U.S. citizens from covert propaganda and safeguarding their personal data, those interests can be achieved through less restrictive means. “Restricting citizens’ access to foreign media is a practice that has long been associated with repressive regimes, and we should be very wary of letting the practice take root here,” said Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute. “Upholding the ban would do lasting damage to the First Amendment and our democracy.” On the other side, seven human-rights groups — which said they are “dedicated to shedding light on the blatant human rights violations occurring in the People’s Republic of China” — filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in favor of the TikTok divest-or-ban law. The groups (Campaign for Uyghurs, the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Watch, International Campaign for Tibet, Uyghur American Association, Uyghur Human Rights Project and Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation) argued the law is constitutional and a “necessary step toward protecting the physical and digital safety of those who seek to illuminate the atrocities occurring in the PRC.” “TikTok under its current corporate structure is a clear instrument for the CCP to harass, target and silence activists and dissidents in the U.S., the PRC, and around the world,” the group said. “In sum, we stand for the proposition that the U.S. Constitution does not protect a PRC company’s right to act as an unregistered foreign agent — covertly shaping the American information environment through a nonexpressive algorithm at the instruction of a foreign adversary government.” According to the law, in the absence of a “qualified divestiture” by ByteDance, the TikTok ban will go into effect Jan. 19 — unless the law is blocked by the Supreme Court. The law gives the U.S. president the ability to grant a one-time extension of “not more than 90 days” if the president determines that ByteDance has a legitimate sales negotiation in progress to sell its TikTok stake; if that’s the case, the sell-or-ban date would be April 19, 2025. After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in a Dec. 6 ruling rejected TikTok’s argument that the law unconstitutionally infringes Americans’ First Amendment rights, TikTok and ByteDance filed the appeal with the Supreme Court seeking the emergency injunction. The D.C. Circuit, in its unanimous 3-0 ruling, said the law does “not target speech based upon its communicative content. The TikTok-specific provisions instead straightforwardly require only that TikTok divest its platform as a precondition to operating in the United States.” According to the court, the U.S. government “has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the Act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.” President Biden signed the TikTok divest-or-ban bill into law on April 24, 2024, after it passed in Congress with solid bipartisan support. U.S. lawmakers have expressed deep concern about TikTok’s Chinese ownership, suggesting that the Chinese communist regime could use the app to spy on Americans or use it to promulgate pro-China propaganda. The law’s backers have argued that it is not a ban of TikTok per se, because it would allow TikTok to continue to be distributed in the U.S. if ByteDance divests its stake in TikTok to a party or parties not based in a country the U.S. designates a “foreign adversary.” In an amicus brief submitted to the Supreme Court on Dec. 18, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urged the Supreme Court to reject TikTok’s request for an emergency injunction. “TikTok is a wildly popular social-media application under the direct control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),” the senator wrote. The “clear national-security threat posed by this application” prompted Congress to pass the law, which, by forcing a sale by ByteDance, would “remove[] the control of this popular application from the primary geopolitical opponent of the United States.” McConnell wrote that “Any such injunction will move the divesture date beyond that prescribed by law —and into a new presidential administration. TikTok clearly hopes that the next administration will be more sympathetic to its plight than the incumbent administration. In other words, delay is the point.” President-elect Donald Trump was noncommittal when he was asked at a press conference earlier this month whether he would try to reverse the TikTok law, responding, “We’ll take a look at TikTok.” Trump added, “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok” because of his belief that the app helped drive young voters toward his side of the ballot. VIP+ Analysis: TikTok Has Entered the Realm of the Internet Traffic “Supergiants” During his first term as president, Trump was unsuccessful in his efforts to force ByteDance to sell majority control in TikTok to U.S. owners, also citing national security fears. Trump’s divest-or-ban executive order was found unconstitutional by federal courts on First Amendment grounds. A year ago, a federal judge blocked Montana’s first-of-its-kind statewide ban of TikTok, ruling that the law likely violated the First Amendment. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, at a March 2023 hearing held by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, asserted that “ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government.” ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group.

Title: Jim Cramer on Uber Technologies, Inc. (UBER): ‘It Is Up A Lot This Month, So Let’s Be Careful And Only Buy Some, Not All’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-uber-technologies-inc-180554046.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bearish Calls: 10 Tech Stocks Heading for a Crash. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stands against the other tech stocks. For Jim Cramer, tech stocks and the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts are a major talking point. Investors continued to deal with an uncertain macroeconomic picture that was complicated by a 'bullish dove' of a Fed that cut interest rates by 25 basis points but also hinted that 2025 would see fewer rate cuts than expected. The day the Fed announced the interest rate cut, the benchmark flagship S&P index sank by 2.95%, with more speculative investments such as Bitcoin dropping by a sharper 8.6%. Yet, as has been the case with the macroeconomic picture, the sell-off appeared to be a bit too much. Two days later, on Friday, the Commerce Department released the ever-important Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) dataset. The PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation reading, and it revealed that the annualized inflation in November was 2.4%. This reading was shy of 0.1 percentage point of economist expectations. As a result, it signaled to investors that perhaps the Fed might take it easy with the interest rates heading into 2025. The slightly improved expectations saw the S&P gain 1.86% on the day of the PCE data release. Cramer was optimistic as well, sharing that the data was "somewhat reassuring. Because if we do get lower inflation, I think it's certainly a possibility because we're starting to get our arms around what's really causing inflation. Then it doesn't seem so devastating, what happened on Wednesday." However, he added that the bullish data release didn't mean that markets would reverse all their losses since Wednesday. Despite the fact that inflation ticked lower, the S&P index is still down 1.83% since the data release. Cramer shared some insight into the reasons behind the weakness. According to him, the market has been speculating a lot on areas such as quantum computing and Bitcoin. The CNBC host outlined that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" had driven the market performance ahead of the rate announcement. Consequently, since these areas lack fundamentals, investors might not have immediately returned to them. His Squawk on the Street appearance the day after the rate cut was also full of pessimism for quantum computing stocks. These stocks have gained as much as 162% over the past month - a development that would, on the surface, indicate a groundbreaking shift in their prospects. However, these movements have been driven primarily by Google's Willow quantum computing chip. The hype surrounding quantum computing is understandable as Willow claims to solve a problem that would take a traditional supercomputer 10 septillion years to solve in less than five minutes. However, Cramer remains unconvinced about this technology niche. Commenting on the stock that ranked 16th on this list of stocks that he talked about, the host wondered what had driven its 162% in returns. Likening quantum computing stocks to non-fungible tokens, Cramer commented: "How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is? It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” As for the Fed, he believes that the central bank's data-dependent strategies backfired with the bullish rate outlook as "they chose not to be data-dependent." On the episode of Mad Money aired the day of the rate cut, he speculated that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to have been "caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn’t back it up." Cramer added that he believed "It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today’s meltdown.” On the next day, Cramer added the Fed might have been better off ahead of the call not having signaled that it was going to cut rates. However, as it did the opposite, it was locked into cutting rates while the data pointed towards a robust economy that might not have needed lower interest rates. "I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates," shared Cramer and added that the Fed "got trapped, Jay got trapped.” For 2025, Cramer wants investors to focus on stocks that might change the world. In a recent Mad Money episode, he outlined that some stocks tend to stand against the tide due to fiercely loyal followers. Sharing some advice, Cramer stated: “There’s a lesson here and it is a brutal one. Sometimes conventional methods of valuation are completely worthless, and you need to embrace the dynamics of cult stocks. The trick is to recognize when we’re in one of those moments. In 2025, let’s strive to find the stocks of companies that do defy orthodoxy.” Our Methodology To make our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech stock calls, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks he was bearish on, analyzed their performance, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close up view of a hand holding a smartphone, using a ride sharing app. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 136 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-26-24 Performance Since Then: -15% Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is the biggest ride-sharing service provider in America. Estimates show that the firm controls 76% of US ride-sharing spending, and this business also accounted for 51% of its revenue during H1 2024. Consequently, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) depends on consumer spending and economic activity for its financial and share price health. The stock fell by 7% in October when bookings for the quarter missed analyst estimates, and overall, it has gained a modest 5.70% year-to-date. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is also facing competition in the autonomous driving market, as was evident in December when the shares fell by 9.6% after Google's Waymo announced that it would be expanding to Miami. Here's what Cramer said in August: "I actually like buying some Uber here and then waiting for a little bit of a pullback. Uber is doing incredibly well, and you may not get that pullback, so I want you to get some on the sheets as we talk about it. It is up a lot this month, so let's be careful and only buy some, not all." Overall UBER ranks 2nd among the tech stocks Jim Cramer talked about recently. While we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UBER but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer on Snowflake Inc. (SNOW): ‘I Think I’m Going To Hold Off On Recommending It’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bearish Calls: 10 Tech Stocks Heading for a Crash. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) stands against the other tech stocks. For Jim Cramer, tech stocks and the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts are a major talking point. Investors continued to deal with an uncertain macroeconomic picture that was complicated by a 'bullish dove' of a Fed that cut interest rates by 25 basis points but also hinted that 2025 would see fewer rate cuts than expected. The day the Fed announced the interest rate cut, the benchmark flagship S&P index sank by 2.95%, with more speculative investments such as Bitcoin dropping by a sharper 8.6%. Yet, as has been the case with the macroeconomic picture, the sell-off appeared to be a bit too much. Two days later, on Friday, the Commerce Department released the ever-important Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) dataset. The PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation reading, and it revealed that the annualized inflation in November was 2.4%. This reading was shy of 0.1 percentage point of economist expectations. As a result, it signaled to investors that perhaps the Fed might take it easy with the interest rates heading into 2025. The slightly improved expectations saw the S&P gain 1.86% on the day of the PCE data release. Cramer was optimistic as well, sharing that the data was "somewhat reassuring. Because if we do get lower inflation, I think it's certainly a possibility because we're starting to get our arms around what's really causing inflation. Then it doesn't seem so devastating, what happened on Wednesday." However, he added that the bullish data release didn't mean that markets would reverse all their losses since Wednesday. Despite the fact that inflation ticked lower, the S&P index is still down 1.83% since the data release. Cramer shared some insight into the reasons behind the weakness. According to him, the market has been speculating a lot on areas such as quantum computing and Bitcoin. The CNBC host outlined that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" had driven the market performance ahead of the rate announcement. Consequently, since these areas lack fundamentals, investors might not have immediately returned to them. His Squawk on the Street appearance the day after the rate cut was also full of pessimism for quantum computing stocks. These stocks have gained as much as 162% over the past month - a development that would, on the surface, indicate a groundbreaking shift in their prospects. However, these movements have been driven primarily by Google's Willow quantum computing chip. The hype surrounding quantum computing is understandable as Willow claims to solve a problem that would take a traditional supercomputer 10 septillion years to solve in less than five minutes. However, Cramer remains unconvinced about this technology niche. Commenting on the stock that ranked 16th on this list of stocks that he talked about, the host wondered what had driven its 162% in returns. Likening quantum computing stocks to non-fungible tokens, Cramer commented: "How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is? It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” As for the Fed, he believes that the central bank's data-dependent strategies backfired with the bullish rate outlook as "they chose not to be data-dependent." On the episode of Mad Money aired the day of the rate cut, he speculated that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to have been "caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn’t back it up." Cramer added that he believed "It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today’s meltdown.” On the next day, Cramer added the Fed might have been better off ahead of the call not having signaled that it was going to cut rates. However, as it did the opposite, it was locked into cutting rates while the data pointed towards a robust economy that might not have needed lower interest rates. "I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates," shared Cramer and added that the Fed "got trapped, Jay got trapped.” For 2025, Cramer wants investors to focus on stocks that might change the world. In a recent Mad Money episode, he outlined that some stocks tend to stand against the tide due to fiercely loyal followers. Sharing some advice, Cramer stated: “There’s a lesson here and it is a brutal one. Sometimes conventional methods of valuation are completely worthless, and you need to embrace the dynamics of cult stocks. The trick is to recognize when we’re in one of those moments. In 2025, let’s strive to find the stocks of companies that do defy orthodoxy.” Our Methodology To make our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech stock calls, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks he was bearish on, analyzed their performance, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A software engineer at work, surrounded by a wall of computer monitors connected to a 'Data Cloud' platform. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 71 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-16-24 Performance Since Then: 27.35% Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) is a data warehousing company which estimates show holds a sizable 22% market share. Its business model and market share create unique opportunities in the AI wave as data is the 'oil' of AI models. However, Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)'s shares are down by 13.9% year-to-date as the firm has been hit with a slowdown in the broader cloud industry and battled management issues. The second half of the year has been kinder to Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) as it appears to have regained its footing. The stock is up by 26% since its third-quarter earnings report which beat analyst revenue and product revenue estimates. The release also saw Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) guide Q4 and full-year revenue at $908.5 million and $3.43 billion to beat analyst estimates. Since Cramer's remarks in August, the shares have gained 27.35%. Here's what he said: "The latest feedback I'm getting about Snowflake is that they’re facing some difficulties and are being challenged by a couple of companies. It’s kind of a tough road for them right now. I think I’m going to hold off on recommending it." Overall SNOW ranks 4th among the tech stocks Jim Cramer talked about recently. While we acknowledge the potential of SNOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SNOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Analyst on NVIDIA (NVDA): Investors Should Be ‘Very Vigilant’ Amid Rising Competition

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. Investors are looking for new growth horizons in the AI industry to gauge whether the current market rally can continue for the years to come. Chetan Puttagunta, Benchmark general partner, said he’s noticed a lot of innovation in the past few weeks focused on improving the efficiency of algorithms. “In the last six to eight weeks, we’ve seen a tremendous amount of innovation, especially at the model layer, and then for the last two years at the application layer, taking advantage of all the advances in the AI models. Specifically, what’s happening at the model layer is, as we move into an inference-time or test-time compute paradigm, you’re seeing a lot more advantage to entrepreneurs and technical founders that are able to push to the frontier with algorithmic innovation.” To explain how AI is now actually improving workflows, Puttagunta gave the example of Sierra, a conversational AI startup making customer service solutions. “So think of this Sierra AI agent, if you will, delivering the best customer service agent experience every time, replicated an infinite number of times. And that’s an experience that was previously not possible without AI.” READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks that are making moves amid the latest news. With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jessica Lessin, The Information founder, editor-in-chief and CEO, recently discussed the state of AI space and her outlook on 2025. She mentioned the rising competition in the industry. “I think 2025 is going to be the year where all bets are off—or rather, all gloves are off—in AI competition. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will dominate GPUs, but you’re also seeing Broadcom and others partnering with tech companies to diversify. Last week, at The Information, we reported that Broadcom is now working with Apple on an AI chip for inference. While it doesn’t directly compete with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), there is significant competition in the space. I believe investors should stay very vigilant and try to understand the dynamics within each tech company. The key question inside these firms is: how can we build, build, build to create more optionality in AI technology?” Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools. Nvidia’s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon’s new silicon. Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “As of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.” Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This enables the firm to enjoy a wide moat, which has strengthened in today's era of data centers and cloud computing. Big tech firms have used ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)'s designs to make in-house chips. The firm has also sought to further solidify its market presence by providing an off-the-shelf solution to firms looking to design chips. However, ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)'s shares are down by 16% over the past six months as they have been driven by the firm's inability to significantly benefit from the ongoing AI boom despite its near-ubiquity in the smartphone industry. In August, Cramer shared that he preferred ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) over Intel, and the latter's stock has lost 5.6% since his comments: "Intel is struggling with competition from AMD and Nvidia, and I prefer ARM Holdings over Intel in the current tech landscape. Intel has challenges but may benefit if it can leverage AI advances effectively." Overall ARM ranks 6th among the tech stocks Jim Cramer talked about recently.

We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. CJ Muse, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst, explained in a latest program on CNBC that the AI investment cycle is different from the ones we have seen in the past. Muse believes major technology companies investing billions in AI are generating “meaningful” free cash flows. “This cycle is unlike any other. I think most investors look back to the advent of the internet and how long the internet infrastructure investment cycle played out. But this one’s very different. The companies making the investments, predominantly the hyperscalers, are generating meaningful free cash flow despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars building out AI. Let’s be clear: this is existential for these companies as they all try to get to AGI. I think this is a multi-year investment cycle.” The analyst talked about the latest AI model released by OpenAI and said the race is now to reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) and companies would require more and more computing power to improve the reasoning capabilities of AI systems. READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently making headlines on the back of latest analyst ratings and important news.

A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 128 Vijay Rakesh, Mizuho senior semiconductor analyst, said in a latest program on CNBC that Broadcom shares have more room to run: “Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), on the other hand, is just starting to put up massive numbers now. I think we like the name; they have a huge ramp coming up over the next two years. It’s very under-owned. People were cautious heading into earnings, and so we think there is probably some more legs left to the run.” Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. However, the stock could face the impact of what Nvidia is facing today: too high expectations. In the latest quarterly results, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) revenue was largely in line with estimates. The company has narrowly exceeded revenue expectations by less than 5% in most cases. Some analysts suggest Broadcom’s growth rates will moderate to below 20% CAGR starting the first quarter of 2025. In fiscal Q4, it was +50% topline growth. The market won’t be kind to the stock when the revenue growth rate slows. Broadcom has about $58 billion in net debt, which is relatively high. Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Similar to the earnings results for Nvidia, shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) initially sold off after the company reported solid earnings that fell light of elevated market expectations, but the stock did recover from its drawdown in the matter of a few weeks. With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. Broadcom outlined a path to derive a majority of its revenue from the AI end market within a couple of years, and the non-AI part of the business has stabilized after a deep correction. The company’s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.” Overall, AVGO ranks 4th on our list of buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Billionaire D.E. Shaw Is Bullish On This Stock Right Now

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire D.E. Shaw. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks. Equity market pricing is never perfect due to supply and demand imbalances, emotional reactions, and errors. Billionaire investor David Elliot Shaw excels at detecting and exploiting these inefficiencies to generate shareholder value. Unlike most hedge fund managers who rely on intuition, Shaw uses sophisticated mathematical models and algorithms for investment decisions. Over the years, he has developed software and hardware to gain an edge in investment opportunities. Born in 1951, David E. Shaw became a successful billionaire scientist and hedge fund manager. After earning a PhD from Stanford in 1980, he founded D.E. Shaw & Co. in 1988 with six employees and $28 million in capital. The hedge fund has averaged a 12.5% return since inception, with only one down year. Shaw's firm uses powerful computers and advanced algorithms for quick market responses and risk management, returning over $51 billion to investors. Likewise, it generated a net return of 11.88% between 2001 and 2011. While Shaw’s firm was down by 9% at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, it bounced back to profitability with a 21% return in 2009. READ ALSO: 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire David Einhorn and Billionaire Paul Singer’s Top 12 Long-Term Stock Picks. D.E. Shaw is expanding and launching new funds. In 2023, they raised money for D.E. Shaw Alkali Fund VI, the newest in their Alkali group. By November 2024, they had secured $1 billion for this fund, focusing on corporate debt, structured credit, and synthetic securitizations. Last year, the firm also raised $1.1 billion for two new private investment vehicles: D.E. Shaw Voltaic Fund and D.E. Shaw Diopter Fund. In June 2024, D.E. Shaw announced it was raising its second fund in 16 months to target bank capital deals. They filed a private placement notice for D.E. Shaw Diopter Fund II, but the amount wasn't disclosed. Bloomberg reported that D.E. Shaw's largest hedge fund, the D.E. Shaw Composite Fund, gained 9.6% in 2023, outperforming the HFR Global Hedge Fund Index, which was up about 2.5% through December 15. Reuters added that D.E. Shaw's macro-oriented fund, the Oculus Fund, gained 7.8% in 2023, beating its macroeconomic peers. According to Bloomberg, the Oculus Fund has never had a negative year since it started. Diversification is another vital arsenal that D.E. Shaw & Co. relies on to spread risk and reduce market volatility. The firm is highly diversified with a portfolio value of about $116.49 billion. While technology stocks account for the most significant share in the equity market at 24.6%, the hedge fund also has stakes in Services at 17.5% and the financial sector at 7.7%. In addition to diversifying holdings, Shaw relies on a multi-strategy approach to squeeze optimum value in the market. Billionaire D.E. Shaw suggests investing in resilient companies, even as the US Federal Reserve signals fewer interest rate cuts in 2025. Despite three cuts reducing the benchmark rate to 4.25%-4.5%, economic slowdown concerns persist, especially in the labor market. Job growth is mainly in government and health care, while growth in manufacturing, business, and professional services has stagnated. Our Methodology To make the list of best stocks to buy according to billionaire D.E. Shaw, we scanned D.E. Shaw & Co investment portfolio. We then settled on the hedge fund’s largest holdings analyzing why they stand out and the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in them. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on D.E. Shaw & Co stake value. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. D.E. Shaw & Co’s Stake Value: $976.47 Million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 235 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a communications services company that provides applications that allow people to connect and share with friends and family. It is one of the best stocks to buy, according to billionaire D.E. Shaw, owing to its dominance in social media advertising. The company is increasingly investing in artificial intelligence as it looks to enhance user experience in its apps and engagement levels to attract more advertising campaigns. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is up by more than 73% in 2024, demonstrating strong financial performance over the year. Its outstanding 23% year-over-year revenue growth has outpaced the digital advertising industry. Likewise, the company boasts an exceptional gross margin of 81.5%, allowing it to generate more earnings and, therefore, higher shareholder value. While the global digital advertising market is poised to exceed $1.15 trillion by 2030, Meta Platforms is making the most in the fast-growing sector. The company is investing more in artificial intelligence tools to drive returns for advertisers and, therefore, attract more dollars in ad campaigns. Advertisers have seen an 8% increase in the quality of ads they can produce when they use Meta's Andromeda machine learning (ML) tool. The social networking giant also notes that returns on investment have increased by 22% as a result of advertisers using its Advantage+ tool, which uses AI to help them target audiences. Because of this, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has a good chance of continuing to grow faster than the digital ad market for a very long time. Hardman Johnston Global Equity stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “During the quarter, we initiated one new position in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and had no liquidations. Management at Meta has effectively addressed concerns about investment efficiency by shifting resources from Reality Labs towards broader AI initiatives with a clearer path to profitability. We believe management has successfully articulated the benefits of this strategy, highlighting how AI is driving user engagement and advertiser productivity. This, in turn, fuels continued revenue momentum and increases the likelihood of positive earnings surprises in the future. Additionally, the parent company of the social media platform, Facebook, has recently taken positive steps to enhance safety, which suggests to us a shift towards a more proactive and responsive approach to addressing important potential challenges and concerns. Weak oversight over data privacy protection was a key reason why we sold the position in the portfolio back in 2021. Removing this governance overhang allows us to feel comfortable to enter back into the stock at a time when we believe it is poised for strong earnings growth going forward.” Overall META ranks 4th on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Billionaire D. E. Shaw. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Dutch Bros Inc. (BROS): A Bear Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bearish thesis on Dutch Bros Inc. (NYSE:BROS) on wallstreetbets Subreddit Page by Impressive_Safety_26. In this article, we will summarize the bears’ thesis on BROS. Dutch Bros Inc. (NYSE:BROS)'s share was trading at $55.82 as of Dec 26th. BROS’s trailing and forward P/E were 186.07 and 104.17 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A cup of the company's signature coffee being brewed in a state-of-the-art espresso machine. Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) has been expanding rapidly since its inception in 2017, growing from a single location in a small Colorado college town to a notable presence across the state. However, despite its outward growth, the company faces significant challenges that could hinder its future success. The long lines, intense competition with Starbucks and Dunkin', and the growing focus on healthy, less indulgent options all point to issues that may harm Dutch Bros' ability to maintain its edge in the coffee industry. The shift in its brand image, from vibrant, energetic service to more eclectic and diverse employees, has alienated some customers, leading to a diminished in-store experience that used to appeal to coffee drinkers seeking a fun, carefree environment. Dutch Bros’ core customers are not interested in calorie counts or protein-infused coffees. They want sugary, indulgent drinks, and recent shifts toward health-conscious options could alienate this loyal base, potentially leading to a loss in sales. Moreover, the company is attempting to take on bigger, more established players like Starbucks, Dunkin', and independent cafes, which are already entrenched in prime real estate locations. While Dutch Bros is targeting an ambitious expansion plan of 1,500 stores over the next decade, the costs associated with each new location—up to $1 million—are substantial, and the company’s average check size may not be sufficient to support this growth, especially when compared to Starbucks' robust global infrastructure. In addition to the financial burden of expansion, Dutch Bros is shifting from its iconic drive-thru huts to larger stores with indoor and outdoor seating. This move introduces higher overhead costs, which could reduce profit margins. The company may struggle to find prime locations in major urban centers where Starbucks already dominates, and as customers move inside, they may reconsider their purchases or even opt to make coffee at home, further weakening sales. Dutch Bros' financial performance has also been concerning, with a net loss of $16 million reported last quarter while expanding. This, coupled with a low operating margin, presents a bleak financial picture, despite the high expectations reflected in the company’s sky-high P/S ratio. The new CEO, Christine Barone, may have impressive credentials, but her focus on McDonald’s over Dutch Bros raises questions about her vision for the company. Though Barone has the potential to steer Dutch Bros in the right direction, the company faces an uphill battle to compete with established industry giants. Dutch Bros' growth potential may be overstated, and its current market valuation may be inflated, with limited prospects for sustained profitability unless it can radically adjust its strategy and manage its costs more effectively. For investors, Dutch Bros might be a high-risk gamble in a competitive and expensive industry. Dutch Bros Inc. (NYSE:BROS) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 37 hedge fund portfolios held BROS at the end of the third quarter which was 37 in the previous quarter.

Title: Wall St Minting Easy Money From Risky Loans. What Could Go Wrong?
URL: https://dnyuz.com/2024/12/27/wall-st-is-minting-easy-money-from-risky-loans-what-could-go-wrong/
Time Published: 2024-12-27T13:00:03Z
Full Content:
In the fall of 2015, in the back booth of the retro Putnam Restaurant in Greenwich, Conn., Craig Packer, a partner at Goldman Sachs, sat across from Doug Ostrover and listened to an audacious pitch. Mr. Ostrover, then 52, had recently left the investment colossus Blackstone and was mulling a dramatic midcareer effort to build a firm from scratch, one that would take on some of the biggest names in global finance. Quit your job, the billionaire financier told the 48-year-old Mr. Packer, and join me. As Mr. Packer later recalled, Mr. Ostrover wanted to create a firm that would lend money to highly indebted, risky businesses willing to pay hefty interest rates for fast cash. If it succeeded, the new enterprise, and its founding partners, could dominate a new financial playing field with the potential for huge profits. Mr. Ostrover’s pitch (one he would also make to Marc Lipschultz, a two-decade veteran of KKR who would eventually become another founder of the nascent firm) was to leap into the business of “private credit,” a simple-sounding term that belies its complexity — and its risk. The new venture would not be a bank, but would operate almost like one — without the regulatory restrictions and government oversight that had made traditional banks skittish about this market. Unlike a bank, the firm would be amassing money not from individual depositors, whose savings are fiercely protected by the federal government and can be withdrawn at will, but from institutions like insurance companies and pension funds. Thus, the new firm would be legally permitted to finance tricky, highly speculative companies without reporting the details of such activities publicly. During the next several months, over scrambled eggs at the diner and meetings elsewhere, Mr. Ostrover, Mr. Packer and Mr. Lipschultz agreed that the venture offered them a great opportunity — but only if they started at a gigantic scale, $10 billion or so. A bet that size would be a game-changing move in the world of private credit, where small, shady lending shops did backroom financing deals for even shadier fledgling companies. Eventually, the three men raised $12 billion, undercutting their would-be competitors by promising big pension funds and others, like the investment fund run by George Soros, low investment fees if they backed the new firm. Large investors — including Brown University’s endowments, New Jersey’s pension fund, Michael Dell’s investment firm and Iconiq Capital — were given stakes in the firm, essentially making them owners of the new enterprise. “They wanted to become one of the largest financial players on the planet,” said Oliver Weisberg, chief executive of Blue Pool Capital, which led that initial financing round. “That was always their plan.” Over the next few years, the new firm set off a high-stakes arms race among some of the biggest names in global finance. Interest rates had been low since the 2007-8 financial crisis, so pension funds and other institutional investors were desperate to find ways to earn higher returns on their investments. The debt markets, Mr. Ostrover told prospective clients, were much more stable, year over year, than stocks or commodities. And the firm, then called Owl Rock Capital, took the unusual step of setting itself up with so-called permanent investor capital that it would hold even longer than a typical private equity fund, where investors tie up money for a few years or even a decade. This would allow it to make increasingly long-term loans. In return, clients were offered the prospect of far higher returns than they could earn with more conventional investments. “Doug could talk a dog off a meat truck,” said David Salomon, an investment adviser who agreed to help stake the new venture after meeting with Mr. Ostrover over beers at a strip-mall Chinese restaurant. The firm’s founders had “a great vision,” said Mr. Salomon, who manages money for endowments, pensions and family offices through his firm, East End Advisors. Nearly a decade after its founding, Blue Owl Capital — as the firm was renamed — is succeeding in ways that might have seemed unimaginable in that cramped Connecticut diner booth. The firm, which went public in 2021 through a merger and employs more than 1,000 people, is one of the biggest private lenders on Wall Street, managing more than $235 billion of investors’ money. Blue Owl has both caught and created a once-in-a-generation wave, one that has brought a sweeping change to Wall Street. Over the past few years, roughly $1.8 trillion has been raised by private credit investment firms, including rivals like Ares and Apollo Global. That money has been lent to highly indebted companies in sectors like software, insurance and health care. “We’re financing many of the same companies that used to go to the public markets,” Mr. Packer said. To doubters, he added: “Ignore us at your peril.” Looking in from the outside are major banks like Goldman and JPMorgan Chase, whose executives now worry they are ceding their lucrative franchises of big-ticket financing to these less regulated rivals. At a closed-door Goldman management committee meeting this summer, the top brass debated a hard truth: The investment bank was increasingly falling behind in private credit, namely in arranging big-ticket loans for corporations, part of its bread-and-butter financing work, because the newcomers were willing to give out the money at easier terms — for example, by accepting less protection against defaults. “The more risk you take, the better you look,” Marc Nachmann, Goldman’s global head of asset and wealth management, advised the group. Still, the partners decided that they couldn’t ignore the frenzy; Goldman would continue to organize, for a fee, investment funds in which its clients can lend money alongside and in competition with private credit firms. Other big players are also moving in. This month, BlackRock, a publicly traded asset manager and one of the biggest names on Wall Street, staked its claim with a deal to buy the private credit upstart HPS Investment Partners for $12 billion. In its announcement, BlackRock predicted that the private credit market would more than double to $4.5 trillion by 2030. Already the success of Blue Owl has brought mammoth riches to its founders. Mr. Lipschultz and Mr. Ostrover — both cited as billionaires by Forbes — recently bought a majority stake in the Tampa Bay Lightning in a deal that valued the National Hockey League team at nearly $1.8 billion. (Mr. Packer is also an investor in the team.) And the origin story of the firm has become part of local lore. In Greenwich, a gold plaque that was recently installed at the Putnam Restaurant read: “The booth that launched a $25 billion company.” The sign is already out of date. Blue Owl’s public arm, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “OWL,” was recently valued at $35 billion. It can be a risky business, making loans to risky businesses. Consider the go-go junk bond era of the 1980s, as captured in books like “Den of Thieves” and “The Predators’ Ball.” Famously, Michael R. Milken’s Drexel Burnham Lambert organized loans for companies like Steve Wynn’s casinos, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp and the ultimately doomed cable operator MCI Communications. These bonds helped fuel the era of corporate raiders and became the backbone of the private equity industry, which used the debt to buy public companies, take them private and borrow more money again. This worked until it didn’t. Mr. Milken went to jail for violating federal securities laws, Drexel went belly up, and some of the companies financed with junk bonds eventually declared bankruptcy. By the mid-2000s, Wall Street bankers had found yet another way to expand access to credit and rake in billions through risky lending, this time with mortgages to borrowers with low credit scores. Bankers pooled mortgages from borrowers with a mix of high and low credit scores but financed the group as a whole as if they were all highly rated. This fueled a rapid increase in mortgages, inflating home prices. The subprime mortgage bubble eventually burst in 2007 and 2008, leading to a global financial crisis. To its detractors, private credit carries some of those same red flags. Officials at the International Monetary Fund (“could become a systematic risk”), at the Federal Reserve (“financial stability implications”) and on the Senate banking committee (“may pose hidden dangers”) have all chimed in with warnings. Regulators have raised a number of potential issues. Chief among them is that the industry’s rapid growth has not been tested in a long market downturn — a financial crisis or a prolonged recession. It’s unclear how the companies they lend to would fare in a weak economy. Even making a guess about what would happen, critics say, is difficult because of the opaqueness of the industry. While banks are required to publicly report the value of their loans, private credit firms are not. There is also the specter of contagion. Since so many private credit funds are backed by public pensions and other such entities, losses to the industry would ultimately be borne by millions of retirees. The hundreds of billions of dollars that Blue Owl manages include the pension funds of teachers in New York State, Texas and California. In New Jersey and South Carolina, Blue Owl invests on behalf of firefighters and other state employees. Private credit’s boosters say their lending portfolios are well diversified and unlikely to sour all at once, and they rightly point out that everything thus far has gone smoothly. They say they report the health of their loans to their private investors, who have the right to examine their obligations in detail — and do. As measured by the relative interest rates charged by this new class of lenders, there has been a paradigm shift. Banks and private lenders charge higher rates to risky borrowers, expressed as the “spread” or difference from the interest rate on U.S. Treasury bonds, generally considered the safest base-line investment. The larger the spread, the riskier the loan, or so goes the calculus. With so many new private credit firms competing to make loans, the average spread on such loans and high-yield bonds has shrunk drastically in the past two years. That perplexes longtime industry researchers such as Ed Altman, a professor emeritus at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “The markets are not risk-free,” Mr. Altman said. Perhaps most prominently, JPMorgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has emerged as a vocal critic of private credit. Last December, Mr. Dimon appeared before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs and urged the senators to do something about the unregulated and swift growth of private credit. Regulators, he said, will be “unable to see the next brewing crisis,” because so much activity has moved outside the banking system. If these private loans run into trouble, he said, lenders will be unlikely to refinance them, as banks do. Over the past year, private credit has become almost an obsession for Mr. Dimon, who has repeated those warnings on JPMorgan’s earnings calls, in meetings with clients and in television interviews with CNBC and Bloomberg. In May, he told Wall Street analysts that there would be “hell to pay” if a large number of these loans turned sour. Mr. Dimon is not a disinterested party, of course. By making huge loans with their own money, firms like Blue Owl have been encroaching on JPMorgan’s business of arranging loans of $1 billion or more to companies and private-equity firms. To claw back at least part of this market, JPMorgan has also been hunting for a private credit shop to buy. By mid-2024, JPMorgan nearly completed a deal to acquire Monroe Capital, a Chicago-based private lender, according to a person with knowledge of those negotiations. The deal faltered, however, when the two parties couldn’t agree on certain terms. In the meantime, JPMorgan has set aside around $10 billion of its own money — a pittance for the bank — to compete with the likes of Blue Owl on private credit deals. So while Mr. Dimon may think private credit is dangerous, he still wants in. While Blue Owl frequently promotes its track record — saying it has lost money on only a handful of deals it has financed over the past decade — that performance has been tested by strife between the lender and its partners in at least one major deal. In 2021, Blue Owl and a consortium extended a $1.7 billion loan to Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm, to buy Pluralsight, which makes educational and training videos for large technology companies. Rather than weigh the start-up’s profits, they based the loan on Pluralsight’s revenues and the projection for its growth. But Pluralsight’s customers, which included Deutsche Bank, Teach for America and 1-800 Contacts, soon began to bail. They became frustrated with Pluralsight’s course offerings and customer support. The company’s revenues plummeted. In July this year, the Blue Owl-led group allowed Vista to defer its quarterly payments on its debt. Vista tried to push lenders to cut its debt load and allow it to retain control of the company. Instead, by August, Blue Owl and its other lenders had become Pluralsight’s new owners. Vista lost billions on the deal, and the lending group, as of now, has lost roughly half of that $1.7 billion loan. (Blue Owl put $339 million into the original deal.) Blue Owl said Pluralsight was one of just six companies it had lost money on, out of more than 500 it had lent to over the last eight years. But many on Wall Street question whether Blue Owl and its peers’ loan numbers are too good to be true. Blue Owl says its loss rate is 0.1 percent. While that can’t be independently confirmed, it’s remarkably low even for a safe debt investment portfolio, let alone one like Blue Owl’s, which is made up of loans to companies that are considered generally poorer bets than those that qualify for investment-grade ratings. In an interview, Mr. Lipschultz said the firm’s portfolio was generally uncorrelated, arguing that it is unlikely to sour all at once. He summed up the business airily: “We’re the banks of old.” Because private credit firms don’t have to regularly reveal their loans to regulators, they can create their own rules for how to “mark,” or value, their portfolios. These loans, said Thomas Majewski, founder of Eagle Point Credit and a three-decade veteran of the lending industry, “are sometimes less rigorously marked” than they would be at regulated banks. Blue Owl charges its investing clients an annual fee based on the value of its portfolio of loans. So the higher the value, the more it makes. Blue Owl says that it uses third-party evaluators to mark portfolios, and that the independent board members sign off. Even Blue Owl says defaults are likely to rise if the economy enters a recession. Still, the firm said that even if a number of its deals ran into trouble, it was different from the banks that once financed these deals. “We don’t have depositors,” Mr. Lipschultz said. “We don’t have anybody who says, ‘OK, I need my money back today.’” Blue Owl’s founders insist that if any more of their companies run into trouble, the long-term commitments their investors have made give them the time and the flexibility to work through those issues. How long can the boom in private credit last? Practically everyone on Wall Street concedes that this “golden moment” — as Jonathan Gray, president of Blackstone, once put it — is bound to dim as more lenders emerge to compete with one another for a finite number of loans. The question is whether it will cause a shakeout that could spill into the broader economy, with dire consequences. Few influential voices in the financial world seem to have any immediate concerns. In a speech to the Brookings Institution in May, the Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook said: “Overall, I think the growth of private credit likely has not materially adversely affected the financial system’s resilience. Private credit funds appear well positioned to hold the riskiest parts of corporate lending.” Later that month, the Fed’s chair, Jerome H. Powell, commented that, in private credit, “many of the lending structures are not subject to a run in the way that banks have traditionally been.” He added that because their funding largely came from backers with a long-term commitment, “it’s not obvious to me that at this point it’s a net loss to financial stability.” But regulators are increasingly on edge. In November last year, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the chairman of the banking committee, wrote to regulators that “private credit funds operate in the shadows” and “in the absence of sufficient oversight and accountability.” The International Monetary Fund stated in April that the sector “has meaningful vulnerabilities, is opaque to stakeholders and is growing rapidly under limited prudential oversight.” “It’s crazy,” said Philipp Krohn, chief executive of Alantra US, an investment bank. “Every time we look, they are getting bigger.” Failures could have a cascading effect throughout the financial markets. Because private credit firms borrow from banks — JPMorgan lends to Blue Owl, for instance — “there is actually an umbilical cord back to the banking system,” said Viral V. Acharya, a New York University finance professor and former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Blue Owl’s war chest is roughly doubled by leverage, meaning that for every dollar its clients have staked the firm directly, two dollars are lent out. Mr. Acharya compared the seeming steadiness of the booming industry now to “saying the market is great to lend in the U.S. in 2007 and 2008.” He added, “Because the cycle hasn’t turned yet, we simply do not know.” Mr. Lipschultz said he wasn’t worried about that. With a muted laugh, he pointed out that the government needed to rescue major banks in 2008 — and that his firm continued lending even at the nadir of the pandemic. “Where have the problems been since the financial crisis?” Mr. Lipschultz asked and quickly answered his own question: “The banks.” The post Wall St. Is Minting Easy Money From Risky Loans.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Car Repair Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) stands against the other car repair stocks. According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global automotive aftermarket industry was valued at $418.95 billion in 2023. The market is expected to reach $568.19 billion by 2032. The acceptance of electric and hybrid vehicles is expected to propel the growth in demand for related aftermarket products. Moreover, the rise in automotive e-commerce is also contributing to increased sales in the market. As a result, major players in the industry are developing their omnichannel platforms to facilitate online automotive aftermarket services. The KPMG Corporate Finance recently released its automotive aftermarket report for the fiscal third quarter of 2024. The report highlights that the decline in new car purchases can lead to growth for the aftermarket industry. Despite the recent cut in the Federal Reserve's interest rates, experts believe new car purchases may not see an immediate uptick. This is because auto loan interest rates typically adjust slowly, thereby remaining high even after the Fed's actions. Currently, average auto loan rates are still exceeding 9.61% for new vehicles and nearly 14% for used vehicles, which poses a significant barrier to new car purchases. As a result, many consumers are opting to defer vehicle purchases and are increasingly relying on the aftermarket for more affordable maintenance and repair solutions to extend the lifespan of their existing vehicles. Moreover, the gradual adoption of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and software-defined vehicles is reshaping the automotive aftermarket landscape. While these advancements may lead to less frequent maintenance needs, they also introduce new service requirements related to battery systems and advanced electronics. According to forecasts from Bank of America Global Research, BEVs are expected to comprise about 8% of total vehicle sales in 2024, increasing to approximately 29% by 2030. While analyzing the performance of the industry during the quarter, the report highlighted that the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) saw significant growth over the past year, up 34.4% and 26.6%, respectively. The Automotive Aftermarket Index grew at a slower pace of 14.3%. However, it is noteworthy that in Q3 2024, this index outperformed both major indices with a growth rate of 8.4%. Specific segments within the aftermarket showed varied performance. For instance, the Parts Suppliers grew by 13.1% while Retailers & Distributors grew by 8.9%. The Enthusiast Products segment rebounded with an 11.3% increase after earlier declines, whereas Service Providers experienced a slight decline of 3.2%. Regardless of the challenges stemming from high interest rates and inflation the automotive aftermarket has shown resilience and proved to be recession-proof. The shift towards maintaining older vehicles rather than purchasing new ones, combined with technological advancements in vehicle types is fueling growth in the industry. Moreover, trends suggest that while immediate growth in new car sales may be sluggish, there remains a robust demand for aftermarket services and products as consumers adapt to changing economic conditions. Our Methodology To curate the list of 8 best car repair stocks to invest in, we used the Finviz stock screener and other listings on the internet. Using our sources we aggregated a list of car repair stocks sorted by market capitalization. Next, we ranked these stocks by the number of hedge fund holders sourced from Insider Monkey’s third-quarter hedge funds database. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An AutoNation-branded dealership, showcasing the wide variety of new and used vehicles on offer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32 AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) is a major automotive retailer in the United States. The company operates through a network of franchises that sell both new and used vehicles. The company deals in Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury segments with franchises in each segment selling parts and offering repair services to customers. The company had a rough fiscal third quarter of 2024, characterized by a CDK outage, which is a major software used by various players in the industry. Its net revenue decreased 4% year-over-year to $6.6 billion, whereas the gross profit also dipped 9% during the same time. However, on the bright side AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) Customer Financial Services segment and After-Sales segment, led the gross profit 2% higher on a subsequent basis. Management noted that its After-Sales segment, which deals with parts and repairing services has been showing continuous momentum despite the CDK outage. While the overall revenue of the company dipped, the segment revenue improved by around 1% year-over-year. More importantly, the segment profit margins showed a 50 bps improvement during the same time led by improved parts and labor rates, leverage, and higher value orders. Looking ahead, management notified of improving technician headcount thereby further boosting productivity within the segment. It is one of the best car repair stocks to invest in now. Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) (down 3.7%) operates around 350 dealer franchises across the US, as well as collision centres and used vehicle stores. When compared to Group 1, it sells more units at a slightly higher price and margin, and derives around 50% more revenue. But its strategy is different, with nationwide branding and centralised operations. Although we prefer the Group 1 model, the economics of Autonation look attractive to us. And by introducing this into the portfolio we could thereby invest more than 5% of assets in this sector without necessitating the sale of other attractive large positions. And so after selling a little Group 1 and buying Autonation we ended the quarter with 4.1% and 1.9% positions respectively.” Overall AN ranks 6th on our list of the car repair stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of AN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A customer smiling delightedly after driving away in their new car from the automotive retail shop. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30 Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG) is an international automotive retailer based in the United States. The company primarily operates by selling vehicles and providing car parts and repairing services. Its Total Care Auto segment, powered by Landcar, is a significant component of its business model, specializing in service contracts and other vehicle protection products. The segment operates 37 collision repair centers in 14 states across the country. During the third quarter, Madison Mid Cap Fund announced adding Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG) to its portfolio. The firm stated that while the company owns a diversified portfolio of dealerships, its Parts and Services business tends to earn more profits. The anticipation by Madison stood true as during the fiscal third quarter results delivered $4.2 billion in revenue, up 16% year-over-year. While the revenue growth was driven by a 16% increase in new vehicle sales and a 13% increase in used vehicle sales, both components reported 11% and 6% decreases in gross profits. On the other hand, its Parts and Services segment not only grew revenue by 13% but also improved gross profits by 16%. The segment provided damage control to the overall gross profit which decreased only 142 bps year-over-year. It is one of the best car repair stocks to invest in. Madison Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: "During the quarter we added three new holdings: Graco, Lithia Motors, and Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG). We purchased shares in Lithia Motors and Asbury Automotive, two of the largest auto franchise dealer groups in the country, owning a diversified portfolio of dealerships ranging from Toyota to Ford to Mercedes. Investors tend to pay a lot of attention to the level of new car sales, but dealers actually earn more in profits from parts and service than they do from selling new cars, and this steady business provides a nice ballast throughout the economic cycle. In addition, we believe these businesses have a long runway to create value via consolidation of this fragmented industry, as the advantages of scale are increasing.” Overall ABG ranks 7th on our list of the car repair stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of ABG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ABG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Forecast 2025 — Taking Out the Trash
URL: https://www.kunstler.com/p/forecast-2025-taking-out-the-trash
Time Published: 2024-12-27T12:03:25Z

Note: due to the length of this special blog-post, email will probably truncate it. So, to view the entire post just go to: Kunstler.com on your browser. I would guess that you’re feeling as if anything might happen now. It’s hard to rule out even the possibility that we could all be vaporized before moving onto the next mundane chore of the day. The world order is dangerously in flux. America’s Woke-Jacobin “Joe Biden” regime was defeated in the 2024 election, but they were apparently just a front for the sinister entity we call the “blob” or the Deep State, which in recent years has consistently and garishly acted against our country’s interests. So, the blob abides, and it probably weaves schemes in the deep background of daily life even as a new government awaits. But if the Woke-Jacobin Biden-istas were tied-in with the so-called “globalist” enterprise centered around the EU bureaucracy, with assistance from the World Economic Forum’s network of zillionaires and bankers. . . well, that coalition looks rather broken now. It’s doing a hurt-dance. It’s on the run, a little bit. What is not broken for the moment — a tenuous moment — is the new Trump regime’s determination to correct the disorders of Western Civ, starting with the affairs of the USA, according to age-old reality-based norms of behavior and good-faith relations between the people and their government. Trust was broken and must be restored. The President-elect has assembled an extraordinary team of reformers, if they can get to their posts without subversion. And, of course, Mr. Trump himself has to evade further attempts to rub him out, to knock him off the game-board before he can take office, and then he must survive the months beyond his inauguration. So, you are correct to be nervous. Clusterfuck Nation is a reader-supported publication. Subscribe to this blog on Patreon or right here on Substack! This blog is sponsored this week by Vaulted, an online mobile web app for investing in allocated and deliverable physical gold. To learn more visit: Vaulted.com Paradoxically, Mr. Trump has to initially manage the US government as if it deserves a sense of reassuring continuity, which, in many respects it does not deserve. So many institutions and relationships between them have been perverted and damaged. How do we pretend that the upper layers of management in any federal agency — the strata who really run things below the top “political” appointees — can continue in-place as if all that perversion never happened? The Department of Justice and the FBI are filled with lawyers and agents who abused their power egregiously and went to war against the American people. The agency’s work will just have to stop for a while. The nation can probably endure if investigations and prosecutions are suspended for sixty days while the personnel issues get sorted out — who goes and who stays. But what about the Defense Department and the CIA? The country must be able to defend itself. These departments are the lairs of the more dangerously entrenched blob actors. Both DOD and the CIA have come to be organized as racketeering operations. Both are involved in domestic money-laundering activities at the giant scale, and in rackets abroad — such as the many grifts around Ukraine, in which giant financial entities like BlackRock are partnered-in. (You know, for instance, don’t you, that BlackRock was poised to acquire control of Ukraine’s natural resource base, until Mr. Putin’s resolve ended that fantasy.) And the CIA is suspected of being deeply involved in the Mexican crime cartel operations, both around drugs and human trafficking. The imputations are sickening. The DOD and the CIA will fight desperately to preserve their perqs and projects, and to stay out of jail. But until now they have not really been challenged. The public health agencies, FDA, NIAID, CDC, NIH, and so on have become outright mafias, with labyrinths of money-laundering channels, government grant-grifting, and pharma phuckery, not least around the still-mysterious, homicidal Covid-19 prank, with the deadly mRNA vaccine program piggybacked onto it. Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it). Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and Economy Does the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. Oil For now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained For The “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung. Mr. Webb’s concise 99-page book is available free as a pdf HERE. Of course, a global implosion of equity and bond markets would be the end of financial life as we’ve known it, and none of the abstract chatter about banking rules takes sufficient account of the grotesque social disorder that would attend such an event, so any Great Taking might end up being beside the point — the point being that everyone is broke, no one can transact, and things get awfully dire. But we get a bit ahead of ourselves going up that path. So, let’s return to things we know about. Mr. Trump’s proposed economic reforms have inescapable overtones of contraction. Paring down the federal government workforce may have many benefits, but it would likely cause a depression in the DC Metro area as jobs are massively eliminated, and the economic damage would radiate through the rest of the country as departments are trimmed and shut down, and the money flowing out of them stops. The effect of a tariff campaign could hurt American business in the short term. Import replacement is a laudatory goal, but it’s liable to be a rough road getting there. Supply lines will break. People and businesses will not get the things they need to do produce goods. It takes time and capital to set up new factories. The tendency will be to run production with robots as far as possible — so, where will the people earn a living? Robots will not become consumers. You must also wonder more generally whether it’s really possible to reenact the industrial orgy of the mid-20th century. Detroit will not be what it was in 1962. “Joe Biden” leaves behind an economy already auguring-in, concealed by monumental federal spending of money created out of thin air in the months leading up to the 2024 election to cover-up the failing private US economy. Also, all of the official reporting about jobs in 2024 was fake in order to juice the election for the party in power. US Government outlays for the year were $6.752 trillion against revenue of $4.919 trillion. Government can’t solve the problem of mass joblessness by giving everybody government jobs, and Mr. Trump is not philosophically aligned to that sort 20th century Big Government action. Anyway, too many jobs today are crap jobs toiling for merciless companies who mistreat their workers, so the very meaning of work has been degraded to a new kind of slavery. Plus, too many Americans do not work at all, but subsist on government hand-outs or on crime. How does this change? First, it doesn’t change without the nation going through a period of disorder, discontinuity, and distress. When it does change, the change will be systemic and emergent. It will not come from any top-down government or managerial process. It emerges from the circumstances that reality presents — specifically, the need for people to support themselves, to make themselves useful to their fellow humans, which relationships form into networks of business and work that become a social ecology, a community. So, the second Trump term could usher in a period of deep economic hardship as we try to figure out how to remake an American economy and rebuild those local ecologies of business. Can Mr. Trump assume a role anything like Franklin Roosevelt did in the 1930s? A paternal voice speaking directly to the people and offering them reassurance in a troubled time? They are obviously very different personalities. Also, the lingering political opposition to Mr. Trump is far more noxious on the Left than anything FDR faced from the Right in 1933. Today’s Left is still functionally insane, sunk in Marxian-Woke delusions, race-and-gender animus, and an intemperate libido for power, all of it boding ill for political stability. Americans are used to relying on faceless, distant authorities to take care them, to solve their problems: Social Security, Disability, Medicaid, insurance companies, courts. It all works very poorly now, and before long a lot of it may not work at all. We will have to take care of each other. There have never been so many single-person households as there are now. Loneliness and anomie are epic. When the Boomers are gone, that will likely be the end of nursing home care and assisted living at the cost of many thousands of dollars-a-month. The Boomers’ replacement generations are not nearly as wealthy. They missed the window for being able to buy McMansions that could be liquidated for millions to support end-of-life care. We’ll probably see the rise of households made of unrelated people. But the default setting for humans is the family and the extended family. Some human relations that were common in earlier eras of history, and absent in our time, could return. A little over a century ago, ten percent of the people employed in America were household servants, including what were then middle-class households. Today, only the very wealthy have servants. What hasn’t changed is that people need a place and a purpose, and a purposeful place in a household is not necessarily a bad deal in a civilized society. We just haven’t experienced it in many decades and many Americans would probably find the proposition ridiculous. Yet too many have no place in society and nothing to do, including activities that might be considered duties to one another. Many towns in the 19th century had institutions called the Poor Farm. Sounds terrible, perhaps, but it was a way of providing a place and real duties for people who had nowhere else to go and nothing to occupy them. It was generally organized as a local charity. Residents were expected to work to their ability, raise their own food in gardens, take care of livestock, do laundry and cleaning chores. Today, that might be considered “cruel,” but really, is it as bad as just letting many thousands camp-out on the streets, sunk in drug addiction? What it requires is the political will to organize useful, properly-scaled institutions around these needs. To get there, we must drop a lot of ideological pretenses. We face very serious problems with agriculture organized at the gigantic scale, utilizing multi-million-dollar machines (usually mortgaged), giant loans to put in crops, huge “inputs” of chemicals and fertilizers. That is probably coming to an end, too, despite the current techno-narcissistic fantasies of Agribiz. We’re probably going to need more human beings working directly on farms, smaller farms, with fewer giant machines, less borrowed money for putting in crops, and fewer chemical inputs. Which is to say, we’re probably going to see a larger percentage of the population at work growing our food than has been the case for a long time. I suppose it’s hard to grok our society becoming reorganized so differently, of reviving ways of living and working together that are consistent with human nature, proven over time, but considered out-of-date now. Obviously resurrecting relations like these requires major changes in our national psychology. Today, it is impossible to persuade a lot of citizens that they need to do something useful for a living. Or, to look at it differently, that there might be activities to fill their days that would interesting, satisfying, and rewarded with pay — rather than just loafing, getting high, and watching canned entertainment. Today, we lack countless occupational niches in society that used to allow people of very different abilities to find a place and a purpose, especially, now, people of low ability. If I am correct that the macro trend is to re-scale our economy and re-localize it, those places and purposes can return. It will probably also require a return of the eternal verities, too, as a means of managing social relations: truth, beauty, liberty, brotherly love, trust, fairness. . . conditions and behavior that we should at least agree to aspire to in a common culture worthy of our allegiance. I doubt that the incoming Trump administration sees things developing in the direction of downscaling, decomplexifying, and localizing. Rather, they seem to expect ever more grandiose enterprise, at least in what’s known as the private sector, even while they pare down government. But, really, everything in the everyday life of this nation will have to scale down and happen differently. We’re going to need fewer giant entities like Walmart and more local commercial networks of small businesses geared to local communities. As you may have inferred, I believe that circumstances will deliver us to that new disposition of things in any case, whether political leaders agree or not. If Mr. Trump is wise, he will recognize the trend and go with the flow. Other Parts of the World As I write, governments are falling all over the place. Olaf Scholz cannot form a governing coalition in Germany. In France, Emmanuel Macron’s ruling faction lost bigly in snap elections last summer with no clear majority for any coalition, and also in the EU parliamentary elections. Both countries are using lawfare to defeat their opponents. Mr Scholz’s and his allies are trying to outlaw the rising opposition Alternative for Deutschland (AFD) party, especially after the AFD showed growing strength in state elections in Saxony, Brandenburg, and Thuringia. The Paris prosecutor’s office is trying to nail Marine LePen on embezzling EU funds to pay staff salaries in her National Rally Party. Germany, the largest economy in the EU, has been busy committing suicide for the past decade. The country shut down its nuclear power reactor fleet entirely and went all-in for a “green” energy program (wind and solar) that has fallen far short of being able to supply its needs. It had just gotten ready to receive a reliable supply of cheap Russian natural gas in 2022 when somebody — probably the USA — blew up the Nord Stream One and Two pipelines. Joe Biden declared in so many words that he was going to “stop” the Nord Streams months earlier, so why not believe him? The Germans just rolled over for what would normally be construed as an act-of-war against it, by a NATO ally no less. Consequently, overnight Germany’s advanced industrial economy, its automakers, chemical companies, machine tool-makers, became uncompetitive in global markets and the German economy entered a slow death spiral. Europe is now supposed to be happy to get American liquified natgas, which is much more costly to transport and offload than Russian pipeline gas would have been. France was only marginally better off with its robust nuclear energy production to supply electricity, but it, too, lost access to cheap Russian natgas needed for industry and home heating. Meanwhile, the other nations of the EU have all to one extent or another joined the European suicide pact. The EU has been at war against its own farmers for years for reasons that appear completely insane — perhaps driven by Klaus Schwab and his World Economic Forum. The regulatory architecture of the European Commission is crushing business under its “green” energy and climate change mitigation agenda. Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) unexpectedly won the most seats in the last election, but not an outright majority, and could not form a working coalition. Wilders did not become prime minister —the job was assigned instead to one Dick Schoof, a career bureaucrat who most recently ran the Netherlands’ Intel service. Canada, entered political limbo in mid-December when Deputy Prime Minister and Finance chief (and WEF board member) Chrystia Freeland suddenly resigned and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau looked like he was fighting for his political life in parliament. Mr. Trudeau had only days before made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago for talks with Donald Trump, who mocked him most severely down there, calling Canada “our fifty-first state” and referring to Mr. Trudeau as “governor.” The Canadian dollar has been tanking since then and stands at 69 cents to the US dollar as I write. Mr. Trudeau will be gone early in the new year at the latest. He’ll be replaced by the Conservative party leader, Pierre Poilievre, who demonstrates an ability to think straight. The European Union regulatory overlayment has become an intolerable burden for the EU member nations. The EU seemed like a good idea at the time, and for many years basic operating principles like a common currency (the Euro) and the Schengen Agreement (free movement of member state citizens and goods across national borders) made daily life easier. But in recent years the EU bureaucracy adopted a set of insane polices: the programmatic destruction of farms and farmers; mass unregulated immigration from third world failed states; and antipathy to petroleum resources for the sake of debatable climate change. Aggravating all this is the unelected EU Commissioners’ lack of accountability to the public. Other technical issues, such as the EU’s lack of fiscal control over individual members and the problems that causes for bond issuance appear irresolvable. Once before, in 2012, financial turmoil has threatened the EU’s existence. But that crisis — the collapse of Greece and its ramifications — got “papered over” with bail-outs and accounting fraud. Now, Europe enters an era not just of critical financial imbalances, but of severe dislocations in the on-the-ground economy of real production. The flood of migrants continues and their aggressive antagonism to age-old European culture is on the rise with calls for Sharia law and a European caliphate. It’s getting to look like a tragi-farcical reenactment of the Mohammedan conquests of the Middle Ages. It’s draining EU members’ treasuries while they go broke from de-industrializing. And countless humiliations are heaped on the people: mass murders, beheadings, constant insults, street violence all over and, just last week, the Christmas market murders in Magdeburg. It’s at a breaking point. As Europe watches Mr. Trump successfully commence deportations, Europe will eventually follow — but not before a tumultuous period in early 2025 when rebellion sweeps away Leftist governments. The European Union could be swept away with them. Borders will harden, national currencies might return, and drastic realignment awaits. The United Kingdom looks like a lost cause due to the utter collapse of the conservative party, leaving Labor temporarily alone on the field, with the monumentally incompetent PM Keir Starmer in charge and an all-out Orwellian regime severely abusing the indigenous British people while it coddles hostile immigrants. That will not last a whole lot longer. Starmer will be chased out in the first half of 2025, just as Liz Truss (remember her?) got dumped in 2022. Waiting to enter at stage-right is Nigel Farage, a genuinely charismatic leader who is destined to become Britain’s Trump. After successfully leading the Brexit charge, he sojourned in the political wilderness like Churchill did between 1929-39. Now he leads the Reform UK Party, which is in the process of utterly eclipsing the broken Tories. Look for Farage to make his move quickly in 2025. Then there is the woeful situation in Ukraine. I’ve written about it often and will recapitulate it as succinctly as possible: The Ukraine War was an American neocon project to destabilize Russia and probably an attempt to gain control of its resource assets. Mr. Putin refused to get rolled and fought back. It has been a hugely costly disaster for Ukraine in blood, capital, and infrastructure. Not a cake-walk for Russia, either. But Mr. Putin will probably attain his objectives, which are: annexation of Donbas and Crimea and establishment of what’s left of Ukraine as a neutral, non-member of NATO. Mr. Trump is eager to end what he calls “this stupid war.” The catch is, how can he settle it expeditiously without appearing to capitulate? Mr. Putin will not budge from retaining Crimea and the Donbas provinces (“oblasts”). That is the condition for even entering talks. The humiliation associated with this project should be all Joe Biden’s, and in some respects certainly will be when his family’s entanglements and machinations are fully exposed, as they are certain to be. Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin will solve the puzzle by pretending to negotiate over the port of Odessa, which will eventually be awarded to the rump Ukraine so it can have access to the sea for its essential grain shipments. They’ll tussle for a while over that but it will be all for show. The war will end. Ukraine will finally hold elections and Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be cast out like a dog that has peed on the rug too many times. I doubt he will survive the year. Both America and Russia pony up money to rebuild Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, but not much more. The world will come to understand exactly what happened. NATO will be a shadow of what it was, if it does not collapse altogether due to the rising political upheavals all over Europe. The Middle East I am not on the bus with the mob shouting about Israel as a perpetrator of “genocide.” Our own General Sherman put it succinctly 160 years ago: War is hell. Hamas should not have started one on October 7, 2023. For that, the Palestinians got hell. Hamas fighters should not have (literally) dug itself in amongst the Palestinian civilians of Gaza, with its labyrinth of war tunnels that the Israelis had to destroy if there would be any end to the strife emanating out of them. The essential problem in that corner of the world is that the region cannot support the huge and still-growing populations of most of the Arab states in it. It is mostly desert. The fantastic wealth of the oil age combined with other circumstances, such as the increase in grain production, to grow these populations. Tragically now, all that has reached a limit and things are going in the other direction: toward collapse. This slow-motion collapse expresses itself in political friction, mass migration, violence, and religious zealotry. The Jihadis are serious about murdering non-Muslims. Considering the action in Europe lately, the truculence of Muslim migrants towards their hosts there, it’s obvious that Jews and Christians are on equal footing as targets. The population Israel of Israel is 9.4 -million. The total population of Palestinians worldwide is estimated to be around 14.8 million as of mid-2024. This includes Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, within Israel, and in the diaspora across various countries. The population of countries adjacent to — Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria — is 145-million. Much of that Arab population subscribes to annihilating the state of Israel, and declares as much publicly all the time. Is Israel not supposed to take those threats seriously? Considering these odds, are you shocked and offended that the United States is an ally of Israel? Do you think that the United States has no strategic interest in any counter-balance to opposing interests in the Middle East? Grow up. The American Woke-Marxists want you to think that this relationship is illicit, unjust. They want you to hate the Jews and hate Israel. You’d better ask yourself: who do these Woke-Marxists serve? Not our interests, not American interests. Israel has managed to make its tiny desert country blossom over the past seventy-five years while also building a manufacturing and tech economy. Due to the constant threats against it, much of the wealth generated by that economy must be directed into the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). It is quite an accomplishment for this tiny state to stand-up against so many enemies. They have won two major wars against them in modern times as well as many periodic border clashes, intifadas, and skirmishes. Their enemies are deeply resentful and probably jealous of Israel’s economic success. The Oct 7, 2023, rape, torture, and murder attack by Hamas prompted Israel to mount an existential defense against an obdurately and garishly murderous enemy. Israel won the Gaza Strip territory from Egypt in the 1967 War. In 2005 it turned over governance of Gaza to the Palestinians. Among other things, the Palestinians could have turned Gaza’s twenty-five-mile-long beach-front into a premier Mediterranean resort. Instead, the Hamas government used the international aid funds they received to build miles and miles of war tunnels. Bad choice. They used Gaza as a launching pad for missile attacks and intifadas. More bad choices. 10/7/23 was a crossed red line. Now there is no more Gaza. The civilians will have to find somewhere else to go, and if their Arab neighbors won’t take them, then blame their Arab neighbors. They have been cast out for atrocious behavior. The Jihadis’ publicists want you to think that Israel has behaved badly. No doubt, the action by the IDF in Gaza was brutal. War is hell. In war, everywhere and always, soldiers act savagely. Americans did, at times, in Vietnam and Iraq. It is the reality of war. One lesson is that wars should not be started casually. Israel’s motive in this war is to put the war parties of its enemies out-of-business. It is close to succeeding now, with Hamas scattered, Hezbollah cut off from its sponsor, Iran, and Assad gone in Syria. Israel accomplished this with the “Joe Biden” regime pretending to support both sides in the conflict and finally having less influence than ever over the outcome. This is where things stand in December, 2025, but it is a very lively game-board, and there is much potential for new action and the entry of other players, which we’ll turn to now. Suddenly Syria Well, that was fast! Took twelve days (Nov 27 to Dec 8). Phhhhht!!! Assad, gone (to Russia). How’d that happen? Begin with the population problem I cited above: the region is poor. Expanding population against a contracting resource base will create great political and social stresses. Syria’s population grew dramatically from 7-million in 1972 to 22-million in 2022. Syria is a large country with distinct territories. Its easternmost region bordering Iraq and Turkey, Jazira, with the city of Raqqah, straddles the Euphrates River, a grain-growing corridor that used to feed the Syrian people. Many years of drought and botched irrigation projects have wrecked farming there. That was one factor in the mass migrations to Europe the past decade. Altogether, 6-million Syrians have fled the country since the Arab Spring in 2011. Jazira is also the location of Syria’s oil, which was grabbed by the US in 2019 when the country was racked by civil war. The region is a cultural crossroads, with a significant Kurdish population, bleeding over to Greater Kurdistan into Iraq and Turkey. Long story short: Assad’s Syria was badly weakened by food shortages, revenue shortage, and long-running civil war. He could barely pay his Army, and when the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebel forces pushed across the country this fall, his soldiers melted away. HTS has its origins in al Qaeda, and al Qaeda has its origins in the US intel blob and its neocon strategists. You can be sure that the US was involved in rooting out Assad. As we have seen before, these kinds of operations tend to be double-edged swords, which end up stabbing America in the back later on. In this case, imagine that by chasing Assad out we may have succeeded in turning Syria into Jihad Central of the Middle East. As soon as HTS was in control of Damascus, the capital, Israel sent its air force in and destroyed every military target, airfield, tank park, munitions depot in Syria so that it would not fall into the hands of Hezbollah, Israel’s Iran-backed enemy. Israel controls a small area of southern Syria near the Golan Heights. Israel had already done severe damage to Hezbollah earlier this year by methodically killing off its leadership, one-by-one. The exploding pager op also did enormous operational damage to Hezbollah. For now, Israel benefits from broken Syria. Iran has lost its geographical conduit for arms supply to Hezbollah. The HTS forces are Sunni and Hezbollah’s sponsor, Iran, is Shia, with all the built-in conflict that implies. All of a sudden, Iran has lost its influence in this region adjacent to Israel, the enemy it declares it wants to “wipe off the map.” The Turks were involved in the Syrian regime change, too. Turkey currently hosts millions of Syrian refugees from the chaos of the Syrian civil war. The Kurds in Syria are also a problem, linked to the PKK, a terrorist terror group inside Turkey. Turkey’s pugnacious president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, pivots between its alliance with NATO, its off-and-on strategic relations with Russia, and the Arab world with its cultural affinities. Turkey is a disgruntled NATO. For decades, it was openly and often derided by other nations in the west as “the sick man of Europe.” Yet, it controls the entrance to the Black Sea, which has always been a problem for Russia — they have gone to war several times — though Russia engages in development projects in Turkey these days. Don’t forget, Turkey’s Ottoman Empire controlled all of the Middle East and North Africa from the 16th into the early 20th century and its influence ranged into Europe as well. This was the time long before oil wealth juiced the Arab world. Populations were sparse then across what was then called The Holy Land. The indigenous Arabs still wandered the desert on camels and lived in tents. The Ottoman Empire collapsed in the First World War, and what you see on-the-ground over much of the region are artificial boundaries created by the British after the war for administrative efficiency. Mr. Erdoğan may harbor ambitions for Turkey to once again play a larger role in world affairs. It has the region’s largest standing army. For now, Turkey and Erdoğan enjoy somewhat enhanced regional influence. The counter to him has been the US’s penchant for creating failed states via CIA involvement with rebel and Jihad movements. Mr. Trump has dropped the hint that he’s inclined to keep the US involvement in Syria to a minimum. He begins his administration with a declared aversion to all the world’s current wars. I’d forecast the HTS government not being able to control much of the country and a continued arc toward failed nationhood, with friction and violence between many of the different groups still residing there. I doubt Israel wants to try to control it, since it is an obvious quagmire. Russia appears to be bowing out of direct involvement, too, but is rumored to be negotiating with HTS to maintain its presence at the Khmeimim Air Base and the Tartus Naval Base. The macro trend in many parts of the Middle East is a return to pre-modernity. The last hundred years of jet planes and Range Rovers will look like a strange, anomalous blip in history. China Whatever is going on in China, her leaders like to play the long game, looking ahead decades, fifty and a hundred years, while everyone else struggles to strategize from month to month. It doesn’t mean that China comes out a winner, though. Some of that long game is just hubris and pretense. China has plenty of problems. It developed into an industrial colossus overnight, and now the global techno-industrial economy it found such a big role in is wobbling, especially in Europe, which puts a huge strain on China’s export-oriented system. Its financial architecture has always been janky because CCP is so entangled with the banks, bourses, and giant business enterprises — and if it doesn’t like how things are going, the Party just pretends that everything’s great. Nothing can be allowed to challenge the CCP’s dominance. Eventually things break, though, and the Party has to create some new narrative to explain the breakage. Lately there are rumors of mass layoffs, and of many young people leaving the cities to return to the countryside. The population is skewed to the elderly, due to the many years of China’s one-child policy. There is, of course, the disastrous real estate bubble which continues to destroy the savings of households, since many Chinese did not trust banks or stock and bond markets, and instead invested in enormous apartment complex property development projects have been failing one after another. The CCP’s response has been to screw down CCP control over the people and their activities ever-harder. The party fears its own people and no regime has a guarantee to go on forever. Expect turmoil there in 2025 as economic depression creeps across the global economy. America’s problems with China over trade and manufacturing are likely to be eclipsed in 2025 by the gross intrusions and subversions that China has been allowed to make in US institutions and our economy with the assistance of the “Joe Biden” administration. The Chinese have infiltrated America’s research universities, telecommunications (especially the hardware for cell phones and 5-G microwave transmission), US Intel, and the corporate sector, stealing intellectual property and our manufacturing secrets. And, of course, China has deeply involved itself in elected officialdom — the Biden family’s grifting operations and Rep Eric Swalwel’s romance with the spy Fang-Fang, among the most notorious. Senator Diane Feinstein employed a Chinese spy as her limo driver and go-fer for twenty years, including the years 2009 to 2015 when she chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee. You can be sure that Congress is well-larded with Chinese money and the influence it buys. Expect to find out a lot more in 2025. It is one of the things that binds elected officials so tightly to the DC blob. Two other matters involving China require urgent attention and the waiting Trump admin is already talking about them. One is China’s large, recent purchases of US land, both prime farmland and real estate around US military bases. It looks like they are going to be ejected from these holdings, with or without compensation is not known yet. We might see inquiries as to how these purchases were allowed to happen. The second issue is the number of Chinese nationals, especially men of military age, who came across the border along with the millions of other illegal aliens that “Joe Biden” allowed into the country with zero vetting. In fiscal year 2023 — Oct 1, 2022 to Sept. 30, 2023 — that number was about 24,100. In fiscal year 2024 it was 24,400. You should assume that US intel knows something about some of them, but not most of them, and what they are up to here. Several Chinese “police stations” — that is, offices set up in US cities to control Chinese migrants in the US — have been discovered and busted the last several years. And then there was the case of the Chinese high-altitude “weather balloon” (actually suspected of being a military surveillance balloon) that the “Joe Biden” admin allowed to sail completely across the USA from the Pacific to the Atlantic before shooting it down offshore of the Carolinas. These Chinese activities around the USA in aggregate suggest a kind of stealth warfare aimed at eventually getting control of the North American continent and its resources. This would be consistent with fifty-to-a-hundred-year long-range strategic thinking. And it was apparently working pretty nicely until the elections of 2024. It should be pretty alarming, but somehow the alarm bells have not gone off until a couple of months ago. Questions, anyone? I’d forecast that the US and China will not go to war with China over Taiwan in 2025. It is too much of a losing proposition for all concerned. Both China and the USA will be preoccupied with domestic problems and trade negotiations in the year ahead. A Few Other Odds and Ends Keep your eye on Argentina and its president, Javier Milei. Argentina was the world’s seventh-wealthiest nation in the early 1900s, and from 1930s on, after many coups, the country slid into chronic decline, badly aggravated by the long-running dictatorships of Juan and Eva Peron, and followed buy decades more revolving military coups, Peronista governments, and neoliberal finance mischief that left the resource-rich nation broke. Enter Javier Milei (Mee-lay) in 2023 as Argentina’s “anarcho-capitalist” president, who ran the promise to “take a chain saw” to the parasitical bureaucracy. In year one of his admin (essentially 2024), Milei got rid of 35,000 government employees and balanced the budget for the first time in decades. Inflation is finally falling. The Argentine people have awakened from the successive Peronista / neoliberal zombie comas they have been in for decades. Prediction: in 2025 Argentina sets the pace for the revolution in Western Civ government. Melei has another successful year in downsizing oppressive, useless bureaucracy. He begins a pioneering national nuclear power program. Argentina begins to emerge as a major player on the world stage. El Salvador is ruled, shall we say, by the eccentric and very interesting President Nayib Bukele-Ortiz (known simply as Bukele), now in his second term. His campaign against gang violence that made El Salvador such a savage place has produced spectacular results. His new “Terrorism Confinement Center” is one of the largest and most modern prisons in the world. It was built to house 20,000 inmates. He has arrested an estimated 86,000 hardened gang-aligned criminals. El Salvador has the highest incarceration rate in the world — which is what happens after allowing criminal gangs to hold the country hostage for decades. From 2022 to 2023, the murder rate fell by approximately 69-percent. (Data for 2024 is not complete.) Mr. Bukele enjoys a 91-percent favorable rating among voters. In 2021, El Salvador made Bitcoin a legal tender alongside the US dollar. Mr. Bukele’s “Bitcoin Law” requires businesses to accept Bitcoin in transactions. (As I said above, Bitcoin as “money” is deeply problematic.) The government itself has been purchasing Bitcoin as a long-term investment strategy. The verdict is out as to how Mr. Bukele’s fate might be chained to Bitcoin. For now, he has managed an epic turnaround in a country that had been lost to anarchy and crime for virtually all its previous existence. Forecast: El Salvador will continue to thrive due to Mr. Bukele’s Napoleonic organizational skills, even if Bitcoin falters. That is all I have for you in this end of year forecast for the year to come. I will be amazed to hear if any of you read this document to its bitter end. For each of you personally: do your best to lead purposeful, ethical lives in 2025. Refrain from trying to push other people around. Take care of your own bidness. . . and keep abreast of the goings-on in the year ahead at good old Clusterfuck Nation! And, above all, stay calm and cheerful! You can visit the archive of past yearly forecasts click here, to see what panned-out and what didn’t. Making predictions, of course, is a mugg’s game. Visit the page with JHK’s books here: (click image): Damn, you weren’t kidding that this is a long post! It’s a bit depressing, while at the same time energizing as there are potential solutions for many problems. First order of business is to have Elon and Vivek borrow Milei’s chainsaw and do to the bureaucracy what Elon did to Twitter (fire 80% of the employees). These two will give new meaning to the song “Who let the DOGEs out”! Sorting out the political miscreants will take time and be fraught with many dangers, but Trump has surrounded himself with people dedicated to the elimination of those miscreants. He has assured their focus by bringing in those who have been previously violated by the blob. Trump’s success is far from assured, but he is the only chance we have. We will know he’s been successful when housing prices in the DC area collapse as the bureaucrats and the private sector companies sucking the teat of government are terminated.

Title: Is BP p.l.c. (BP) the Best Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Stock to Buy for 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Stocks to Buy for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) stands against the other hydrogen and fuel cell stocks. Hydrogen produced from renewable electricity could transform heavy industry and transportation, offering a clean, sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. Seen as a key to decarbonizing heavy industry, hydrogen provides a greener way to generate heat and power vehicles. While global investments in renewable energy have surged, electricity alone can’t meet the fuel needs of many industrial operations. Hydrogen steps in as a versatile option, functioning much like traditional oil and gas, allowing vehicles to run on clean fuel instead of petrol or diesel. The global hydrogen market, worth $148 billion in 2023, is expected to grow to $259 billion by 2033 at a steady CAGR of 5.75%. Moreover, BloombergNEF predicts hydrogen supply will expand thirtyfold, reaching 16.4 million metric tons annually by 2030. Hydrogen holds immense potential, but its adoption still faces significant challenges. A 2024 report by IDTechEx estimated that only 4% of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) will run on hydrogen in the next two decades. However, it projected that around 20% of ZEV trucks could be hydrogen-powered by 2044. The report emphasized that expanding blue, gray, and green hydrogen markets—combined with supportive government policies—could accelerate innovation in fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). In the global hydrogen race, the United States is positioned to be a leading player, thanks to its mature projects and favorable tax policies that incentivize hydrogen development. However, the sector’s future faces uncertainty with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Reduced federal support for green hydrogen initiatives could make it difficult for the industry to compete with cheaper fossil-fuel alternatives like natural gas, putting billions of dollars in planned projects at risk. “Lots of people in industry continue to see the long-term value of producing hydrogen to the U.S. economy and for export around the world,” said Frank Wolak, president and CEO of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association. “But there’s definitely a trepidation about what this industry looks like going into 2025.” Overall, hydrogen remains in its early stages. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Global Hydrogen Review 2024 highlighted sluggish policy implementation in critical sectors like heavy industry, refineries, and long-haul transport. In 2023, global hydrogen demand reached just over 97 million tons, with a modest rise to 100 million tons expected in 2024—largely driven by economic trends rather than effective policy measures. As the IEA stated, "Hydrogen demand remains concentrated in refining and industrial applications, where it has been used for decades. Its adoption in new applications crucial for the clean energy transition—such as heavy industry, long-distance transport, and energy storage—accounts for less than 1% of global demand, despite a 40% growth compared to 2022." China dominated nearly 60% of the global 25-gigawatt electrolyzer manufacturing capacity in 2023, according to a report from the IEA. The Paris-based organization projects that China will remain a leader, producing over half of the world's electrolyzers by 2035. By 2050, the IEA estimates global installed electrolyzer capacity could reach 320 GW, assuming countries meet their Paris Agreement commitments. The report highlights that EU initiatives promoting low-carbon aviation fuel are a key driver of electrolyzer demand. It predicts that transportation will account for two-thirds of global demand by 2050, with the remainder distributed across industrial, refining, and power sectors. By midcentury, China is expected to utilize 25% of installed electrolyzers, followed by the U.S. at 14%. Our Methodology To compile our list of the Best Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Stocks to Buy, we started with companies that have a significant presence in the hydrogen and fuel cell industry. We sifted through ETFs and lists on the internet. We then refined the selection by focusing on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, based on data from Insider Monkey’s database, which tracks the activity of 900 hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A large turbine generating power from natural gas, smoke rising in the background. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36 BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), headquartered in London, U.K., is a global energy leader established in 1908. The company operates across diverse energy sectors, including natural gas production, wind power, hydrogen, carbon capture, and oil production. BP is also active in EV charging infrastructure, retail fuel distribution, and lubricant manufacturing. BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) recently announced its final investment decision for the "Lingen Green Hydrogen" project, supported by funding from the Important Projects of Common European Interest program. The 100 MW plant is expected to produce up to 11,000 tons of green hydrogen annually. This initiative aligns with the company's broader plans to expand hydrogen and carbon capture investments, with five to ten similar projects planned globally by the end of the decade. Construction is set to commence in 2025, with commissioning anticipated by 2027. In Q3 2024, BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) reported robust operational performance, with upstream production increasing 3% year-to-date and liquid production rising by 5%. Upstream plant reliability exceeded 95%, while refining availability surpassed 96%. The company also added 23 kbd of biogas supply, with more facilities slated for launch in Q4. These efforts contributed to an underlying profit of $2.3 billion for the quarter. Overall BP ranks 8th on our list of the best hydrogen and fuel cell stocks to buy for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of BP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence venture, xAI, is taking its chatbot Grok beyond X’s platform with the beta testing of a dedicated iOS application, as per a TechCrunch report. The app is currently live in Australia and is undergoing Beta testing in a few other countries. The app store preview of the iOS application lists features such as image generation, providing users real-time information in response to their queries using data from X and the web, the ability to maintain a conversational tone, and ensuring privacy when it comes to handling user data, etc. Notably, the move marks a further expansion of the audience for the AI assistant, which was previously accessible only to X (formerly Twitter) users. This changed in November 2024, when xAI started testing a free version of the chatbot, and made it available for all users earlier in December. This also coincides with the company recently securing its $6 billion Series C funding, which increased its total valuation to around $45 billion. This included participation from investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Blackrock, Fidelity, Lightspeed, MGX, Morgan Stanley and others. The list of investors also included “strategic investors” Nvidia and AMD, who the company said continue to support its rapid upscaling of infrastructure. As part of its announcement, xAI observed that Grok 3, its most powerful model yet, was in training and that its future consumer and enterprise offerings would leverage the power of its AI models. Earlier this month, X released its image generation tool Aurora for a short period of time before pulling it from their platform. Available momentarily through the Grok tab on the X mobile app as well as the website and touted by users for the photorealistic nature of images it generated, “Grok 2+Aurora (Beta)” was later confirmed by Elon Musk on the site to be under works.

Title: Investors’ $20 Billion Bet On The ‘NeoClouds’ Driving The AI Arms Race
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2024/12/27/investors-20-billion-bet-on-the-neoclouds-driving-the-ai-arms-race/
Time Published: 2024-12-27T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
By Iain Martin, Forbes Staff W hen Vultr founder David Aninowsky started building his own data centers back in 2014, customers only cared about cloud compute and the processors that supported it. Graphic processing units (GPUs) were the stuff of gamer forums, not corporate boardrooms. Now those chips are essential to the development of artificial intelligence models, and renting them has catapulted Vultr to a $3.5 billion valuation. The Florida-based startup raised $333 million from chip giant AMD and hedge fund LuminArx Capital earlier this month. Vultr has built more than 30 data centers around the world over the last decade offering the advanced level of hosting typically sold by AWS, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure, and renting time on GPUs has become its biggest growth driver. “AI is the fastest growing part of the infrastructure market,” JJ Kardwell, Vultr’s CEO told Forbes. It’s not just Vultr. Investors have plowed some $20 billion over the last year into 25 companies that rent access to GPUs, according to a Forbes analysis of corporate filings and Pitchbook data. That includes $8 billion in equity and over $12 billion in debt in the form of loans from Wall Street giants like BlackRock, Carlyle and Pimco. It’s a fast emerging sector, but no one is quite sure what to call it yet: “Cloud GPUs”? “GPU factories"? Dylan Patel, analyst with SemiAnalysis, has settled on something else. “New giants will emerge from the neoclouds,” he told Forbes. The biggest winner so far has been Coreweave. The New Jersey-based startup had built an armada of GPUs to mine cryptocurrency but after the market crashed in 2018 pivoted to renting them to startups working on AI projects. In the last year alone, it raised $1.75 billion of equity, and $8.1 billion of debt, attaining a $23 billion valuation. The clutch of startups playing catch up to Coreweave are a strange crew. They include crypto refugees like Crusoe Energy, which started out mining bitcoin on gas flared from oil rigs, and German-listed miner Northern Data that got a $1.1 billion lifeline from stablecoin giant Tether to reinvent itself as an AI compute powerhouse. The field also includes older data center outfits like Vultr and France’s OVH that pivoted from cloud compute to AI compute. Then there’s players like Nebius, which emerged from the wreckage of Yandex, the ‘Google of Russia’, with a Finnish data center, $2 billion in cash and a suspended Nasdaq listing. Its shares resumed trading in October, and it raised $700 million in a private placement from Nvidia and venture fund Accel earlier this month, to power its new business — renting GPUs. A long tail of smaller players include Runpod, which cobbles together smaller clusters of Nvidia chips, and Fluidstack, which finds buyers for data centers with idle chips. Investors might be willing to look past some of the strange backstories of this new clutch of unicorns because of the profits generated by renting GPUs, largely by the hour. “At one point the pay back on buying a GPU was six months. Now it’s a couple years,” Patel said. “There’s a misconception that because Amazon is the Walmart of ecommerce they must be for cloud computing. They’re really the Niemann Marcus” The boom for the neoclouds has not just been driven by the scarcity of AI chips but by massively undercutting giants like AWS and Oracle on price. Coreweave sells access to AI chip workhorses like the Nvidia A100 for $2.21 an hour. AWS charges $5.12 when GPUs are hired by the hour, according to a price analysis from neocloud rival Paperspace. Though the Amazon-owned cloud giant has steep discounts for long-term bookings. “There’s a misconception that because Amazon is the Walmart of ecommerce they must be for cloud computing,” said Vultr’s Kardwell. “They’re really the Niemann Marcus.” Neoclouds are able to keep prices lower because they sell “bare metal” GPUs without the bundled software and services typically peddled by giants like AWS. While corporates might appreciate the concierge experience, AI startups are often just looking for the lowest price. “AI factories are not investing in the software that AWS, Google and Microsoft do to make those clouds usable for any kind of compute you need,” said chip analyst Karl Freund. These stripped-back, smaller challengers also have an edge when it comes to getting their hands on AI’s key commodity: the GPUs themselves. Nvidia has backed Coreweave and Applied Digital while chip rival AMD has backed Vultr. That squeeze on chips has helped make tech giants like Microsoft and Oracle some of the neoclouds’ best customers. Microsoft warned that “capacity constraints” in its data centers spelled slower growth for its AI business in its last earning calls. And so it turned to Coreweave. Ironically, the selling points of neoclouds for the so-called hyperscalers, who build airport-sized data centers, might be their ability to scale. Coreweave has doubled its data centers to 28 from 14 over the last year; it has a $10 billion deal with Microsoft over the next five years. Crusoe Energy’s CEO Chase Lochmiller said it brought online a renewable-powered data center in less than a year when it would take a hyperscaler at least three years. And Oracle reportedly signed a $3.4 billion deal to lease a Crusoe AI data center in Abilene, Texas. Still, there are challenges ahead. Fundraising is one. Building and running data centers is another, particularly for small teams whose bitcoin mining acumen might not translate to managing finicky GPUs and sensitive customer data. “It’s like building an industrial warehouse versus a five star hotel; they are very different things,” warns Lochmiller. “Let’s be clear, I think a good chunk of these neo clouds are going to go bankrupt.” There are also hints that demand for AI chips is softening. Some startups have slashed prices by up to a third since September, while others have taken to posting “GPUs to rent” ads on AI investors Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’ Craiglist-style listings page. With a new crop of energy-intensive but powerful Nvidia chips headed to market, the bigger, more established neoclouds may well end up with a winning hand. That’s less certain for the smaller players. For them, the combination of debt-fuelled expansion and a potential chip glut exacerbated by the expiration of multi-year contracts at a time when more efficient chips are becoming commonplace could be a problem. Said Patel, “Let’s be clear, I think a good chunk of these neoclouds are going to go bankrupt.”

Title: Is Premier Investments Limited (PMV.AX) the Best ASX Dividend Stock Heading Into 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 ASX Dividend Stocks Heading into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Premier Investments Limited (PMV.AX) stands against the other ASX dividend stocks. Analysts often advise investors to diversify their stock portfolios globally to optimize returns. With this in mind, strong markets should be a key focus. Australia's stock market is expected to perform well in 2025, driven by positive sentiment from potential central bank easing and China's commitment to supporting its mining sector. Year-to-date, the Australian benchmark index has climbed nearly 8%, with a 12-month gain of around 9%. This was buoyed by the strong rally in the US equity markets, drawing increased attention from investors. The growth has also been led by technology and financial stocks, with the banking sector on track for its best performance since 2009. However, mining and energy stocks have faced challenges due to weaker commodity prices. According to a report by BlackRock, broad Australian equities have been the second most favored investment within iShares' local offerings this year, trailing only broad US equities. As of November 2024, they have attracted nearly $840 million in net inflows. Also read: 13 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy Under $50 Banking stocks in the country made a remarkable impression in 2024, with a sectoral index surging over 30%, as of December 18—its strongest performance in 15 years—thanks to prolonged elevated interest rates. However, as the Reserve Bank of Australia gears up for potential rate cuts, banks may encounter earnings pressure due to tighter net interest margins, a crucial measure of profitability, and heightened competition. In addition, Australian lenders rank among the priciest globally, with the sector's price-to-earnings ratio outpacing that of their international counterparts, as per Bloomberg data. Analysts suggest that Australian resource stocks could gain from Beijing's promise to boost government spending. However, local mining shares are heading for their weakest performance since 2015, weighed down by the ongoing slump in China's property market, which continues to impact commodity prices. Morgan Stanley analysts including Rahul Anand said the following in a Dec. 15 note: “As the market awaits visibility on tariff risk versus China stimulus benefits, we see opportunities for exposure to resources. Despite higher-than-normal iron ore inventories, steel inventories in China remain lower than 2019 levels creating iron ore restock opportunity.” The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) projects that economic growth in Australia will rise modestly to about 1% by the close of 2024 and reach its typical pace of around 2.5% by late 2025. This recovery is expected to be largely driven by government spending, which has provided stability to the economy as higher interest rates have dampened private consumption. Analysts suggest that index investing offers an effective and efficient way to tap into the Australian market’s growth potential. S&P Global data revealed that nearly 70% of actively managed Australian equity funds have lagged behind the benchmark index over a three-year period. Over a 10-year timeframe, the disparity is even greater, with over 80% of managed funds underperforming the index. While active stock picking can complement a portfolio, they argue that tracking the benchmark might be one of the best strategies for investors seeking straightforward, long-term exposure to the growth of the local equity market. Our Methodology: For this list, we used a screener to identify ASX stocks. From there, we selected dividend stocks with strong histories of regularly rewarding shareholders with dividends. Then, we picked the top 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 25. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A financial planner carefully scrutinizing company's investment portfolio. Dividend Yield as of December 25: 4.09% Premier Investments Limited (PMV.AX) ranks seventh on our list of the best ASX dividend stocks. The company is mainly engaged in retail and investment activities. The company owns the Peter Alexander and Smiggle brands, which analysts believe have significant potential for long-term growth. They are also optimistic about the proposed sale of the company's non-core brands. Bell Potter, a prominent Australian stockbroking firm, noted that Premier Investments Limited (PMV.AX) holds around 6% market share in the Australian apparel sector and about 15% in the stationery market. In addition, Smiggle is a major player in the UK market. With plans to expand Smiggle's presence in the Middle East and Indonesia through a low-risk wholesale model, along with Peter Alexander's expansion into the UK, both brands are seen as having considerable growth opportunities ahead. The stock has surged by nearly 19% in the past 12 months. In its earnings report, Premier Investments Limited (PMV.AX) highlighted that FY24 proved to be another challenging year for discretionary retail. Despite the difficult market conditions, the company achieved global sales of $1.6 billion, reflecting a 25.5% increase compared to pre-COVID FY19 levels. The company also posted a strong EBIT result of $325.9 million, driven by effective management of gross margins and operational costs. In August 2023, the Premier Board initiated a strategic review of Premier Retail, recognizing significant growth opportunities for Peter Alexander, Smiggle, and the Apparel Brands. In June 2024, the Board concluded that the proposed merger of the Apparel Brands business with Myer warranted further evaluation, and extensive work has been carried out to analyze this proposal. Premier Investments Limited (PMV.AX) declared a record final fully franked ordinary dividend of $0.70 per share, marking a 16.7% increase or an additional 10 cents per share compared to the FY23 ordinary dividend. This brings the total fully franked ordinary dividend for FY24 to $0.133 per share. As of December 25, the stock supports a dividend yield of 4.09%. Overall PMV.AX ranks 7th on our list of the best ASX dividend stocks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of PMV.AX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PMV.AX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently published a list of 12 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to look at where 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) stands against other best technology penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The Russell 2000, a benchmark index for small-cap stocks, has historically lagged behind the large-cap S&P 500. Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has delivered returns of 200.8%, nearly double the 103.2% return of the Russell 2000. Even in 2024, the S&P 500 outpaced small caps, returning 27.1% compared to the Russell 2000’s 16.1%. However, a shift may already be underway. Since the U.S. presidential election on November 5, the Russell 2000 has nearly matched the S&P 500’s returns, signaling a possible resurgence in small-cap performance. Analysts at CFRA forecast that the S&P SmallCap 600 Index will generate EPS growth of 20.9% in 2025 and 18.6% in 2026, a sharp contrast to the negative 8% EPS growth seen in 2024. The economic and political landscape also seems to favor small caps. Historically, small-cap stocks have performed best when the economy emerges from a slowdown, credit spreads tighten, and investor risk appetite improves. Donald Trump’s return to the presidency has further buoyed optimism. Trump’s policies emphasize domestic economic growth, which directly benefits small-cap companies, as nearly 80% of Russell 2000 revenue comes from domestic operations. Additionally, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index recently jumped above its 50-year average for the first time in three years following Trump’s election victory. This surge in optimism indicates renewed confidence among small business owners, a critical driver for small-cap growth. In an interview with CNBC on November 4, Charlotte Daughtrey, Equity Investment Specialist at Federated Hermes, discussed the current investment landscape, particularly focusing on the small and mid-cap market. She highlighted that these segments are currently trading at or below their long-term averages, offering a 25% discount compared to large caps. Typically, small and mid-cap stocks should command a 10% premium due to their higher growth potential, but the ongoing risk environment, exacerbated by the pandemic and the prolonged period of higher interest rates, has led to their devaluation and for active investors this presents a significant opportunity. Daughtrey noted that the small and mid-cap space is particularly attractive due to its potential for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. She explained that well-performing, niche-focused companies in this segment are often attractive targets for larger corporations seeking to acquire growth rather than investing heavily in research and development. This dynamic is particularly evident in the U.S., known for its innovative companies, and is a key reason why Federated Hermes is overweight in information technology. This sector not only offers growth but also benefits from the AI tailwind without being as crowded as some larger-cap technology stocks. Daughtrey emphasized that small and mid-cap stocks are likely to perform well compared to large-cap companies if there is a strong economy in the United States because small and mid-cap companies are more domestically focused, with 70-80% of their revenues generated domestically compared to 50-50 for large caps. The current economic and political landscape presents a compelling case for investing in small and mid-cap technology stocks.

Title: SEN BERNIE SANDERS: Two Americas, the people vs. the billionaires
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sen-bernie-sanders-two-americas-people-vs-billionaires
Time Published: 2024-12-27T10:00:36Z
Full Content:
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., responded to the backlash against Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., over her comments on the killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO. It’s hard to miss. Our country is rapidly evolving into two Americas. One America consists of less than a thousand billionaires who have an unprecedented amount of wealth and power and have never ever had it so good. President-elect Trump and Elon Musk (Getty Images) The other America, where the vast majority live, consists of tens of millions of families who are struggling to put food on the table, pay their bills and worry that their kids will have a lower standard of living than they do. BIDEN CALLS OUT 'BILLIONAIRES' BUYING NEWSPAPERS, LAMENTS CHANGING MEDIA LANDSCAPE In the first America, the uber-wealthy buy $500 million yachts with helicopter pads, $270 million mansions with 30 bedrooms, private islands, a fleet of jets to take them all over the world and rocket ships that blast off to the edge of outer-space. They receive the best health care money can buy, send their kids to the best schools and can expect to live very long lives. In this America, the three wealthiest men (Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg) own more wealth than the bottom half of our society – over 165 million people. And their wealth is skyrocketing. Musk, alone, is now worth over $450 billion and, combined, these three men are worth $955 billion. And it is not just these three men. The top 1% now own more wealth than the bottom 90% – and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider every day. In the other America, the working class struggles just to provide for the basic necessities of life. In this America, over 60% of our people live paycheck to paycheck, millions work for starvation wages, 85 million are uninsured or underinsured, more than 20 million households spend over half of their limited incomes on rent or a mortgage and over 60,000 die each year because they can’t afford to go to a doctor on time. BIDEN TO TRUMP: IS THIS THE WORST TRANSITION EVER? In this America, 25% of our seniors try to survive on less than $15,000 a year and parents try to raise their kids in a nation that has the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. And, because of stress and inadequate health care, working people live far shorter lives than the rich. In this America, workers are scared to death that if your car breaks down, if your kid gets sick, if your landlord raises the rent, if you get divorced, if you become pregnant, if for whatever reason you lose your job, you will find yourself in the midst of a financial catastrophe. But let’s be clear. Our country is not just experiencing an unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality. Today, we also have more concentration of ownership than we have ever had. In sector after sector - health care, agriculture, financial services, energy, transportation - a handful of giant corporations control what is produced and how much we, as consumers, pay for their products. Unbelievably, just three Wall Street firms (BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street) control assets of more than $22 trillion. These three Wall Street firms are the major shareholders in about 95% of S&P 500 companies, exerting enormous control over the largest corporations in the world. JEFF BEZOS, OTHER BILLIONAIRE MEDIA OWNERS LOSING 'A FORTUNE' ON STRUGGLING NEWS OUTLETS: REPORT And that’s not all. Never before in American history have so few media conglomerates, all owned by the billionaire class, had so much influence over the public. It is estimated that six huge media corporations now own 90% of what the American people see, hear and read. This handful of corporations determines what is "important" and what we discuss, and what is "unimportant" and what we ignore. If you use a social media account to get your news, chances are it is owned by billionaires Musk, Zuckerberg or Trump. If you read the Washington Post, Fox or the Los Angeles Times, your news is owned by billionaires Bezos, Murdoch or Patrick Soon-Shiong. But it’s not just the billionaire ownership and control over the economy and the media that should concern us. The uber-rich are also buying our government and undermining American democracy. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Never before in American history have we seen a ruling class with so much political power. As a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, billionaires and their super-PACs can spend unlimited sums of money on political campaigns. And that’s exactly what they are doing. During the 2024 election cycle, just 150 billionaires spent nearly $2 billion to buy politicians who support their agenda and to defeat candidates who oppose their special interests. Billionaires who represent just .0005% of our population accounted for 18% of total campaign spending. That is not democracy. That is not one person, one vote. That is not what this country is supposed to stand for. In his Gettysburg Address in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln spoke about "a government of the people, by the people, for the people." Well, today, we have a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class, for the billionaire class." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We are in a pivotal and unprecedented moment in American history. Either we fight to create a government and an economy that works for all, or we continue to move rapidly down the path of oligarchy and the rule of the super-rich. The choice is clear.

Title: Oracle Corp. (ORCL): Should You Invest In This Enterprise Software Stock Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Enterprise Software Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) stands against the other enterprise software stocks. Enterprise software comprises applications designed for large organizations, which enable them to manage functions like data analysis, sales, marketing, and customer service. These solutions prioritize scalability, high user capacity, and seamless integration with existing systems. Grand View Research reported that the global enterprise software market is valued at $263.79 billion as of 2024 and is expected to expand at a 12.1% compound annual growth rate from 2025 to 2030. North America accounted for 41% market share of the global enterprise software industry in 2024. Key trends such as Industry 4.0, digitization, and the rise of connected devices add to the demand for automated and integrated solutions. The shift towards hybrid work models has increased enterprise software adoption in sectors like healthcare and education. In healthcare, enterprise software enhances hospital management and electronic health records. Data safety and privacy are vital market drivers as organizations prioritize protecting sensitive information and comply with GDPR and HIPAA regulations. Cloud-based enterprise software is expected to dominate the market share by over 55% in 2024 due to its accessibility and affordability, while on-premise solutions will gain traction as organizations seek enhanced customization and data security. Large enterprises accounted for over 62% of the market share, driven by the need to manage complex workflows efficiently. The IT & Telecom sector led with over 20% market share in 2024. On December 11, Liz Young Thomas, SoFi's head of investment strategy, and Angela Mwanza, Rockefeller Global Family Office private advisor, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss their market outlooks and address the recent performance of tech stocks. Mwanza expressed a strong bullish outlook for the software sector as they approach the new year. She noted that while mega-cap tech stocks are highly valued, this does not indicate that they are overvalued. She suggested rebalancing portfolios to reduce concentration in these large-cap names while recognizing their growth potential. She highlighted that over the last 6 months, the MAG7 stocks have lagged behind the broader S&P 500, indicating a market broadening that could favor software investments. Thomas supported this bullish sentiment by emphasizing the resilience of software stocks amid recent volatility in momentum stocks, particularly high-growth names. Despite some mega-cap stocks seeing dramatic year-to-date increases, some up to 900%, others have struggled. Looking into 2025, Thomas predicted uneven performance within the tech landscape and advised investors to focus on software companies. She expressed a stronger bullish sentiment towards this segment, suggesting that software stocks are well-positioned for continued growth as they head into the new year. Methodology We first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top enterprise software stocks. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of IT professionals meticulously crafting a large-scale enterprise performance management system. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91 Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) is a software provider that offers comprehensive cloud solutions through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which provides a suite of cloud services, including computing, storage, and networking capabilities. Furthermore, its Roving Edge Infrastructure extends cloud capabilities to remote locations, enabling real-time data processing and analysis in limited connectivity. Cloud services and license support segment encompass a range of offerings, including cloud computing services like Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), as well as the ongoing support and maintenance services associated with the company's software licenses. Cloud services, particularly within OCI, grew due to the increasing demand for AI workloads, the company's competitive pricing and performance advantages, and the flexibility offered by its diverse deployment options. License support plays a vital role in ensuring the smooth and uninterrupted operation of Oracle software for customers. In FQ2 2025, this segment generated $10.8 billion in revenue, reflecting a 12% year-over-year increase. This made up 77% of the total revenue generated in this quarter. This integrated approach enables Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) to meet the diverse needs of its customers, from providing cutting-edge cloud solutions to ensuring the seamless operation of their existing software investments. Parnassus Value Equity Fund stated the following regarding Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) announced second-quarter results that exceeded consensus expectations, driven by growth in its cloud infrastructure business, which is benefiting from demand for AI applications. Investor sentiment was further bolstered by the company’s announcement of a new partnership with Amazon.” Overall ORCL ranks 4th on our list of the best enterprise software stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of ORCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORCL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The year hedge funds grew up

Time Published: 2024-12-27T09:15:01Z

The game has changed. Hedge funds, led by the big names who set the agenda for the multitrillion-dollar sector, were once known for their scrappiness, speed, and reliance on the brains and vision of their founders. Now, as the industry's investor base has shifted to long-term institutions from wealthy families and small funds of funds, hedge funds have become institutions of their own. 2024 may be the turning point that in 10 years' time industry observers will see as the beginning of the next era. The biggest managers are preparing for life beyond their founders, long-standing funds are becoming more formulaic and bureaucratic, and new entrants need to raise more money than ever before. Multistrategy managers like Millennium, Citadel, and Point72 have long been heading in this direction, but recent moves by the firms' founders point to a world in which these giants outlast their larger-than-life leaders. Ken Griffin, Citadel's billionaire founder, said in November that he would be open to selling a stake in his $66 billion Miami-based asset manager. Millennium and BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, have reportedly had talks about the latter taking a stake in the former. Both firms are set to outlast their founders, with built-out infrastructure and leadership teams littered with former Goldman Sachs partners. Millennium, for example, created the office of the chief investment officer in late 2022 and promoted a longtime executive, Ajay Nagpal, to president, giving investors a clear line into the next level of leadership beyond the $72 billion firm's founder, Izzy Englander. The legendary founder of $35 billion Point72, meanwhile, has stepped away from trading his own book of stocks, which is how he burst onto the scene decades ago. While Steve Cohen spends plenty of time and money on the baseball team he owns, the New York Mets, a person close to the firm said the decision to step back from running a book wasn't an indication that he's spending any less time working at his manager. In a recent internal town hall, this person said, he described no longer having a book under his purview as "freeing" as he can spend more time on strategic initiatives for the firm. The market's hours no longer dictate Cohen's schedule — a flexibility he appreciates as he balances running the manager and his baseball team. In mid-October, for example, Cohen was set to appear on a panel at the investment consultant Albourne Partners' annual conference in New York but canceled because the Mets went on a run in the playoffs, people familiar with the event told Business Insider. Beyond the main multistrategy names, several long-running firms across the industry are structurally starting to look more like peers in private equity than smaller hedge-fund rivals. Elliott Management centralized decision-making and created more internal structure, which has frustrated some veterans of Paul Singer's asset manager but provided hierarchy. Meanwhile, Two Sigma and Bridgewater have officially moved on from their founders with new leadership. Brevan Howard's billionaire founder Alan Howard no longer trades for his firm. At the other end of the industry, the bar for new launches has increased substantially, and the next generation of industry leaders are starting the firms with a much more institutional feel than even five years ago. Bobby Jain's $5.3 billion launch in July, for example, had plenty of big-name hires and titles right from the start. In 2023, the average fund launched with $300 million, according to Goldman Sachs' prime-brokerage division. PivotalPath, the industry data tracker run by Jon Caplis, said in an end-of-year report that it expected 2024 to be similar, driven by the increase in multimanagers allocating externally. The report said larger launches were a result of allocators' focus on "quality" launches; the firm is tracking 145 new funds with launches between the start of 2024 and the second quarter of 2025 with founders who come from funds with more than $1 billion. If you're able to command enough capital — either from a platform like Millennium or big allocators like pensions, sovereign wealth funds, and endowments — building out a new firm should be worth it. Longtime industry players and investors believe it's shaping up to be a strong period for the industry thanks to increased volatility that will allow actively managed investment firms to shine. "Our underlying hedge fund managers are active, fundamental stock pickers who seek to identify the best opportunities and offer differentiated exposure," Old Farm Partners, a New York-based fund of funds, wrote in a recent note arguing why active management should shine in the coming years. "Given the argument that we have laid out in this paper, we think the current market backdrop should provide a favorable setup for our strategy going forward." Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Enterprise Software Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where HubSpot Inc. (NYSE:HUBS) stands against the other enterprise software stocks. Enterprise software comprises applications designed for large organizations, which enable them to manage functions like data analysis, sales, marketing, and customer service. These solutions prioritize scalability, high user capacity, and seamless integration with existing systems. Grand View Research reported that the global enterprise software market is valued at $263.79 billion as of 2024 and is expected to expand at a 12.1% compound annual growth rate from 2025 to 2030. North America accounted for 41% market share of the global enterprise software industry in 2024. Key trends such as Industry 4.0, digitization, and the rise of connected devices add to the demand for automated and integrated solutions. The shift towards hybrid work models has increased enterprise software adoption in sectors like healthcare and education. In healthcare, enterprise software enhances hospital management and electronic health records. Data safety and privacy are vital market drivers as organizations prioritize protecting sensitive information and comply with GDPR and HIPAA regulations. Cloud-based enterprise software is expected to dominate the market share by over 55% in 2024 due to its accessibility and affordability, while on-premise solutions will gain traction as organizations seek enhanced customization and data security. Large enterprises accounted for over 62% of the market share, driven by the need to manage complex workflows efficiently. The IT & Telecom sector led with over 20% market share in 2024. On December 11, Liz Young Thomas, SoFi's head of investment strategy, and Angela Mwanza, Rockefeller Global Family Office private advisor, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss their market outlooks and address the recent performance of tech stocks. Mwanza expressed a strong bullish outlook for the software sector as they approach the new year. She noted that while mega-cap tech stocks are highly valued, this does not indicate that they are overvalued. She suggested rebalancing portfolios to reduce concentration in these large-cap names while recognizing their growth potential. She highlighted that over the last 6 months, the MAG7 stocks have lagged behind the broader S&P 500, indicating a market broadening that could favor software investments. Thomas supported this bullish sentiment by emphasizing the resilience of software stocks amid recent volatility in momentum stocks, particularly high-growth names. Despite some mega-cap stocks seeing dramatic year-to-date increases, some up to 900%, others have struggled. Looking into 2025, Thomas predicted uneven performance within the tech landscape and advised investors to focus on software companies. She expressed a stronger bullish sentiment towards this segment, suggesting that software stocks are well-positioned for continued growth as they head into the new year. Methodology We first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top enterprise software stocks. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of software developers gathered around a monitor discussing a new CRM platform. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63 HubSpot Inc. (NYSE:HUBS) provides customer relationship management (CRM) software and empowers businesses to attract, engage, and delight customers. Its platform offers tools for sales, marketing, and customer service. Some of its features include AI-powered marketing automation, an app marketplace, and a community of users and partners. Its growth is significantly driven by the rapid adoption of its AI-powered platform. Q3 2024 saw strong revenue growth of 20% year-over-year in constant currency, building upon 2023's robust performance of 25.4% revenue growth. The recently launched Breeze platform, the company's AI engine, encompasses Copilot, AI Agents, new features, and an agent marketplace. AI awareness increased by 13% quarter-over-quarter, with a portion of enterprise and Pro customers actively engaging with AI features. Copilot, the AI assistant, has a 43% repeat usage rate, demonstrating early adoption among startups. The Customer Agent has empowered 25-30% of Kaplan's customers to self-serve, leading to a 30% reduction in average ticket response time. The Content Agent has enabled Morehouse College to increase page views by 30% and improve time spent on the site by 27%. These AI-powered solutions are empowering businesses to enhance efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth, solidifying HubSpot Inc.'s (NYSE:HUBS) position as the leading customer platform. Artisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Along with Dexcom and Celsius, a notable trim in the quarter wasHubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS). HubSpot is a leading cloud-based customer relationship management software provider for small-to-medium businesses. The stock was a top performer in 2023 as it meaningfully improved its profitability after several years of heavy investment. However, as we mentioned earlier in this letter, the environment for cloud software providers has been challenging in 2024 as macroeconomic pressures have impacted customer spending. Our long-term conviction remains intact, but we reduced the position due to near-term uncertainty. Meanwhile, we are encouraged by the company’s efforts to leverage AI advances to help internally (e.g., more efficient software development) and externally (e.g., new agent-based apps to help customers extract more value out of its products).” Overall HUBS ranks 11th on our list of the best enterprise software stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of HUBS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HUBS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Balfour Beatty plc (LON:BBY) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 87% of the company

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Institutions' substantial holdings in Balfour Beatty implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price A total of 15 investors have a majority stake in the company with 52% ownership Insiders have sold recently Every investor in Balfour Beatty plc (LON:BBY) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 87% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Balfour Beatty. See our latest analysis for Balfour Beatty Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Balfour Beatty already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Balfour Beatty, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Balfour Beatty. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.0% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 5.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.6% by the third-largest shareholder. Furthermore, CEO Leo Quinn is the owner of 0.7% of the company's shares. A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 15 shareholders have a combined ownership of 52% implying that no single shareholder has a majority. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Our information suggests that Balfour Beatty plc insiders own under 1% of the company. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own UK£18m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Balfour Beatty better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Balfour Beatty you should be aware of.

Title: ‘Gaelic was my first sport and David Brady my hero’ – Dave Heffernan hopes Mayo GAA roots can inspire Connacht

Connacht's Dave Heffernan is tackled by Leinster duo Alex Soroka and Aitzol Arenzana-King, right, during the inter-provincial clash at the Aviva Stadium. Photo: Seb Daly/Sportsfile David Brady during his playing days with Mayo. Photo: Ray McManus/Sportsfile All-Ireland football medals are as rare as a Christmas snowflake down Ballina way but the renowned Heffernan family dusted down their prized possession this year. For there are some Mayo men who know what it’s like to win an All-Ireland. Not the big piece of tin, perhaps. But in a county defined by perennial pining, what’s seldom is wonderful. Gaelic football may not be the only sport people for folks in Mayo but for so many it is the first one they turn to. Connacht hooker Dave Heffernan grew up dreaming of winning Sam before being turned by an oval ball. He won a Celtic League title that transcended borders with the men from the west in 2016. If he’d stayed with the O’Neill’s ball, he would still be questing the western seaboard’s sporting grail. But there was one All-Ireland medal amongst the family when the Heffernans gathered this festive season; 50 years ago, dad Ivan was in goal as the Mayo men defeated Antrim in a replay to win the now defunct U-21 title. September marked the 50th anniversary of the occasion but they’ve lost a few soldiers in that time; John O’Mahony, even then touted as a four-star officer for the future, the latest to fall this year. Ballina native Ivan also prospered with another group of famed All-Ireland winners of that mid-70s era, Eugene McGee’s star-studded UCD collective, franking his place in Mayo sporting folklore. But there was more to follow. And someone else. His father. The great Ivan Heffernan Snr’s name is so embedded in Ballina RFC lore that they named their pitch after him. As a player, he backboned the famous league and cup double-winning team alongside Dave Heffernan’s maternal grandfather, Séamus Barrett. That triumph came in 1951, the year Mayo last lifted Sam. And so his son would inevitably tread the rugby turf that bore the family name, winning a Junior Cup in 1986 as a formidable back-row forward in the days when referees didn’t whistle and flankers didn’t apologise. And then when his own son was born, the pattern continued; there may have been rugby in the genes but GAA coursed through the veins. When Dave was old enough to run, the first passion was the one that absorbed every Ballina boy. “Look, Gaelic football was my first sport growing up,” says Heffernan, now a 12-year and over 200-cap Connacht veteran, as he eagerly scans a unique New Year resolution. A personal return to MacHale Park as part of a professional, provincial rugby squad when Connacht entertain Munster in March. “David Brady was my hero, he only lived down the road from me there and my dad would have played with Liam McHale as well. “I wouldn’t go so far as to say it was an illustrious underage career! I played centre-back and full-back mainly. I tried to play a little bit in midfield towards the end but mainly centre-back and full-back. “But I played with Ballina Stephenites up to minor level and I did play in MacHale Park, we won an U-16 county championship there. “That was my last appearance there so, hopefully, we can get a win the next time we go back there again! “But yeah, I loved it; on my dad’s side of the family particularly they all played football. They’re all football-mad. “My uncle [Niall] has coached the Stephenites for the last couple of years, and they’ve won a couple of county championships. “My dad never would have pushed me down any path, to be honest. He played both sports for most of his life.” Dave would have his head turned while boarding in Blackrock College but his initial progress was not entirely smooth; he broke his leg just three minutes into a Connacht U-20 bow. From a sliding door to a slamming door, it seemed but he persisted and, once recovered, seized a place in the Connacht Academy 12 months later. David Brady during his playing days with Mayo. Photo: Ray McManus/Sportsfile He had forged his own individual path; no longer a flank-forward, like the Heffernans before him, but a hooker. “Dad was always my hero growing up, he still is. And that’s probably why I wanted to play for Mayo as well from a young age. “But there was never any pressure from him in terms of which way, he just kind of said whoever forces you to make the decision, go the opposite way. “And it kind of did come to a fork in the road where the Gaelic side of things were saying, ‘Look, we need you to make a commitment, one way or the other.’ “And, obviously, with rugby, you’ve got a very short window from underage to academy to try and go pro, so I just went with the rugby at that stage, not knowing what would come of it.” In every year since 1951, nobody would have contemplated a rugby team darkening the doors of a GAA ground before Mayo would win another senior All-Ireland. Heffernan’s professional devotion remains Connacht rugby but his personal passions are inextricably entwined with the green and red. His daily reality is the perennial toil of Irish rugby’s fourth, often fallow, green field attempting to battle against superior forces. His nightly dreams rarely omit a journey home from Croke Park as All-Ireland champions. Can it happen in his lifetime? “I hope so! I’ve been to all the finals in the last 15 years or so and look, they’ve been incredible. And, yeah, look, they’ve just fallen short a few times, obviously, but I think we will. I hope so. “My dad hasn’t seen it yet either, but look, to be a team that’s constantly competing, honestly, at the tail end of the season, it’s something that for us here in Connacht, we always aspire to be in the knockout stages of competitions. “There’s a lot to be said for that as well but, obviously, the main goal is to try to get Sam Maguire back. We’ll see what happens!”

BlackRock reported holding 430,770 shares of its spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) IBIT through its Global Allocation Fund. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the shares amount to over $17 million as of Oct. 31. As highlighted by X user identified as MacroScope, the amount of shares reported in BlackRock’s recent filing is 117% larger than the 198,874 shares reported on July 31. Additionally, the current amount of IBIT shares reported is over 10 times higher than the 43,000 shares registered in the first quarter. The Global Allocation Fund is a BlackRock product that invests in equities from the US and foreign markets, debt, money market securities, and other short-term securities. Its composition varies periodically. Despite doubling down on its own Bitcoin product, the IBIT shares represent only 0.1% of the Global Allocation Fund’s $16.5 billion total size. The ETF Store CEO Nate Geraci recently highlighted that the IBIT is among the 35 largest ETFs by assets under management out of over 3,900 funds. He added: “Ahead of ETFs such as iShares MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF, & Vanguard Total World Stock ETF. In less than a year. You have no idea how ridiculous that is.” According to data from Farside Investors, IBIT amassed over $37 billion in positive net flows in less than one year since its launch. This is over three times the amount registered by the second largest ETF by inflows, Fidelity’s FBTC, which amassed $11.8 billion in capital. This makes IBIT primarily responsible for the US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs’ $35.4 billion inflows. Regarding assets under management, the IBIT holds 527,284 BTC as of press time, according to ETF tracker heyapollo. This is worth over $50 billion at Bitcoin’s current price of $95,753.77. As with the net flows of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the IBIT also plays a key role in US-traded BTC investment vehicles surpassing gold ETFs’ total assets under management.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other top performing dividend stocks in 2024. Over time, dividend stocks have shown consistent resilience in difficult market conditions. Despite the recent focus on AI, the long-term appeal of these stocks has grown. Income investors have noticed this shift, reflected in the increasing role of dividends in personal income. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices reveals that the share of dividend income has risen from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024, emphasizing the importance of dividends as a key income source. The report also noted that since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than a third of total equity returns in the broader market, with the rest coming from capital gains. The dividend growth strategy seems to be working for long-term investors as these stocks have generated strong returns over the years. Considering inflation, dividends have outpaced it, suggesting that investors should focus on these stocks. A report by Wisdom Tree highlighted that from 1957 to 2023, dividends grew at an average annual rate of 5.7%, which is over 2% higher than the inflation rate. The report also pointed out that dividends have only decreased in six years during the past 64 years, and only once by more than 5%. In comparison, stock prices fell in 18 of those years, with the worst decline exceeding 40% and an average drop of over 11%. Stock prices were more than twice as volatile as dividend cash flows, as short-term price movements are more influenced by market sentiment, while long-term value is driven by the stability of cash flows. READ ALSO: 10 Dividend Stocks For Steady Income This year, dividend stocks have underperformed compared to the broader market. The Dividend Aristocrat Index has gained only 6% year-to-date, while the market has surged by over 27%. Although this might seem discouraging for dividend investors, seasoned investors recognize that this presents a great opportunity to buy dividend stocks. Chris O’Keefe, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management, pointed out that the widening performance gap between the market and dividend stocks in 2024 creates an ideal time for investors to consider these equities. Along with O'Keefe, many analysts are encouraging investors to focus on dividend stocks due to their favorable outlook. The Dividend Aristocrats index has struggled to keep pace with the market since 2020. Dividend stocks saw a brief resurgence in 2022 as recession concerns led investors to seek out stable sectors like utilities and consumer goods, but the recovery was short-lived. By 2023, rising interest rates made bond and money-market returns more attractive than dividend yields, causing companies to adopt a more cautious stance and conserve cash amid economic uncertainty. This year, many of the top-performing stocks from the COVID era have once again driven the market to new highs. Despite underperforming for the past two consecutive years, analysts remain optimistic about dividend stocks. They believe that dividend-paying equities could see a resurgence in 2025, as investors are increasingly seeking cash returns. The broader market’s dividend yield recently dropped to a 20-year low, falling below 1.19%, significantly lower than the long-term historical average of 4.3%. With interest rates rising on risk-free investments like Treasuries, companies are recognizing the growing competition for yield. As a result, many are responding by increasing dividends or introducing them for the first time. Notably, several major technology companies began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market that they are positioning themselves as value plays within a high-growth sector. A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. For this article, we first used a stock screener to identify stocks that have reported positive returns in 2024 so far. From this selection, we chose dividend stocks with the highest year-to-date (YTD) as of December 25. The stocks were then arranged in ascending order of their YTD gains. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Year-to-Date Return as of December 25: 120.82% An American multinational semiconductor company, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks second on our list of the best performing stocks that pay dividends. The company offers a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. It recently announced its Q4 2024 earnings and reported revenue of $14.05 billion, which showed a significant growth of over 51% from the same period last year. Semiconductor revenue reached a record $30.1 billion, fueled by $12.2 billion in AI revenue. The AI revenue, which grew 220% year-over-year, was driven by the company's leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. In fiscal year 2024, adjusted EBITDA increased by 37% compared to the previous year, reaching a record $31.9 billion. Though Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has not provided full-year guidance, analysts anticipate the company's revenue will grow by nearly 19% in the current fiscal year, reaching $61.1 billion. Moreover, the semiconductor specialist is expected to see a 15% increase in revenue over the next couple of fiscal years as well. In addition to its strong earnings, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also showed a solid cash position. During the quarter, the company reported an operating cash flow of over $5.6 billion, and its free cash flow came in at $5.48 billion. This cash flow represented 39% of the company's revenue. Due to its growing cash flow, it announced an 11.3% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.59 per share on December 12. This marked the company's 14th consecutive year of dividend growth. As of December 25, the stock has a dividend yield of 0.98%. As of the end of Q3 2024, 128 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database held stakes in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), compared with 130 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $14.5 billion. With more than 23.4 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of the best performing dividend stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential for AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Dycom Industries (DY) the Best Engineering Stock to Buy for 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE:DY) stands against other engineering stocks to buy for 2025. The engineering industry is playing an increasingly significant role in today’s tech-supported world. The demand for engineering solutions is increasing globally, and this trend is expected to continue into 2025. Investments in clean energy, urban development, and transportation are driving this demand, presenting a scalable opportunity for investors to benefit from engineering companies’ potential. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global engineering services industry has remained resilient over the years, with a market size worth $1.67 trillion as of 2024. It is expected to grow to $2.04 trillion by 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.20% between 2024 and 2029. Although the largest market for the engineering services industry is centered in the Asia Pacific region, the Middle East and Africa are showing the fastest market growth globally. This growth is attributed to various factors, including infrastructure development, technological advancements, demand for sustainable solutions, and the need for specialized skills in infrastructure programs. Since infrastructure projects are complicated and strenuous, the demand for innovative engineering services continues to grow. In fact, data from the US Census Bureau shows that the value of infrastructure building in the US rose from $1.80 trillion to $1.84 trillion between October 2022 and February 2023. The surge in the use of digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and IoT is another primary force driving the market. Thus, the engineering sector stands out as a promising investment opportunity due to technological advancements, resilience to economic fluctuations, supportive government initiatives, and strong market demand. The construction industry experienced a 10% increase in nominal value added and a 12% growth in gross output in 2024. According to Deloitte, construction spending surpassed $2 trillion in the US in 2024. Its employment level touched 8.3 million in July 2024, exceeding its previous high of 7.7 million in 2006. These numbers have been consistently increasing for more than a year. Similarly, the Dodge Momentum Index (DMI), which measures nonresidential building spending, was on an upward trajectory in fiscal Q2 2024. This reflects increasing confidence in market conditions among developers and owners. Deloitte’s 2025 Engineering and Construction Industry Outlook states that there are reasons to be optimistic in 2025. The company’s analysis of the Oxford Economic Model shows that short-term interest rates are likely to fall gradually over the coming years, followed by interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The improving financial and economic conditions are anticipated to positively influence construction and engineering demand across various segments. Declining mortgage rates may also increase demand and residential construction activity. Other drivers of growth in segments such as manufacturing, engineering, and energy may include government investments through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). We sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of 30 engineering stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). asharkyu/Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29 Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE:DY) provides specialty contracting services. It offers an array of services to telecommunication providers, including engineering and design, program management, and others. Its engineering services span the planning and design of underground, aerial, and buried fiber optic, copper, and coaxial cable systems that extend from the telephone company’s hub location to a business or home. The company’s revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $1.272 billion in fiscal Q3 2025, and its organic revenue increased by 7.6%. This growth was attributed to the deployment of gigabit wireline networks, wireless networks, and wireline converged networks. The company is also seeing continued strategic transactions, including commitments and refinancings, to increase many of its customers’ capital expenditures. Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE:DY) completed the acquisition of Black & Veatch’s public carrier wireless telecommunications infrastructure business during fiscal Q3 2025. It is also focusing on opportunities related to AI, including expansive new national deployments of high capacity, low latency inter and intracity networks. The company ranks eighth on our list of the 10 best engineering stocks to buy for 2025. Aristotle Small Cap Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE:DY) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE:DY), a provider of engineering and construction services to the telecommunications and cable television industries, benefitted from continued growth in its core business, funding tailwinds, and expanding margins as demand for wireline services continues to grow. We maintain a position as we believe the company remains well positioned for longer-term growth alongside secular trends for expanding fiber deployments to support faster broadband connectivity speeds and opportunities to deploy fiber to rural or underserved areas across the country.” Overall, DY ranks 8th on our list of engineering stocks to buy for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of engineering stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted mountains of cash, and have enabled investors to gain exposure to BTC without the hassle of managing private keys. They have also lent legitimacy to the asset on Wall Street. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs validated the asset’s regulatory status. And despite a subdued debut, they have gained momentum in recent weeks and potentially opened the door to similar products for Solana and XRP in the U.S. When Bitcoin ETFs began trading in January, the price of BTC clocked in at $46,000. Nearly a year later, the asset’s price has more than doubled. It even breached $108,000 in December, following momentum sparked by Donald Trump’s White House victory. As a group, eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold $113 billion in assets under management, or AUM, according to CoinGlass. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas had told Decrypt in early December that the number of Bitcoin held by these products could overtake the estimated 1.1 million Bitcoin mined by Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, by Christmas. Turns out, the symbolic milestone was shattered just two days later. “It’d be a fitting cap on a storybook launch,” Balchunas said at the time. “This stuff is an anomaly in physics. There has never been a launch like this, and there will never be another one.” When it comes to spot Bitcoin ETFs, the products brought “excitement, anticipation, opportunity, [and] legitimacy” to the asset, Balchunas added. Removing any friction associated with getting exposure to Bitcoin, he said the power of matching investors with brands they know and trust in brokerage accounts could not be overstated. It's a marked departure from the common refrain of “Not your keys, not your coins,” following the collapse of FTX in 2022—that is, the believe from many crypto die-hards that self-custody is the only reasonable way to own crypto. By 2024, the value proposition of Bitcoin exposure without key management was too good for some investors to pass up. Nathan Geraci, president of investment advisor The ETF Store, told Decrypt that he was always highly bullish on the prospects of Bitcoin ETFs. At the start of the year he predicted that the group would “obliterate every ETF launch record out there” before they began trending. However, he added, “net inflows into these products has exceeded even my extremely optimistic expectations.” With more than $53.5 billion in AUM, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) emerged as an industry leader this year. Towering over Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the second-largest spot Bitcoin ETF by AUM at $20 billion, IBIT’s profile was boosted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who highlighted Bitcoin as an investment multiple times this year. Once a Bitcoin skeptic, the CEO of the world’s largest asset manager described Bitcoin in January as “potential long-term store of value” against governments devaluing their currency. Months later, Fink called himself a “major believer” in Bitcoin, framing the asset as an investment for those with an increasingly frightened view toward the world. As far as stores of value are concerned, Bitcoin advocates often compare Bitcoin to “digital gold.” Within BlackRock’s suite of products, that link crystallized in November, when IBIT’s AUM surpassed that of BlackRock’s iShares Gold ETF (IAU)—first offered in 2005. As of this writing, it ranked 32nd among all U.S. ETFs by AUM, according to the ETF Database. While analysts noted to Decrypt that BlackRock’s push into the crypto space eroded industry stigma in 2023, Geraci said the stellar performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs was anything but a given. “Back in January, I’m not sure anyone envisioned the spot Bitcoin ETF category eclipsing $100 billion in assets before year-end,” he said. “As a matter of fact, there were plenty of naysayers who thought the category would never hit that mark.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs garnered massive amounts of inflows this year, but they also improved Bitcoin’s market structure, according to research from analytics firm Kaiko. In June, Kaiko observed that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs had increased trading volumes for Bitcoin on crypto exchanges, while strengthening the market’s ability to absorb large orders. At the same time, Kaiko analysts noted that Bitcoin’s trading activity became concentrated around weekdays, when Wall Street is open for business. After branding himself a “crypto president” on the campaign trail, Trump’s reelection sparked a record-setting rally in Bitcoin’s price. When it came to BlackRock’s Bitcoin product, IBIT served as a connective tissue that enabled investors to trade Bitcoin in an unprecedented way. As Bitcoin jumped past $75,000 on November 6—the day after Trump’s reelection—IBIT’s trading volume crossed $1 billion in 20 minutes. By the end of the day, IBIT’s trading volume had swelled to $4.1 billion. "For context, that's more volume than stocks like Berkshire, Netflix, or Visa saw today," Balchunas wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter). In an interview, Balchunas noted that spot Bitcoin ETFs smashed record after record this year, from trading volume stats to an initial pace of inflows. Of note, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF reached $10 billion in AUM faster than any ETF ever launched in history. It was also the first ETF to hit $50 billion in AUM—more than five times faster than any other ETF in history. When the SEC approved the listing and trading of options for spot Bitcoin ETFs in October, analysts told Decrypt the development would make it easier, cheaper, and safer for institutional players to gain Bitcoin exposure. “I mostly consider this another brick in the wall of normalization,” Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan told Decrypt. “We should be happy about it.” It would be impossible to capture the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs without mentioning Grayscale. It was once the largest asset manager in the crypto space, and its legal victory against the SEC last year paved the way for the products’ eventual approval. The SEC dragged its feet on approving applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs for a decade, citing concerns about market manipulation. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit found last August that the SEC’s repeated denial of Grayscale’s ETF gambit was unlawful. While billions of dollars flowed out of GBTC this year—$21 billion, as of this writing—Grayscale’s then-CEO Michael Sonnenshein said the outflows were anticipated. In April, he pointed to the bankruptcy estates of collapsed crypto firms, which were “forced” to liquidate GBTC holdings, among traders capitalizing on GBTC’s once-sizable discount due to its former structure. Analysts also attributed GTBC outflows to the product’s expense ratio as well, which stands at 1.5%. Making the product more costly to hold than GBTC’s competitors, with expense ratios as low as 0.19%, Grayscale responded with a GBTC spinoff ETF featuring a 0.15% expense ratio. A similar dynamic befell the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which saw over $1 billion in outflows during its first three trading days as a full-fledged ETF, according to CoinGlass. While the bleeding has largely stopped, and Grayscale has launched a spinoff ETF for ETHE too, the outflows dampened investor enthusiasm when spot Ethereum ETFs launched this summer. Because SEC Chair Gary Gensler had sidestepped questions about Ethereum’s regulatory status, many doubted that applications for spot Ethereum ETFs would be approved under his leadership. In a stunning development, however, the SEC flashed a green light for the products in May. A lawsuit filed by the Ethereum software company Consensys had also alleged that the SEC internally viewed ETH as a security. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) The distinction would’ve forced ETF hopefuls to pursue a different avenue, but the SEC effectively validated Ethereum’s status as a commodity with its move. Still, spot Ethereum ETFs have seen far lower inflows than spot Bitcoin ETFs have. Weighed down by $3.6 billion in ETHE outflows, the group of products from eight issuers have attracted $2.3 billion worth of inflows since their July debut, as of this writing, according to CoinGlass. Meanwhile, the ETFs haven’t been a salve to Ethereum’s price the way similar products were for BTC. After peaking around $4,100 earlier in December, the cryptocurrency currently trades hands around $3,400. And unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum hasn't broken its all-time high mark in 2024, nor has it come close to doing so. It makes sense that investors haven’t flocked to spot Ethereum ETFs en masse, given that Ethereum’s story is relatively unknown compared to Bitcoin’s within the minds of mainstream investors, FlaconX Head of Research David Lawant told Decrypt. Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value has been well established, Lawant said. But regardless of whether Ethereum is conveyed as a tech play, smart contract platform, or an app store for Web3 applications, the narrative surrounding Ethereum isn’t as established outside crypto circles. “Ethereum is a different beast” compared to Bitcoin, Lawant said. “There's different ways you can spin it, but regardless of how you tell the story, it is a different story.” At present, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only digital assets with spot ETFs in the United States. Yet, alongside hopes of a crypto-friendly SEC during Trump’s administration, asset managers have filed for ETFs covering Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, among a growing list of other digital assets. Even Dogecoin ETFs don't seem so far-fetched in this climate, analysts told Decrypt. Whether or not applications for those cryptocurrencies are approved may be a question for Gensler’s slated successor, Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and Trump's nominee for the role. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs will be trading, following up their first year with a high bar to shoot for.

We came across a bullish thesis on YETI Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YETI) on Substack by Rene. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on YETI. YETI Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YETI)'s share was trading at $39.31 as of Dec 24th. YETI’s trailing and forward P/E were 17.02 and 13.51 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A family enjoying a camping trip, with the company's coolers, cargo bags, and other outdoor lifestyle products in the frame. Yeti, a premium lifestyle brand known for its high-quality outdoor and leisure products, has built a strong market presence through a combination of functionality, durability, and aspirational appeal. Founded in 2006 by Roy and Ryan Seiders, Yeti initially focused on high-performance coolers but has since diversified into a variety of products including drinkware, backpacks, and barware. Despite its premium prices, Yeti’s products resonate deeply with a loyal customer base, particularly those from middle- to upper-middle-class demographics who value quality and reliability. Yeti’s customers often view purchases as long-term investments, reinforcing brand loyalty and repeat business. The company’s direct-to-consumer (DTC) model has played a critical role in driving growth, accounting for over half of total revenue. By selling through its own website and retail stores, Yeti maintains control over its brand image while enjoying higher margins than traditional wholesale channels. In addition to its core products, Yeti has expanded into related categories, such as coffee gear and cast-iron cookware, effectively building an ecosystem that encourages repeat purchases. This approach has allowed the company to create a robust brand that blends functionality with status, distinguishing itself from competitors. Financially, Yeti has experienced significant growth, with revenue tripling from approximately $600 million in 2016 to over $1.8 billion today. The company has consistently maintained gross margins above 50%, driven by its pricing power and premium product offerings. Yeti's focus on high-margin categories and product innovation is key to its profitability, and management is targeting a gross margin surpassing 60% within the next five years. Additionally, Yeti’s return on invested capital (ROIC) has averaged 28.5% over the past decade, showcasing its efficient capital deployment and strong financial performance. Looking ahead, Yeti’s growth strategy revolves around three key pillars: international expansion, product innovation, and acquisitions. With only 18% of revenue coming from outside the U.S., international markets represent a significant opportunity for growth, particularly in regions like Europe and Asia. Yeti’s recent acquisitions, including premium backpack brand Mystery Ranch and cast-iron cookware maker Butter Pat Industries, are expected to help the company capture new customer segments and expand its product portfolio. However, risks remain, including competition from emerging brands and supply chain dependencies, particularly in China. Market saturation in the U.S. also poses a challenge, making international growth crucial for sustaining double-digit revenue growth. Despite these risks, Yeti’s strong brand, customer loyalty, and robust financials position it well for continued success. At its current valuation, Yeti offers an attractive investment opportunity with significant upside potential driven by international expansion and product innovation. YETI Holdings, Inc.

The price of Bitcoin surpassed US$100,000 this year upon a favourable US election result for the asset. Photo / 123rf If there was any story that gripped financial markets in 2024, Bitcoin would likely be it. The cryptocurrency (although Bitcoiners don’t like it being called that), smashed records this year to surpass US$100,000 for the first time. It followed the launch of exchange-traded funds that made investing in the asset easier for retail investors, and a US election result that favours its future. Markets with Madison began covering Bitcoin in-depth earlier this year, speaking to its biggest bulls including Michael Saylor and Cathie Wood. Markets with Madison visited MicroStrategy’s executive chairman in Washington DC in October to discuss his company’s Bitcoin adoption playbook. MicroStrategy held about US$45 billion worth of Bitcoin by December, as it kept acquiring it despite the rising price. In the first part of this interview, Saylor discussed the multiple his stock is commanding above the value of its Bitcoin holdings, and how investors should assess his company’s finances. In the second part of the Saylor interview, he discusses the factors fuelling the asset’s attractiveness among investors. This episode also explains how Bitcoin is created and its properties. One of the more significant moves in Bitcoin this year was the halving event, where the reward earned from mining the cryptocurrency is reduced. Such an event occurs about every four years and has historically positively impacted its price. In this episode, Ark Invest chief investment officer Cathie Wood discusses her outlook for the asset upon the halving, and the success of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds that her firm launched alongside other financial players like BlackRock.
