The Site WordPress.com hasn’t changed up anything dramatically this month. Nothing here to get angry about. They have still broken things however, so there is still some minor disappointment. Back in January I mentioned that WP.com had introduced Activity Pub integration, which let you connect your blog directly with the Fediverse, so that it would appear on, allow people to follow it, and auto update for users of services such as Mastodon. Pretty cool. You could even leave a comment on the blog from Mastodon, which was honestly easier than trying to leave a comment here without logging into a WP.com account. I had a couple of problems with it on this blog, and turned it off in March as it was causing problems with Discord. But I let it run with my other blog, EVE Online Pictures, because its format was quite well suited to the integration. And so it appeared in the Fediverse. EVE Online Pictures – Fediverse Version Granted, nobody actually followed it, which is about par for the course for the 17 years that blog has existed. There is no broad interest in EVE Online screen shots. It would get a like now and then… but even that seemed to dry up in June. And then I discovered that WP.com broke the whole Activity Pub thing, so the likes stopped because the integration stopped working after June 11, 2025. This corresponded with an update to the blog settings for WP.com hosted blogs and there does not seem to be any way to get the integration running again. I cannot even turn it off and back on again, the most basic of trouble shooting, because the on/off option has gone missing. One Year Ago There was the end of the Steam Summer sale, which always prompts me to summarize my gaming so far in the year. There was also Pokemon Go Fest 2024. My wife and I also made it to level 46 in the game. Enad Global 7 bought the struggling title Palia and assigned it to Daybreak. Meanwhile, the EQ and EQII producer’s letters gave hints about their fall plans. Playable Worlds, having announced Stars Reach, put the game up to wishlist on Steam and got on all the usual social media sites. Then there was the start of the pillars posts, followed by more pillars, and then even more pillars. It was like the Acropolis. I played a bit more Tarisland. In EVE Online the Guristas took over the Alliance Tournament XX sponsorship. The AIR daily goals got a change up while CCP made it clear that the “farms and fields” idea for null sec was over. There would, once again, be good space and bad space in null sec. This got Asher to write an open letter to CCP about their plans, which got endorsements even from our traditional foes. I did a Friday bullet points post about CCP announcements around Equinox, Vanguard, Carbon, ATXX timeline updates, and actually getting mentioned in the Community Beats post. Meanwhile I was still on about shuttle destruction in the MER and CCP introduced the weekly 15K skill point injector for Omega accounts. The latter gets you an extra 780K skill points a year if you remember to redeem them. I also sold a SKIN on the Paragon Hub. In game we were out in the Dronelands shooting the new Skyhooks. While out there I narrowly averted disaster when I jumped to the Fraternity staging beacon. Then the invasion of far Catch began in what was the start of the Imperium’s plan to move eastward. PanFam and Fraternity didn’t seem concerned even as we dropped a Keepstar on grid with one of their in U-QVWD. With Cataclysm Classic we bowled over Blackrock Caverns in our second try. Then, because we missed a quest, we went back and did it again as a foursome. Along the way an alt hit level cap. Over in retail, the pre-patch for The War Within landed. There was also the World of Racetrack vision of WoW. In Valheim I made it to the Ashlands, mostly out of my grudge against it. Having gotten there and tested it out I was done. I started back in No Man’s Sky. You start out in trouble and then work up from there. There was the warm up to Blaugust 2024. Finally, WP.com was being awful, because that is what they do best. Five Years Ago The 2020 Steam Summer Sale finished up. I bought some things. In TorilMUD, aging was abolished. And a good thing too! SSG was compensating people for outages in Lord of the Rings Online. Minecraft gave us the Nether Update. I went out and found a crimson forest in the nether. I was reflecting on Diablo II at its twenty year anniversary. We didn’t know for sure there would be a remaster at that point. Blizzard was getting us more details about the Shadowlands beta and launch. In WoW Classic the instance group was finishing up Zul’Farrak and then meandering about Maraudon, which we finished up on our second run. Blizzard was banning botters in classic while getting ready to open up the Ahn’Qiraj war effort event. As part of the anti-botting effort they were limiting the number of instances players could spawn in a day, but we were at least getting some extra bag slots. CCP cancelled their San Diego player event as Covid did not look to be going away any time soon. I also resigned myself to the fact that, despite past promises, CCP was going to keep selling skill points in EVE Online. (I’d feel better if they stopped being so dumb about it.) In game we saw the launch of the Zenith Quadrant, the first part of which was a small update to command ships, and official support for the capsuleer cemetery at Molea. The June MER showed that mining was shifting to high sec after the resource changes. But the bulk of my posts in July were about the opening of World War Bee, which I chose to list out rather than try to create a paragraph narrative: It was kind of a big deal at the time. Ten Years Ago I was feeling a bit of the summertime MMO ennui blues. Windows 10 launched, bringing with it the Microsoft Solitaire Collection. This wasn’t your Win 3.1 Solitaire or Freecell, and more is the pity. Project: Gorgon was off with another Kickstarter campaign. Would the third time be a charm? (Spoiler: yes) Need for Speed: World shut down, so I said farewell to Palmont. Derek Smart began what would become is crusade against Star Citizen, detailing why he felt we would never see the game that was promised. It could have ended there, but RSI responded in a way guaranteed to turn it into a fight and took away his Rear Admiralty. Game on! In Minecraft I was learning about not falling off of things, bringing light to dark places, and accumulating materials. Also, sheep stole my mine cart. I was mucking around in War Thunder for a bit. It is a pain to return to the game because there is always a huge update required. Over at Daybreak, there was a vote up for the EverQuest progression server Ragefire about speeding up the unlock of Ruins of Kunark, as well as talk about raids and such. On the EverQuest II side of the house, there was a beta for its first nostalgia servers. I avoided the beta but was there when the servers went live… for the big surprise, the return of the Isle of Refuge, adding to the nostalgia experience. And while that was going on, it appeared to be the end of Smed at Daybreak. In New Eden my alliance, TNT, handed over its last system in Deklein. We then lived in Tribute. The Aegis expansion hit… but there was a delay between that and other bits of what we now call Fozzie sov to be deployed. But entosis link modules were finally able to take sov as the month rolled along. So we started to learn by doing. There was a plan in the Imperium to bring in care bears to mine and rat in order to raise ADMs so that our now much reduced space holdings would remain secure. At one point Mordus Angels managed to claim some sovereignty in Pure Blind! Can you imagine? Crazy times! Meanwhile, in the cash shop… erm… New Eden store, more skins were being rolled out. Or, rather, the same skin on more ships. The blog banter of the month was on about attributes, and I was bitching about never having enough jump clones. On the Azeroth front, Blizzard said they would be announcing the next World of Warcraft expansion… right after the Q2 quarterly report was released, which raised some suspicions in me. What would the subscription numbers look like if they felt they needed a big announcement to distract from them? And I finally got my copy of Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls from the Kickstarter… only two years late. Fifteen Years Ago The late Paul the octopus created the then largest page view day ever in the history of the blog, later to be surpassed by Cats playing Patty Cake and Alamo. Actually writing about games is never popular. I was told I write like Cory Doctorow… or maybe Ian Flemming. My daughter was Banned from Club Penguin. Tears were shed, lessons were learned. EverQuest II Extended, the free to play EverQuest II, was announced. I wondered whether trying to play it without paying at all would be a challenge in and of itself. Meanwhile, there was some evidence that EQII accounts had value. That stunning news no doubt got them going on the authenticator they announced at Fan Faire this year. I completed 100 levels in The Agency: Covert Ops. I was unemployed, what can I say? StarCraft II launched. I never bought a copy and the base edition eventually went free. It never surpassed the original in popularity and Blizz eventually just stopped doing content for it, though like many old Blizz titles, it does get a patch once in a while to keep it playable. Need for Speed World, an MMO version of the Need for Speed series, launched. I ended up playing it for a bit. But, being an EA MMO, it was doomed to be shut down. In EVE Online Hulkageddon III ended, and it even had a video wrap-up. And then PLEX was made transportable in space. I wonder if they waited for Hulkageddon to be over for that? In another Summer hiatus season, the instance group started another run at LOTRO. This time it was Bung who was out, having the dual issues of moving and having a new baby to care for. Those of us in Middle-earth hung out with old friends. That put off deciding who my main character was, by letting me roll another one! Blizzard gave up on some of their RealID plans thanks to much public kvetching. Shortly there after, the ESRB came out against Real ID as being bad for consumer security while proving they too were bad for consumer security. Blizzard revamped Parental Controls again. As much as I have griped about them, they are better than any comparable controls I have seen, even in games that offer that as a feature. World of Warcraft Magazine issue #2 showed up. Issue #4 would arrive 9 months later, which is kind of a long time for an alleged quarterly publication. Once issue #5 was finally out, the whole thing was shut down. And somebody was trying to make yet another flying car that failed to live up to our expectations. Have none of these scientists ever seen The Jetsons? Twenty Years Ago Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas gets rated adults only (AO 18+) and the company faces sanctions when the hot coffee mod unlocks a hidden mini-game that existed in the product which allow the protagonist to have sex with his girlfriends. Unlike some other infamous graphic mods, this one was not fan created content, but something the company put into the game. In EVE Online the Cold War expansion hit, bringing freighters, dreadnoughts, and player owned outposts (“Permanent” caputurable stations, not to be confused with Player Owned Starbases, the doughty POS that remains to this day) in null sec. Those stations are gone, but remembered via special faction Fortizars. Forty Years Ago The Amiga 1000, the first in the line of Commodore’s Amiga series of computers, is debuted. Launched in an era when DOS users were still working from a command prompt and Mac users could run exactly one program at a time, the Amiga brought performance, multitasking, multimedia, and high resolution graphics to the masses. Later versions of the Amiga, combined with the Video Toaster software package, would do for video production what the Macintosh and the laser printer did for desktop publishing. Forty-Five Years Ago Atari releases Missile Command to arcades, one of the iconic titles of the era. Not the first arcade title to use a trackball, but it certainly helped cement the trackball as an input device. It hasn’t been ported/copied onto as many platforms as Tertis, but it has never gone away either. Most Viewed Posts in July Search Terms of the Month what is rimworld [Oh my, where to begin?] rimworld odyssey worth it [Maybe… but you have to leave your base to play it] rimworld unable to reach parking spot [I am not sure…] why is it called rimworld [Why are you called Steve?] rimworld lossless scaling [Why would you want this?] rimworld on ipad [Maybe through Steam Link] rimworld skilled in everything to an unnatural degree [Did you win then?] Game Time by ManicTime and iOS EVE Online topped the list for July. I’ll get into that below. Also, WoW Classic is back… a bit. I mean, we had the pre-patch all month. And LOTRO… well… I did get to Mordor. I’ll always have that. Enshrouded The group has made some effort to get together and do a few things, but it is summer and people have things to do on the weekends. We did make some progress, including getting to the spire in the Albaneve Summits. We’re not ready to fight the dragon yet, but we should be able to mount an expedition to get the blast furnace once we’re all around. EVE Online I ended up playing a lot in New Eden, if “playing” is the right word. I didn’t go on a lot of ops… though there were plenty to go on… but I had plenty to do in finishing up the move, starting with filtering down all the stuff in my hangar. I had piled so much in there that I went over the item limit. So there was some inventory management time. Also some ship reassembly, including some Epithals, which are used to haul PI materials, because it was also time to get my PI back online, as the market had started to recover. And then I stuck an alt in an Ishtar and did Forsaken Hubs for a couple of days, just to earn some ISK. That is probably worth a post soon. Pokemon Go My focus for the month was largely around trying to advance some achievements to get to platinum level as that is going to be the biggest barrier. I knocked out a few, but I am still 10 shy and I am close to being done with the easy ones. Meanwhile, my wife is still level 47 because she still needs to walk 25km in a week… something she totally does, but she leaves her phone sitting on the desk or counter while doing so. Like I said, keep your phone in your pocket to get steps! RimWorld With the launch of the Odyssey update I grabbed a copy of that and went and played some RimWorld for a few days. It is still a fine answer to the question, “What do I do with six hours of free time on a Saturday afternoon/evening?” You can sit there for hours fiddling with your colonists and their base. It is also kind of amusing to see the start points for the different DLC paths pop up. But after a few days of dealing with the problems of my colonists, I decided to step back from it again. It is engaging but not entirely satisfying for me now. WoW Classic Oh, and stepping back from RimWorld might have coincided with Mists of Pandaria landing in WoW Classic. I got my Pandarian out of the tutorial and did some pet battles, but with the opening of the expansion I jumped right in… literally… you jump and parachute into the expansion as part of the opening. It has, however, been kind of slow going… though I remember that being the case back in the day as well. The Jade Forest is not the best zone in the expansion. We’ll see if I carry on, or if the group decided to take a panda vacation from Enshrouded for a bit. Coming Up Well, as I have mentioned a few times, it will be Blaugust 2025. Expect some posts to go along with that, starting tomorrow. At the back end of the month will be Gamescom, and Blizz is expected to announce a couple of things… like maybe the timeline for Midnight and when housing might become a thing in WoW. Fantasy Critic League will carry on, though my next title to launch isn’t until September. So I’ll be in last place for a while still. Otherwise, it will be the usual stuff. In EVE Online we might get a hint about the next expansion and we might be about due for another update in Enshrouded… though I suspect that will come closer to November. “And somebody was trying to make yet another flying car that failed to live up to our expectations. Have none of these scientists ever seen The Jetsons?” Worth the price of admission, right there. Thanks for the giggle!! LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

In total, Tenev referenced tokenization 11 times, while also mentioning Robinhood’s stock tokens on a handful of occasions. The digital assets, which offer synthetic exposure to private companies like SpaceX and OpenAI, were unveiled for European users in June, alongside company ambitions to build its own Ethereum layer-2 scaling network. During the hour-long broadcast, Tenev invoked tokenization within five minutes, a term used to describe the process of representing real-world assets using tokens on a blockchain. In some ways, the episode mirrored Facebook parent Meta’s pivot away from the metaverse in 2023, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg referenced artificial intelligence 20 times on an earnings broadcast. Tenev described tokenization as “the biggest innovation in capital markets in over a decade,” saying investors will benefit from 24/7 trading, instant settlement, and self custody. Robinhood can make “all sorts of assets” accessible for users that weren’t feasible before, he said. Robinhood’s stock price has nearly tripled this year, rising 179% year-to-date to $104 on Thursday, according to Yahoo Finance. Despite a cooldown in crypto trading revenue, the firm posted stronger-than-expected sales and profits in the second quarter. Crypto exchanges Binance and now-defunct FTX dabbled in tokenized stock trading during the pandemic-era crypto boom, but the umbrella term faded into obscurity amid regulatory heat until BlackRock CEO Larry Fink touted tokenization as “the next generation for markets” in 2022. Now, with the SEC committed to advancing tokenization frameworks under a crypto-friendly White House, Robinhood is positioning itself as a major player in the space, and one that could potentially benefit from the same regulatory tailwinds as crypto-native firms for years to come. Asked by an analyst for feedback that Robinhood is getting on tokenizing private assets, Tenev said that it’s addressed a mainstream criticism toward digital assets, namely the claim that they’re not tied to anything with "fundamental utility” and are ephemeral like memes. Aside from customers’ apparent demand for stock tokens, Tenev said the product's rollout demonstrated “the power of crypto technology and show[ed] a roadmap to what Robinhood could be if it was rebuilt from the ground up on crypto rails.” But not everyone was satisfied with Robinhood’s stock tokens, including OpenAI, which slammed the product as an unauthorized attempt to tokenize its equity. Not long after, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned firms that their tokenized offerings must comply with securities laws, and a blockchain isn’t a valid way of getting around that. Tenev told Decrypt last week that he thinks the regulator’s warning was not specific to Robinhood, and on Wednesday, he noted that “some things need to happen” regulatory-wise to unlock tokenization’s true potential, including a look at investor accreditation laws. At the end of the day, Robinhood said that it’s still in the first phase of its tokenization strategy, which involves creating a sustainable supply of stock tokens. The second phase will involve getting the tokens to trade on Bitstamp, a crypto exchange that Robinhood acquired this year. Phase three, Tenev said, will allow users to plug stock tokens into decentralized finance, or DeFi protocols. DeFi applications allow users to self-custody their assets and transact natively on blockchain networks. “We have the technical capabilities to do all of this,” he said. “It's just a question of going through the regulatory process, and we think that's basically the optimal path.” Robinhood did not immediately respond to Decrypt.

Title: Circle: The Digital Dollar’s Unlikely King
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/07/31/circle-the-digital-dollars-unlikely-king/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T17:06:57Z
Full Content:
ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. The Infrastructure Powerhouse Built on Regulation, Compliance, and Transparency. Why the Real Battle Is Just Beginning The numbers told the story before anyone understood it. Circle's IPO wasn't just big; it was a spectacle. Priced at $35, the stock rocketed to nearly $300 within weeks, setting off a Wall Street frenzy. USDC, the world's second-largest stablecoin issued by Circle, is used wherever value moves in crypto. It is embedded across protocols, blockchains, and DeFi platforms, and is becoming the connective layer between crypto and traditional finance. Circle stands as a rare asset in modern markets: a compliant, regulated, revenue-generating gateway to a financial system being rewritten in real time. Beneath the euphoria lies a paradox: Circle earns less from USDC than the partners helping distribute it. In 2024, Coinbase received $908 million, about 54 percent of Circle's total revenue. Circle retained the remaining 46 percent. That imbalance, as one-sided as it now seems, may have been the necessary price of market share. The revenue-sharing agreements weren't a misstep. They were Circle's way in: the cost of catching up, the price of market share. Circle launched USDC in 2018, entering a market where Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, already had a four-year lead and dominated liquidity, adoption, and trading pairs across exchanges. Tether operated under an offshore model and looser compliance standards. Coming from behind, Circle played a different game, turning regulation into a competitive edge and transparency into a trust-building tool for regulators and institutions. The results validated the approach: between 2018 and 2021, USDC's supply surged more than 8,300 percent, nearly doubling Tether's growth over the same period. But there's a deeper risk: its revenue model, anchored in interest income, could unravel if rates come down materially. So why are stablecoins such a big deal? In the first half of 2025 alone, stablecoins processed $8.5 trillion in transactions. They're used in 89 percent of digital asset trades, power nearly half the liquidity in DeFi protocols managing over $200 billion, and now account for 15 percent of global retail cross-border payments. When someone buys Bitcoin on Coinbase, they're trading stablecoins, not dollars. Stablecoins slash cross-border payment costs by as much as 80 percent compared to traditional bank wires. Across Argentina, Vietnam, Turkey, and Nigeria, millions are turning to USDC for everything from groceries to rent, according to Chainalysis, which ranked these countries among the top five globally for grassroots crypto adoption in 2024. As stablecoins move into the mainstream, Circle's USDC is emerging as the default bridge between traditional finance and the blockchain economy. It's more than digital cash; it's an infrastructure layer for instant, 24/7 financial settlement. USDC spans 23 blockchains, is accepted by 89 percent of major exchanges, and reaches 500 million users across more than 180 countries through wallets and apps. In 2024 alone, its circulation jumped 78 percent to $64 billion, capturing a quarter of the global stablecoin market. Since launch, it has processed over $20 trillion in transactions, bridged $850 billion between crypto and traditional finance, and moved $20 billion through Circle's Cross‑Chain Transfer Protocol. More importantly, USDC has proven its resilience under extreme stress. It survived the 2021–22 crypto winter when multiple stablecoins collapsed, maintained its peg during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis that threatened its reserve backing, and continued operating seamlessly while competitors faced regulatory scrutiny. Jamie Dimon, Wall Street's most influential banking CEO and longtime crypto skeptic, publicly acknowledged stablecoins in JPMorgan's Q2 earnings call: "We're going to be involved in both JPMorgan Depositcoin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it… The way to be cognizant is to be involved." And no stablecoin is more institutionally aligned than USDC. Circle's compliance-first strategy looks less like a hedge and more like a masterstroke. Circle's business model is deceptively simple. It earns interest on the dollars backing every USDC in circulation. With more than $60 billion worth of tokens issued, Circle holds an equal amount in reserves. About 85 percent of those reserves sit in a BlackRock-managed money market fund earning around 4 percent annually; the rest is held in cash at major banks. That interest income makes up the bulk of Circle's revenue. But the company doesn't get to keep most of it. To grow USDC's footprint, Circle signed revenue-sharing agreements with major crypto exchanges. These deals gave its partners a share of reserve income to promote and integrate USDC. The most favorable terms went to Coinbase: USDC's co-creator and largest distributor. Under the agreement, Coinbase keeps 100 percent of the interest on USDC held on its platform, which typically totals tens of billions of dollars, plus 50 percent of net reserve income from all other USDC in circulation after other partners take their share. The deal auto-renews through 2026 and could extend to 2029 if usage milestones are hit. In 2024, Coinbase earned more from USDC than Circle did. These terms made sense when market penetration was the goal—but now they leave Circle boxed in. Binance and Bybit also negotiated their own revenue-sharing deals, each securing a mid-to-high single-digit percentage of reserve income. While these cuts are smaller than Coinbase's, they still reduce Circle's overall take. In total, Circle retains only about 40 to 50 percent of net reserve income, all while bearing the full operational, compliance, and regulatory burden. And with interest rates expected to decline, the overall revenue pool is likely to shrink, tightening the squeeze just as Circle tries to scale into public markets. Circle isn't standing still. It's building new revenue streams that leverage its infrastructure: transaction fees, blockchain partnerships, and financial products with 100 percent gross margins. Blockchain partnerships monetize USDC's presence across networks. As new blockchains compete for users, hosting USDC brings instant legitimacy. Circle selectively charges integration fees for premium partners, turning network expansion into revenue. One of Circle's most effective pivots is charging fees for moving USDC between different blockchain networks. Think of it like a toll for crossing bridges between digital financial systems. Once offered for free, Circle now charges roughly 0.03 percent per transfer. With $20 billion in flows, it's become one of their fastest-growing income sources. Circle is also expanding into higher-margin financial products. Its acquisition of USYC, a digital money market fund, generates steady fee income from institutional exposure to government securities. Unlike USDC, these products carry no revenue splits. While these new revenue streams are gaining traction, Circle's long-term play is far bolder: embed USDC deep into the foundation of global finance. General payments represent a $240 trillion market where USDC's instant settlement could eliminate days-long delays and costly intermediaries. Circle envisions USDC becoming the digital backbone for everyday commerce, capturing a share of transaction fees from a market far larger than crypto trading. Cross-border payments offer the clearest near-term opportunity. Traditional wire transfers can take days, incur high fees, and pass through multiple correspondent banks. USDC can settle these transfers instantly and reduce costs by up to 80 percent. Circle's Cross-Border Payments Network is in early development, but partnerships with incumbents like FIS suggest a serious push into this space. Most ambitiously, Circle is partnering with ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, to pilot the use of USDC as collateral and settlement infrastructure for traditional financial instruments. If successful, this could dramatically accelerate settlement times, lower capital requirements for traders, and enhance market efficiency, positioning Circle to earn fees on trillions in global equity, bond, and derivatives transactions. These early initiatives show how Circle could turn its compliance-driven infrastructure into a scalable, high-margin business. Then came the regulatory watershed moment. In July 2025, the GENIUS Act swept through Congress, mandating full reserves and strict licensing for all stablecoins. Competitors scrambled to comply. Circle? It was already there—with monthly attestations, money transmitter licenses in 46 U.S. states, and years of regulatory groundwork. Overnight, its compliance burden became everyone else's nightmare—and Circle's competitive moat. Anyone can issue a stablecoin, but building trust, liquidity, and ubiquity takes years. Circle didn't just launch a token; it built the infrastructure everyone else now relies on. PayPal's PYUSD highlights the limits of closed ecosystems. Despite a massive user base, adoption has lagged due to limited utility outside its own platform. In contrast, adoption by Standard Chartered, Stripe, FIS, Visa, Mastercard, and even BlackRock reflects Circle's growing momentum. Near-zero interest rates would devastate Circle's revenue model, cutting reserve income while it surrenders 60 percent to partners. Regulatory winds could shift: a new administration might view private stablecoins as threatening dollar supremacy, or the Fed could launch its own digital currency. Most critically, if traditional finance adoption stalls, Circle's vision of embedding into global finance could remain just that: a vision. Without massive scale in traditional markets, its new revenue streams would stay subscale, leaving Circle dependent on a reserve interest model where it keeps the minority share. Now Circle is chasing the final piece of institutional legitimacy: a U.S. banking license. Its application for an FDIC charter is more than a regulatory formality; it's a strategic move to embed itself within the financial system. If approved, Circle would gain direct access to Fed payment rails, the ability to offer traditional banking services, and the trust halo of being a federally supervised institution. More importantly, it could position USDC as the safest digital dollar in circulation: government-regulated, fully reserved, and interoperable, without being state-controlled. In many ways, Circle functions like the Fed's unpaid R&D lab. Each USDC transaction is a real-time experiment in how programmable dollars might move through a modern financial system. Rather than launch a controversial FedCoin, regulators may opt to shape USDC, controlling the plumbing without owning the faucet. The application process won't be easy. Most crypto banking efforts have struggled to cross the finish line, and approval could take 18 to 24 months. But if Circle succeeds, it won't just sit on top of the financial system; it will become part of it. Circle's punishing revenue splits may reflect the cost of building foundational infrastructure. But if it executes on its trillion-dollar vision, those trade-offs could become footnotes to a much bigger success story. With regulatory tailwinds, monetization levers, and a banking charter in play, Circle is positioning for its next act. As CEO Jeremy Allaire put it, "we're still in the very early, early days of this," with stablecoins poised to scale into the trillions in circulation. The question isn't whether programmable dollars will reshape finance, but whether Circle will control the rails when they do. For investors, it's not just a fintech bet; it's a wager on who defines the future of money.

Title: Ripple CTO Explains Why XRP Ledger Lags Despite 300+ Bank Deals
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-xrp-ledger-lags-300-bank-deals/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T17:00:27Z
Full Content:
Ripple chief technology officer David “JoelKatz” Schwartz moved to explain the gap between Ripple’s oft-touted roster of bank relationships and the still-modest on-chain activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), responding at length on July 30 to a widely shared thread of questions from investor and YouTuber Andrei Jikh. In a series of posts on X, Schwartz pointed to compliance realities, institutional behavior, and product roadmap items—most notably a forthcoming “permissioned domains” model—as key reasons that institutional flows remain largely off-chain today. Jikh’s prompt captured long-standing critiques: after more than a decade and “300+ bank partnerships,” why isn’t the XRPL clearing “billions in daily on-chain volume,” why would payers choose a volatile asset like XRP over stablecoins, and—in a world saturated with fiat-linked tokens—do bridge assets still matter? He also raised questions about tokenization strategy, including why a firm such as BlackRock would select XRPL rather than operate a captive chain, and about geopolitical risk for non-US users. Schwartz’s central explanation for sluggish on-chain settlement was blunt about the constraints facing regulated entities that cannot unknowingly transact against illicit counterparties on public DEX liquidity: “Even Ripple can’t use the XRPL DEX for payments yet because we can’t be sure a terrorist won’t provide the liquidity for payment. Features like permissioned domains will address this.” The post acknowledged “it has been very slow” to shift institutional flows on chain, even as he argued that institutions are “starting to see the benefits.” Pressed by another user on whether the same counterparty-risk problem exists on other L1s, Schwartz said that, depending on how features are used, “generally decentralized exchanges on public layer 1’s don’t give you any control or knowledge of who your counterparties are.” The point was procedural rather than moral—“regulations aren’t always totally logical,” he added—underscoring why regulated payment flows have struggled to route through open liquidity. Schwartz framed “permissioned domains” as a design intended to keep the ledger’s openness while giving compliance-bound participants a venue with rule-enforced counterparties. In follow-ups, he described a structure in which “retail is welcome in the permissioned parts provided they can prove they’re not sanctioned,” and said the “net effect” should be that liquidity in these domains remains comparable to the open side because of market-making between the two. On the stablecoin question, Schwartz rejected the idea that XRP’s volatility automatically disqualifies it for payments. He argued there are use cases where volatility “isn’t a minus, or is even a plus,” and—separately—contended that a functioning bridge requires inventory: “A bridge currency only works if someone is holding it so that you can get it precisely when you need it.” He added that if users don’t know which asset they will need next, they may rationally hold the “dominant bridge” because it’s cheaper to pivot from a liquid hub asset into whatever comes next. Schwartz also addressed whether bridge assets still matter if stablecoins increasingly cover most trading pairs. He allowed that “if one stablecoin wins,” it could act as the bridge, but said he doesn’t think a single stablecoin can win because each is “only…stable relative to one particular fiat currency” and anchored to jurisdictions. That multi-stablecoin reality, he argued, leaves room for a neutral bridge to connect a “long tail” of tokenized assets. Asked why a heavyweight like BlackRock wouldn’t simply build its own chain for tokenization—especially as some brokerages do—Schwartz downplayed the importance of chain homogeneity in a world of interoperability and portability. He urged skeptics to “ask the same question about Circle—why don’t they launch USDC only on their own blockchain?” implying the obvious answer: ubiquity and liquidity come from meeting users where they are, across many networks. On geopolitics, he drew a line between XRPL, which he described as neutral infrastructure, and Ripple’s enterprise products, which are segmented by jurisdiction. “If you’re asking about XRPL, it’s not really US based,” he wrote, adding that the ledger “has never discriminated against any particular participant,” and conceding that, for Ripple’s own products, licensing realities apply and some corridors—“North Korea or Cuba any time soon”—are out of bounds. Schwartz further argued that XRP’s role within Ripple’s payments stack remains material even if much of it is not visible on public ledgers. “I don’t have the numbers in front of me,” he wrote, “but I’m pretty sure XRP’s use as a bridge in Ripple Payments dwarfs every other asset.” In a related point on XRPL design, he reminded readers that “XRP has a privileged place on the XRP Ledger.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.13.

Title: Bitcoin New Investor Dominance Rises – No Signs of Mass Profit-Taking Yet
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-new-investor-dominance-rises-no-signs-of-mass-profit-taking-yet/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T17:00:26Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin’s new investor dominance is gaining momentum just as the asset consolidates in a tight range, setting the stage for a major breakout. After more than two weeks of sideways movement between $115,000 and $120,000, BTC continues to trade within this well-defined range—building pressure that typically precedes a sharp move. Data from CryptoQuant highlights a crucial dynamic: the comparison between demand and supply from new versus old investors. The current new investor dominance sits at 30%, only half of the “overheated” range of 60–70% seen during euphoric phases, but the trend is clearly climbing. This means new liquidity is entering the market steadily, while old holders are still distributing at a manageable pace. The supply of long-term holders is absorbing this growing young demand without disrupting the price structure. This healthy balance suggests that the market is still in a stable late bull phase, with no signs of mass profit-taking or capitulation from seasoned investors. With Bitcoin maintaining a bullish structure and demand from fresh entrants rising, the coming days will be critical. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared detailed insights into Bitcoin’s market structure, focusing on the balance between new and old investor behavior. According to Adler, previous peaks in new investor dominance—64% in March 2024 and 72% in December 2024—aligned precisely with local BTC price tops. At those points, new liquidity began to wane, and experienced holders ramped up profit-taking. Currently, new investor dominance stands at 30%, which is still far from those overheated extremes. However, the trend is upward. The purple fill on the chart, which reflects cumulative activity from younger coins, has been climbing steadily since July 2024. This indicates that a fresh wave of buyers continues to enter the market, while selling pressure from old hands remains limited. This dynamic creates room for further bullish continuation before the typical euphoria zone—above 60–70% dominance—takes hold. Old holders are still distributing coins, but only moderately. A coefficient of 0.3 means that three-year-old coins are absorbing demand without triggering major volatility. This balance suggests that the market remains structurally sound. Bitcoin is currently trading at $118,413, consolidating in a narrow range between $115,724 and $122,077, as seen in the 8-hour chart. This sideways movement has persisted for over two weeks, indicating indecision in the market. The key support sits at $115,724, which has been tested multiple times but held firmly, while the $122,077 level acts as immediate resistance after a strong rejection earlier in July. The price remains above the 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages, which now align in bullish order—another sign that the underlying trend is still intact despite short-term consolidation. Volume remains relatively low, suggesting that neither bulls nor bears are aggressively positioning at the moment. However, such tight ranges often precede large directional moves. If bulls manage to break above the $122K resistance with strong volume, it could trigger a continuation toward new highs. On the other hand, a breakdown below the $115.7K support would expose downside risk. Potentially leading to a retest of the 100-period moving average around $114,490 or even the 200-period average near $110,188.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Michael McDonald, Shirley Zhao and Filipe Pacheco Jul 30, 2025, (Bloomberg) –Panama’s comptroller general asked its Supreme Court to review the government’s contract extension with CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.’s local ports unit, potentially throwing a new wrench into the conglomerate’s controversial deal to sell its global terminals business. Panamanian official Anel Flores said he asked the court to find unconstitutional a 2021 extension for Panama Ports Co.’s contract to operate two ports along the Panama Canal and declare it null and void. “The contract was bad, one-sided and abusive, against the interests of the country,” he told a briefing in Panama City, adding that the ports belong to the country and should not be negotiated over by others. Panama Ports and CK Hutchison didn’t respond to requests for comment. The development risks further complicating a transaction that’s become a high-profile tussle between the US and China. CK Hutchison shares fell 2.2% in Hong Kong trading on Thursday, dropping the most in over a month. “Panama’s legal challenge to CK Hutchison’s port concession could introduce material uncertainty and elevates the risk of delays, potentially derailing the deal or triggering a renegotiation at a lower valuation,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong said. The Panama terminals are at the center of the geopolitically delicate deal for the 43 ports owned by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison. A buyer consortium backed by BlackRock Inc. is seeking to acquire the business, with the American asset manager taking control of Panama Ports. “What is Panama’s business is that the ports are ours, they belong to the republic of Panama,” Flores told the briefing. “I don’t think it’s right that, at other latitudes, other people are negotiating the future using property that belongs to Panama.” Read More: How Li Ka-shing Landed in the Middle of US-China Tiff: QuickTake Still, some analysts assessed that Panama’s objection would not be a major roadblock for CK Hutchison’s deal, given that other ports in the country are operated by foreign entities. The development “appears a small-ish road bump to completing the global terminal deal,” said David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors. “There are three remaining Panamanian ports, all operated by foreigners, none of which has raised the ire of the comptroller,” he said, “implying there exist benchmark contracts that can be struck for these two ports.” Flores said in April that an audit by his office found that Panama Ports had failed to get proper approvals for its contract extension. Tax breaks under the contract have also cost the Central American nation $1.3 billion, as a series of tax-exempt shell companies operating on Panama Ports’s grounds helped the firm lower the share of profits it paid the government, he told a press conference at the time. Outside of Panama, CK Hutchison and the buyer consortium have been trying to find a solution for the transaction to move forward. While the deal has been hailed by US President Donald Trump as returning the canal to American influence, it’s been furiously opposed by Beijing, which considers BlackRock a proxy for American influence. China has also separately cautioned that antitrust reviews shouldn’t be bypassed, so as to prevent an agreement from being rushed into. “The complexity shows exactly how ports have become assets with larger geopolitical risks and why CK Hutchison wants to reduce its related business,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. CK Hutchison said this week that it may invite an unnamed “major strategic investor” from China to join the consortium, a move that’s aimed at appeasing China. State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. has been negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the group, Bloomberg News reported. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum is once again approaching critical levels after a stretch of volatile yet bullish price action. Following a sharp rebound from yesterday’s low of around $3,675, ETH is now trading above the $3,800 mark, regaining momentum as traders eye a decisive move. While short-term volatility remains, the overall structure favors continuation—provided ETH can break cleanly above the $4,000 resistance level. This threshold now stands as the key barrier between consolidation and a potential rally toward new highs. A confirmed breakout would likely ignite fresh bullish momentum across the broader altcoin market. Until then, price remains trapped in a narrowing range, testing both trader patience and liquidity depth. Meanwhile, on-chain data supports the bullish case. According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham, whales have ramped up their accumulation, with large addresses steadily adding to their ETH holdings in recent days. This ongoing accumulation trend reflects growing conviction among high-cap players and adds weight to the possibility of further upside in the months ahead. Ethereum’s bullish narrative gained further momentum this week after Arkham disclosed a massive on-chain transaction involving a major institutional player. A fresh wallet address—0xdf0A67Ded855F8ea4baB6399690883243c0e2EF3—just received $153 million worth of ETH, purchased directly through Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter (OTC) desk. The scale and nature of this transaction suggest growing institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential. This isn’t just another whale move. The fact that the ETH was funneled into a new wallet from a regulated OTC provider underscores the strategic accumulation taking place behind the scenes. As traditional finance increasingly integrates with crypto, Ethereum’s utility, programmability, and future role in tokenized finance are making it a high-conviction play among institutional allocators. This heavy buy comes after a prolonged period of weakness. Earlier this year, ETH suffered persistent selling pressure, with price action sliding lower for months. Retail interest faded, and sentiment turned bearish. But while the public panicked, sophisticated players appear to have taken the other side of the trade—accumulating quietly during the downturn. Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade in a tight range just below the key resistance level of $3,860.80, as shown in the 4-hour chart. Despite recent price volatility, ETH has remained above its 50- and 100-period moving averages, currently near $3,756 and $3,629, respectively. This suggests that bullish momentum is still intact in the short term. Volume has picked up slightly, indicating rising interest from traders as ETH tests this critical horizontal resistance. The price has failed to close decisively above this level multiple times since July 25, highlighting its significance. However, the consistent higher lows forming over the past week point to building buying pressure beneath the surface. A confirmed breakout above $3,860.80 could open the door for a push toward the psychological $4,000 level and beyond. Conversely, failure to break resistance may lead to another retest of the 100-period moving average or even the $3,700 support zone.

Title: How to invest like you’re uber rich (even if you’re not!) (Paul Quickenden)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/29028/how-to-invest-like-youre-uber-rich-even-if-youre-not
Time Published: 2025-07-31T12:22:55Z
Full Content:
Let’s be honest - ‘Invest like the uber rich’ sounds like classic headliner clickbait. But here’s the thing… in a tokenised world, that headline is actually starting to hold up because the old barriers to high-value, long-horizon investing are crumbling fast and blockchain is the earthquake shaking the establishment's foundations. There’s always been a bit of mystery around how the global elite build and then keep their wealth. According to recent research reported on by Newsroom, the pattern is actually quite simple, i.e. “a distinctive focus on long-term thinking and alternative assets…” We’re not talking about chasing IPOs or crypto hype cycles here. This is intergenerational capital thinking around assets that hold value over decades and ignoring short-term volatility in favour of upside over time. Traditionally, that’s meant real estate, private equity and infrastructure - assets that are expensive to access and tough to liquidate. But all that’s changing… Fig 1: Multiple sources are now saying that high net worth individuals are getting into alternative investments in a proportional, long term manner (source): Crypto might not seem like a traditional ‘family office’ asset, but it ticks both boxes rich families are drawn to. It's alternative and when viewed through a long-term lens - its reward profile gets interesting. Volatility is still a part of the crypto story, but we’re seeing it flatten as the asset class matures - the highs aren’t quite as high and the crashes are not quite as deep. What’s more, as more infrastructure is built and more institutional capital enters, the swings are becoming less violent. That doesn’t mean crypto is risk-free - nothing is - but it is becoming something far more compelling: an alternative investment class with global reach, deepening liquidity and strong long-term upside for those with patience and a defined strategy. In that sense, it’s already mirroring the kind of thinking that the uber wealthy have leaned on for decades. Traditionally, the kinds of assets favoured by ultra-wealthy investors have been large, expensive and illiquid. Think commercial real estate, infrastructure projects, private equity and even fine art. These aren’t investments you can casually buy into with a few thousand dollars and even when you could, they usually come with long lock-up periods and little flexibility to exit. Enter tokenisation and it’s a genuine game changer… Tokenisation changes that by using blockchain technology to break these big-ticket assets into smaller, digital units - or fractionalising into ‘tokens’ - that can be bought and sold individually. It’s a bit like owning shares in a company, but instead, you own a fractional slice of a building, a venture fund or any other real-world asset. The key difference is that these tokens exist on a blockchain ledger, meaning ownership is secure, transparent and (potentially) tradeable 24/7. This is a big deal, because traditionally these types of assets have been the exclusive domain of the rich and powerful. A case in point is a tokenised villa in Dubai which sold in under 5 minutes (see here). Tokenisation enables everyday investors to own a slice of a premium commercial property without needing millions upfront, waiting decades to cash out or going through the typical real estate grind. This is the future of investing, and it looks a lot more inclusive than the past. And it’s not just real estate. BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have both tokenised Money Market Funds, Goldman Sachs has issued a 2 year digital bond, while it is common to tokenise gold and carbon credits. Fig 2: A deep dive into the benefits of tokenisation. Benefits Description Example Faster Transaction Settlement Tokenisation enables near-instant, 24/7 settlement instead of traditional 2 or more days Goldman Sachs issued a €100M digital bond with same-day settlement (T+0) using blockchain Increased Liquidity By fractionalising traditionally illiquid assets, tokenisation opens markets to more investors and enables easier trading. Tokenising private equity or bonds lets investors buy small shares, bringing in more liquidity and opening up market access Operational Efficiency & Cost Savings Embedded smart contracts enable automatic execution of payments, compliance, and other conditions, enabling new business models. Automating interest calculations in tokenised corporate bonds streamlines servicing and compliance.Smart contracts for carbon credit tokens automate trading with transparent, enforceable rules Enhanced Security & Transparency Immutable blockchain ledgers provide auditable, tamper-proof ownership records; tokenisation also replaces sensitive data with secure tokens. JPMorgan’s JPM Coin improves payment security and settlement transparency on a permissioned blockchain Democratisation of Access Lower minimum investments and seamless global participation bring asset classes traditionally reserved for elites to wider audiences. Fractional tokens allow smaller investors to access high-value assets like art, real estate, and private funds Global Reach & 24/7 Markets Tokenised assets can be traded cross-border, anytime, breaking time zones and geographic barriers inherent in traditional finance. Swiss Digital Exchange supports tokenised securities trading round-the-clock with global investor participation Tokenisation is more than just a trend; it’s a fundamental shift in financial infrastructure. By enabling fractional ownership and recording it on-chain, tokenised assets bring transparency and auditability to markets that were once closed off to all but the wealthiest. They also inject liquidity into asset classes that have traditionally been locked up for years. Together with blockchain rails and crypto-based value transfer, this technology is building a new model of wealth creation - one that doesn’t care how big your starting balance is, only that you’re ready to play the long game.

Title: Miami Showband massacre 50 years on: ‘The trauma lasts for ever’ – Stephen Travers
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/2025/07/31/miami-showband-massacre-50-years-on-the-trauma-lasts-for-ever-stephen-travers/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T11:35:41Z
Full Content:
The Miami Showband’s days were numbered. The band had formed in 1962, playing its first gig in Portmarnock, at the Palm Beach Hotel, which inspired the group’s original name, the Miami Showband. Thirteen years, seven Irish chart-topping singles and several line-up changes later, lead singer Fran O’Toole and guitarist Tony Geraghty had both asked bass player Stephen Travers, who had only joined the band two months earlier, if he would like to play in their separate musical projects. In the meantime it was business as usual. After big gigs in Salthill, Co Galway, on Monday and Tuesday, the band met up at what is now the Regency Hotel near Dublin Airport and travelled north, over the Border, to play the Castle Ballroom in Banbridge on Wednesday, July 30th, 1975. A midweek gig in a midsized town was bread and butter for the Miami but a lifeline for locals who wanted to lose themselves in music and dancing and forget the Troubles. When the band reached Banbridge, Stephen and Fran, who had a sweet tooth, went to buy sweets. Stephen was unnerved when he saw skinheads running towards them, but one just wanted Fran’s autograph on his plaster cast. The band members never drank before a gig so they probably wouldn’t even have noticed the pub next door to the ballroom, much less been aware of its tragic Troubles story. The Signpost Inn had been owned by Jack McCabe, a past pupil of Dublin’s prestigious Blackrock College, who had abandoned a law career to take over the family business on the death of his father. On July 12th, 1972, he was shot dead in his other pub in Portadown. The gig didn’t start till after 11pm, so it was 2am by the time the band set off home. Stephen sat up front with his bandmate Brian McCoy, who was driving, while Fran, Des Lee and Tony Geraghty played cards in the back. At about 2.30am, halfway between Banbridge and Newry, the minibus was flagged down by an army patrol. The musicians were lined up outside and asked for their names and addresses. The roadblock was fake, however, although at least five of the soldiers there were serving or former UDR members. They were also loyalist paramilitaries. As two of them, Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville, planted a bomb on the bus, it exploded prematurely, killing them instantly. The explosion blew the musicians into a field, where four were hunted down. Fran was shot 22 times, mostly in the face, Brian nine times and Tony four times. Stephen was hit; Des hid in the long grass, playing dead, and was not hurt. Stephen counted his fingers. As a musician, that was important. Next, he clicked his platform heels. He still had his legs. He was disorientated, however. “I didn’t know I was shot. I couldn’t figure out why my stomach was so distended. There was this terrible silence. The ditch was still on fire. I was crawling among the bodies, talking to them. I wouldn’t accept that they were dead. “I couldn’t stand up. I’d get up and fall down. For the hour or so I was there I was crawling around on my stomach. I found it difficult to breathe. I didn’t know that after the dumdum exploded inside me, part of it had travelled up after entering just above my right hip and went through my left lung which had collapsed. You often see someone after running a marathon sort of bending down and trying to get their breathing right. I tried that. I crawled over to the ditch and there was a low branch and I tried to lean over it, but no matter what I did I couldn’t get it right. I put it down to one of the soldiers having punched me in the kidneys.” James Blundell, the surgeon at Newry’s Daisy Hill Hospital who saved Stephen’s life, told him the anaesthetist had to compress his aorta to keep him alive until he received a blood transfusion. The Rev William McCrea, a Free Presbyterian minister and later a Democratic Unionist Party MP, conducted a UVF paramilitary funeral for Boyle and Somerville. (Decades later, he would also officiate at the funeral of Loyalist Volunteer Force leader Billy Wright.) [ ‘I was glad to see that it did come out that it was collusion’Opens in new window ] UDR sergeant James Roderick Shane McDowell and lance corporal Thomas Raymond Crozier were convicted in 1976 of the murders. Imposing the longest life sentences in Northern Ireland history, the judge said he would have imposed the death penalty, had it not been recently abolished. Former UDR soldier John James Somerville, Wesley’s brother, was also convicted of the murders, in 1981. Stephen spent months recovering. The Miami reformed, having replaced Fran, Tony and Brian, but it felt macabre. “We became photo ops.” He left the following summer. As part of a criminal injuries case, Stephen had to see a psychiatrist. “He said, ‘I don’t like the way you’re handling this.’ I said, ‘Here’s the bottom line: I went to a gig, on the way home the lads were killed, I was shot, I survived, I’m fine.’ There was no such thing as counselling back then. Only sissies complained about their feelings.” The psychiatrist told him his response wasn’t normal. “He said, ‘I must warn you, in six months or 10 years the wall might fall on you.’” Stephen reflects with the benefit of hindsight and education. “I stepped back for 30 years, said I’m not going to talk or think about it, but that did awful damage.” He felt that as a musician in Ireland he could never escape his past, so he and his wife moved to London in 1983. One night he was having a drink in an Irish pub when the owner asked everyone for a business idea. Stephen saw a copy of The Irish Post and said that it needed competition. Within months, the Irish Advertiser was launched, with him as editor. The paper became The Irish in Britain News. Stephen cofounded another newspaper, The Irish World, in 1987. Three years later, I got my first job on The Irish World, moving to The Irish in Britain News, the two papers Stephen had helped to found, before spending nine years with The Irish Post, where Stephen wrote for me about music. I was in Harry’s Bar in Banbridge in the mid-1990s when a former Banbridge Academy classmate said loudly, “I hear you’re working for a Provo paper.” There is a certain type of unionist for whom anything Irish – be it the language, traditional music, the GAA or even a newspaper – is a republican front and a personal affront. Stephen and his family moved home in 1998. In 2000, he testified at Justice Henry Barron’s official inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Margaret Urwin, secretary of Justice for the Forgotten, a campaign group for its victims and survivors, told him that the Miami Showband massacre was not an isolated attack but one of many perpetrated by the Glenanne gang. In December 2011, the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) report on the Miami killings raised “disturbing questions about collusive and corrupt behaviour”. It confirmed Mid-Ulster UVF leader Robin Jackson’s involvement and linked him to RUC special branch. The report also revealed that on June 11th, 1975, more than a month prior to the killings, Jackson, his brother-in-law Samuel Fulton Neill and Thomas Crozier had been arrested for possessing four shotguns near Banbridge, but no charges were brought. Neill’s car was reportedly used in the Miami ambush, which took place just over a mile from Donaghmore, where Jackson grew up. Neill was shot dead in Portadown on January 25th, 1976, allegedly by Jackson for informing. Stephen said at the time, “We believe the only conclusion possible arising from the HET report is that one of the most prolific loyalist murderers of the conflict was an RUC special branch agent and was involved in the Miami Showband attack.” As he explained to me, “People said you now have the smoking gun of the culpability of the British State.” An independent international inquiry, chaired by Douglass Cassel of the Law School of the University of Notre Dame, concluded that there was “credible evidence that the principal perpetrator [of the Miami attack] was alleged RUC special branch agent Robin Jackson”. On May 19th, 1976, two of Jackson’s fingerprints were discovered on a silencer home-made for a Luger pistol. The silencer and Luger were found in a police raid on former B Special Ted Sinclair’s farm. The exhibit was mistakenly labelled, indicating that Jackson’s prints had been found on insulating tape wrapped around the silencer. Jackson, arrested on May 31st, denied having been at Sinclair’s farm but admitted knowing him through the Portadown Loyalist Club. When shown the Luger, silencer and magazine (but not the tape), Jackson denied having handled them. Asked to explain why his fingerprints might be on either pistol or silencer, Jackson said he had given Sinclair adhesive tape in the club. Although ballistic testing had linked the Luger (for which the silencer had been made) to the Miami attack, Jackson was never questioned about the killings, and the Miami inquiry team was never informed. Jackson claimed that one week before his arrest, two high-ranking RUC officers had told him his fingerprints had been found on the tape and that “I should clear as there was a wee job up the country that I would be done for and there was no way out of it for me.” Despite a detective inspector’s recommendation, the officers faced no disciplinary action. Jackson was only prosecuted for possession of the silencer. The trial judge, Mr Justice Murray, acquitted him, saying, “I find that the accused somehow touched the silencer, but the Crown evidence has left me completely in the dark as to whether he did that wittingly or unwittingly, willingly or unwillingly.” Former RUC officer and convicted loyalist paramilitary John Weir told the Barron Inquiry that Jackson had co-ordinated the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Justice Barron concluded that Weir’s “evidence overall is credible”. Weir claimed Jackson had shot dead Catholic chemist William Strathearn in Ahoghill, Co Antrim, in 1977. Weir and RUC colleague Billy McCaughey were convicted of the murder but both named Jackson and another loyalist, RJ Kerr, as the killers. Jackson was never questioned for “reasons of operational strategy”, according to an RUC detective. Weir suggested that “Jackson was untouchable because he was an RUC special branch agent”. Weir had offered to testify against Jackson and Kerr if the murder charge against him was withdrawn. The prosecutor rejected this offer, saying that “Kerr and Jackson have not been interviewed by the police because the police state [that] they are virtually immune to interrogation and the common police consensus is that to arrest and interview either man is a waste of time. Both men are known to police to be very active and notorious UVF murderers.” Jackson was not unbreakable; he was untouchable. [ From the archive: Claim that hundreds of deaths in North happened due to collusionOpens in new window ] Mr Justice Barron was highly critical of the RUC. In 2006, a Dáil committee concluded that some loyalists, notably Robin Jackson, “were reliably said to have had relationships with British intelligence and/or RUC special branch and exchanges of information took place”. The Irish News reported in January 2020 that British ministry of defence documents linked SAS-trained undercover officer Captain Robert Nairac to the atrocity. Nairac was abducted and killed by the IRA in 1977 and his body has never been found. The papers were disclosed to solicitor Michael Flanigan, who represented Fran O’Toole’s widow, Valerie Andersen, in her legal action against the MoD and PSNI chief constable. It is understood the redacted documents contained suggestions that Nairac obtained equipment and uniforms for the killers. The file also claimed that he was responsible for planning and executing the attack. [ Who was Robert Nairac and what happened to him?Opens in new window ] A UVF handkerchief decorated with handstitched paramilitary figures and mottos was found among Nairac’s possessions. It is displayed in his regiment’s museum in London. The Miami victims’ families and survivors took a civil action against the police and the British ministry of defence. A settlement was only reached in December 2021, exactly 10 years after the HET report’s damning findings. They received £1.5 million to settle claims of collusion without any admission of liability. Stephen received the largest settlement, £425,000. “It’s all very well to say they settled without admission of liability, but they don’t pay you for annoying them. At the beginning they laughed at us, said we didn’t have a case. The PSNI and MoD put up every barrier, the three Ds: delay, deny and, ultimately, death.” That at least five UDR men were involved is only the tip of the iceberg for him. He dismisses the notion of rogue elements in the security forces and believes collusion was systemic. “Far more sinister people were involved. So-called experts concentrate on individuals but that is just very clever deflection. It was policy from the very top. Some of the bravest men I met were in the RUC. There was a point in the chain of command at which good reports just disappeared.” Almost 50 years have passed since the atrocity. How much of his life has he spent managing its repercussions? Should he prioritise his mental health over his feeling of responsibility to pursue justice? In 2005, Stephen’s friend Michael Gallagher, who lost his son Aiden in the 1998 Real IRA Omagh bombing, asked him to take part in an anti-radicalisation project at Warrington Peace Centre, set up in memory of two children, Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball, murdered by the IRA. He was asked to bring an object that related to his trauma. He brought Tony Geraghty’s guitar strings. He listened to a British soldier who had been abused as a child and suffered from alcoholism. “I felt I could help this man by telling him how I had coped, but I was in denial. When it came to my turn, I introduced myself, but when I went to take out the guitar strings, 30 years after the psychiatrist predicted it, the wall fell on me. I wasn’t in Warrington, I was in the field, I could hear all the screaming, the obscenities, the gunfire, the terror all around. “The soldier that I had been feeling sorry for had his arm around me and was telling me this is okay, it happens. This was the first time that I had shed a tear over the incident. I was ashamed that I had shown my feelings.” Stephen describes his post-traumatic stress thus: “It’s like when a TV producer is telling people which monitor to look at. For me it’s like there are two monitors. One is normality, which I’m focused on most of the time, but there is another big monitor and I’m drawn to that sometimes, and that is what happened on July 31st. When we went back on the road, sometimes I heard the fans screaming and thought it was something else.” When Stephen’s father served in the British army, he contracted malaria. It resurfaced from time to time over the years, just like Stephen’s trauma. [ Why I wrote Dirty Linen: recording the toll the Troubles took on my parish, the long tail of traumaOpens in new window ] “My father is the man I wish I could be,” Stephen says. “I once asked him what is the greatest achievement a person could have, and he said peace of mind. I didn’t understand then, but I understand now. “It helps you to manage it better, but it doesn’t ease it. No one back then ever mentioned PTSD. I’d never heard of enduring personality change. It was first used for people who had been in concentration camps. Having had that explained, I now know how difficult it was for me to fit into my old world but also how difficult it was for my wife to deal with me. “I have been in the incident for 47 years. It doesn’t happen that they take out the bullets and sew you up, and it is gone. The trauma lasts for ever.” Stephen helped set up a victims’ support group, the Truth and Reconciliation Platform. “I think the best way to speak up is to talk about your own experience. We wanted to get people from both communities to tell their stories. It has been a great education, but it came with a price.” Is it good for him, though? I am conscious of the irony. I am interviewing him about his trauma. “It’s essential,” he replies. “I certainly don’t have peace of mind but I would have less if I didn’t process the trauma by using it to help others. I think I’m stuck with that for the rest of my life and all I ever wanted to be was a bass player.” What good does it do? “An immense amount. I heard a woman on a radio show, coming back on the day after she spoke about her husband’s murder: ‘Yesterday I was nobody and my husband was nobody but today I am somebody and my husband is somebody.’” In 2005, to mark the 30th anniversary, Dana and Dickie Rock sang at an interdenominational service in Dublin’s Pro Cathedral. Brendan Bowyer headlined a memorial concert in Vicar Street. Another service was held in Portadown, with 15 marching bands, to commemorate two of the killers. In 2015, The Miami played their final gig at the Linenfields Festival in Lenaderg. The month before, 200 people had gathered at the ambush site to lay a wreath on the 40th anniversary. In Dublin, Stephen attended a ceremony at the memorial in Parnell Square. In 2019, Netflix released the Emmy-nominated documentary ReMastered: The Miami Showband Massacre. Yet in Banbridge, where Fran O’Toole, Brian McCoy and Tony Geraghty played just before they were murdered, there is nothing to acknowledge what happened. The Castle Ballroom is now a bingo hall. I am struck by the parallels between two of the UK’s most notorious serial killers in the 1970s. Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, born in 1948, murdered 13 women and attempted to murder seven others between 1975 and 1980. Most of his victims were sex workers, whose low standing in the eyes of the public and particularly the police was believed to be a factor in the failure to apprehend the killer sooner. He was given 20 life sentences, converted in 2010 to a whole life order. He died in prison in 2020. Robin Jackson, the Jackal, was born two years before Sutcliffe, and his first murder was two years before Sutcliffe’s too. They were both HGV drivers, exploiting this to prey over a wide area. The low standing of Catholics in the North, particularly in the eyes of many in the British security forces, who perceived them as pawns in the war against the IRA, is the likeliest reason why he was never convicted of any of the 50 or so murders attributed to him. He died at his home in Donaghcloney in 1998. This is an extract from Dirty Linen: The Troubles in My Home Place by Martin Doyle, published by Merrion Press in 2023 and in paperback in 2024.

Title: ‘Nothing Stops This Train’—Fed Dollar Crisis Predicted To Trigger ‘Critical’ Bitcoin Price Shock

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 07/31 update below. This post was originally published on July 30 Bitcoin and crypto prices have soared this year, with the combined crypto market topping $4 trillion amid a Satoshi Nakamoto-era bombshell. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price, up almost double from this time last year, hit an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin earlier this month and is braced for an Elon Musk shock after his rocket company SpaceX set alarm bells ringing. Now, as traders bet on a new “infinite money glitch," legendary billionaire Ray Dalio has recommended a 15% bitcoin or gold portfolio allocation, warning the Federal Reserve has been caught up in debt “doom loop" and that the dollar is past the “point of no return.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “We are at the at the point of no return because we’ll be having more debt,” Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said on The Master Investor Podcast and calling the situation in the U.S., the U.K. and other countries a “doom loop.” "How do you pay all this debt and all this debt service plus everything else? The only way to do that is for the government to create debt and borrow that money to pay and the central bank printing the money." U.S. debt has skyrocketed in recent years following huge government spending through Covid-era lockdowns, with interest rates that were rapidly hiked to rein in inflation adding to the cost of servicing the ballooning $37 trillion U.S. debt pile. 07/30 update: The Federal Reserve has left interest rates on hold, as the market had expected it would do, though governor Christopher Waller and Fed vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman voted for a cut, the largest number of dissenting votes by Fed officials in just over three decades. “If we cut rates too soon, maybe we didn’t finish the job with inflation. History is dotted with examples of that,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said during a press conference. “If you cut too late, then maybe you’re doing unnecessary damage to the labor market.” Earlier, data showed the U.S. economy grew at a stronger-than-expected pace in the second quarter as a growing trade balance and renewed consumer optimism propelled GDP to 3% for the three months from April through to the end of June. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market have climbed following the Fed’s interest rate decision, with one crypto company executive dismissing interest rate-led market swings as noise. “Institutions are in a race, for some it’s existential, for relevance in the next-gen financial internet,” Johnny Garcia, managing director of institutional growth and capital markets at VeChain, said in emailed comments, adding the "chatter and excitement around the direction of Fed rates is centrally focused on looking for buoy to send crypto prices higher–not about fundamental adoption.” Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have exploded onto Wall Street and into company’s treasuries in recent years, with companies led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy and bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) sucking up around 2.5 million of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist. “Nothing is stopping this train; least of all short-term one-off market-based factors such as the U.S. Federal funds rate," Garcia said. "When markets take into consideration the effect of central bank lending rates, it’s through the following perspective lens: current state and the direction of financial conditions and secondly expected economic activity as a result.” Tesla billionaire Elon Musk hit the campaign trail for U.S. president Donald Trump last year, issuing doomsday warnings over the spiraling U.S. debt pile and this year falling out with Trump over his failure to rein in spending. Musk called the dollar “hopeless" earlier this month, posting to his social media platform X that his new America Party would use bitcoin over so-called fiat currency. Dalio went on to advise investors to allocate at least 15% of their portfolios to gold or bitcoin, going far beyond the 2% bitcoin allocation recommended by BlackRock, which has found phenomenal success with its $85 billion spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). “[If] you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or bitcoin,” Dalio said, with his comments cheered by those in the bitcoin and crypto world. “The man has a point,” the X account of crypto asset manager Bitwise posted alongside a chart of U.S. debt shown soaring to around $35 trillion. “Dalio is merely suggesting putting a small portion of your deposit into time-tested assets, just like major funds do,” Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, said in emailed comments. “15% of a portfolio is a rather small share—after all, the remaining 85% can be invested however you like. Both gold and bitcoin are considered safe-haven assets in times of high inflation. Gold needs no introduction as it’s a historically protected asset. And bitcoin is often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ especially given the way regulation is evolving and how banks and governments plan to use it." Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious Meanwhile, bitcoin price and crypto analysts are predicting this is "critical" time for the market as investors increasingly pour cash into crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Bitcoin could quickly reclaim $120,000 and push into price discovery,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments. "The timing is critical. Spot bitcoin ETFs, and now ethereum ETFs, which have seen over $5 billion in flows in the past month and outpaced bitcoin on several days, continue to absorb institutional demand. With regulatory clarity taking shape and a coordinated federal stance now emerging, institutional adoption may accelerate meaningfully.” Mena added he believes the bitcoin price could soar be catapulted as high as $150,000 per bitcoin within the next couple of months if the Trump administration makes a “strong declaration around the strategic bitcoin reserve” Trump ordered the creation of in March.

Title: Trump-Appointed Group Calls For Easier Crypto Regulations From Federal Authorities

A task force established by President Donald Trump has issued a comprehensive crypto report advocating for clearer regulations governing digital asset markets. Released on Wednesday, the report calls on federal regulators to utilize their existing authority to create more definitive rules surrounding the trading of digital assets, thereby facilitating the adoption of innovative financial products. According to Bloomberg, the White House described the report as an essential step toward positioning the United States at the forefront of the blockchain revolution. “By implementing these recommendations, policymakers can usher in the Golden Age of Crypto,” officials stated in a fact sheet accompanying the report from the Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Formed through an executive order signed by Trump in January, the task force has proposed a variety of policy measures aimed at addressing the complexities of the digital asset landscape. Among its key recommendations is the urgent passage of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which seeks to eliminate regulatory gaps by granting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) authority to oversee spot markets for non-security digital assets. The report also emphasizes the need to embrace decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies as a vital component of the evolving financial ecosystem. The report also urges both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC to act swiftly, providing clarity on critical issues such as registration, custody, trading, and recordkeeping to enable federal-level trading of digital assets. These recommendations come on the heels of Trump’s recent signing of a congressional bill called the GENIUS Act, aimed at regulating stablecoins, marking a significant victory for the cryptocurrency industry. This new law establishes rules for US dollar-backed stablecoins, which proponents believe will pave the way for broader integration of digital assets into the financial system. The White House has indicated that additional details about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be forthcoming. This reserve is expected to consist of approximately 198,000 Bitcoin that the government has seized from criminal cases and other proceedings. An executive order issued earlier this year mandated that the Treasury Department retain these Bitcoin holdings, with directives to explore budget-neutral methods for acquiring more. The report also addresses other crucial issues, including the need for clarity on Bank Secrecy Act obligations to strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. On tax policy, it recommends that Congress classify digital assets as a new category subjected to modified tax rules applicable to securities or commodities. Furthermore, it calls for legislation to extend wash sale rules to digital assets, preventing investors from claiming tax losses on securities if they repurchase similar assets within a designated timeframe.

Title: JPMorgan, Coinbase Forge Historic Pact For Direct Bank-Crypto Wallet Integration By 2026

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. JPMorgan Chase and crypto exchange Coinbase have announced a new partnership on Wednesday that marks a pivotal shift in the relationship between traditional finance and digital assets. As the crypto industry experiences a bullish resurgence, fueled by a more favorable regulatory environment in the United States, major financial institutions are reassessing their earlier skepticism toward digital currencies and are now eager to explore the opportunities within this sector. The recent passage of key legislation—the GENIUS Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and anti-Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) bills—through Congress has encouraged more banks and firms to consider integrating digital assets into their operations. This renewed interest comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market has reached an impressive valuation of approximately $4 trillion, with expectations for continued growth as regulatory clarity emerges in major markets. Starting in 2026, JPMorgan customers will be able to fund their Coinbase wallets using Chase credit cards, according to Reuters, therefore facilitating easier access to cryptocurrency purchases. The partnership also allows Chase customers to redeem credit card reward points for Circle’s USDC stablecoin. This feature, alongside the ability to link bank accounts directly to Coinbase for funding crypto purchases, reflects the increasing integration of digital assets into everyday financial transactions. Stablecoins, which are designed to minimize price volatility, are positioned as essential tools for facilitating seamless transactions in both trading and payments. They are now under a new regulatory framework established by the GENIUS Act, which was signed by President Donald Trump. Market analysts have noted that the adoption of cryptocurrencies is set to accelerate in light of the recent legislative changes. BCA Research highlighted that companies within the crypto ecosystem are well-positioned to benefit from this growth, suggesting that increased adoption will lead to price appreciation for digital assets. Coinbase’s stock, COIN, has responded positively to the partnership news, rising by 6% in Wednesday’s trading session, closing the day at $377 and reflecting a broader trend in the company’s performance. With shares up around 50% this year, Coinbase has achieved a market capitalization of approximately $95 billion, further solidifying its role as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. Reuters highlighted that the crypto exchange’s recent inclusion in the S&P 500 index underscores its growing significance and acceptance in the mainstream financial world. Other financial institutions are also taking steps to engage with the crypto market. Earlier this month, PNC Bank announced its collaboration with Coinbase to offer cryptocurrency trading to its customers, indicating that the interest in digital assets is not limited to JPMorgan alone. Citibank, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America are among the largest US banks joining this growing trend, in which cryptocurrencies are expected to benefit tremendously.

Title: Chainlink Acknowledged By The White House As Key Player In Crypto Infrastructure

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The White House has officially recognized Chainlink (LINK) as an essential component of the digital asset ecosystem. This acknowledgment comes from the recently published Digital Asset Report, which emphasizes the importance of decentralized oracles in the functioning of stablecoins and tokenized assets. Market expert Quinten Francois highlighted this recognition on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), stating, “WHITE HOUSE JUST MENTIONED CHAINLINK.” The report underscores how oracles act as a bridge connecting external data sources to blockchain networks, enabling smart contracts to execute agreements based on real-world events and prices. This functionality is crucial for decentralized applications (dApps) that facilitate a range of financial activities, including trading, lending, and earning rewards. Chainlink’s role becomes even more vital in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), where dApps often serve as cross-chain bridges, allowing assets to move seamlessly between different blockchain networks. These wrapped assets, which exist on one chain but are represented on another, illustrate the growing complexity and interconnectivity of the blockchain ecosystem. Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, responded positively to the White House’s endorsement, expressing his appreciation for the administration’s commitment to advancing the blockchain industry. Nazarov noted that Chainlink’s recognition represents a critical moment for both the industry and the broader US financial system. Chainlink’s co-founder further noted: I think the president’s (Trump) clear placing of our industry as a national priority will be seen as a critical and historic moment for our industry and for the United States financial system’s role globally. Nazarov distinguished the report’s focus on oracles, particularly the Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which according to his assessment highlights the innovative work being done by the Chainlink community to enhance smart contract capabilities. Beyond its focus on Chainlink, the White House report outlines various recommendations aimed at structuring cryptocurrency markets and clarifying the regulatory roles of federal agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). An earlier report by Bitcoinist also notes that the White House encourages Congress to implement laws that embrace decentralized finance technologies, recognizing their potential to reshape traditional finance. Despite the optimism surrounding these developments, some industry leaders had anticipated further details regarding a federal Bitcoin (BTC) reserve, a topic notably absent from the report. During a press briefing, a White House official mentioned that infrastructure for this initiative is currently being developed, with more information expected in the near future. Despite this development, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, remained unfazed, currently trading at $17.80. Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading 66% below its record high of $52.

Title: Tech giants face pushback from backers on scale of AI spending

‘If a company is saying, maybe we’ll see an AI benefit in five years, we’re no longer at the point where that will get a pass’ Microsoft is expected to report about $18bn in capital spending in the quarter ended June 30. Photo: Getty Earnings season for a handful of megacap tech firms has morphed into capex season with the AI arms race showing no signs of slowing. Focus will be on how much the behemoths Microsoft and Meta Platforms plan to dish out to keep up with competitors like Alphabet and Amazon.com as they build out infrastructure and software to power artificial intelligence applications. The answer, estimated at around $70bn (€61bn) in each company’s current fiscal year, may matter more to investors than actual profits and will go a long way to determining whether blistering rallies in the shares will persist. ​ For nearly two years now, investors have continued to shower Big Tech with cash as the companies churned out lavish profits and then reinvested hundreds of billions of dollars into AI. Now, with Microsoft and Meta having notched rallies north of 40pc from April lows, analysts worry massive outlays without corresponding AI profits could dent investor enthusiasm. “If a company is saying, maybe we’ll see an AI benefit in five years, we’re no longer at the point where that will get a pass,” Gabriela Santos, chief strategist for the Americas at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in an interview. “Valuations are mattering more and more, and valuation especially matters if a company can’t grow sales as fast as expected, or as quickly as capex.” Microsoft is expected to report about $18bn in capital spending in the quarter ended June 30, an increase of nearly 30pc from a year ago. Sales at the software giant are forecast to rise 14pc. Meta, meanwhile, is expected to show $16.4bn in spending, double from the year-ago period, while revenue will rise 15pc, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Last week provided a hopeful marker for Big Tech bulls. Alphabet shares rose as the company boosted its capex forecast 13pc to $85bn after delivering better-than-expected earnings. A gain in the week erased what had been a loss in 2025. The bar is likely higher for Meta and Microsoft when it comes to spending, not least because their shares have rallied about 20pc this year versus Alphabet’s 3.4pc gain. They also have different approaches to AI than Alphabet’s search-driven focus, with Microsoft teaming with OpenAI and Meta trying to develop “super intelligence” with an army of engineers, lured with massive pay packages. Last quarter, AI spending proved somewhat beneficial. Meta’s strength was credited to AI improving ad targeting, and Microsoft saw a similar tailwind with its cloud business. “Microsoft is investing aggressively into AI, which looks like the right strategy if you have a long-term view on the stock,” Daniel Flax, a senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, said. Santos struck a more cautious tone specifically on AI outlays. “We’re really honing in on margins this quarter,” she said. “It is still all about ROI, and what companies can grow their sales faster than what they’re invested into AI capex.” With capex swelling at both companies, neither can afford to falter in the businesses that have generated billions in cash flow in recent years – a misstep Flax thinks both can avoid. “Microsoft is executing extremely well on its cloud opportunity,” he said. Azure, the OpenAI investment, and AI assistant “Copilot” should ease worries about spending, said Krishna Chintalapalli, portfolio manager and tech sector head at Parnassus Investments. “Those are all huge and growing businesses, and Microsoft seems like it has less risk in its non-AI business, where there is steady recurring revenue,” he said. Meta’s AI bets also make sense to investors. It has “multiple ways to earn a return on AI spending,” according to Michael McKinnon, who manages more than $40bn as a portfolio manager at Artisan Partners. He cited the ability to improve efficiency and increase both user engagement and the return on ad spend for its customers as ways for AI to drive growth, in addition to the ability to create new business categories, such as with its smart glasses. This is a “very different kind of spending than what we saw a couple years ago, when it was spending $20bn on Reality Labs,” which was a “low-probability bet that didn’t justify the level of investment Meta was throwing at it”. Still, with trillion-dollar valuations and P/E ratios near or above long-term averages, investors will likely remain cautious as the results roll in. Option-derived implied moves for the shares following the reports are relatively muted, with Microsoft at 3.9pc and Meta at 5.8pc. “Historically, high or rising capex is a negative factor, but the more profitable the company is, the more it turns into a positive factor,” said Tony DeSpirito, global chief investment officer of BlackRock Fundamental Equities. “That’s why these big tech companies are getting treated differently than another company might.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Letters: My plan to help fix the housing crisis is outside the box, but it’s worth a shot

We need radical ideas if the housing crisis is to be alleviated. Photo: Getty President Franklin D Roosevelt came up with a solution for the shortage of labour to build large projects when he ordered the construction of dams, highways and schools all over America. Workers flocked to these sites and were housed in temporary’ compounds beside each job. Based on army barracks, they were made of timber and were simple, warm and comfortable, with showers, kitchens and other basic essentials. They could be dismantled and the land returned to green grass. We should copy this to scale up our labour force for the construction of housing and other large projects. This is a national emergency and no time for nimbyism. We should build modular accomm­odation that could be moved to follow the work. We should place ads across eastern European countries seeking qualified tradesmen with 10 years’ experience to come and work in Ireland. We should offer them a two-year term at full hourly industry standard rates of pay. Each worker would pay full tax, but if he or she finishes the term they would get the full amount returned as a lump sum to send home to their family. As all pay rates are the same, each worker could follow the work from job to job as and when needed. Each compound would have a basic office where the weekly work could be booked. This would ensure a secure pool of expert labour available to all. Each man would get a free Ryanair flight home for one week each quarter to visit family, and Michael O’Leary should be asked for a contract rate. Mr O’Leary would answer the call. This is a brief snapshot of a concept I believe would help to solve our housing crisis. I know it’s out-of-the-box thinking, but given the scale of the crisis we face, I believe it’s worth a shot. Harry Crosbie, Hanover Quay, Dublin 2 Scaffolding blocks our pavements. We are delayed and diverted on our roads. We are tormented by drilling and concrete saws. Our homes are covered in dust. There is a need for decent architecture and design. Don’t tell me there’s a shortage of builders. The place is walking with them. Eve Parnell, Dublin 2 It seemed hard to beat Donald Trump’s suggestion of a 1,000pc discount on drug prices as a maths error, but then his son stepped up. In reference to the new Trump golf course in Aberdeenshire, Eric Trump said it was wonderful because “we had an unlimited budget and we exceeded it”. Quite an achievement. This all sounds funny until you consider who is in charge of the US and its economy. Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne Reading your editorial (‘New Garda chief must focus on strategic challenges’, July 30), I couldn’t help but feel there must be another key priority for the commissioner that is given scant attention. The men and women of An Garda Síochána need morale restored at all levels, and this goes way beyond rosters. It has taken a battering over recent years and is tied to a depleted force that has to do more with less. An internal appointment, Justin Kelly has the experience to potentially reset relations with all ranks of the force that could have a very positive effect. Stephen O’Hara, Carrowmore, Co Sligo It is unconscionable that the humani­tarian tragedy in Gaza has reached the shocking levels we now see on a daily basis. The harrowing scenes of starving children, mere walking skeletons, will be a stain on our shared humanity. This is one of the darkest chapters of dehumanisation, demonisation and demoralisation in the annals of human history. Homes are in ruins, while the ­Palestinian people are starved and left distraught. Mothers are frightened and in disbelief. Children are left maimed and bloodied as Israel keeps up its relentless attacks on the innocents. Efforts in recent days to deliver aid to the besieged people in Gaza, provide medical support, facilitate medical evacuation and cater for the needs of the sick and injured are a drop in the ocean of need. A complete cessation of hostilities by ­Israel must happen, and an unimpeded flow of flood, fuel and medicine must be allowed in. Dr Munjed Farid Al Qutob, London We all know what Nero was doing as Rome burned, but now we see what Donald Trump occupies himself with as thousands of Gazan children starve in front of the world. Over the last few days, the US president has played two rounds of golf, cut a ribbon to add to his family property portfolio and still found time to ride roughshod over the EU with his tariffs. Did he give any time or thought to the starving population in Gaza? Donough O’Reilly, Stillorgan, Co Dublin Michael D Higgins should be congratulated on reminding his fellow European presidents of their moral duty to do their utmost to help end the genocide being carried out on the people of Gaza by Israel before the eyes of the world. J Anthony Gaughan, President Irish PEN, Blackrock, Co Dublin Pope Leo has urged young people to use AI for good and to “create encounters between hearts”. It is a refreshing break from the usual Vatican dread about algorithms and doom. He even posed for selfies. Frankly, it’s a miracle the man didn’t get ­auto-tagged as a lifestyle influencer. If Pope Leo keeps this up, he may soon be declared patron saint of wifi connections, “strong in spirit and signal”.

Business FILE PHOTO: The company logo of CK Hutchison Holdings is displayed at a news conference in Hong Kong, China March 17, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo PANAMA CITY :Panama's comptroller general, Anel Flores, said on Wednesday he had filed suit to the nation's Supreme Court against a contract to operate ports near the Panama Canal, held by a local firm controlled by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. Flores said the two suits were to declare the unconstitutionality and to nullify the contract to operate the Balboa and Cristobal ports. The Supreme Court would still need to accept the request to hear the comptroller's complaint. The suits stem from a months-long audit spearheaded by Flores, who has publicly complained that the contract did not serve the nation's interests. Flores has not made the full audit public, but said on Wednesday that it had revealed "many irregularities."

Title: State financial officers urge financial institutions to abandon ESG
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4331704/posts
Time Published: 2025-07-30T21:42:54Z
Full Content:
Skip to comments. Posted on 07/30/2025 2:42:54 PM PDT by george76 Arizona, Louisiana, Pennsylvania treasurers among those to sign.. A group of 26 financial officers from 21 states sent letters to 18 major financial institutions this week, warning them to abandon environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices if they wish to continue doing business with their states. The letters said ESG has undermined the traditional fiduciary duty that firms owe their clients, focusing solely on financial return, and instead prioritizes advancing political agendas. “Fiduciary duty has long been a critical safeguard that facilitated efficient capital allocation grounded in financial merit rather than political ideology,” the letter said. “But that clarity is being diluted under the banner of so-called ‘long-term risk mitigation,’ where speculative assumptions about the future, like climate change catastrophe, are used to justify ideological conclusions today.” Signers include state treasurers, auditors, and comptrollers from states like Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Utah. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and 17 other financial leaders were recipients of the joint letter. Others include executives from Vanguard, Fidelity, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and State Street. The letter said that while some firms have started leaving global climate coalitions and reducing ESG-related proxy votes, the state financial officers want “durable assurances” that fiduciary duty, not politics, drives investment decisions. “While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” the letter said. “The number one issue is a recommitment to the foundational principles of fiduciary duty, loyalty, objectivity, and financial focus.” The move comes after Texas removed BlackRock from its blacklist earlier this month and resumed investing with the firm – a move that drew criticism from others still pushing back against ESG. The letter indicates that many states won't follow suit. “Financial institutions wishing to compete for our states’ business should provide durable assurances that their practices align with these principles,” the letter said. “Our responsibility is to ensure public assets are managed in the best financial interest of beneficiaries and taxpayers.” O.J. Oleka, president of the State Financial Officers Foundation, said the states are right to demand proof that ESG is no longer a factor in investing for these companies. “Actions always speak louder than words. Requiring America's financial giants to prove their independence from woke ideology with concrete steps before doing business with a state's dollars is fully necessary and just makes sense,” Oleka said. “These financial officers are doing the right thing for their states and the taxpayers whose financial security they've been entrusted to protect.” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, also praised the letter. “BlackRock is playing a game of deceit,” Hild said. “Fink and his team are trying to say all the right things to conservatives while quietly doubling down on their activist agenda behind the scenes.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Government; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections KEYWORDS: affirmativeaction; blackrock; climatechange; coal; dei; die; diversity; energy; esg; evs; fidelity; goldmansachs; jpmorgan; statestreet; vanguard; woke Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 07/30/2025 2:42:54 PM PDT by george76 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: george76 who wrote the rules for esg? how did it even become a thing? 2 posted on 07/30/2025 2:49:25 PM PDT by joshua c [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: george76 Pennsylvania treasurers>>> She is a good one.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson A group of 26 financial officers from 21 states sent letters to 18 major financial institutions this week, warning them to abandon environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices if they wish to continue doing business with their states. The letters said ESG has undermined the traditional fiduciary duty that firms owe their clients, focusing solely on financial return, and instead prioritizes advancing political agendas. “Fiduciary duty has long been a critical safeguard that facilitated efficient capital allocation grounded in financial merit rather than political ideology,” the letter said. “But that clarity is being diluted under the banner of so-called ‘long-term risk mitigation,’ where speculative assumptions about the future, like climate change catastrophe, are used to justify ideological conclusions today.” Signers include state treasurers, auditors, and comptrollers from states like Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Utah. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and 17 other financial leaders were recipients of the joint letter. Others include executives from Vanguard, Fidelity, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and State Street. The letter said that while some firms have started leaving global climate coalitions and reducing ESG-related proxy votes, the state financial officers want “durable assurances” that fiduciary duty, not politics, drives investment decisions. “While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” the letter said. “The number one issue is a recommitment to the foundational principles of fiduciary duty, loyalty, objectivity, and financial focus.” The move comes after Texas removed BlackRock from its blacklist earlier this month and resumed investing with the firm – a move that drew criticism from others still pushing back against ESG. The letter indicates that many states won't follow suit. “Financial institutions wishing to compete for our states’ business should provide durable assurances that their practices align with these principles,” the letter said. “Our responsibility is to ensure public assets are managed in the best financial interest of beneficiaries and taxpayers.” O.J. Oleka, president of the State Financial Officers Foundation, said the states are right to demand proof that ESG is no longer a factor in investing for these companies. “Actions always speak louder than words. Requiring America's financial giants to prove their independence from woke ideology with concrete steps before doing business with a state's dollars is fully necessary and just makes sense,” Oleka said. “These financial officers are doing the right thing for their states and the taxpayers whose financial security they've been entrusted to protect.” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, also praised the letter. “BlackRock is playing a game of deceit,” Hild said. “Fink and his team are trying to say all the right things to conservatives while quietly doubling down on their activist agenda behind the scenes.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Government; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections KEYWORDS: affirmativeaction; blackrock; climatechange; coal; dei; die; diversity; energy; esg; evs; fidelity; goldmansachs; jpmorgan; statestreet; vanguard; woke Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 07/30/2025 2:42:54 PM PDT by george76 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: george76 who wrote the rules for esg? how did it even become a thing? 2 posted on 07/30/2025 2:49:25 PM PDT by joshua c [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: george76 Pennsylvania treasurers>>> She is a good one.

The letter indicates that many states won't follow suit. “Financial institutions wishing to compete for our states’ business should provide durable assurances that their practices align with these principles,” the letter said. “Our responsibility is to ensure public assets are managed in the best financial interest of beneficiaries and taxpayers.” O.J. Oleka, president of the State Financial Officers Foundation, said the states are right to demand proof that ESG is no longer a factor in investing for these companies. “Actions always speak louder than words. Requiring America's financial giants to prove their independence from woke ideology with concrete steps before doing business with a state's dollars is fully necessary and just makes sense,” Oleka said. “These financial officers are doing the right thing for their states and the taxpayers whose financial security they've been entrusted to protect.” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, also praised the letter. “BlackRock is playing a game of deceit,” Hild said. “Fink and his team are trying to say all the right things to conservatives while quietly doubling down on their activist agenda behind the scenes.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Government; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections KEYWORDS: affirmativeaction; blackrock; climatechange; coal; dei; die; diversity; energy; esg; evs; fidelity; goldmansachs; jpmorgan; statestreet; vanguard; woke Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 07/30/2025 2:42:54 PM PDT by george76 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: george76 who wrote the rules for esg? how did it even become a thing? 2 posted on 07/30/2025 2:49:25 PM PDT by joshua c [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: george76 Pennsylvania treasurers>>> She is a good one.

I believe it was promoted by Dim leaning states and their treasurers that manage state pensions. Basically, ESG was a score for how much a firm wanted Dim run pensions to invest in those businesses. Pension money managers = big investors. Imagine a CEO trying to impress not just a Warren Buffet running one Berkshire Hathaway, but a room full of Buffets each running a different large investment "firm" (pension plan). That's how the ESG score was created and how it basically wound up being nothing but a score of how much a firm likes to kiss Dims' butts. Even Tesla's ESG sore dropped as soon as Musk started supporting Trump. Though absolutely nothing changed about Tesla's involvement in the E of ESG (environment). Tesla is still making EV's and cashing in on carbon credits and such that by Dim logic makes them more environmentally "green" than any other company. But various investment firms like Blackrock downgraded Tesla's ESG "score" and Dim run states moved their large pension investment plans out of Tesla stock -- all because Musk joined Trump's team. That's how phony the ESG bull crap is. 8 posted on 07/30/2025 4:00:27 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Gladwin Edited by Andrew Hayward Jul 30, 2025Jul 30, 2025 7 min read Ethereum celebrated its 10th birthday on Wednesday, marking a decade since its first block was produced. But what about the next 10 years? In its first decade, the network has established itself with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, survived existential threats, and evolved in various ways. The Frontier launch brought Ethereum to life as a proof-of-work blockchain, the DAO hack divided the community and led to a controversial hard fork, celebs splashed millions of dollars on monkey JPEGs, the "merge" saw the network adopt a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake model, and countless scaling networks have been deployed. Over the next 10 years, what can we expect from Ethereum? Decrypt asked some of the leading ETH experts for their predictions. Today, Ethereum turns 10. That’s a decade since the genesis block: enabling billions of transactions, settling trillions of dollars, and securing over 23 million blocks. A decade of digital trust. As far as we’ve come, we’re just getting started. Happy birthday, @Ethereum. 💚 pic.twitter.com/GNFTa1dcwP — Consensys.eth (@Consensys) July 30, 2025 Predictors on Myriad Markets believe that it is 64% likely that Ethereum sets a new all-time high price by the end of the year, which would be a great start to its second decade—particularly since the current record has held since 2021, while Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies have set more recent records. (Disclosure: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.) Within this timeframe, the network is expected to undergo the Fusaka upgrade, which Bitwise Senior Research Associate Max Shannon estimated will roll out this November. In its current draft form, Fusaka will focus on data efficiency, accessibility, and user experience, or UX. The Glamsterdam upgrade is also anticipated for 2026, per the Ethereum roadmap. Victor Zhou, an Ethereum Improvement Proposal editor and founder of Namefi, told Decrypt that it's still in the scoping phase, but will broadly look to enhance the network's capabilities. “The Ethereum L1 will continue to scale, with a target of 10x within the next 12 months,” Jason Linehan, Chief Strategy Officer at Consensys, told Decrypt. “This will complement the L2 scaling roadmap, which is moving towards interoperability faster than ever.” (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) Hart Lambur, co-founder of Risk Labs—the team behind the oracle service UMA and bridging protocol Across—told Decrypt that interoperability is a major key to its short-term future. “Ethereum already scales thanks to layer-2s, but that broke the experience; moving between chains is (still) clunky and expensive,” Lambur said. “Solving interoperability is the big milestone ahead. Once interop feels seamless, Ethereum will feel like one unified network again.” As the Ethereum ecosystem moves closer to interoperability, a host of new network upgrades are waiting in the wings to improve the base layer. “Over the next five years, upgrades like the 'surge,' 'scourge,' 'verge,' 'purge,' and 'splurge' will bring cheaper transactions, faster processing, stronger MEV (maximal extractable value) protections, and simpler node operation,” James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet, told Decrypt. “While not as dramatic as the merge, these changes tackle long‑standing pain points.” The merge, surge, scourge, verge, purge, and splurge are loosely defined terms that group together improvements that Ethereum may undergo, Consensys Senior Product Strategy Manager TJ Keel told Decrypt. Toledano believes that many of those improvements will take root over the next five years. “Ethereum’s first decade was about idealism,” Zhou told Decrypt. “The next will be about adoption—bringing crypto to the general public.” believe in somETHing ✨ pic.twitter.com/xhvckqI2Z3 — beeple (@beeple) July 29, 2025 As Ethereum celebrates its 15th birthday, experts believe that institutional adoption will kick into third and fourth gear, thanks to another set of upgrades. Shannon, the researcher from Ethereum ETF provider Bitwise, predicts that Ethereum will “complete danksharding with verkle tree state commitments and state expiry”—which, in plain English, will cut hardware requirements for nodes and streamline the network. Linehan added that it is a Consensys “ambition” to add zero-knowledge proofs as a part of the base Ethereum protocol. Shannon hopes such an upgrade would unlock the use of on-chain digital IDs, as a way to prove “unique personhood” without needing to reveal personal data. “These structural upgrades should drive sustained increases in on‑chain throughput, institutional adoption, and real‑world asset tokenization,” Shannon added. In recent years, Ethereum has seen a significant uptick in institutional adoption with the passing of U.S. spot ETFs—which have collectively racked up more than $9.65 billion worth of inflows, per CoinGlass. But many experts think this is just the beginning. “Ethereum is well-positioned to become the core infrastructure for global finance and digital coordination,” Rob Viglione, CEO of infrastructure firm Horizen Labs, told Decrypt. “It’s not hard to imagine ETH and stablecoins replacing much of what SWIFT, CashApp, Venmo, Mastercard, and Visa do today, while tokenized assets begin trading around the clock on Ethereum-based rails.” For Risk Labs’ Lambur, he believes this will manifest with “most assets” becoming tokenized on Ethereum—think real-world assets, equities, and bonds. He points to BlackRock already tokenizing funds on Ethereum as evidence that the network is already heading there. In doing this, Lambur said, Ethereum will become the “settlement and payment layer for all things of value on the internet.” “New generations of stakeholders will be at the table—including, we believe, some of the world’s largest institutions—who will increasingly embrace Ethereum as a kind of public utility, a base layer for the future global economy,” Linehan told Decrypt. “We saw with the internet, with the web, with Linux, with all systems of this kind, how powerful it is when you hit that turning point where the whole world is building together. This is the power of open systems like Ethereum.” “It’s going to be the base layer of the future global economy,” he added. Ethereum Improvement Proposal editor Zhou added that smart contract standardization, combined with real-world assets, will be the key to making this leap. “The real endgame is straightforward: a giant payments and exchange network that connects every blockchain,” he told Decrypt. “[My] craziest prediction might be that Ethereum becomes boring because it just works as the settlement layer for everything.” Some experts believe that quantum computing poses an “existential crisis” to leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin, as the technology to break the chain’s encryption could be less than a decade away. However, Linehan says Consensys isn’t so concerned about the threat to Ethereum. “We don’t anticipate quantum computing posing a risk to Ethereum in the near term,” Linehan told Decrypt. “But Ethereum is the most advanced in terms of research and readiness to start a transition.” That research and readiness were already kick-started with a 2024 blog post from Vitalik Buterin outlining possible cryptographic improvements via the aforementioned “splurge.” Since then, Toledano from Unity Wallet claims, development on new quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes has started as network builders attempt to stay ahead of any potential threat. “In short: It’s a serious future challenge, but far from an existential threat,” Toledano added. If Ethereum can battle against the threat of quantum computing, improve its user experience, and become the settlement layer for traditional finance, then one expert thinks it could eventually flip Bitcoin—which currently has a market cap five times larger than ETH. “If the UX is there, and users eventually realize it, as they always do, Ethereum is going to win and flip Bitcoin,” Amir Forouzani, co-founder of Ethereum infrastructure firm Puffer Labs, told Decrypt. “It’s better money, and it offers a platform where you can truly own and trust your money. The flippening won’t happen in a single cycle, but it will happen eventually.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Spot XRP ETFs Coming Up Next? Top Expert Predicts What Might Win SEC Approval First
URL: https://zycrypto.com/spot-xrp-etfs-coming-up-next-top-expert-predicts-what-might-win-sec-approval-first/

Most in the cryptosphere are anxiously waiting to see the next crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) to be approved for listing by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For most Ripple fans, a spot XRP ETF is on the horizon as post-lawsuit momentum builds around the cross-border payments token. But for well-known ETF expert Nate Geraci, the SEC might approve staking in spot Ethereum ETFs before giving the nod to the much-awaited XRP products. On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged Nasdaq’s proposal to accommodate staking for BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA). If the proposal is greenlighted, the ETHA would be able to earn yield by locking up ether to help validate transactions on the Ethereum network, per the SEC’s filing. The ETF could stake a portion of its ETH holdings via one or more trusted providers to generate additional yield. U.S. regulators have yet to definitively determine whether staking services offered through an ETF should be classified as securities. But the inclusion of staking in the BlackRock filing reflects increasing confidence that staking could eventually be part of crypto ETFs. For NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci, who has been closely following ETF-related developments for months, staking is the final item left on his November checklist. His forecast? The SEC could approve ETHA staking “sooner rather than later,” potentially even before any new spot crypto ETFs, including ones based on XRP, get the regulatory blessing. Meanwhile, the SEC has recently approved in-kind creation and redemption for all spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds, a move hoped to boost efficiency for institutional investors. The action implies something bigger — a regulator that once kept crypto at arm’s length is now setting the stage to usher it deeper into Wall Street. That being said, it appears that the SEC is currently focused on streamlining how existing crypto ETFs trade rather than expanding the fund lineup. If Geraci’s prediction comes true and the agency greenlights yield-generating ETH exposure, XRP fans might have to wait a little longer before a spot ETF fund goes live in the US.

Title: What is tokenization?

Time Published: 2025-07-30T16:30:30Z

Asset tokenization is unlocking trillions in finance. Learn how it turns bonds into tradable digital tokens. Finance is getting a digital makeover. A technology called tokenization is quietly re-engineering how we think about assets. By turning ownership of an asset into a digital coin on a blockchain, it’s making it possible to trade things that were once hard to sell, like a stake in a skyscraper or a piece of a government bond. This isn’t just theory anymore; it’s happening now, potentially prying open markets worth trillions and making them faster and more open. Some of the biggest names in finance, from BlackRock to JPMorgan, are already building the tools for this new world, proving that blockchain is moving from the fringes to the financial mainstream. The whole point is to cut through the red tape that makes finance slow and expensive. When an asset lives on a shared, unchangeable digital ledger, you can automate complex tasks, rely less on middlemen, and do new things like sell tiny fractions of a single asset or build compliance rules directly into the transaction. The bond market is an early testing ground, showing how much fat can be trimmed from the old way of doing things. When bonds are issued as digital tokens, things like interest payments can be handled automatically by a bit of code called a smart contract, slashing administrative work. The European Investment Bank (EIB) has already run successful tests, issuing a €100 million digital bond with help from Goldman Sachs on a private blockchain. This wasn’t a small experiment; it was a large-scale deal that proved the concept. More recently, Hong Kong issued a $100 million tokenized green bond, showing that this tech can also help direct money toward sustainable projects. It’s not just for governments. The German industrial powerhouse Siemens put its first digital bond on the Polygon blockchain, highlighting just how quick and clean a blockchain-based issuance can be. These examples point to a future where the entire life of a bond—from its creation to its final payment—is streamlined. Settling trades could take minutes, not days. Tokenizing stocks could finally let ordinary people invest like the big players. By turning shares into digital tokens, companies could sell them in tiny pieces. This fractional ownership would tear down the high-cost barrier that keeps many retail investors out of certain stocks. While turning public stocks into tokens is still a work in progress, the real action is in private markets. Some platforms, like Swarm Markets, are already offering tokenized versions of big names like Apple and Tesla on the Polygon blockchain, making them available to more people. The biggest shake-up, though, is happening in the exclusive world of private equity. Private equity has always been a members-only club with huge buy-ins and long lock-up periods. Tokenization is changing that by creating something that never existed before: a way out. By turning a stake in a private equity fund into a tradable token, fund managers can let their investors sell their positions on a secondary market. Firms are already jumping on this. The investment manager Hamilton Lane teamed up with Securitize to tokenize one of its funds on Polygon [MATIC], letting qualified investors buy into a portfolio of private companies for a much smaller check. In another example, the venture capital firm SPiCE VC turned its whole portfolio into a token, giving investors a tradable security that represents a basket of startups. It’s a win-win. Investors get a shot at cashing out early and spreading their money around, while fund managers can reach a bigger pool of investors and possibly see more stable fund values. For all the progress, tokenization isn’t a sure thing yet. Regulators are still figuring out the rules, which creates uncertainty. This makes the underlying technology bulletproof and building reliable exchanges for these new assets are also huge tasks. And the very transparency of a blockchain, which is often a selling point, can be a problem for private equity, where secrecy is key. Finding a way to get the benefits of the tech without giving up privacy will be essential. Still, the potential is too big to ignore. The ability to make illiquid assets tradable, cut costs, and open up exclusive markets is a fundamental change in how we create and trade value. As the tech gets better and the rules become clearer, tokenized assets will likely shift from a niche experiment to a basic building block of our financial system. It changes everything from how startups raise money to how we save for retirement. The projects happening today are just the first steps on a very long road. The real estate market, a multi-trillion-dollar giant famous for high costs and snail-paced deals, is about to get a serious jolt. A technology known as tokenization is breaking down the old walls of property investment. It’s bringing in an era of fractional ownership and creating lively secondary markets, letting people trade property shares like stocks. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a complete rewiring of how property is bought, sold, and managed. At its simplest, real estate tokenization turns ownership of a property into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token is a share of that asset. This allows a multi-million dollar building to be split into thousands of affordable pieces. Think of it like a company’s stock, but backed by a physical building and secured by the transparency of a blockchain. For a long time, only the wealthy or big institutions could afford to invest directly in prime real estate. Tokenization changes that. By allowing for fractional ownership, it opens the door for people with less capital to buy into properties they could never afford on their own. Instead of needing millions for an office tower, you could buy a few tokens that represent a small piece of it. This shift has clear benefits. Investors can now spread their money across different properties and locations to lower their risk. It also gives them a shot at the higher returns that usually come from institutional-quality buildings. For developers and property owners, tokenization means they can tap into a worldwide pool of investors, giving them a new way to raise money and make their properties easier to sell. Maybe the biggest change tokenization brings is a solution to real estate’s oldest problem: you can’t sell it quickly. Traditional property sales are a nightmare of paperwork, fees, and delays that can drag on for months. Tokenization turns these frozen assets into digital tokens that can be traded on secondary markets, 24/7, almost as easily as stocks. This gives investors a level of freedom and access to their money that was unheard of in real estate. The tech behind this is a mix of blockchain and smart contracts. The blockchain acts as a secure, public log of who owns what, cutting down on fraud. Smart contracts are bits of code that automatically handle parts of the deal, like distributing rental income or transferring ownership. This automation cuts out many of the middlemen, like brokers and lawyers, making deals faster and cheaper. Even with all this promise, the path to a fully tokenized real estate market has some bumps. The biggest is that the law hasn’t caught up. Many countries don’t have clear rules for these kinds of digital assets, creating confusion around things like property rights and taxes. There are also tech risks, like bugs in the smart contract code or the need for blockchains that can handle huge volumes of transactions. Getting the traditional real estate world to trust and understand this new technology is another challenge. The dream of instant trading depends on building active secondary markets, which are still in their early days. But the direction is clear. As governments create rules and the technology improves, tokenized real estate will become a standard part of property investing. By tearing down the barriers of high costs and slow sales, this innovation isn’t just changing the rules; it’s building a fairer, faster, and more open real estate market for everyone. A quiet shift in the financial world is starting to pry open the doors to investments that were once reserved for the very wealthy. This shift is driven by tokenization, a process that turns rights to real-world things into digital tokens on a blockchain. It’s creating a way for regular people to invest in previously off-limits markets like prime real estate, fine art, and private equity. For years, the price of admission to these worlds was simply too high for most. If you wanted to own a piece of a Manhattan skyscraper or a Picasso, you needed to be an institution or a billionaire. Tokenization breaks that mold by creating fractional ownership, letting people buy tiny digital slices of a bigger asset. This is more than just making things cheaper; it’s a fundamental change in how we own and trade things. The process involves creating a digital stand-in for an asset—whether it’s a physical building or a share of a private company—and issuing it as a token. These tokens live on a blockchain, a shared and unchangeable digital logbook that records every transaction transparently, creating a secure and verifiable ownership history. The biggest impact of tokenization is its ability to make hard-to-sell assets easy to trade. Real estate is a classic example of an illiquid market. By dividing a property into thousands of digital tokens, ownership can be traded quickly and easily on global markets that never close. This gives investors more freedom and helps sellers get a better price for their assets. This newfound flexibility comes from a few key features: Tokenization can be applied to almost any asset class, each with its own potential for change: Despite the potential, tokenization faces some real hurdles: Both financial giants and nimble startups are exploring what tokenization can do. As the technology gets better and the rules become clearer, it is set to become a major force in finance. For the average investor, this represents a huge opportunity to get into a world of investments that was once locked away. While it’s important to be cautious and understand the risks, the potential for tokenization to create a more open and efficient financial system is hard to deny. The digital key has been made, and the doors to exclusive markets are starting to open. The market for tokenized assets—real-world things turned into tradable digital tokens—is growing at a breakneck pace. Industry forecasts now predict it will be a multi-trillion dollar industry by the end of the decade. The boom is being driven by big financial institutions getting on board, a growing hunger for fractional ownership, and the promise of making slow, traditional markets faster and more liquid. Market reports paint a picture of rapid expansion. Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and ADDX believe asset tokenization could become a $16.1 trillion opportunity by 2030. Some analysts are even more optimistic, with one report suggesting the market for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could hit $30 trillion in the same timeframe. The value of RWAs already on the blockchain has blown past $50 billion and is projected to hit $500 billion by the end of 2025. This growth isn’t just in one area; real estate, bonds, private credit, and commodities are all seeing significant activity. Property is leading the charge. The market for tokenized real estate was valued at $2.7 billion in 2022 and, according to BCG, could explode to $16 trillion by 2030. For 2024, the market is expected to hit $3.5 billion and then grow to $19.4 billion by 2033, expanding at 21% per year. Another report sees the global market crossing $16.51 billion by 2033. This growth is all about fractional ownership, which lets more people invest in property. The tokenized bond market is also set for huge growth. Projections suggest this slice of the market could reach at least $300 billion by 2030, a 30-fold jump from where it is now. Some even think it could hit $1 trillion by 2028. The appeal is clear: near-instant trade settlements, lower costs, and the ability for small investors to buy a piece of a bond. Tokenized private credit has seen explosive growth, making up about 65% of the total tokenized RWA market in 2024. The market value for these assets now tops $12 billion as of March 2025, accounting for over half of the RWA market. Big money is moving in. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) quickly grew to over $1 billion in assets, showing that major institutions are hungry for on-chain treasury products. A BCG report estimates that tokenized fund assets under management could top $600 billion by 2030, which would be 1% of the total global mutual fund and ETF market. The main reasons for this explosive growth are the potential for more liquidity, greater transparency, and lower investment minimums. Tokenization lets you slice up expensive assets, making them affordable for a much wider group of people. At the same time, smart contracts can automate tasks, making the whole system efficient and cheaper to run. Looking forward, the future of asset tokenization looks very strong. As blockchain technology matures and governments provide clearer rules, adoption should speed up even more. As more financial players and investors see what tokenization can do, the market is on track to become a core part of the global financial system, blending the best of traditional finance with modern technology. Tokenization is creating a new world where you can own a piece of anything from an apartment building to a famous painting. Analysts predict this market will be worth trillions by 2030. But underneath all the hype lies a tricky problem: how do you figure out the true value of these digital slices of real-world things? Pricing a tokenized asset is a hybrid job, mixing old-school financial math with new ideas designed for the digital world. The starting point is always the value of the underlying asset, which is key for building investor trust. Several classic methods are being retooled for this new asset class: You value something by seeing what similar things have recently sold for. This works well for assets with active markets, like real estate or stocks. For a tokenized property, you might compare it to similar, non-tokenized buildings that just sold. This method looks at the future income an asset is likely to produce, like rent from a building or revenue from a business. You estimate those future cash flows and adjust them for risk to find their value today. This is a finance staple, but it’s tough to apply to tokens that don’t generate direct income. This approach calculates what it would cost to replace or rebuild an asset. It’s often used for things like factories or infrastructure that don’t have a clear income stream. Net asset value (NAV) Firms use NAV for funds or companies. You take all the assets, subtract all the liabilities, and what’s left is the value. It’s a good fit for asset-backed tokens. Beyond these traditional tools, the unique properties of tokens have led to new ways of thinking about value: Even with these methods, several challenges make it hard to put a reliable price on a tokenized asset. Figuring out how to value tokenized assets is a work in progress. As the market grows, the most likely outcome is a hybrid approach that combines solid financial analysis with new metrics designed for the digital world. The creation of busy, liquid secondary markets will be crucial for better price discovery. Clearer regulations will also help build investor confidence and provide a more stable foundation for pricing. In the end, specialists who understand both Wall Street and Web3 will be needed to navigate this new landscape. While the rulebook for valuing tokenized assets is still being written, the innovation is real. By tackling these challenges head-on, the market is building a future where the value of almost anything can be unlocked and traded more openly and efficiently. A future where most of the world’s assets are traded as digital tokens is quickly becoming a real possibility. This shift, powered by blockchain, promises to open up finance to everyone, make markets run better, and create new economic opportunities. But this bright vision comes with dark shadows. It could also deepen existing inequalities and create new kinds of financial risk. The social and ethical fallout of a fully tokenized world needs a close and careful look. Turning assets into digital tokens on a blockchain could fundamentally change our social and economic landscape. One of the biggest promises of tokenization is greater financial inclusion. By allowing for fractional ownership, it can break down expensive assets like real estate or private equity into small, affordable pieces. This could let people with less money, especially in developing countries, invest in things that were once only for the rich. Some argue this could be a powerful way to close the wealth gap by letting more people own assets. For example, a luxury resort in Colorado sold tokenized shares of its property for as little as $10,000, a tiny fraction of what a traditional investment would require. Tokenization could make trillions of dollars worth of hard-to-sell assets easy to trade. This increased liquidity could spur more economic activity. By cutting out many of the usual middlemen like brokers and banks, automated smart contracts can make transactions cheaper and faster for everyone. The impact of tokenization goes far beyond the stock market. It could change how industries like healthcare, supply chains, and intellectual property work. Artists could tokenize their work, selling fractional shares and collecting royalties directly. Communities could use it to crowdfund local projects or support non-profits. For all its potential, the widespread use of tokenization creates a messy web of ethical problems. There is no single set of rules for the tokenized economy. Different countries are at different stages of regulating digital assets, creating a confusing and patchwork legal system. This makes cross-border deals tricky and allows companies to shop for the jurisdiction with the weakest rules. A top concern for governments is the risk that tokens could be used for money laundering or other crimes. Strong identity checks are needed to manage these risks, but the anonymous nature of some blockchains makes this a huge challenge. The transparency of a blockchain is a double-edged sword. While it builds trust, it also creates major privacy issues. Once a transaction is on a public blockchain, it’s there forever. This clashes with privacy laws like GDPR, which give people the right to have their data erased. Finding a balance between transparency and privacy is a major ethical hurdle. While tokenization can make markets more liquid, it could also create new dangers for the financial system. The link between digital assets and traditional finance means that a crash in the volatile crypto markets could spread to conventional ones. The International Monetary Fund has warned that if a widely held tokenized asset were suddenly sold off, it could send shockwaves through the entire system. Big market players like Citadel Securities have also cautioned that a rush into unregulated tokenized securities could destabilize stock markets. The risk of new gatekeepers Ironically, a technology praised for being decentralized could end up concentrating power in the hands of a few big platforms or developers. The rules for these new markets are still being written, raising questions about who is in charge. The algorithms that run these systems could also be biased, reinforcing existing inequalities if the rule-writers don’t design and check them carefully. In real estate, tokenization could have unintended negative side effects. It becomes easier for global investors to buy into local property markets. There’s a risk of driving up prices in poorer neighborhoods. This flood of outside capital could lead to gentrification, pushing out long-time residents who can no longer afford to live in their own communities. The move toward a tokenized future seems unstoppable, but where we end up is not. The social and ethical consequences are huge, offering both a better world and a more dangerous one. To make sure we get the benefits, regulators need to work together to create clear rules that protect people without killing innovation. Developers have a duty to build secure, private, and fair systems. And we all need to have an honest conversation about the kind of financial world we want. Tokenization isn’t just a tech revolution; it’s a social one. Its true success will be judged not by the value of the tokens, but by whether it creates a fairer world for everyone.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on the operations on 'Special Report.' FIRST ON FOX: A group of Senate Democratic leaders are accusing President Donald Trump of making "steep concessions to Beijing" by refusing to allow the Taiwanese president to come to the U.S. and allowing China to purchase Nvidia chips. The group claims the Trump administration has "ceded leverage" in trade talks without gaining any "real breakthrough" in negotiations, which took place in Sweden this week. "In the face of lackluster domestic economic forecasts and anemic interest from Beijing in achieving a real breakthrough in talks, Trump and his economic team have ceded leverage and negotiating power to Beijing in a desperate attempt to lure President Xi to a meeting with Trump," Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del., Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Patty Murray, D-Wash., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, Andy Kim, D-N.J., Tim Kaine, D-Va., Jack Reed, D-R.I., Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and Mark Warner, D-Va. said. "Even more dangerously, they risk putting American national security, technological advantage, and economic prosperity on the chopping block in order to do so." CHINA MAY GAIN GREATER CONTROL OF PANAMA CANAL AFTER BLACKROCK DEAL MISSES DEADLINE Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Chris Coons, left, and Sen. Chuck Schumer, right, slammed President Donald Trump for making "concessions" to Beijing without a "real breakthrough" in trade talks. (Reuters) Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te was planning a stopover in New York en route to a trip to Latin America, but the Trump administration reportedly denied permission for the stop after China raised objections. The U.S. does not maintain formal relations with Taiwan, but such stops have happened before. Last week, the Trump administration reversed a ban on selling Nvidia’s lower-powered H20 chips to China to power its artificial intelligence, arguing they were only the U.S.’ "fourth-best chip." That move was a concession in talks with China over rare earth minerals, in hopes that Beijing would stop cutting off exports of the materials needed for all sorts of American technologies. "President Trump is handing our primary geopolitical adversary the keys to the castle of 21st century global technological dominance. Doing so will enable Chinese leadership in artificial intelligence, infusing the Chinese military with the technological advantage it needs to continue hostile operations across the globe," the Democratic statement claimed. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly shot back in a statement to Fox News Digital: "Democrats enabled and applauded Joe Biden’s weakness when they denied the Wuhan lab leak theory and allowed a spy balloon to surveil our country." "President Trump is putting America First, and his strategy is working — China is sending rare earth magnets to the United States, and tariffs are rapidly leveling the playing field for American industries. This President is successful because he will look anyone in the eye to negotiate better deals for our country, and he will continue to advance American interests, such as bolstering our economy and stopping the flow of fentanyl into our communities." SCHUMER CALLS ON FBI TO CONDUCT COUNTERINTELLIGENCE THREAT ASSESSMENT ON EPSTEIN FILES Last week, the Trump administration reversed a ban on selling Nvidia’s lower-powered H20 chips to China to power its artificial intelligence, arguing they were only the U.S.’ "fourth-best chip." (Ton Molina/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The U.S. and China concluded their third round of high-level trade talks on Tuesday, ahead of an August 12 deadline after which the steep China tariffs Trump announced in April are expected to kick in. Trump told reporters Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent felt "very good" about the meeting, but it’s unclear yet if the two sides reached any solid agreements — or plan to extend the August deadline. Trump, the Democrats claimed, "is emboldening Beijing to take aggressive actions and seek even more aggressive concessions in whatever trade negotiations may follow."

Title: BlackRock Staking For Its Spot Ethereum ETF Has Been Acknowledged — But What’s Coming For ETH?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged a Nasdaq filing proposing an amendment to BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). This proposal seeks to enable the ETF to stake its Ethereum holdings, allowing it to participate in the ETH proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and potentially earn staking rewards. BlackRock just received regulatory acknowledgment to include staking in its Spot Ethereum ETF. As mentioned by Çağrı Yaşar on X, acknowledging the filing isn’t a minor regulatory checkbox. It’s the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) handing institutions a key, and not just to ETH price action, but to its engine. This staking isn’t about price speculation. It’s about alignment, incentives, governance, and yield. Unlike traditional asset holding, staking involves actively securing the network by validating transactions and supporting ETH’s consensus. With recent regulatory approvals allowing BlackRock and other institutions to include staking in Spot ETH ETFs, this will enable Wall Street to hold ETH as a speculative asset. Thus, they can begin earning from the yield generated by the ETH core protocol mechanics, and integrate deeply into the network infrastructure. However, if ETH staking becomes ETF-native, it will redefine what it means to invest in a financial network. ETH would become the first global-scale digital infrastructure where traditional capital markets not only invest, but they become active participants in the protocol. The SEC has effectively validated ETH’s consensus model as not only secure but worthy of institutional involvement. This is how empires shift, and not with headlines, but with details no one expected. This highlights that major shifts in power or systems don’t always announce themselves loudly. Instead, they often happen quietly, through small regulatory changes. ETH isn’t becoming Wall Street-friendly. Wall Street is becoming ETH-compatible. This is when a new technology enters mainstream finance, and people assume it’s being reshaped to fit traditional systems. Furthermore, Yaşar noted that the network effect has just turned financial. This means that the value of a network grows as more participants join. In an X post, VirtualBacon stated that BlackRock and JPMorgan aren’t investing in Ethereum for speculative hype or short-term price gains. Instead, their focus lies on ETH’s growing role as a foundational platform for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has been unequivocal about his vision for ETH’s future, stating that he aims to tokenize stocks and build investment funds directly on the ETH blockchain. This marks a significant institutional endorsement of ETH as a platform for next-generation finance. Meanwhile, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan has softened his previously cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, especially following recent regulatory clarity provided by initiatives under the GENIUS Act. This shift signals growing openness among traditional financial leaders to integrate blockchain technology into mainstream finance. My name is Sandra White. I am a graduate.

Title: Ethereum sets sight on becoming the ‘global computer’ in the next 10 years

Ethereum aims to be the backbone of the digital world across AI, robotics, and decentralized infrastructure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ten years ago, Ethereum was little more than an idea on Reddit. Today, it stands as one of the most significant technological innovations in modern finance. Co-founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, Ethereum began with a vision to move beyond Bitcoin’s perceived limitations. That vision sparked interest from fellow technologists, including Gavin Wood, who would go on to write the Ethereum Yellow Paper, a key technical document that helped legitimize the project. In mid-2014, long before Ethereum became a household name in crypto, the Ethereum Foundation launched a public presale. ETH was sold at an initial fixed exchange rate of 2,000 ETH per BTC, gradually decreasing over 42 days to 1,337 ETH per BTC. The sale raised over 31,000 BTC, valued at roughly $18.3 million at the time, and distributed 60 million ETH. Those funds laid the foundation for Ethereum’s network development and community growth. Since then, Ethereum has grown into the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization. It has powered countless innovations, from DeFi and NFTs to Layer-2 scaling and zero-knowledge proofs. The network has also undergone major milestones, including the DAO crisis, the hard fork that followed, and The Merge, which transitioned Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Joseph Lubin, Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder, highlighted the protocol’s resilience during these 10 years, saying: “Ethereum has demonstrated non-stop uptime, proving itself as the definition of antifragile. It has continually evolved to serve as a reliable trust layer for our fast-growing digital world.” Lubin also noted that Ethereum’s appeal now extends far beyond the crypto-native world. Financial giants like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Visa have begun building on the network, attracted by its programmability and security. He noted: “Ethereum offers a borderless, transparent, and decentralized financial architecture, opening up entirely new avenues of growth and innovation and enabling far greater economic and political agency for people and communities.” Ethereum Foundation Co-Executive Director Tomasz Stańczak believes the network is poised to play a central role in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and decentralized infrastructure. According to him, Ethereum aims to be the backbone of a more secure, open, and programmable digital world over the coming decade. He said: “Ethereum is designed for this future. Privacy. Censorship resistance. Security. Open source at the root. These are not features, they’re values. That’s why people come to Ethereum to build their dreams” Co-Executive Director Hsiao-Wei Wang echoed this vision, stating that Ethereum will become a “global computer” seamlessly embedded in daily life. However, Wang noted that realizing this vision will require a balance between innovation and stability, scalability and accessibility, privacy and affordability. The executive said: “As we grow, the ecosystem must maintain its commitment to where it started: decentralized & robust network, permissionless applications, & global open-source contribution. Winning will not rely on any single entity. Resilience is created by the growth of the whole community.” Meanwhile, Lubin also stated that: “Beyond finance, Ethereum will serve as critical infrastructure for the next wave of innovation across networks of decentralized social graphs, stablecoins, decentralized identity systems, decentralized physical infrastructure, data marketplaces and autonomous AI agents.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Let Banking Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Adam Cohen will join the OCC from the law firm Skadden. He’s previously held roles at both the CFTC and Federal Reserve. Former SoFi general counsel Adam Cohen has been tapped to become the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel. Cohen, who will join the OCC from the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP on Aug. 11, spent two years at SoFi from 2022 to 2024, according to his LinkedIn profile, joining shortly after the fintech obtained its charter from the OCC. He also previously served as counsel to the banking regulation and policy group of the Federal Reserve Board, and for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s division of clearing and risk, according to his Skadden bio. “Adam’s unparalleled background in banking law and regulation, together with his depth of hands-on experience working on financial services matters as a regulator, in-house general counsel, and external advisor bring tremendous value to the OCC,” said Comptroller Jonathan Gould in a press announcement Wednesday. Cohen will oversee the regulator’s legal arm, providing analyses and advisory services on bank supervision, enforcement, administrative, litigation and licensing actions. He will also advise on policy and operations initiatives within the OCC, will serve on its executive committee and will provide advice to Gould and other senior OCC executives. “Adding a seasoned professional of Adam’s caliber to the OCC’s executive committee strengthens the agency’s efforts to ensure a safe and sound federal banking system, improve bank supervision and regulation, embrace innovation, and promote fair access to financial services,” Gould said. At Skadden, Cohen co-leads the firm’s financial institutions regulatory group, advising global and regional banks, fintech and other financial institutions on regulatory matters such as mergers and acquisitions, charters, stablecoin and digital asset issues and compliance. He advised BlackRock on its $12 billion acquisition of HPS Investment Partners, completed earlier this month, and its $3 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, completed in October. Last year, he also advised Citi on its separation of Banamex and Fortress Investment Group on its investment in bank holding company First Foundation. “Although I am sad to be leaving my colleagues at Skadden, who are among the best and most dedicated lawyers in the business, I am honored to be appointed as the next Chief Counsel of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,” Cohen wrote on LinkedIn. “I am thankful to Comptroller Jonathan Gould for the opportunity to support a safe and sound banking system that embraces innovation and promotes fair access to financial services,” he wrote.

Title: Ripple CTO reveals why the firm is not currently using XRPL DEX for payments

Ripple CTO envisions permissioned features as key to unlocking XRPL DEX for payments. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has revealed that regulatory risks are the main reason why the company and its partners have not embraced the XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX) for payment settlements. The statement came in response to a user on X (formerly Twitter) who questioned the DEX’s underwhelming activity despite Ripple’s wide-ranging institutional partnerships. According to the community, the network has over a decade of development behind it and more than 300 financial partners. As a result, it is expected to facilitate far greater on-chain volume than it is currently processing. In his post on X, Schwartz acknowledged the slow progress, attributing it to institutional reluctance around public liquidity pools. He said: “Institutions have historically preferred to use digital assets off-chain rather than on-chain. I think we’re close to changing that because institutions are starting to see the benefits of moving on-chain.” Schwartz also pointed out a key concern in the difficulty of verifying liquidity sources on an open DEX. In his words, Ripple currently avoids using the XRPL because “we can’t be sure a terrorist won’t provide the liquidity for payment.” Considering this, Ripple or its counterpart engaging with the DEX poses serious legal and reputational risks without reliable controls. To address these concerns, Schwartz highlighted ongoing efforts to introduce permissioned features. One such tool under development, permissioned domains, could help institutions identify trustworthy liquidity providers, potentially unlocking safer use of on-chain payment rails. Despite the issues Schwartz cited, the Ripple CTO expressed a belief that traditional financial institutional players like BlackRock might find it more efficient to build on existing networks like XRPL, rather than create standalone blockchains from scratch. He cited Circle’s USDC strategy as a prime example of this trend. Instead of launching its own blockchain, Circle deployed its stablecoin across multiple public networks to leverage scale, interoperability, and existing liquidity. According to Schwartz, these traits position XRPL as a strong candidate for future enterprise-grade tokenization projects. He argued that public chains offer the kind of asset mobility and infrastructure depth that private solutions struggle to match. BlackRock has already entered the space through Ethereum. Its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, has amassed over $2.4 billion in assets, making it the largest of its kind. Schwartz suggested that this precedent may hint at how future institutions could use XRPL in similar ways, provided compliance features catch up. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Remember in 1963 they screamed that the 5 shot bolt action Army Surplus Rifle was “evil” because it was “military” and needed to be banned, which it was from 1968 to the 1980s when it was finally admitted it was not an “evil” rifle.

Title: ‘Point Of No Return’—Fed ‘Doom Loop’ Dollar Crisis Predicted To Trigger ‘Critical’ Bitcoin Price Shock

Time Published: 2025-07-30T11:30:03Z
Full Content:
ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 07/31 update below. This post was originally published on July 30 Bitcoin and crypto prices have soared this year, with the combined crypto market topping $4 trillion amid a Satoshi Nakamoto-era bombshell. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price, up almost double from this time last year, hit an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin earlier this month and is braced for an Elon Musk shock after his rocket company SpaceX set alarm bells ringing. Now, as traders bet on a new “infinite money glitch," legendary billionaire Ray Dalio has recommended a 15% bitcoin or gold portfolio allocation, warning the Federal Reserve has been caught up in debt “doom loop" and that the dollar is past the “point of no return.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “We are at the at the point of no return because we’ll be having more debt,” Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said on The Master Investor Podcast and calling the situation in the U.S., the U.K. and other countries a “doom loop.” "How do you pay all this debt and all this debt service plus everything else? The only way to do that is for the government to create debt and borrow that money to pay and the central bank printing the money." U.S. debt has skyrocketed in recent years following huge government spending through Covid-era lockdowns, with interest rates that were rapidly hiked to rein in inflation adding to the cost of servicing the ballooning $37 trillion U.S. debt pile. 07/30 update: The Federal Reserve has left interest rates on hold, as the market had expected it would do, though governor Christopher Waller and Fed vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman voted for a cut, the largest number of dissenting votes by Fed officials in just over three decades. “If we cut rates too soon, maybe we didn’t finish the job with inflation. History is dotted with examples of that,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said during a press conference. “If you cut too late, then maybe you’re doing unnecessary damage to the labor market.” Earlier, data showed the U.S. economy grew at a stronger-than-expected pace in the second quarter as a growing trade balance and renewed consumer optimism propelled GDP to 3% for the three months from April through to the end of June. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market have climbed following the Fed’s interest rate decision, with one crypto company executive dismissing interest rate-led market swings as noise. “Institutions are in a race, for some it’s existential, for relevance in the next-gen financial internet,” Johnny Garcia, managing director of institutional growth and capital markets at VeChain, said in emailed comments, adding the "chatter and excitement around the direction of Fed rates is centrally focused on looking for buoy to send crypto prices higher–not about fundamental adoption.” Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have exploded onto Wall Street and into company’s treasuries in recent years, with companies led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy and bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) sucking up around 2.5 million of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist. “Nothing is stopping this train; least of all short-term one-off market-based factors such as the U.S. Federal funds rate," Garcia said. "When markets take into consideration the effect of central bank lending rates, it’s through the following perspective lens: current state and the direction of financial conditions and secondly expected economic activity as a result.” Tesla billionaire Elon Musk hit the campaign trail for U.S. president Donald Trump last year, issuing doomsday warnings over the spiraling U.S. debt pile and this year falling out with Trump over his failure to rein in spending. Musk called the dollar “hopeless" earlier this month, posting to his social media platform X that his new America Party would use bitcoin over so-called fiat currency. Dalio went on to advise investors to allocate at least 15% of their portfolios to gold or bitcoin, going far beyond the 2% bitcoin allocation recommended by BlackRock, which has found phenomenal success with its $85 billion spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). “[If] you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or bitcoin,” Dalio said, with his comments cheered by those in the bitcoin and crypto world. “The man has a point,” the X account of crypto asset manager Bitwise posted alongside a chart of U.S. debt shown soaring to around $35 trillion. “Dalio is merely suggesting putting a small portion of your deposit into time-tested assets, just like major funds do,” Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, said in emailed comments. “15% of a portfolio is a rather small share—after all, the remaining 85% can be invested however you like. Both gold and bitcoin are considered safe-haven assets in times of high inflation. Gold needs no introduction as it’s a historically protected asset. And bitcoin is often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ especially given the way regulation is evolving and how banks and governments plan to use it."

"The timing is critical. Spot bitcoin ETFs, and now ethereum ETFs, which have seen over $5 billion in flows in the past month and outpaced bitcoin on several days, continue to absorb institutional demand. With regulatory clarity taking shape and a coordinated federal stance now emerging, institutional adoption may accelerate meaningfully.” Mena added he believes the bitcoin price could soar be catapulted as high as $150,000 per bitcoin within the next couple of months if the Trump administration makes a “strong declaration around the strategic bitcoin reserve” Trump ordered the creation of in March.

Title: BlackRock Goes Heavy on Ethereum: Buys 4x More ETH Than BTC

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum has entered a volatile and decisive phase following weeks of strong buying pressure and rapid price appreciation. After pushing above $3,800, ETH is now facing resistance, with bulls stepping in to defend key lower demand zones. The market appears uncertain, caught between a potential continuation toward new highs and the risk of a broader cooldown. Adding to the momentum, new data from Arkham reveals that BlackRock purchased over four times more Ethereum than Bitcoin last week. This shift marks a significant moment for institutional involvement in Ethereum and signals growing confidence in its long-term potential. Analysts across the industry are beginning to take note, interpreting the move as a signal that Ethereum may be gaining favor among traditional finance giants. As Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs, Ethereum now stands at a crossroads. Will it continue climbing and close the gap, or will rejection above $3,800 mark the beginning of a local top? Arkham data has revealed a significant development in institutional crypto allocation: BlackRock purchased over $1.2 billion worth of Ethereum last week, compared to just $267 million in Bitcoin. This 4.5x disparity signals a decisive shift in institutional strategy, with capital now flowing more aggressively into ETH than BTC. For many in the market, this is what true institutional Ethereum adoption looks like—massive inflows that reshape market dynamics. This shift didn’t start overnight. Institutional interest in Ethereum began building back in April, when ETH hit a cycle low near $1,380. Since then, a combination of legal clarity, progress around ETF approval, and Ethereum’s maturing role in the financial ecosystem has fueled a steady wave of accumulation from large players. BlackRock’s latest allocation is simply the most visible and significant confirmation of that trend. As the broader crypto market heats up, Ethereum appears well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory. However, not everything is straightforward. ETH is now struggling to break through resistance around the $3,800 level, and the failure to reclaim new highs is beginning to stir uncertainty. Some analysts warn that the current rally may lose steam without a breakout, and fear of a short-term correction is growing. Ethereum has staged an impressive rally over the past few weeks, surging from sub-$2,000 levels to a current price of $3,782.61. The weekly chart shows a strong bullish breakout from the $2,852.16 resistance zone, with ETH now approaching a critical barrier near $3,860.80. Price briefly reached a high of $3,941.86 before pulling back, signaling potential short-term exhaustion after an aggressive upside move. Volume has increased significantly during this breakout, confirming strong buying interest. The 50, 100, and 200-week SMAs—all converging around $2,700–$2,850—now serve as key support, reinforcing the strength of the breakout. As long as ETH remains above the $2,850 level, the broader structure remains bullish. However, the current pause below $3,860 suggests indecision as bulls encounter historical resistance. A clean weekly close above this level could open the door to a continuation toward $4,200–$4,400. On the downside, a rejection followed by a drop below $3,500 may trigger a short-term correction as traders secure profits.

Title: Microsoft, Meta Face Investor Scrutiny Over AI Spending Binge

(Bloomberg) -- Earnings season for a handful of megacap tech firms has morphed into capex season with the AI arms race showing no signs of slowing. Focus will be on how much the behemoths Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. plan to dish out to keep up with competitors like Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. as they build out infrastructure and software to power artificial intelligence applications. The answer — estimated at around $70 billion in each company’s current fiscal year — may matter more to investors than actual profits and will go a long way to determining whether blistering rallies in the shares will persist. Both report after the close Wednesday. For nearly two years now, investors have continued to shower Big Tech with cash as the companies churned out lavish profits and then reinvested hundreds of billions of dollars into AI. Now, with Microsoft and Meta having notched rallies north of 40% from April lows, analysts worry massive outlays without corresponding AI profits could dent investor enthusiasm. “If a company is saying, maybe we’ll see an AI benefit in five years, we’re no longer at the point where that will get a pass,” Gabriela Santos, chief strategist for the Americas at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in an interview. “Valuations are mattering more and more, and valuation especially matters if a company can’t grow sales as fast as expected, or as quickly as capex.” Microsoft is expected to report about $18 billion in capital spending in the quarter ended June 30, an increase of nearly 30% from a year ago. Sales at the software giant are forecast to rise 14%. Meta, meanwhile, is expected to show $16.4 billion in spending, double from the year-ago period, while revenue will rise 15%, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Last week provided a hopeful marker for Big Tech bulls. Alphabet shares rose as the company boosted its capex forecast 13% to $85 billion after delivering better-than-expected earnings. A gain in the week erased what had been a loss in 2025. The bar is likely higher for Meta and Microsoft when it comes to spending, not least because their shares have rallied about 20% this year versus Alphabet’s 3.4% gain. They also have different approaches to AI than Alphabet’s search-driven focus, with Microsoft teaming with OpenAI and Meta trying to develop “super intelligence” with an army of engineers, lured with massive pay packages. Last quarter, AI spending proved somewhat beneficial. Meta’s strength was credited to AI improving ad targeting, and Microsoft saw a similar tailwind with its cloud business. “Microsoft is investing aggressively into AI, which looks like the right strategy if you have a long-term view on the stock,” Daniel Flax, a senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, said. Santos struck a more cautious tone specifically on AI outlays. “We’re really honing in on margins this quarter,” she said. “It is still all about ROI, and what companies can grow their sales faster than what they’re invested into AI capex.” With capex swelling at both companies, neither can afford to falter in the businesses that have generated billions in cash flow in recent years — a misstep Flax thinks both can avoid. “Microsoft is executing extremely well on its cloud opportunity,” he said. Azure, the OpenAI investment, and AI assistant “Copilot” should ease worries about spending, said Krishna Chintalapalli, portfolio manager and tech sector head at Parnassus Investments. “Those are all huge and growing businesses, and Microsoft seems like it has less risk in its non-AI business, where there is steady recurring revenue,” he said. Meta’s AI bets also make sense to investors. The company has “multiple ways to earn a return on AI spending,” according to Michael McKinnon, who manages more than $40 billion as a portfolio manager at Artisan Partners and holds Meta shares. He cited the ability to improve efficiency and increase both user engagement and the return on ad spend for its customers as ways for AI to drive growth, in addition to the ability to create new business categories, such as with its smart glasses. This is a “very different kind of spending than what we saw a couple years ago, when it was spending $20 billion on Reality Labs,” which was a “low-probability bet that didn’t justify the level of investment Meta was throwing at it.” Still, with trillion-dollar valuations and P/E ratios near or above long-term averages, investors will likely remain cautious as the results roll in. Option-derived implied moves for the shares following the reports are relatively muted, with Microsoft at 3.9% and Meta at 5.8%. “Historically, high or rising capex is a negative factor, but the more profitable the company is, the more it turns into a positive factor,” said Tony DeSpirito, global chief investment officer of BlackRock Fundamental Equities. “That’s why these big tech companies are getting treated differently than another company might.” Top Tech Stories Earnings Due Wednesday --With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.

Title: 50 Over 50: Investment

As Taxbit’s CEO since 2023, Lindsey Argalas’ expertise in fintech and consumer technology is meeting the rising demand for accounting and tax services for blockchain, crypto and tokenized assets. The Salt Lake City-based unicorn (it has some $235 million in funding) addresses the crypto-related tax needs of exchanges, institutional investors and governments alike. Prior to Taxbit, Argalas was the chief digital and innovation officer at Banco Santander and chaired Santander Innoventures, the bank’s $200 million fintech venture capital arm. TIAA manages the savings of nearly five million customers, but it’s a family story that CEO Thasunda Brown Duckett shares to raise the issue of retirement planning literacy. Her father, Otis Brown, worked for more than 30 years at a warehouse job and didn’t contribute to his 401(k) plan, leaving years of savings, a company match and returns on the table. Since taking the top job at the $1.3 trillion AUM institution in 2021, Duckett has advocated for retirement education and planning services to address the glaring gap in savings. This month, Kate Burke was promoted to the CEO role at Allspring Global Investments, which has more than $600 billion in assets under advisement and 1,325 employees across 19 offices worldwide. Burke joined Charlotte-based Allspring in 2023 as president after 18 years at AllianceBernstein, where she shepherded the firm’s move from New York to Nashville—one of the largest of the industry’s southern migrations. Allspring was spun out of Wells Fargo’s asset management business in 2021. As co-CEO and managing partner of Golden Seeds, Jo Ann Corkran oversees an investor group of more than 300 members that focuses on funding women-led businesses. Founded in 2005, the group is one of the most active angel investment organizations in the U.S. and has invested over $185 million in over 257 women-led startups. Corkran also is a general partner at two Golden Seeds venture funds and was previously a managing director at Credit Suisse Asset Management. After her public breakup with Morgan Stanley in 2007 (which resulted in her resignation as co-president following a 25-year career there) Zoe Cruz found her stride a decade later in the digital asset space, first as an advisor at Ripple Labs and then, in 2020, as founder of Menai Financial Group. Her firm has two offerings: one product that offers diversified exposure to digital assets, and a strategy that helps identify the top 20 to 40 most compelling investments out of more than 15,000 cryptocurrencies. Stephanie Drescher’s grandmother had no schooling beyond 8th grade but followed the markets every day, inspiring her granddaughter to a career in finance. Drescher joined Apollo Global Management, with its more than $785 billion AUM, in 2004 after a decade at JP Morgan, primarily in the alternative investment group. Today, Drescher is in charge of a division of about 130 colleagues in its global wealth business, and she leads Apollo’s Expanding Opportunity Steering Committee as well as the company’s women’s network. She is also on the board of the girls’ college access organization Student Leadership Network. At 54, Molly Duffy took over Standard Chartered’s multi-billion-dollar client segment and, in creating two new growth strategies—one in the public sector and one that doubles down in working with other banks, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds—turned the division into a business that drives 51% of Standard Chartered’s overall Corporate and Investment Banking income. “This chapter has brought together everything I’ve learned so far,” Duffy, who spent 12 years at Credit Suisse before joining Standard Chartered in 2017, told Forbes. “I’m proud that it all came together in a role I wouldn’t have been ready for at 40 but was prepared to fully lead at 54.” Monica Brand Engel leads Quona's Africa, MENA and cross-border investment strategy with a focus on investing in technologies that expand access to quality financial services in emerging markets. Engel, who is half Peruvian and half American, has said “never quite fitting in” helps her spot opportunities that also deliver on impact. “Our goal is to bring what’s on the margins into the mainstream,” she said. With 68 active portfolio companies and a team of nine nationalities speaking 20 languages, Quona has nearly $800 million in assets under management. Samara Epstein Cohen is BlackRock’s chief investment officer leading the teams managing some $7.8 trillion of the company’s index funds and ETFs. In this position, she’s been responsible for the launch of the firm’s target date ETFs in 2023, the only suite of target date ETFs in the U.S. specifically geared towards people without access to a 401(k). BlackRock was a homecoming of sorts: Cohen rejoined the firm in 2015 after starting her career there in 1993 as an analyst. Cohen went on to spend nearly two decades at Goldman Sachs, where she built and led the global market transition team, guiding clients through the changing regulatory landscape following the 2008 financial crisis. Two-time Forbes Midas lister Jennifer Fonstad has spent nearly 30 years in venture capital and has helped fund some of the world’s most influential tech companies. Her early jobs gave her a hand in investing in companies like SpaceX, Athenahealth and Hotmail. She co-founded Owl Capital in 2019 to focus on early-stage startups; the firm has since had nine IPOs, 25 M&A exits and over 600 financings. Fonstad started her career teaching math in sub-Saharan Africa. Owl Capital bills itself as the first investment firm to commit 5% of its carry profit pool to the communities where the entrepreneurs it supports live. Named after the first U.S. birth control clinic that opened in Brooklyn in 1916, Amboy Street Ventures invests in early-stage startups in sexual and reproductive health products and services. Colleen Foster joined Amboy Street in 2022 after more than 20 years at Goldman Sachs, where she was a partner managing a global commodities franchise of more than $1 billion. Foster also has a long tenure of working on behalf of Planned Parenthood (she currently sits on its board of its telehealth platform). “The economics of investing in women and their healthcare from puberty to post-menopause produce outsized returns,” Foster said when Amboy Street closed its debut $20 million fund two years ago. Lori Heinel assumed the role overseeing a worldwide team of more than 600 in 2021. She’s since led the revamping of State Street’s operating model and deployed technologies to focus it on strategic priorities. Last year, State Street posted record returns, with total revenues climbing 13% year-over-year to an all-time high of $2.3 billion; AUM grew by 15% to $4.7 trillion. Heinel’s also been lauded for advocating for women in the industry, once writing in an International Women’s Day essay: “Fearless girls are made not born, and we all have a common interest in creating more of them.” Kristin Hull embraces the role of “activist investor,” pushing companies like Tesla and Apple on workplace, environmental and social justice issues. Growing up in San Francisco and learning trading at her father’s successful market-making firm, Hull founded Nia Impact Capital the year she turned 50. “I wanted to make it easier for women to invest for positive returns and for positive impact,” she says. She’s grown the firm to almost $500 million under management across three investment portfolios and a mutual fund. Kimberly Johnson leads technology, global investment operations and client account services and several other operating teams for T. Rowe Price, an international management firm with $1.68 trillion in assets under management. She joined the financial services holding company three years ago after leading a team of 3,600—and an operating budget of $1.4 billion—at mortgage lender Fannie Mae. An alum of Princeton University, Johnson joined its board of trustees in 2023. Yvette Kanouff is the first (and, so far, only) woman to win a Lifetime Achievement Emmy for television engineering and technology and is an inductee to the Cable Hall of Fame. She’s now putting her expertise to work for startups as a partner at JC2 Ventures, the firm founded by former Cisco CEO and chairman John Chambers. “JC2 Ventures is a very different type of venture capital fund,” she said. With 18 current companies in the JC2 portfolio and a total of eight IPOs and acquisitions, the firm says 40% of the companies in its portfolio are deemed unicorns. Freada Kapor Klein started her career in activism, founding the nation’s first organization dedicated to fighting sexual harassment in 1976. It was through “following the trail to the center of power, which leads to money,” that she landed in Silicon Valley. She and her husband, Mitch Kapor, cofounded early-stage venture firm Kapor Capital in 1999 and, in 2011, changed its strategy to exclusively invest in mission-oriented startups. Between that year and 2017, the firm achieved a 29% internal rate of return, and today, Kapor Klein says, the firm continues to achieve “top quartile returns.” In the last three years, seven of its portfolio companies—including Gusto, Formlabs and Newsela—have reached unicorn status. A member of the charter class of Kauffman Fellows, Karen Kerr went on to found Exposition Ventures in 2019, an investment firm inspired by the Chicago World’s Fair that served as a showcase for the Second Industrial Revolution. With a doctorate in physical chemistry from the University of Chicago (she supported herself during her PhD by consulting for investors ARCH Venture Partners), Kerr’s firm has backed companies in 3D printing, robotics, virtual reality and AI that are crucial to advanced manufacturing in the future. Nataliya Kofman has led the $2.3 billion Vanguard Global Wellington Fund since its 2017 inception and co-leads the firm’s quality equity team. The fund has outperformed its benchmark and the category average every year for the past eight. Kofman has said she developed her global perspective on managing risk growing up in Ukraine and in her first career as a mechanical engineer at Ford Motor Company. There she was part of the team responsible for the launch of the F150 pickup and where she said she honed her skills in analytical thinking and structured decision-making. Colette Kress joined semiconductor giant Nvidia in September 2013, long before it became a $4.2 trillion (market cap) publicly-traded company known for being the backbone of the artificial intelligence revolution. Kress has overseen a historic revenue growth over the last decade–Nvidia recorded $60.9 billion in revenue in 2024, a fifteen-fold growth from a decade ago. Prior to Nvidia, she spent 13 years at Microsoft and three years as CFO at a Cisco division. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says retirement is still years away, but speculation that Marianne Lake will be his successor grows more persistent with each move she makes. Lake recently assumed leadership of international consumer banking and JPMorgan’s strategic growth office. When she spoke at the annual Investor Day in May, Wall Street analysts took note of the full hour she was allotted as much as her message (every other senior executive, including Dimon, was given just 30 minutes to speak). Lake oversees services for 85 million consumers and seven million small businesses. She’s the co-founder of the bank’s Women on the Move program to expand women-run businesses. Most consumers might never recognize the name “Nacha,” but the independent, not-for-profit organization governs the ACH Network, the system of direct deposits and payments that reach all U.S. bank and credit union accounts. That gives Larimer oversight of the staggering 33.6 billion payments (volume in 2024), transactions whose value added up to $86.2 trillion. Larimer was the organization’s first in-house legal counsel when she joined Nacha in 1996 and she took over as CEO in 2019. She’s the granddaughter of the first woman to run a Wall Street brokerage firm, Sayra Fischer Lebenthal, and the daughter of municipal bond legend Jim Lebenthal. And while the family is credited with democratizing bonds as an investment for the masses, there’s been no glide path for its third generation. Alexandra Lebenthal now focuses on advising women-led firms through her leadership role at the $171 billion (AUM) Rockefeller Capital Management. “I’ve been in their shoes,” she says. “Having your name on the door isn’t always easy.” Saira Malik is a member of Nuveen’s executive management team and leads a business with more than $1 trillion in global assets under management across equities, fixed income, private placements, green capital, infrastructure and product. She learned about investments from her mother, who picked stocks as a hobby, and Malik started publishing her own markets newsletter as a college student. She joined Nuveen in 2003 and was named to her current role in 2022. She also continues to write a weekly newsletter. Anna Marrs joined American Express six years ago and oversees relationships with millions of businesses that accept Amex, as well as strategic payment, banking and fintech relationships and credit fraud and risk operations. Her team has more than 6,500 employees and accounts for about a quarter of Amex’s revenue — a record $65.9 billion in 2024. She also serves on the board of DocuSign and on the governing body of the London Business School, where she earned an MBA. In the role since 2020, Kara McShane put Wells Fargo at the top of an array of industry rankings — currently the second-largest commercial real estate lender— amid a challenging market for the sector by building greater collaboration with other bank divisions. That’s given her wide visibility as a banking role model. “I recognize the unique challenges women face and pride myself on being a mentor and leader that walks the walk, helping elevate women throughout their careers,” she said. Oxeon takes a unique approach to building healthcare companies and its own business: It searches for executive talent, invests in healthcare innovation and, as an employee-owned company, shares the equity and returns from its more than $100 million portfolio. Sonia Millsom became Oxeon’s CEO in 2022 and has further expanded Oxeon’s influence as a founding sponsor of Break into the Boardroom, an organization that places women on the boards of healthcare companies. Christina Minnis works at what she calls the “convergence of public and private markets” that is reshaping capital flows to meet the demands in high-need markets such as technology, power and infrastructure. She’s part of Goldman Sachs’ newly formed Capital Solutions Group, with $145 billion in alternative assets and a focus on financing large deals for corporate clients. A former All-American squash player at Yale, Minnis has been in leadership at the banking giant since 1998. Ileana Musa was recruited to Morgan Stanley in 2017 to focus on the firm’s high-net-worth clients. Today she does that through co-leading the bank’s international wealth management business and its international lending operations. She also heads up a Morgan Stanley national initiative to empower the Latino community in building generational wealth through homeownership and entrepreneurship. Born in Cuba and immigrating to the U.S. as a toddler with her mother and siblings, it’s a personal story for Musa. She’s said she continually draws inspiration from her late mother, who supported her family, put her children through college and then earned her own business degree at 70. Racquel Oden joined HSBC last year to lead the bank’s wealth management, global private banking and retail businesses in the U.S. at a time when it wanted to better focus on globally connected, high-net-worth clients. Oden came to HSBC USA from JPMorgan Chase, where she was responsible for its consumer banking network expansion; previous stints included Merrill Lynch, UBS and Morgan Stanley. The daughter of Jamaican immigrants who was the first in her family to attend college, Oden chairs the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, which raises millions for scholarships and mentoring. She’s the first African American woman in her current role. A former group chairman at Johnson & Johnson, Sandra Peterson leads health and consumer investments in North America and Europe at CD&R. It’s the 9th largest private equity firm in the world, and its funds have raised nearly $50 billion over the past five years. Peterson joined the firm in 2019 and has since had a hand in some of its most significant transactions, including one with French multinational health company Opella; Zephyr AI, which advances precision medicine for oncology and cardiometabolic diseases; and Cynosure, which is developing technology for non-invasive and minimally invasive procedures. She’s been an independent director on Microsoft’s board since 2015. A member of BNY’s executive committee, Emily Portney leads its largest unit, Asset Servicing, delivering custody, fund services, as well as middle office and data solutions to asset owners, investment managers, insurers, banks and broker-dealers. She previously served as the chief financial officer for BNY, the first woman to hold the role. BNY has more than $55 trillion in assets under custody and administration. Her career also includes the CFO role at Barclays International and more than 20 years at JPMorgan Chase. There’s more than $251 billion sitting in donor-advised funds (charitable investment accounts), and Jennifer Risher thinks that money can be put to better use sooner. Risher, also an impact investor, cofounded #HalfMyDAF with her husband, Lyft CEO David Risher, to challenge those with DAFs to spend down a portion of their holdings by a specific date and be eligible for matching funds from #HalfMyDAF. The effort, which she promotes through national speaking engagements and outreach, has moved more than $75 million to nonprofits, she says. As Mastercard’s chief commercial payments officer, Raj Seshadri leads the firm’s commercial cards business, B2B payables, healthcare payment services, non-card payments, remittances and disbursements. It’s a role that takes on both the complexities of the global payments system and also closer-to-home issues of small businesses in emerging economies, modernizing transactions and migrant workers sending money to their families back home—issues her division has been addressing through new technologies and innovation. Seshadri first joined Mastercard in 2016 after tenures at BlackRock, Citi and McKinsey. She’s a physicist by training with a PhD in the field from Harvard. Susan Sheffield ascended to the top of the nation’s largest originators of auto loans and leases this year after serving as executive vice president and chief financial officer since 2018. The Fort Worth, Texas-based company is the third-largest U.S. auto financier (based on outstanding balances) and originated a combined $56 billion in retail loans and operating leases in 2024. Sheffield started her career in corporate and commercial banking and is known for championing financial literacy, including the KEYS by GM Financial program. In just over three years, Tamara Steffens has more than doubled Thomson Reuters Venture Fund to $250 million and overseen investments in companies such as Spellbook, Payflow, TrueWind and Materia, as well as six exits. Earlier in her career, she scaled teams at six startups and says one of her most significant post-50 accomplishments was Microsoft’s 2014 acquisition of email app Acompli, a sale she negotiated as the startup’s senior vice president of business development. She later joined M12, Microsoft’s venture fund, leading its Female Founders Fund competition. Razor’s Edge Ventures cofounder Peggy Styer invests in growth-stage national security companies, yielding over $1 billion in returns in the last five years. Styer previously cofounded and led Blackbird Technologies, an enemy tracking and tagging tech acquired by Raytheon in 2014 for $420 million. She also cofounded and served as CEO of mobile communications company RavenWing, acquired by Boeing in 2008. Her first innovation was a “fortune-telling machine” she built in middle school, she once shared in an interview. An executive with a “Rubik’s Cube of healthcare knowledge,” Lisa Suennen leads American Heart Association Ventures as its managing partner, a role she took on in 2024. Suennen oversees $200 million in assets and invests in businesses and organizations with the aim of bridging the funding gap between research and practice across the cardiovascular and brain health sectors. Suennen also founded CSweetener in 2016, a nonprofit network that offers mentorships for women in healthcare, which was acquired by the HLTH Foundation in 2019. Kat Taylor set out to create a new kind of bank in 2007—one with a community-first mission—after watching how income and wealth inequality left too many parts of society at a disadvantage. Beneficial State Bank, Beneficial State Bank, which is owned by a nonprofit required to distribute excess funds to underserved communities, has since grown to $1.8 billion in assets (as of 2023). Outside of her work with the bank, Taylor was part of the coalition behind the creation of the California Consumer Financial Protection Law and the DFPI, one of the strongest state consumer protections and bank regulatory agencies in the country. Anne Walsh grew up the daughter of an investor, where business talk occurred around the dinner table. “I actually knew and understood bond math in the sixth grade,” she has said. At Guggenheim, she guides the firm’s investment strategies for its more than $349 billion in total assets. Walsh’s career in financial services spans nearly four decades, and she currently serves on the Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets, an advisory group to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on economic and public policy. The Clearing House is a banking association and payments company owned by the largest commercial banks in the U.S. It is the oldest of its kind in the nation and processes more than $2 trillion each day through wire, bank-to-bank transfers, check images and the real-time payments network. As its chief operating officer, Sheffali Welch plays a key role in the internal operations and strategy for what she describes as the “rails” of the nation’s banking system. Her career includes tenures at BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank and Citi. As an executive partner at 8VC, Karen White collaborates with founders and CEOs to build and scale businesses, a practice she honed in a storied Silicon Valley career, beginning at Oracle in the early 1990s. She joined the firm—which has $6 billion in committed capital and invests across the areas of logistics, biotech, healthcare and defense—in a full-time capacity in 2024 after serving on its board for the prior eight years. White came to 8VC from catastrophe risk modeling company RMS, where as CEO she led the company to a $2 billion acquisition by Moody’s in 2021. Tamar Yehoshua’s career has included leadership roles at Amazon, Google and Slack at crucial times in the companies’ development. In 2023, she joined venture firm IVP, which for more than four decades has funded more than 400 breakout tech companies around the globe, including brand names like Twitter and Netflix. Over the past 15 months, Yehoshua’s held two jobs, adding president of AI startup Glean to her resume before recently transitioning to an advisor’s role there. Glean, valued at an estimated $7 billion after a $150 million Series F raise in June, helps companies like Duolingo and Databricks use AI agents to improve workplace efficiency. Housing market analyst Ivy Zelman had just launched her firm—which provides housing data, analysis and investment services—when she called the 2008 housing crisis and then the bottom of the market in 2012. She further cemented her place in Wall Street lore as a figure in the best-selling novel-turned-movie, The Big Short. In 2021, the $2 billion (market cap) Walker & Dunlop acquired Zelman & Associates, and with U.S. housing facing an ongoing and historic affordability crisis, Zelman’s proprietary research and expertise remain in high demand.

After 20 years in business, Dax still oozes quiet class. Graham Neville’s superb classical cooking is a joy – seared Castletownbere scallops with coral bisque, Tipperary beef, and a mille-feuille of Irish rhubarb are textbook examples. Owner Olivier Meisonnave has compiled one of the country’s great wine lists – from smart biodynamic finds to serious Grand Cru. Corinna Hardgrave Since opening, Killian Durkin and Jess D’Arcy have worked tirelessly to deliver wonderful hospitality and modern Irish cooking from their seaside restaurant. Killian uses local and Irish ingredients such as “lamb lobster” (lamb neck), Winetavern Farm pork and Howth honey to great effect. Don’t miss the iconic cod chip or their exquisite tarts. Joanne Cronin Recently refurbished, mrDeanes is a bistro-style restaurant that encapsulates the very best of chef Michael Deane’s 28 years in business, and this year received a Michelin Bib Gourmand. It’s exactly what a busy city bistro should be, serving up Portavogie crab on toast, entrecôte au poivre, sugar pit pork chops and fish and chips. Look out for their new own label white wine. JC Ruchii is a riot of Indian flavours and bright jewelled colours. Marinated jumbo prawns are cooked to perfection in the tandoor oven while the slow-cooked lamb shank nalli nihari is sheer warmth. Chef Sateesh Sayana also serves up authentic South Indian specialities including rava dosa, masala uttapam and a Sunday special of Hyderabadi chicken dum biryani. Read our full review here. JC John Coffey does not stand still but continues to develop, always cooking with flair. The focus here is on quality produce, resulting in a glossy golden pithivier of potato, onion and Mossfield cheddar; roast cod with cauliflower, capers and golden raisins or a dark chocolate and sesame ganache. JC The words “Asian fusion” can sometimes strike fear, but diners are in safe hands at Umi. Owners Seán Lafferty and Gary Moran have created a fun atmosphere that seamlessly marries great Irish produce with Japanese techniques. Think binchotan grilled steak or crispy dumplings made with local pork and a fiery rayu sauce. They even offer their own wine, a fresh Austrian Blaufränkisch made by ex-employee Jack Mcateer.

Title: After Stablecoins, Tokenized Assets Will Be The Next Major Institutional Play in Blockchain

Recent institutional interest in stablecoins has been something of a watershed moment for the crypto industry. Not only has the mainstream adoption of stablecoins signalled a renewed interest in and a broader acceptance of blockchain, but it is the first sign of the convergence of decentralised finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi). Major institutions such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock have begun integrating stablecoins into their operations. These TradFi heavyweights are utilising stablecoins for transactions, settlements, and as intermediaries bridging TradFi with DeFi. No other blockchain innovation has been adopted by traditional finance players to this extent, underscoring stablecoins’ legitimacy as a bona fide financial instrument. So what comes next? Which new blockchain creation will capture the attention of TradFi or do stablecoins represent the pinnacle of blockchain’s integration into the mainstream? It would appear that we already have a clear answer to this question: Tokenization. Like stablecoins, tokenization enables new market functions that are unfeasible in the traditional financial system. Tokenization, in the simplest terms, is the process of digitally representing real-world assets, including stocks, bonds, and real estate, on the blockchain in the form of a token, and its applications have already begun to pique the interests of private and public institutions. This was no more evident than during the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) public roundtable in May. The event brought together industry leaders, regulatory experts, and academics to discuss the potential of moving traditional assets onto blockchain-based platforms. Executives from BlackRock, Apollo, Fidelity, Invesco, to name just a few, emphasised that tokenization is a significant technological advancement, enabling programmable ownership and providing real-time settlements. Such potential benefits make tokenization particularly attractive for institutions seeking improved market dynamics. Tokenization is a technological shift An interesting theme raised at the SEC roundtable is that tokenization should be seen through the lens of a shift as opposed to the creation of entirely new asset classes. Conversations highlighted how tokenization could address various inefficiencies within traditional markets, including costly intermediaries and limited market access - not dissimilar to how stablecoins have overhauled and simplified traditional methods of processing cross-border payments, facilitating greater financial inclusion. Additionally, panelists emphasised the transformative potential of tokenization in automating compliance processes through smart contracts. They also noted that tokenization was a greater enabler of fractional investments, reducing the minimum purchase price of historically exclusive asset classes, bringing access to a broader range of investors, and therefore increasing liquidity in these tokenized assets. It is clear that tokenization's promise lies in its radical transformation of existing financial infrastructures. By leveraging blockchain's inherent transparency and immutability, tokenization can enhance investor trust and regulatory oversight while reducing systemic inefficiencies, fundamentally reshaping how assets are traded, settled, and owned in traditional markets. Challenges facing tokenization Participants at the SEC roundtable agreed that tokenization offers clear advantages to current market dynamics, but not without drawbacks that must be urgently addressed to enable the kind of institutional adoption seen with stablecoins. Issues such as custody arrangements and the need for regulatory clarity emerged as critical factors. Fortunately, we’re beginning to see Web3 companies that have built tokenization platforms actively address many of the concerns raised by SEC panellists. Standard compliance checks such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and other Anti-Money Laundering safeguards are becoming increasingly standardised across the tokenization ecosystem, reinforcing trust among both retail and institutional investors. Some tokenization organisations have gone a step further in regulatory compliance by securing full Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) licenses from central banks in their regions of operation. These legal advancements are helping to create compliant secondary markets for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), allowing investors to buy, sell and trade property-backed tokens within a safely regulated framework. Of course, there are still areas that need development if tokenization is to reach the scale of institutional adoption seen with stablecoins. While stablecoins have benefited from growing regulatory attention and standardised frameworks, many jurisdictions still lack clear guidelines on how tokenized securities or property-backed tokens are classified, taxed or traded. Interoperability also remains a challenge, with a need for more tokenization protocols and platforms that can integrate across chains and legacy systems, much like how stablecoins operate across exchanges, wallets and DeFi protocols. After stablecoins, tokenisation can be the next blockchain hit From reading coverage of the SEC Roundtable, it’s clear that institutions recognise the immense potential of tokenization to reshape traditional asset markets - provided regulatory frameworks and technological standards evolve in tandem. Tokenization platforms are already scaling to meet some of these requirements. While certain growing pains still need to be addressed, tokenization is well on its way to becoming the next major institutional opportunity in blockchain technology, with the capacity to redefine the future of financial markets, much like stablecoins have begun to do.

Title: BlackRock Analysts Predict Major Bitcoin Surge As US Legislation Strengthens Stablecoins

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a recent expert commentary, executives from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and a leading issuer of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), identified a significant trend in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin (BTC). They foresee a major surge ahead, driven by recent US legislative developments such as the signing of the GENIUS Act. They assert that these developments bolster the role of stablecoins as key players in the future of digital payments. Central to BlackRock’s analysis is the recently enacted GENIUS Act, legislation that aims to establish a comprehensive framework for stablecoins as a means of payment. Stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies such as the US dollar, are gaining significant traction among traditional finance firms seeking to modernize their transactions, and could solidify the dollar’s dominance in global markets. Though their current market share is about 7%—equating to approximately $250 billion—the rapid adoption of stablecoins since 2020 indicates a growing acceptance within the financial landscape. The GENIUS Act delineates stablecoins as payment methods rather than investment products, which includes provisions to prohibit interest payments and restrict issuance to federally regulated banks and select nonbanks. This regulatory framework is poised to create a tokenized ecosystem centered around the US dollar, facilitating easier access for users in emerging markets while potentially limiting adoption in major economies due to the ban on interest payments. Additionally, the act specifies the types of assets that stablecoin issuers can hold in reserve, predominantly consisting of repurchase agreements, money market funds, and US Treasury bills with short maturities. Notably, major stablecoin issuers like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) currently hold over $120 billion in Treasury bills, yet this represents only a small fraction of the total outstanding US Treasury bills. BlackRock’s commentary also suggests that while the demand for Treasury bills may increase as the stablecoin market grows, the overall impact on yields could be limited. This is due to a likely offsetting shift of funds from similar assets rather than generating significant new demand. Furthermore, the US Treasury’s inclination to increase short-term debt issuance to address persistent budget deficits may also dampen any upward pressure on yields. Beyond US borders, other regions are also taking steps to regulate stablecoins. Hong Kong is implementing new regulations aimed at fostering innovation in stablecoins, while Europe is exploring the concept of a digital euro, albeit with limitations to protect traditional banks. Should other nations allow interest-bearing stablecoins or pursue central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), the US dollar’s role in trade finance could be at risk, the experts assert, potentially prompting the US to reconsider its stance on interest payments. As digital assets continue to gain mainstream acceptance, the combination of regulatory support and US administration backing suggests a future where Bitcoin and stablecoins play a more integral role in financial systems. BlackRock remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential as a distinct return driver and a key asset in diversified investment portfolios.
